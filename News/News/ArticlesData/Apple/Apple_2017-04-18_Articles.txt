Digital Trends Home > Computing > Apple just made iMovie and a bunch of other apps… Apple just made iMovie and a bunch of other apps free for everyone By Trevor Mogg — April 18, 2017 9:57 PM Subscribe Share Apple Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you're using an older Apple device and never bought the tech company's suite of apps, you can now grab them for free. Apple has just cut the cost of a number of its Mac and iOS apps to the princely sum of zero. The free apps are iMovie, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and GarageBand, and each can be downloaded now from the Mac and iOS App Stores. It’s worth noting that the software has been available for free to anyone who purchased a Mac computer or iOS mobile device after August, 2013. Therefore, the move to stop charging for it will particularly benefit anyone with an older piece of Apple kit who never purchased the software, which used to cost between $5 and $20 a piece. Of course, if you’re a Mac and/or iOS user without any of these apps, you’ve probably been using alternatives for a while. But if you’re unhappy with any of them, now’s surely the time to try out Apple’s software. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which used to cost $20 each, are Apple’s word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation offerings, respectively. GarageBand, meanwhile, is a music creation software aimed at musicians or even non-musicians who fancy tinkering about in their own digital studio. However, with so many folks whipping out their smartphones to shoot video these days, it’s iMovie that may prove to be of most interest. Powerful though not so complex to befuddle everyday users, Apple’s consumer-level video editing software lets you select from your library of clips before adding studio-quality titles, music, and special effects. A fun feature is the ability to quickly create Hollywood-style movie trailers from a bunch of short sequences and images, with the software doing the brunt of the work, often to great effect. And like all of Apple’s software, iMovie lets you work on the same project across multiple devices, so you can begin a project on your iPhone and continue with it on your iPad, “then take advantage of additional features on your Mac to add finishing touches like color correction, green-screen effects, and animated maps.” If you own an older Apple device and never felt compelled to purchase any of the company’s software, now’s the time to take a closer look. You’ll find all of the offerings in Apple’s Mac and iOS App Stores.

Users of Snapchat could already apply augmented-reality filters via the front-facing camera, using 'Lenses'. You've probably seen this before when people apply a set of bunny ears to their head. GIF Advertisement - Continue Reading Below World Lenses flips this idea, encouraging users to augment the world around them, rather than images of themselves. The new feature places a 3D object over the rear camera input, be that a Bitmoji or stylised text. Just like a real-world object, it can be manipulated in different dimensions and when users move around it, it stays in place. Or, as Snapchat puts it, "paint the world around you with new 3D experiences!" To achieve this, the app seems to perform some basic mapping of the 3D space presented by the camera, understanding where the ground is and how an object should look if it's moved about. The effect is reminiscent of Pokémon Go, which uses augmented-reality tech to superimpose creatures on the world around users. Right now the effects offered by World Lenses are fairly simple, but that will likely change if the feature gains popularity. Bitmoji and text could easily be followed by a broader array of objects. World Lenses launches today. To use the feature, tap on any surface when using the rear-facing camera, then just swipe over to the World Lens you'd like to apply.

That’s why the notion of a smartphone that acts like a PC when connected to those peripherals has kept recurring ever since the iPhone redefined mobility for the modern era. But so far, reality has not delivered on that promise of the mobile-on-desktop notion. Now, Samsung is trying its hand at this puzzle, with the Dex dock available for its new Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones. [ Review: Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is an unpleasant smartphone. | iPad Pro vs. Surface Pro vs. Pixel C vs. Galaxy TabPro S: The “tabtop” tablet/laptop hybrids compared. ] The journey from the Lapdock to the Dex Station The Motorola Lapdock back in 2011 was the first dock to put smartphone screens on a computer monitor, as well as provide a full-screen browser and connections for physical keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals. But the constrained smartphone apps weren’t much easier to use as big-screen windows, and the Linux-based browser was too limited. Apple took a dockless approach, using its AirPlay protocol to beam an iPhone’s or iPad’s screen to a TV via an Apple TV box and provide typing access via Bluetooth keyboards. That didn’t make the app user interfaces usefully bigger (they were magnified, but contained the same number of pixels as the Apple devices’ own screens). And moving your hand between the physical keyboard and device touchscreen (iOS still has no mouse support) is an awkward experience you do only when required. In effect, Apple’s AirPlay approach is limited to presentation use, and Apple has clearly decided to focus on making the iPad itself work better as a laptop surrogate. Last fall, HP tried its hand at the mobile-on-desktop game with its Elite x3 with Desk Dock, also with unfortunate results. The Elite x3 smartphone is too big and clunky to use as a phone, and although the Desk Dock works decently, the whole thing is undermined by the use of Windows Mobile. People expected to run real Windows applications via the Desk Dock, but they got a few, limited Windows Mobile apps instead. That’s a no-go zone. Samsung has had a dock before, for 2013’s Galaxy Note II and Galaxy S4, but that Samsung Smart Dock wasn’t very smart. It merely projected the mobile device's screen to a TV, like Apple’s AirPlay but via a cable, plus it allowed use of USB input devices. It disappeared quickly and quietly. Now Samsung has the $150 Dex Station, a dock that works only with the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Dex comes the closest yet to delivering on that mobile-on-desktop promise. It requires the S8 series for two reasons: their beefy processor and memory, as well as their USB-C connector. That’s too bad because I dislike the Galaxy S8 and would love to use Dex with its better predecessor, the Galaxy S7. Oh well. You really get close to a PC experience with Dex When you plug your Galaxy S8 into the Dex Station that is connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, in a few seconds you get a PC-like desktop screen on your monitor, with a Windows-like system tray containing relevant controls from the Android system tray. Running apps show up in a MacOS-like Dock at the bottom of the screen. You can drag apps from the Android Home screen to the Dex desktop, like putting shortcuts in the Windows or MacOS desktop for easy access. IDG The Samsung Dex Station does a very nice job of creating a desktoplike user experience for Android apps, while retaining mobile-specific Android capabilities and controls. Too bad it works only with the Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones. Apps that support both tablet and smartphone layouts open up in computerlike windows, which can be resized as they would on a computer. Microsoft’s Office and Google’s G Suite are among such apps, which means they feel very computerlike when running via Dex. Other, smartphone-only apps—including the Phone app, for making calls—display in smartphone-shaped windows, which you can rotate to use vertically or horizontally. InfoWorld Reviews Samsung Dex Station  InfoWorld rating $150.00MSRP $150.00View on Samsung Flaws in the Dex Station’s hardware design mar what is otherwise an excellent way to run your Galaxy S8 Android smartphone as if it were a computer on the big screen. To be clear, you’re running Android apps, not traditional desktop applications. You won’t get the same capabilities for a suite like Office or G Suite via Dex as you would on a PC. But in these two main suites, the Android versions are good enough for everyday use. Because you know you’re running Android, you won’t experience the disappointment that Windows Mobile users get when running the lightweight Windows Mobile apps in what seemed to be “real” Windows. If you need real Windows apps, you can always run them using a VDI client on the Galaxy S8; although VDI is expensive to implement on the back end and awkward on mobile devices, Android (like iOS) has long supported such apps. They’ll be more usable on Dex’s larger screen and with a physical keyboard and mouse. You could of course run apps like Office or G Suite on an Android tablet to get a more desktoplike user experience without having a dock in the middle and even connect to a large screen via HDMI or Google Cast screencasting. But Dex Station gives you not only a larger screen but a more detailed one—your windows hold more pixels with Dex than the blown-up screens do via direct external display from your Galaxy S8. Dex nicely integrates the Android mobile interface elements with the more desktoplike elements it creates for you. Setting up Dex Station is too hard, as is using the smartphone As much as I like the Dex software experience, I don’t like its hardware experience. Samsung made a few poor design decisions that keep the Dex Station from achieving a five-star rating. First, the setup process is nightmarish. You would think all you have to do is plug the Galaxy S8 smartphone into the Dex Station, then connect the Dex Station to your monitor via HDMI. Nope. First, be careful with the HDMI connections. The cable can appear to be fully inserted in the Dex Station when it isn't. If the cable isn't seated, your monitor won’t detect the Dex Station’s video signal, and your smartphone will beep incessantly to warn you something is wrong. But it won’t tell you what is wrong; there’s no textual alert or way to view one. Also, you must set up all peripherals before you connect the smartphone to the Dex Station, because you need to have the keyboard and mouse up and running to do anything via Dex. If you’re using Bluetooth peripherals, note that you cannot set them up once the Galaxy S8 is docked to the Dex Station. In a really dumb move, Samsung disables the Galaxy S8’s screen and touch interface when it is docked, so you can’t use it to do any forgotten setup or even check status if something is not right. Contrast that to HP’s approach in the Elite x3, where the smartphone itself acts as a peripheral, in addition to whatever other input devices you have set up. The Elite x3 can also continue to function as a smartphone in its Desk Dock. By contrast, once your Galaxy S8 is docked in the Dex Station, you can only use it via the external keyboard and mouse. At least the fingerprint sensor still works when the Galaxy S8 is docked, if you can reach it. There are more poor hardware design decisions in the Dex Station. The circular dock is pretty lightweight, so your cables’ weight and tension can rotate it. Because you can’t use the smartphone itself when docked, that’s not a disaster. But it is annoying, and it can prevent easy access to the fingerprint sensor. Also, the USB-C power cable that comes with the Dex Station is much too short; there’s no way it will reach a wall outlet. It could reach a free USB port on a laptop on your desk, but if you have a laptop at your desk you don’t really need a Dex Station, do you? Prepare to put a charging USB hub on your desk or get a much longer USB-C cable. I also found it awkward at first to use a Bluetooth mouse with Dex. I tried both Samsung’s S Action Mouse and Apple’s Magic Mouse. Both moved much too fast, often jerkily, so it's difficult to select items, click buttons, and so forth. Android provides no controls over mouse speed, as MacOS and Windows do. Fortunately, Samsung provides a way to modify the pointer speed, but it’s not so easy to find. The secret is you go to the Settings app from the Dex desktop; you’ll see a new Settings option called Samsung Dex that appears only when the Galaxy S8 is running Dex; go there to change the pointer speed from the way-too-fast Medium setting to something slower. The Dex Station’s hardware is clever in one respect: Its top flips down to become a back for the Galaxy S8, which plugs into a USB-C connector with the dock. This approach allows the Dex Station to accommodate the disparate sizes of the two Galaxy S8 models. A better hardware design would make the Dex Station a truly great mobile-on-desktop dock. Even with these flaws, the Dex Station finally delivers on the promise that the Motorola Lapdock first made.

The group, calling themselves the Turkish Crime Family, claimed to infiltrate Apple security and had access to millions of account names and passwords. A few weeks back, news broke that hackers were claiming to hold millions of iCloud accounts hostage. They were threatening to reset the accounts and wipe all data from them. The group, calling themselves the Turkish Crime Family, had claimed to infiltrate Apple security and had access to millions of account names and passwords. An online news and conversational site, Motherboard, broke the piece in March claiming that they had been contacted directly by the group. The group provided the site with screenshots of email strings between the group and the Apple security team. It also provided a YouTube video showing the group accessing an account of what seems to be an elderly woman and remotely deleting the contents. Details were sketchy about the hack At first, the group was threatening to restore over 300 million accounts to their factory settings. Doubts were raised about the validity of the hack as the number more than doubled to 627 million accounts within a few days. It was claimed that various other hackers were stepping forward to assist in the operation and had account information of their own. The ransom amount was also uncertain. The initial ransom demand was $75 000, in any online currency including Bitcoin or Ethereum. A subsequent demand was later released at over $400 000. Apple gave very little response to the hack Apple refused to comment on the claims at first. But eventually, they came back denying the hack to their systems. They have insisted that there are no breaches. They did, however, shift the blame to third party services. In a statement from an Apple spokesperson, they claimed to not be involved in the matter. “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems, including iCloud and Apple ID,” the spokesperson said. “The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.” The Turkish crime family claim payment was made Hello everybody, look what we have here https://t.co/I3B0wh1Udv — Turkish Crime Family (@turkcrimefamily) April 7, 2017 The hackers had given Apple until 7 April 2017 to pay the ransom and, in the days leading up to this, had become increasingly vocal on Twitter. Apple, however, seemed to make no move and appeared to have stepped away from the controversy. On the evening of the 7th, the group claimed victory in the matter. They posted an address showing hundreds of Bitcoins had been posted in their wallet. The post indicated that a total of 401.731 bitcoin was paid in the early evening of 7 April. This is equivalent to R6,731,059,044.50! There are doubts, however, that the payment was in fact made by Apple due to their silence in the matter. Data breaches cost companies millions Many theories have been circulating that the company decided to quietly pay the hackers off without causing a media storm. This could be very likely due to the controversy caused by a hack of this type. The sheer reputational damage to the company could cost it millions of dollars. It could also lose the company millions of customers and result in them being made vulnerable to lawsuits. There are hundreds of corporate giants who have, in the past, fallen victim to hacks and cyber attacks. Not only did it cost the companies millions in damages, but these attacks have created PR storms that have taken years to recover from. In a hack in 2014, for example, eBay had the personal information of more than 145 million users stolen, including login credentials and physical addresses. It cost the company more than $200 million. In the same year, Russian hackers stole the information of more than 76 million client accounts from JP Morgan. The cost to the bank is estimated at $1 billion, despite spending a $250 million annual budget on cyber security. So, the question remains, did Apple weigh up the risks of a billion-dollar controversy and simply quietly pay the hackers? Or was this a ploy by an organisation to get their name on the map?

Information from sources back previous rumored features expected on the 10th anniversary device this fall. However, the new technology could possibly delay the iPhone 8’s release date by one or two months after it is revealed because of supply constraints, the report said. Read: Apple's Gift Suggestions For Mother's Day Include The iPad Pro And BeatsX Earphones Here are some features the iPhone 8 could come with, according to the Bloomberg report: iPhone 8 Rumored Design Features Apple is apparently testing a “revamped iPhone with an all-screen front, curved glass and a stainless steel frame,” the report said. The design features of the iPhone 8 mentioned by the sources are similar to previous rumors. On Monday, Japanese blog Mac Otakara said the iPhone 8 would come with stainless steel frame to hold together the front and back glass panels of the device. iPhone 8 Rumors: OLED Display And Screen Size The iPhone 7S and 7S Plus are expected to have LCD displays, like previous rumors have indicated. For the iPhone 8, the sources said Apple will use an edge-to-edge OLED screen display provided by Samsung, backing a recent Nikkei report which said Apple placed orders for 70 million OLED panels from Samsung. However, the Bloomberg report said Apple ordered around 100 million panels from Samsung. The DigiTimes reported recently Apple signed a $9 billion two-year contract with Samsung for OLED displays. Read: iPhone 7 Vs Galaxy S8: Speed Test Video Shows Apple Still Ahead of Samsung The display is said to be larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus, released last year, but will have an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, sources told Bloomberg. Embedded Touch ID Apple will reportedly reduce the smartphone’s size by embedding the home button into the screen via software like the in the Samsung Galaxy S8, people close to the matter said. However, this week, Pacific Crest Securities equity research analyst recently said Apple will likely ditch its plan of embedding the Touch ID into the iPhone 8 display. A note to investors from an analyst at Cowen and Company last week said Apple’s biggest trouble among iPhone 8 features was embedding the Touch ID. He also said Apple could ditch the idea or delay the production of the iPhone 8. New Camera Technology The Bloomberg report said Apple is testing more advanced cameras for the iPhone 8. For the back camera, Apple is reportedly testing versions of the iPhone for better photos by positioning the dual-camera system vertically instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is apparently testing dual-lenses for the front camera, an upgrade from the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which have single cameras. The company has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its iPhone camera system, it was learned earlier this year. The iPhones this year will run iOS 11 that will “include a refreshed user-interface,” the report said. The software update is expected to be announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif. this June.

Apple says it'll appeal. Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript A blow to Apple: a federal jury in Texas ordered the iPhone maker to pay more than half a billion dollars. It ruled that Apple's iTunes software had infringed three patents owned by the patent licensing firm, Smartflash. The jury found that Apple used the Texas firm's patents willfully and without permission. The patents cover the access and storage of songs, videos, and games that are downloaded. Smartflash says Apple knew about its technology. In its lawsuit, it says that around 15 years ago, the co-inventor of its patents had discussed its technology with an executive who now works as a senior director at Apple. Apple argued that the technology was already out there, saying previously patented inventions covered the same ground. Smartflash said it was happy with the verdict. Apple says it'll appeal. It had earlier tried to have the suit thrown out, but the district judge ruled against that. Investors didn't seem worried. Apple's shares dipped in early trading. The damages it's ordered to pay doesn't even amount to one day's worth of Apple's sales in the last quarter. Piper Jaffray senior analyst Gene Munster said, "It's a classic patent troll case against Apple. It's a speed bump. It doesn't impact any of Apple's products. This is a lot of money, but not for Apple." Smartflash could stay in the spotlight. It has also sued Google, Samsung and HTC.

Yesterday, we reported a rumor that Apple is readying a premium iPhone dubbed ‘iPhone Edition’ that would take design inspiration from the Apple Watch by encasing the handset in stainless steel. It’s also mooted to feature a vertically-aligned iSight Duo dual camera system.  A day earlier, there was another hot rumor that suggested this year’s 10th anniversary iPhone would be almost all screen, with minimal bezels and the possibility of a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Now, reliable sources have given Bloomberg further information that’s added fuel to the fire by backing up said claims, with a source stating that Apple is already “testing a revamped iPhone” that will feature “a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras”. Multiple prototypes have reportedly been tested, including a “more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007.” Apple’s not phoning it in this time The report states that this new and overhauled iPhone will arrive alongside upgraded versions of the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which are presumably part of the usual second year ‘S’ cycle. So will this new premium model actually be called the iPhone 8? We wouldn’t bet on it. If Apple is indeed planning to release ‘S’ iterations this year, then it’s logical to think this higher-end option will go by the rumored ‘iPhone Edition’ moniker — as the Cupertino company is unlikely to release products named iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 at the same time. According to the report, the premium iPhone will sport an OLED display, lending credence to the rumor that Apple has ordered 70 million curved OLED screens from Samsung, while the other two handsets will continue to use IPS LCD displays.  It’s also stated that Apple is still trying to implement a fingerprint scanner under the glass on the front of the premium iPhone, though design plans are reportedly “still in flux and can change.” All three new iPhones are expected to launch this fall (late September through December), though you can probably expect some difficulty in getting your hands on the premium model, as “supply constraints could mean the device isn't readily available until one or two months after the typical fall introduction.” iPhone 8 release date, news and rumors Related news Fujifilm unveils hybrid INSTAX SQUARE SQ10 camera Fujifilm broadens GFX system with two new lenses and accessories The best earbuds (in-ear headphones) available today PS4 Slim now offers a 1TB hard drive but keeps the original price See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

In fact a recent report from Bloomberg has hinted at just that. It won’t be as curved as the Galaxy S8’s display, but it will be curved to a certain degree that will apparently allow it to give off the illusion of a handset with a full screen. However a new report from Macotakara has suggested otherwise (via AppleInsider). According to the report, it has been suggested that Apple could ultimately adopt a flat OLED screen as opposed to the 2.5D curved display that was previously rumored. Note that this clearly contradicts earlier rumors, but apparently there is a reason for this. It seems that Apple was testing out various prototypes and did source components for these prototypes, which might have prompted the rumors of a curved iPhone in the first place. The report goes on to claim that Apple is in the stages of finalizing the design specifications of the iPhone 8, with the design reportedly making it through the engineering validation testing stage. In any case given that Apple has unsurprisingly kept mum through all these rumors, it’s hard to say who is right and who is wrong, especially most of the rumors have come from credible sources who have had pretty good track records in the past, but either way it’s probably best taken with a grain of salt.

At the event, Cook was presented the award and made brief comments on what it means to him and Apple, as well as touching on the importance of companies taking a stance… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Cook was chosen for the award because of how he has used his spotlight to “take a public stand on major societal issues” such as racial equality, privacy, climate change, education, and LGBT rights. Prior to the presentation of the award itself, a brief video was played highlighting some of Cook’s values, including clips for Cook’s George Washington University commencement speech, his comments on the FBI’s request to unlock the San Bernardino iPhone, and more. Upon accepting the Free Expression award, Cook thanked Washington Post CEO and publisher Fred Ryan for the honor, explaining that he’s accepting it on behalf of everyone at Apple. Cook went on to address the idea of the freedom of speech. As noted by AppleInsider, Cook explained that times now are very different from what they were when the Founding Fathers established the idea of free speech. There were no app developers, modern content creators, and other new forms of speech. “We know that these freedoms require protection,” Cook said of First Amendment rights. “Not just the forms of speech that entertain us, but the ones that challenge us. The ones that unnerve and even displease us. They’re the ones that need protection the most. It’s no accident that these freedoms are enshrined and protected in the First Amendment. They are the foundation to so many of our rights.” Cook went on to talk on the fact that Apple takes protection of the First Amendment very seriously, working to give everyone an opportunity to speak up and speaking up itself: “This is a responsibility that Apple takes very seriously,” Cook said. “First we defend, we work to defend these freedoms by enabling people around the world to speak up. And second, we do it by speaking up ourselves. Because companies can, and should have values.” “At Apple we are not just enabling others to speak up, we are doing so ourselves.” Furthermore, Cook spoke on the importance of listening in a time when many people have conflicting opinions: “Free speech isn’t only about speaking, it’s about listening, whether or not we agree. It demands we stay informed.” Cook also seemingly took a swipe at the Trump Administration’s idea of “alternative facts,” something first set forth by U.S. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway. “We must be open to alternative points of view, not alternative facts,” Cook said. Tim Cook has given Apple a voice on many social issues. He has been honored with the National Visibility Award from the Human Rights Campaign after becoming the first CEO of a major company to come out as openly gay. Furthermore, Cook has spoken on a variety of hot-button issues including diversity, immigration, and much more. Video of the awards presentation should be available here soon. True test of character?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Facebook Messenger Is Getting An Apple Music And Spotify Extension By Ali Salman 4 hours ago 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Facebook is not reluctant to announce new changes in its platforms, even if it includes blatantly ripping off Snapchat Stories. Today, the company has announced a plethora of changes for its Messenger app including the new ways for applications to integrate with it. The announcements were made on the company’s annual F8 developer conference. If you’re excited just yet, one of the partners standing out was Apple Music and Spotify. So lets dive in to see some more details on the subject. Facebook Messenger To Integrate With Apple Music And Spotify If you’re in for a deeper insight on the scenario, the feature will basically allow users to link to Apple Music and Spotify and share songs and playlists directly within the Facebook Messenger app. At this point in time, Apple did not detail any method for how its chat extensions will work. Spotify on the other hand detailed in a blog post about the Spotify chat extension. More or less, Apple Music’s chat extensions will work in a similar way. Related Google Maps For iOS Brings ‘Your Timeline’, New iMessage App And ‘Directions’ Widget Facebook announced the feature at its annual F8 developer conference. While Messenger’s new music sharing feature will ship with Spotify integration, Apple Music integration is committed to  be integrated in the days to come. Advertisement Facebook is already integrated with Apple Music in the main app with the feature that lets you share songs called Music Stories. The feature basically allows users to share songs through Apple Music to Facebook feed. The music is previewed in line and can be opened directly in the Apple Music app. Using Spotify chat extensions, users will have the ability to search and share Spotify songs, playlists and albums. The links will play the 30 second preview of the song, while tapping on it will open the full song. The Spotify bot will offer playlist recommendations to users based on their mood, genre and activity. Currently, we’re not sure if Apple will introduce a feature similar to this one. Related iWork, GarageBand, iMovie Apps Now Absolutely Free for All iOS & Mac Users – Download Links While Apple Music already offers a music sharing feature, the Facebook integration comes through the Messenger app. Since the feature is not yet available, you can also check out the extension that performs the same features right away.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple to Introduce Bezel-Less iPhone 8 as Samsung Prepares to Compete w/ Dual-Camera Galaxy Note 8 By Rafia Shaikh 5 hours ago 14Shares Share Tweet Submit KGI: Galaxy S8 selling better than expected; Note 8 will copy iPhone 7 Plus dual camera setup; Apple to copy bezel-less S8 design Ming-Chi Kuo, a trusted name in the murky world of leaks and rumors – is out today with new investor reports, focusing mainly on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 reception and expectations for Galaxy Note 8 and Apple’s iPhone 8. In his investor report, Kuo of KGI has said that Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be the company’s first dual-camera smartphone. Kuo adds that despite his earlier remarks on Galaxy S8 lacking “attractive selling points,” the S8 duo is selling better than expected, raising his own shipping estimates for the handset. Galaxy Note 8 to bring dual camera setup that will match iPhone 8 Kuo has said that the introduction of dual camera setup will be “the most important upgrade” in the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. He adds that the “Note 8’s dual-camera will be much better than that of iPhone 7 Plus, and likely match that of OLED iPhone.” The iPhone 7-inspired dual camera design was one of the most talked about iPhone 7 Plus features, bringing extra add-ons like the Portrait Mode and the artificial depth of field effect that is meant to give the illusion of using a high-end DSLR. Kuo believes that Note 8 could exceed iPhone 7 Plus camera performance and match the performance of Apple’s rumored iPhone 8 – one of the three expected iPhones for this year. Related Another Galaxy S8 Prototype Reveals a Dual-Camera Setup – Missed Opportunity? Galaxy Note 8 dual camera setup is rumored to feature 12MP wide-angle CIS supporting dual photodiode (2PD), 13MP telephoto CIS, 3x optical zoom, dual 6P lenses and dual optical image stabilization. This camera design has already appeared in leaked images of what was being called a Galaxy S8+ prototype. In a note released to investors (obtained by AppleInsider), Kuo has focused on this feature calling it the most important new upgrade that could possibly help Samsung finally get rid of those fiery Note 7 images. Kuo added that Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be a 6.4-inch QHD+ OLED handset with a full-screen design and a rear-facing fingerprint sensor, powered by Exynos 8895 processor. Advertisement Galaxy S8 and S8+ selling better than expected thanks to their bezel-less design Additionally, Kuo has also talked about the early reception of Samsung Galaxy S8, saying that the bezel-less design has helped the company get a better reaction than expected. Apple is also expected to introduce a bezel-less design with iPhone 8 – a massive design overhaul for iPhone that has largely remained untouched over the past few years. But, it isn’t clear whether Apple will also consider fitting a rear-facing Touch ID especially after seeing negative feedback on this particular design choice made by Samsung for Galaxy S8. We now expect full-screen design will accelerate penetration of the high-end smartphone segment over the next few years, thanks to adoption by S8 and the new 2H17F OLED iPhone model. Kuo noted that the feedback on Galaxy S8 and S8+ has been “better than expected,” which is why KGI has increased 2017 shipment predictions by 10 million units. The analyst believes this positive reception is largely due to the full-screen design that has offset concerns over a back-mounted fingerprint sensor. Related Samsung’s Growth Percentage to Increase by Only Single Digits, According to Analysts According to our survey, market feedback to Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ (abbreviated as ‘S8’) has been better than expected since their unveiling. We attribute this to a better- than-expected selling point in the full-screen design. For this reason, we revise up our 2017F S8 shipments from 40-45mn units to 50-55mn units. Post-launch market response a big thumbs up for full-screen design, offsetting our concerns. Although the full-screen design has not created any new applications, its form factor will be effective in attracting high-end users. This is why market feedback has exceeded our expectations. KGI expects Samsung to sell 50 million to 55 million units of Galaxy S8 duo and 13 to 15 million units of Galaxy Note 8 in fiscal 2017.

PTI  | Posted by Shraddha Jandial  Follow @PTI_News   pti@intoday.com April 17, 2017 | UPDATED 09:29 IST A +A - Highlights 1 191 complaints were received by Customer Complaints Council for misleading advertisements. 2 ASCI upheld a total of 102 complaints in healthcare category, 20 in education, seven in personal care. 3 To add to that six in food and beverages and eight advertisements from other categories. Apple showing iPhone 7 as iphone 7 plus variant is among 143 advertisements dubbed as misleading by regulator ASCI, which also pulled up Coca-Cola India, Bharti Airtel and others for such campaigns. Mobikwik, HUL, Nivea, Amul, Opera, Standard Chartered Bank and Pernod Ricard are among the companies against which a total of 191 complaints were received by Customer Complaints Council (CCC) of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) for January. ASCI upheld a total of 102 complaints in healthcare category, 20 in education, seven in personal care, six in food and beverages and eight advertisements from other categories. APPLE SHOWS WRONG IMAGE FOR iPhone7 According to ASCI, Apple India was found using a wrong image in its advertisement for iPhone 7. "The advertisement text states 'The amazing iPhone 7 is here', but shows an image of iPhone 7 Plus variant, which is misleading by ambiguity and implication," said ASCI. The sector watchdog said although the advertisement had the Apple trademark with iPhone7 but said it didnt have any reference to series in the advertisement text. "In absence of any visual of iPhone 7 variant, it was concluded that the advertisement is likely to mislead the consumers about the product advertised and its corresponding features," it said. Comments from Apple could not be obtained. ASCI also upheld a complaint against Coca-Cola India for Thums Up campaign, in which the soft drink major has showcased a rider performing a wheelie in normal streets, traffic conditions, right amongst a few people. "This is contradictory to the disclaimer made in the advertisement ?- the actions are for representational purposes alone and must not be copied by viewers... It was concluded that though the overall advertisement is not objectionable, regardless of the disclaimer the specific visual... encourages dangerous practices, manifests a disregard for safety and encourages negligence," it said. When contacted, a Coca-Cola India spokesperson said: "On receiving feedback, we have on boarded suggestions from ASCI and modified the TV commercial (TVC). The revised TVC has been updated on air and on digital media." Similarly, it has also pulled FMCG major HUL for its advertisement of Rin Antibac, where it had claimed that the detergent powder with Ayurvedic extracts removes germs. However, ASCI said the claim "was not substantiated, and is misleading by implication and exaggeration as the advertised product does not have the property to provide germ protection in wear conditions". Commenting on the matter, a HUL Company Spokesperson said: "We, as a responsible marketer and member of ASCI, have always complied with its guidelines and recommendations. We have suitably modified the said advertisement as per their recommendation." Similarly, Standard Chartered Banks claim of "up to 10 per cent extra cashback on all spends with your Standard Chartered credit card" was found to be "false and misleading by ambiguity" as the cash back was limited to Rs 10,000 only. When contacted Standard Chartered Bank said: "The up to 10 per cent cash back offer was a campaign launched last year. The cash back cap and all other relevant details were shared with customers over multiple communication channels. However, ASCI felt that we needed to make certain modifications, and we have taken their inputs on board." The regulator also upheld three complaints against leading telecom operator Bharti Airtel for "misleading" claims for free Calls Local + STD and a free upgrade for Airtel-V Fiber. "The ad claim, "Free Calls Local + STD" cannot be said free as the prevailing price for data without advertised incentive is less i.e. from the consumers point of view, they have to make a payment of Rs 149 to avail this offer although they get only 300MB data versus 500 MB data," it said However, when contacted Airtel declined to comment. COMPLAINT AGAINST OPERA MINI Complaint against Opera Software Asa claim for its mobile browser Opera Mini was also upheld where it had claimed that it saves data cost up to 90 percent while browsing "The advertisements claim, Saves data cost up to 90 per cent while browsing, was not substantiated with supporting data and is misleading by exaggeration," the CCC said. When contacted an Opera spokesperson said:" We adhere to the highest ethical standards and never share any exaggerated or misleading data with our consumers. Hence, our claim of Opera Mini saving up to 90 per cent data in our advertisement, is entirely true. We have proven our claims by internal and external tests from time to time over the years." MOBIKWIK NOT INDIA'S SAFEST WALLET? Digital payment firm MobiKwik also failed to substantiate its claim of "India's most secure e-wallet" for Mobikwik e- wallet and found to be "misleading by exaggeration". It also upheld complaint against Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation for ad of Amul Butter where it had claimed it to be a rich source of Vitamin A and stated that "Eat milk with every meal and live every day, worry-free". "It was considered the latter part of the statement to be misleading by implication and is encouraging excessive consumption of butter which may not be advisable from the health point of view," it said. Similarly, FMCG firm Nivea was also pulled for claims in the commercial of Nivea Protect & Care Deodorant. It was "considered to be misleading by ambiguity and implication that several other major ingredients of Nivea Creme are added to the deodorant product".

And, if the rumour mill is to be believed, Apple has already started working on the design language, feature sets and hardware of the next generation of its iPhone, speculated to be named the iPhone 8 and expected to be launched later this year. Given that Apple has been using the same design language for past three generation of iPhones – iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus – it is expected that the iPhone 8, or the next iteration, would make a design shift and be built right from scratch. Apart from the design language, there is also a lot of buzz around the hardware and software enhancement aspects of the iPhone. Let’s take a quick look at the top speculations about the next iPhone: Variants According to speculations, Apple is currently testing at least 10 prototypes of the so-called iPhone 8 with different screen sizes, camera set-ups, battery capacities and display resolutions. Here we go #iphone8 #iphonex or #iphoneedition pic.twitter.com/kxDDOKZ6XM — KK Sneak Leaks (@kksneakleaks) April 17, 2017 Eventually, according to the reports, the company could launch at least three new devices. Two of those could be upgraded versions of the current iPhone models, while one might be the anniversary edition model that would set the tone for future iPhones. Display The anniversary edition of iPhone 8 is speculated to feature a large curved display, 5.7-inch to 5.8-inch in size. According to reports, the iPhone 8 could feature a display covering the entire front. The fingerprint scanner, earpiece, sensors and front camera might move behind the display. It is, however, difficult to understand how the company will make that possible. #Apple still experimenting with #iPhone8 tech including curved screens, new camera systems https://t.co/8Qj0V8Kt1w pic.twitter.com/h66m99wFq9 — AppleInsider (@appleinsider) April 18, 2017 If Apple covers the entire front with the display, it will reduce the iPhone 8 size remarkably – something that the tech community has been suggesting for a long time, considering that the top and bottom bezels on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 series are huge.

With the anniversary edition iPhone 8, the camera game could reach another level. According to speculations, the new iPhone 8 might come with a dual-camera set-up at the ,rear but in a vertical position. Also, the front-facing camera could see a huge change and the iPhone 8 might possess a dual lens set-up at the front. The interesting bit in the rumours is that the new camera set-up in the iPhone 8 could have an advanced depth of field enhancements, coupled with an augmented reality (AR) support and that, if true, should be the greatest move. Design, Processor and Operating system According to speculations, the iPhone 8 might feature a compact stainless steel body with seamless curved sides and a slim build. The new processor that will tick the iPhone 8 is speculated to be manufactured on a 10-nanometer production process.

Given that the curved display is not the first in the market -- Samsung is already acing the game with its latest Galaxy S8 and S8+ devices – it is for Apple to see how well the iOS can be made to use hardware to reflect the prowess of software. Conclusion The Apple iPhone 8 launch is still months far and more rumours might keep pouring in. The details mentioned above are based on rumours coming from some of the known industry insiders whose words, in most cases, prove correct. But, since these are still rumours, we take them with a pinch of salt. The rumours largely reflect the expectations of the fans around the world and, if any of these come true, the iPhone 8 should indeed become a global favourite.

Khalid Anzar Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Apple iPhone 8: Curved screen, dual-camera and everything we know so far Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 8 at the company's 10th anniversary Apple is one smartphone manufacturer that enjoys to be among a fair share of rumours every year. And, if the rumour mill is to be believed, Apple has already started working on the design language, feature sets and hardware of the next generation of its iPhone, speculated to be named the iPhone 8 and expected to be launched later this year. Given that Apple has been using the same design language for past three generation of iPhones – iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus – it is expected that the iPhone 8, or the next iteration, would make a design shift and be built right from scratch. Apart from the design language, there is also a lot of buzz around the hardware and software enhancement aspects of the iPhone. Let’s take a quick look at the top speculations about the next iPhone: Variants According to speculations, Apple is currently testing at least 10 prototypes of the so-called iPhone 8 with different screen sizes, camera set-ups, battery capacities and display resolutions. Here we go #iphone8 #iphonex or #iphoneedition pic.twitter.com/kxDDOKZ6XM — KK Sneak Leaks (@kksneakleaks) April 17, 2017 Eventually, according to the reports, the company could launch at least three new devices. Two of those could be upgraded versions of the current iPhone models, while one might be the anniversary edition model that would set the tone for future iPhones. Display The anniversary edition of iPhone 8 is speculated to feature a large curved display, 5.7-inch to 5.8-inch in size. According to reports, the iPhone 8 could feature a display covering the entire front. The fingerprint scanner, earpiece, sensors and front camera might move behind the display. It is, however, difficult to understand how the company will make that possible. #Apple still experimenting with #iPhone8 tech including curved screens, new camera systems https://t.co/8Qj0V8Kt1w pic.twitter.com/h66m99wFq9 — AppleInsider (@appleinsider) April 18, 2017 If Apple covers the entire front with the display, it will reduce the iPhone 8 size remarkably – something that the tech community has been suggesting for a long time, considering that the top and bottom bezels on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 series are huge.

With the anniversary edition iPhone 8, the camera game could reach another level. According to speculations, the new iPhone 8 might come with a dual-camera set-up at the ,rear but in a vertical position. Also, the front-facing camera could see a huge change and the iPhone 8 might possess a dual lens set-up at the front. The interesting bit in the rumours is that the new camera set-up in the iPhone 8 could have an advanced depth of field enhancements, coupled with an augmented reality (AR) support and that, if true, should be the greatest move. Design, Processor and Operating system According to speculations, the iPhone 8 might feature a compact stainless steel body with seamless curved sides and a slim build. The new processor that will tick the iPhone 8 is speculated to be manufactured on a 10-nanometer production process.

Apple is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this autumn, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look, according to people familiar with the matter. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the people said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait because supply constraints could mean the device isn’t readily available until one or two months after the typical fall introduction. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, representing about two-thirds of sales. It also leads customers to buy other Apple devices like the iPad and Apple Watch, and serves as a home for lucrative services like the App Store. This year’s new iPhone lineup comes at a critical time. Last year, Apple broke its typical upgrade cycle by retaining the same iPhone shape for a third year in a row and endured a rare sales slide. Samsung Electronics’ new S8 lineup has also been thus far well received after last year’s Note 7 battery debacle. For the premium model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device, according to people familiar with the matter. That results in a display slightly larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, the people said. Apple is also aiming to reduce the overall size of the handset by integrating the home button into the screen itself via software in a similar manner to Samsung’s S8, the people said. The overhauled iPhone will use an organic light-emitting diode display that more accurately shows colours, while the other two phones will continue to use liquid crystal display technology and come in the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as last year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple’s iPhone feature and design plans are still in flux and can change, they added. The people asked not to be identified discussing Apple’s private testing and design plans. For its redesigned phone, Apple has tested multiple prototypes with manufacturing partners in Asia, including some versions that use curved glass and stainless steel, according to one of the people. One of the latest prototype designs includes symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back. The curves are similar in shape to those on the front of the iPhone 7. The new OLED screen itself is flat, while the cover glass curves into a steel frame. The design is similar conceptually to the iPhone 4 from 2010. An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides. Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007, one of the people said. Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves, the person added. The company is also testing a simpler design that has an aluminium back, rather than a glass one, and slightly larger dimensions, one of the people said. Because of its early lead in the mobile OLED display space, Samsung will enjoy a rare upper hand in this year’s high-end smartphone contest. At launch, Apple will exclusively use Samsung Display OLED panels for the redesigned iPhone, as other suppliers won’t be ready to supply mass quantities until later, Bloomberg News reported last year. Apple has ordered around 100 million panels from Samsung, the people said. “This fall, it would be three years since we had a remarkable shift in iPhone hardware. This raises expectations for this year’s phone having a material change in functionality and look,” said Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a veteran Apple analyst. “The Samsung Galaxy S8 raises the bar for Apple to hit a home run.” Spokespeople for Apple and Samsung declined to comment. Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone’s fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version, which would be technically challenging, the people said. It’s currently unclear if that feature will make it into the final product. Samsung also tried this approach for the S8, but ended up installing a more standard fingerprint reader on the back of its phone due to the challenges, another person said. Significant camera changes are also in testing for Apple’s overhauled iPhone. For the back of the phone, Apple is testing versions of the phone with the dual-camera system positioned vertically, instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which could result in improved photos, according to people familiar with the matter. Some prototypes in testing continue to include the slight camera bump found on current iPhones, rather than having them flush with the back surface, the people said. For the front-camera, Apple is testing dual-lenses, one of the people said. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have single front cameras. As it has done in the past, Apple is using camera components from Sony, the person added. Apple has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its iPhone camera system, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year. Company engineers in the past have also experimented with integrating cameras into screens, another person said. All the new iPhones will run iOS 11, a mobile operating system that will include a refreshed user-interface and will be announced in June at the company’s annual conference for developers, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple has been testing using faster processors based on a smaller 10-nanometre production process for all three new models, a person familiar with Apple’s chip plans said. That’s down from 16 nanometres for existing iPhones. The smaller processors are more efficient, allowing Apple to retain its battery life standards while adding more advanced features. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone’s 10th anniversary Conde Nast unveils first-ever magazine covers shot with iPhone 7 Zuckerberg vows work to prevent next 'Facebook killer' (VIDEO) Samsung users see red over ‘tinted’ Galaxy S8 screen Facebook's strategy for augmented reality starts with phones Nintendo to release mini-size Switch in 2019, Citigroup predicts US takedown of Russian botnet won’t end pernicious spam, say experts Samsung users see red over ‘tinted’ Galaxy S8 screen This prototype flight suit brings you that much closer to your Iron Man dreams (VIDEO) 90-second recap of Samsung Galaxy S8 with ‘Gadgets with Gurman’ (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Queen announce European tour dates First teaser for ‘Kingsman: The Golden Circle’ Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Conde Nast unveils first-ever magazine covers shot with iPhone 7 Apple eyes backing Hon Hai bid for Toshiba chip unit Apple gets permit in California to test self-driving cars Apple considers bidding for Toshiba’s chip business Survey reveals US teens in love with Amazon and Apple Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(KGO-TV) KGO Tuesday, April 18, 2017 08:09PM SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- Storm troopers and superheroes will march into downtown San Jose this weekend for the second annual Silicon Valley Comic Con. Apple founder Steve Wozniak helped raise the flag for the event he helped create. Last year it drew 60,000 people. If you go, expect to see the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the stars of Flash and The Walking Dead, and Astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Wozniak said it was a no-brainer having a comic-con in the heart of Silicon Valley. "All the Silicon Valley work. All of the engineering. It all involves a lot of fun and play. Geeks are that way. And comic con makes sense. Why was there no comic con here?" Wozniak said. It all kicks off Friday. Tickets range from $10 to $99, with more expensive VIP options available. There will be an outdoor festival that includes a science fair, beer and wine garden, and cosplay events.

Apple's co-founder, Steve Wozniak, thinks Apple, Google and Facebook will still be the biggest tech companies around in 2075, despite huge changes in the tech landscape expected by then. Wozniak compared Apple's success to that of IBM in quotes appearing in USA Today, reflecting upon its success over the last quarter as an indicator of its power. "Apple will be around a long time, like IBM," he said. "Look at Apple's cash. It can invest in anything. It would be ridiculous to not expect them to be around. The same goes for Google and Facebook." He also referenced one major tech trend he thinks will explode over the next few decades: AI. It's something the tech commentator thinks will be ubiquitous, with people communicating using smart walls. These huge screens will become an everyday way to interact and live our lives, including shop, work and be entertained. Wearables we're already using will replace the need for doctors, prescribing medication using the data they've gleaned from your body, but there's always the question about whether it will be safe, he told USA Today. "The question will be ethical, on whether we can eliminate the need for physicians." Just two years ago, Wozniak voiced his concerns about AI, describing it as unsafe for humans, whereas his latest thoughts focused on the more immediate impact of the technology. Wozniak also touched upon what he thinks will be the biggest themes of the next 60 years, including new cities, built upon harsh landscapes such as deserts, a colony on Mars and aliens. Although on this final theme he accepts there's only a "random chance" they exist, he thinks there's the possibility that people in our lifetime will be able to communicate with extra terrestrials. "It's worth trying," he said in the interview, "but I don't have high hopes."   This article originally appeared at itpro.co.uk Related Articles Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google and more rally against Trump's travel ban Google Hire wants to take Linkedin's job Google and Facebook reveal tools to battle fake news FaceTime vs Duo vs Skype vs Messenger: Which video chat app is for you?

Apple's Very First Android App... Is A Transfer App To Move Users Off Android Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2015/09/16 2:43pm PDTSep 16, 2015 222 Plus 1 on G+ 215 Share on Facebook 110 Share on Twitter Total Shares437 Applications News Apple is, you might say, ever so slightly hesitant to support competing platforms. It took the company years (and the promise of a greater market for the iPod) to support Windows for its massive iTunes program, and some of the more professional tools have never appeared on anything except Apple hardware. Today is a banner day, then, because Apple has released its first ever Android app. It's pretty much exactly what you were expecting.    Apple announced the Move to iOS app way back in June, but it's taken them this long to get it on the Play Store. (Maybe they had to wait for approval.) Like similar apps from a variety of manufacturers, including Microsoft, Samsung, and Motorola, the app is designed to allow you to transfer contacts, SMS history, bookmarks, photos, and account information to the company's hardware, in this case an iPhone or iPad. It won't transfer apps, of course, and both devices need to be connected to a secure Wi-Fi network. The description is surprisingly light on the condescending Apple ad copy we're all familiar with... so it's a good thing that Android users are more than willing to provide their own in the reviews section. (Some of those might not be 100% true, by the way.) Move to iOS works on Android devices running 4.0 or later, and it's a free download. Download QR-Code Move to iOS Developer: Apple Inc.

Hopefully Apple makes more of their apps available for Android users e.g. imessage and facetime. Leandro Brandão i'm pretty sure they would not allow other brands put apps like that on their app store. iPhone_user1 I dunno. Apple making apps for Android is great fo both parties. If Apple music gets this kind of reaction from Android diehards, Apple may not bother to do so in the future. Wodge This is going to be Apples only app on the play store. They're notoriously closed minded in regards to other operating systems. I recall some apps getting removed from Apple's app store for mentioning they're an editors pick on the then Android Market, whereas you can mention how well your app has done on the App store without Google getting the banhammer out. KL Yep, our iOS app got rejected by Apple for that very reason!! (*SMH*) José A. Medina I really doubt they will release facetime or imessage on Android, at least not in near future... Jumanji242 Apple will make music available for Android because it means monthly recurring revenue for them. Given that Android has a much larger marketshare vs iOS, it would be foolish for them to avoid the dominant installed platform. They would literally be leaving money on the table for petty, emotional reasons when Apple is instead supposed to monetize their services where possible, even if it's on a competing platform. I'm going to guess that you've never worked in strategic or product position at a tech company in your life. iPhone_user1 What are you talking about? I know that making Apple music available on Android is to expand their service. What I'm saying is that if it gets deliberate 1 star ratings, Apple wouldn't bother making more cross platform apps in the future unless they have to. Jumanji242 And if Apple gets 5 star reviews for this app, they still aren't going to make apps for Android unless they have to. Do you think Apple just makes apps for a competing platform because they're hoping people will give them good reviews? Making money always trumps emotional accolades from anonymous people on the internet. iPhone_user1 Imagine if Apple went the BlackBerry route and made imessage cross platform. They would have a user base as big as WhatsApp. They won't do it anytime soon though, unless Apple music proves to be successful and loved on Android. Jumanji242 Some things to ponder: 1. Apple Music requires a subscription. This generates revenue. 2. iMessage is a free app and an iOS platform differentiator. It doesn't generate revenue. Questions for you: 1. How would Apple monetize iMessage on Android or any other competing platform? 2. If iMessage is on Android, would that remove one competitive difference that iOS has over other platforms? 3. What would be the win in having iMessage on Android? 4. How much revenue does WhatsApp generate? 5. If iMessage is released on Android, would that motivate an Android user to switch to an iOS device? iPhone_user1 Are you quizzing me? Jumanji242 No, I am showing you why you're wrong on multiple levels. Seiga Apple making their native apps on Android would be a wise move, however, not going to happen. Not unless Apple changes their decision on exclusivity. Android had no qualms pushing hangouts to the iOS. But Facetime on Android, to apple, that's taking their bread and butter and putting it on the Android platform. It won't happen unless they change their business model. Apple has more hatred towards Google than Google has hatred towards Apple. Proof is with all the dumb lawsuits Apple tries to send out to Google and their hardware companies. John Who wants apple music anyway? There are so many superior music services out there. Apple music is great for people who love the word "Apple" Gepstra Yeah, no. Don't think so. Patrick Smithopolis Never used imessage or facetime even when I briefly had an iPhone. They're overrated. ethd I'd love to see iMessage on Android at least. It's at least on par with Hangouts for instant messaging. I'm not particularly sold on FaceTime but the more the merrier! Unfortunately, Apple didn't really seem to be interested in supporting Android as a platform. Its frankly amazing that Apple Music is going to be on Android. Santos Isaac Chavez If iMessage came to both Android and there was a Windows Client, I'd be a heavy user of them. Why? I'm an Android fanatic stuck in the middle of Apple diehard fans. Uwotm8 While amusing, I do find this whole iOS vs Android act to be quite silly. It has not been and currently there no legitimate reason to think that Apple will make iMessage or Facetime available outside Apple's own OS'. I would welcome iMessage and Facetime to Android because they have been proven to be quite popular and in my experience, Hangouts has yet to achieve that level of popularity. Apps like those are suppose to bring us together and not divide us, after all. Damian You know what to do, guys. iPhone_user1 Why encourage immaturity? Brendon Cry ISheep iPhone_user1 Thanks for proving my point.... Brendon Go back to your crappy Imagic phone with outdate specs. iPhone_user1 "imagic phone?" lol, at least you're trying to be original. Gerjannn Agreed. I also had a time where I kept hating on iOS, but people like it. A lot of them wouldn't be happy with Android and that's okay. We won't be happy using iOS for a lot of reasons, and that's okay too. Everyone has another opinion of what they like, and as long as both devices keep innovating there's no problem. pol That's funny, considering your comment history. If you want your comments to be taken seriously, maybe change your username and avatar. Brendon LOL,upvote^ iPhone_user1 My username is just a name. And my comments are just MY OPINIONS. Doesn't have anything to do with maturity. pol Your comments do have to do with maturity, though. The fact that you come onto Android sites and articles with that username, avatar, and clear Apple bias shows that. I see you bashing Android phones all the time. iPhone_user1 Giving an unpopular opinion does not mean I'm purposely bashing anything. It's my opinion. pol That wasn't the topic. The fact is that you act immaturely every time you comment on an Android-related site or article, and you're calling others immature when the "you know what to do" comment was clearly a (quite funny) joke. Seiga You're right. You're entitled to your opinion. Except your opinion is not calculated at all. You're going based on your own "feelings" about a company. I can list off proofs from reading your previous posts, but it would be a chapter in a rather large novel for me to list it all. See, I'm not bias to Android or iOS. Both have their pros and cons. But to say one is better than the other is totally stupid. Each platform caters to the user's ecosystem. I can easily say that I have had more iOS app crashes than Android crashes, but you don't see me post anything like that on any boards. Or it took a very long time for iOS to implement anything remotely close to NFC. Or Android Pay (formally was Google Wallet) being out way before Apple Pay. Or the fact that I can alter kernel settings without jumping through hoops like with iOS and Jailbreak. (These points are the first time I have stated these things) Here is the cold hard facts... Apple caters to simplicity, while Android caters to ingenuity. I can easily go on Macrumors.com and find a million posts on Apple fanboys bashing Android. WORPspeed So Westboro baptists church members sharing their 'unpopular' opinion at the place where black people, gay people, funeral atendees gather is also mature behavior? Randa Hafza you cant be talking sense on one topic, then being stupid on other topics, and tell people to "be reasonable" , you are a kind of person who either are a professional troll, or a guy with no principles. someone755 Am I the only one who can't find a single immature comment of yours? So far you're one of the most educated and Android-friendly Apple fan I've seen in a website's comment section. iPhone_user1 Finally, someone in understands. Thanks for not being extremely judgemental like most people on here. someone755 The last conversation you and I had was interrupted by an asshole fanboy. And that's what happens to most of the conversations you're in, sadly. I wonder if iOS fans would react the same way to an "Android_user1" on an Apple-only blog... Franco Rossel If you act in an immature way, don't ask for maturity.. That's what we call hypocrisy. iPhone_user1 Again. Just because you don't like what I have to say doesn't make it immature. Franco Rossel Same applies here. Maturity is boring anyways. I want to have fun. iPhone_user1 Purposely rating apps 1 star because you don't like the company is pretty immature. You don't see Apple users doing that with Google apps. Franco Rossel You also see people on Android give 5 star to completely useless apps like the Samsung Push Service just for fun, with stupid reviews like that the app cures cancer. The App Store must be allergic to fun. Also Apple is so closed down that it doesn't allow this kind of apps on the App Store. That's why you don't see this kind of thing there. Darrien Glasser For once I agree with iPhone user. I think this guy is right. Pilz That's because GAPPS are awesome and iPhone users envy Google maps otherwise they would drive into a lake with apples version. I've yet to see a core GAPP that isn't better than an ios one. WORPspeed coughHangoutscough (well, don;t know how the situation is now, but before the 4.0 release on Android Apple had it better and with all the bugs in the Android version, iOS might still have it better) #justsaying Pilz I would call messenger their core messaging app not hangouts. I agree that it was terrible before the update but I still prefer messenger andy_o iOS Hangouts is at 5.0. #justsayin OrionBeast It's still shitty. #justsayin andy_o The iOS one compared to the Android one, or just Hangouts in general? If the former, nope. If the latter, probably yes. WORPspeed You know what else is immature? Cheap shots at the expense at the competitor during keynotes (only this year did Apple not put out as many, maybe because they are now behind on everything, maybe not). You know what else? Delivering the payment to Apple in pennies like Samsung did. Another example of immaturity: iPhone users reactions when Instagram came to Android. Everyone and everything is immature at times. Companies have stooped so low even. You expect a mostly anonymous forum board to be more mature? Not saying it isn't a nice expectation, but maybe you need to understand that people see this as paying back at Apple all the shit Android has gotten before from them. Their stuff is too closed down, so seeing it being burned to the ground where they can't control it (outside their walled garden) has more to do with the fun/irony of the situation than anything else. They make fun of Apple at Apple's expense. As far as I know Apple hasn't developed iFeelings yet so not sure where the harm is. Randa Hafza the whole thing about pennies was fake. WORPspeed AH! :O They lied! I call immature to whoever posted that then! Better yet, let's scrap april's fools while we are at it. Jokes are from now on Illegal. Immaturity must die. Jokes are immature! Leave Britney alone! operator207 Regarding your comment on Samsung paying Apple in Pennies. The "joke" was Nickels, and it was fake. :) http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/samsung.asp I don't disagree with what your saying, I just can't stand untruths floating around. Pet peeve of mine. :) John > You don't see Apple users doing that with Google apps. ROFLMAO! Roh_Mish Actually you can find many one stars in Google and other apps saying that apple and iPhone is better for no reason. Phazonclash Yup, that's because Google apps are actually pretty good and useful :) mark They wouldn't, because if Google put a move to android application on apple's site, apple would likely block it. If you read the reviews, most of them are based on ios, or the desperation of apple publishing this app, or the double standard where apple would likely block such an app. They're not about the company. This is what you apple zealots don't get: whilst you treat companies like football teams and go on about how much profit your favourite company makes from you, the rest of us don't care about companies, we care about what they do, and what products they make. If you like ios so much, maybe you can make use of this app and finally moved there. OrionBeast You shouldn't waste your time on this blog. Seriously. Mr. Franco Rossel doesn't know people are employed at whatever company for making this app. While most at Apple would know there are dimwits like this guy, it kind of interferes with rating system. Read the reviews and you'd see why android users are jealous (I don't see a reason for them to be jealous but holy crap! They should know they're proving themselves as idiots). Material design (first off, it's garbage!) for something that you're using to switch from android to iOS, why on earth do you need that?) Jonathan Plesel Why encourage immaturity? Pilz Because it's entertaining to see what random response you will have Michael Is this your full time job? In 25 days you commented 183 times on this website. Are you a full-time instigator or whatever you want to call it? How do you have enough time to comment 7 times a day on average here? You're fascinating. Miku is Best Vocaloid It's called shilling and he does it very, very wrong. abazigal I would hardly call 7 comments a day excessive. I have a full time job, and I sometimes post on forums way more time than that. verboze I have to agree with you on this; those ratings are just childish. Android fans are not going to use that app, so why waste time downloading and downrating the app? It's there for those who do want to switch, so let them provide proper feedback. I don't like the iPhone because it doesn't meet my needs, but I'm glad it's there. I'm all for competition, let the Googles and Apples compete for us consumers, we win at the end. Roh_Mish But you can't so this on apple side.they don't allow apps that allow users to leave the platform GazaIan I find it hilarious that your only reasonable minded comment is thwarted by your extremely immature and trollish comment history. PartySmasher Because it's funny Franco Rossel We shall make DuARTe proud. NEXUS WARRIORS, ASSEMBLE! Pilz I did mine a few hours ago :) we must bring t down to 1 star!!

The idea is ok, but the opposite cannot be done, and that's not a fair competition and not thinking about the customers' right to choose their own device. Daniel D. Tubul That is because they are duchebags. gtfo apple My1 who is duatre? Franco Rossel Spotted the heretic guys! My1 I am not a heretic. I never used an apple before and the only time I will use it in the future is to make apps (I have to get money for my next devices somewhere) Android Developer One of Google's employees, who presented Material Design, and stuff. My1 no wonder I dont know him. I dont really like Material, similar to io7+ and Win8+ since the flat design is junk, sometimes it's hard to differentiate a button from the rest of the text since there's literally no contrast between those at all (best regards by outlook365 online) I like it more win7 like. but the Idea of a design for all to make it senseful is good but all the UI changes especiially to YT and hangouts are annoying, I was so used to work with the slideout and then they had to change it. I like the hangouts style with the slideout better. also a non-flat style of Material would be nice. Android Developer Well, I liked Holo, as it has a futuristic look, but material isn't that bad. Holo started the being-flat idea, btw. IOS took it to the extreme, and now it looks anemic to me. My1 yeah holo started it, but it did have enough non- flat parts in it like buttons and stuff, the only disadvantage holo had was color, it was iirc only dark/light which is certainly a disadvantage in making your app look unique while retaining standard UI stuff, but the wordt part of holo was that it brought the annihilation of the manu button, I have a note 3 and the menu button is so practical unlike the 3-top at the top right, see I usually support my phone at the bottom with the "small finger" as we call it in german (no Idea how the english name is but i's at the opposite side of the thumb) and now I have my menu button bottom keft which is easy to reach but imagine a nexus 6 and try to get with yout right thumb at the 3-dot while the small finger of the same hand supports your phone, practically impossible, right? also it steals space at the action bar which shouldnt be at the top either, imo, I hated it when they moved the action bar from gmail to the top, as it was so inconvenient to reach. in the end the Idea of a unified UI design base not bad in the Idea but it has several flaws (some holo some material, some both): - Up button at the worst possible point for right handers (and semi-worst for left handers) - same but vice-versa for the 3-dot - Swipe out menu isnt a bad idea but hard to reach for right handers, maybe helpful to change position at users options - flat design removes contrast at important points like buttons making them hard to catch (especially for visually impared users) - Software buttons (well for one thing it takes screen size that you couldnt really take back for full screen interactive apps before KK, no dead zone between software buttons and screen, making games on a tab with before KK really annoying as you can constantly hit those, trust me happened to me, and the most annyong tihng: they change edges all the time which is annoying if you switch from one force rotation to the other and tap too quickly like from movie player to enforced vertical then the bar changes its edge and lets you tap things you didnt want) - no style choice for the users (I think that's obvios enough) Android Developer About the menu button, it was a good thing, but Google was also right: most users didn't use it and didn't know when it's possible to use it, as there was no indication to when it's possible to use it. Also, the problem with things being at the bottom is that there are already buttons there (nav buttons: back, home, recents), so the user might click on them by mistake. About right/left handed, I agree that they should have made it possible to reverse the order. You do have however a workaround for this, in the developer options, to set the alignment as RTL. Not so good solution tough in case your locale is RTL too. About software nav buttons, I agree, it was bad in the beginning, as I've clicked them a lot by mistake. But now it's much better, and I actually like them, maybe more than physical buttons. I don't understand the last part. Looks like HTML tags to me... :) My1 I edited the stuff since a accidentially posted a "lower than" sign (left to the y key on my kb) and it started dooing weird stuff, just refresh... well the fact that there should be an indication is true and there should be something (like for example a small stripe above the menu button in case of hw menu buttons) and I personally like the "hold home for recents" way much better since I am used to it and you dont need so many buttons at a lot of positions I just have to remind 3 things on my Note 3: hold menu -> search, hold home -> recents, hold back -> multiwindow (only on samsung and only if enabled) and I also had problems with software keys when I was typing like instead of space I push home, since as I said the software key have no dead zone to seperate between software buttons and UI while Hardware buttons (no matter whether push button or sensor key) obviosly have a seperation since the touch screen has ended and the buttons need their space as well also most phones with hardware buttons have a better interactive area vs full area ratio while many phones that have software buttons have a lot of "nothingness below the screen (especially Sony Phones) while phones with hw buttons have the buttons and less than half a centimeter margin below that, and you can use the space better with hw buttons since inlike a touchscreen, hw buttons are not contrained to certain shapes which may be defined by the OS like rectangle or round in case of watches. Android Developer Typing is still an issue, I agree. About indication, I hoped (when software buttons were announced) that the menu button will come back to there, as an additional one in case it's available. I've even hoped to have some API for the nav buttons, as it's almost empty (especially on tablets). It doesn't mean that I don't accidentally click on physical buttons though. I have SGS4 and sometimes I click the back/menu buttons by mistake too. It's very bad in online games. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. I like and dislike both. My1 yeah it might be true that you can tap hw buttons easy enough as well, but iirc not as easy as navbar buttons and another problem is the cat that the navbar chnages position depending on your rotation, while hw buttons stay where they are. Android Developer The position change of the nav buttons when changing the orientation doesn't occur on Nexus 4. Maybe on other devices. My1 well I yet only had to use Tablets with a button bar and all of those had that. Android Developer tablets aren't that popular here. I once used Nexus 7, but I don't remember how it worked in this regard, except for a weird bug in case the locale is RTL. My1 lol, what bug? Android Developer Maybe they've fixed it by now, but there were full-screen-landscape apps that the OS decided to avoid showing the navigation buttons, and even when you tried showing them, all you got is the back button which failed to be clicked. Only way to exit such apps was to have the swipe-up gesture to go to the Google-now app... Roh_Mish You Jake in disguise? My1 who is Jake? N&LH 'DuARTe proud.'...by giving false reviews!....So malware users are going crazy because of this app. All the negative comments show, most of Malware users are kids immature. IOS users will don't that. So malware users who call themselves as Pro users are immature. lol Franco Rossel It's just a joke. And are you seriously calling Android users immature while referring to Android as "malware'malware"? ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Go and enjoy jailOS alone. Sam The deed... Is done. v_v shadowdude777 Really? We're going to downvote-brigade an app? This is fanboyism to the same extent of the Apple fanboys. Just leave their app alone. You're not using it, so why would you rate it? Ratings are meant to be left by actual users. Maleko Did someone say to leave a sarcastic review? :D Joe O Sullivan Done.. :-) N&LH This shows how malware users are immature Leandro Brandão i doesn't even transfer music, and you need to use crap itunes to do that. BoFiS Hope all the installs are just to be able to post a 1-star review mocking it...that and you know what's easier than this? Setting up a new Lollipop phone and picking your backup to restore upon signing in! CUEBALL 1 star all the things!! AbbyZFresh This will be funny when Move to iOS ends up being the top free app in the Play Store. Pavel Sikun Not with such rating. Leo You'll need to either wait for an eternity or build your own method of travelling to a dimension where iOS is actually an OS. pfmiller iOS isn't an OS in this dimension? Are you sure? John I don't consider iOS to be a proper user OS. Its more like the OS in your car. A real OS doesn't control, restrict, and regulate its users the way that iOS does. Android Developer Wonder though if the opposite can be done, to put "move to Android" app on App-Store, and see it on the top free apps. Then again, Apple won't even approve this app. John Yes, Apple rules over their users' devices with an iron fist. No unapproved apps in North Korea! I mean, the apple store. Leo Indeed. My mistake, I'm so used to Windows and Android that I automatically declass more antiquated operating systems à la Symbian as "non OS'es" cvm Wow, Apple is so polite, it requires Android 4.0 and up... If it required lollipop they will say "android is too fragmentated and that's why IOS is better and so on..". Muzaffar I guess a lot of apps on play store require Android 4.0, not only Move to iOS. Franco Rossel Did they disable the reviews? rfslocutus Looks like it. Ryan That's got to be the funniest thing I've seen. I can't even pull the app up on my phone either, despite the store saying it is compatible. Ryan aha, I see what they did. (I don't feel like editing my last comment) Looks like Apple pulled it from the Play Store for some reason. Its no longer showing up in searches or anything. I'm going to assume it had some serious flaws or something. Pavel Sikun for me it's there and I see the reviews. Rating fell down to 1.8 though! My name is…. Still high.... Zomby2D It moved your data over to an iPhone, I'd say that's a serious flaw. Ryan Now I'm not prejudiced against Apple (ok, I am, but for other reasons), however I do at least promote competition in the market for the smart phone industry. The whole data is back and I read some of the reviews. 99% of them are just outright stupid and are trying WAY too hard to be funny, when they're not. Patrick Smithopolis You have to download it in order to review it. Franco Rossel Only to make a review, not to see existing ones. Patrick Smithopolis I reviewed the app and I can see all the reviews. Franco Rossel What's your point? I should be able to see all the reviews, even if I haven't installed the app. The web version of the Play Store doesn't have them right now. Patrick Smithopolis I didn't know that. I'm using the play store app on my phone. Ryan That's actually not what he's getting at. No one can review it I think because the app no longer appears in searches, nor does it have a rating in the first place. Don't know if its a glitch, or Apple actually pulled the app briefly Patrick Smithopolis I just downloaded the app and reviewed it. Brian nope I see all the reviews Franco Rossel The web version of the Play Store disabled them. T’ No. Brian Not for me. Franco Rossel They're back for me now. Apparently it was just temporal. SmithCommaJohn I'm fine with this. Anything that makes it easy to switch between platforms will encourage consumers to experiment with different ones, letting them decide for themselves what best meets their needs. It also increases competition, which should make iOS AND Android better in the long run. Mark Apple is so precious... Patrick Smithopolis There's a few people giving it five stars. Android_FrEak What's the point? Just log into your Google account from an iOS device and bam... Google already has all your info ready to go... Contacts - Log into Google account Message history - Hangouts Camera photos and videos - Google Photos (unlimited space) Web bookmarks - Chrome...duh! Mail accounts - Gmail Calendars - Google Calendar. I don't see why this was necessary! Pavel Sikun Inbox ftw!! Sadly there's no google keep for ios :( OrionBeast Inbox for iOS was released exactly the same time as android version. FYI, you're a mindless bot. Just like iSheep Renaldi I. Lol? He was lamenting the lack of Keep for iOS, not Inbox (although I could have sworn Keep was available for iPhones...). Who gave you the right to call others "mindless bots" when your arguments are faulty and you are quick to throw insults? (The irony of "mindless bot" is not lost on me...) OrionBeast my bad. lmao. i swear i was typing this comment for andy_o user. idk how it it linked my comment to Psvel's comment. (fact that you have android in your picture, and by the nature of 'droids' its only fair to say they're indeed mindless lmao). My comment of 'mindless bot' is better suited for you than Pavel. Renaldi I. So you want to lump me in with all others who are fans of Android as "mindless bots"? If that's the case then I suppose its fair to lump you and everyone else who is a fan of Blackberry as "crackheads", for "Crackberry"? Lel, I don't even have a picture; this is the default picture on this blog for all Discus posters without avatars. Way to project. OrionBeast you're a fucking idiot. i said it was my bad. get a life mofo. you sound like a fucking bot ATM. get your batteries charged. Renaldi I. Chill out, crackhead. You sound more of a troll than I ever did. Let's just agree to move on. OrionBeast Lmao. crackhead? I wish internet would allow me to bitchslap you and wake you up from fantasy land. Renaldi I. So you want to lump me in with all others who are fans of Android as "mindless bots"?

OrionBeast you're an idiot. i just said 'my bad'. can you read? i guess not. nvm troll. Renaldi I. You saying 'my bad' doesn't negate your remark, "My comment of 'mindless bot' is better suited for you than Pavel."

TouchMyBox It would be cool if Android was considered to be laggy and if there was a non-laggy alternative out there.

If you want Android and latest updates, buy a Nexus. Consumers have the choice if they care. OrionBeast You brag about androids latest release like its something very 'revolutionary' when iOS users had 90% of those features since iOS 7. You brag about it like its a big deal that you have a choice. Well, everyone when they buy a phone has a 'choice' as to which device they buy. To each, their own.

N&LH Welcome to Malware platform ( http://www.alternatum.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Malware-Threats-Android-Devices-Google.jpeg ) T’ Sooo, Apple is paying every entry-level engineer six digit salaries, yet they couldn't find anyone to write an app which doesn't look like crap from an Indian sweatshop? Seiga The whole idea is to use their UI patterns on Android to signify their transition to iOS. It works both ways. Google apps on iOS use Material Design Pattern, but you don't see people complaining about that. John That's because material design, when done well, looks good on iOS. abazigal Material design, however well done, still looks out place on iOS as it violates iOS design guidelines. T’ Which is bullshit. Google's apps on iOS are material design, but they still follow the native design guidelines. That's no contradiction. mark Indeed. Maybe they could ask Microsoft to write a better one for them, or maybe Google will help them out again. Roberto Virga A.K.A. Sheep Simulator JD Tell you what.

Andrew I don't get why people are giving it low reviews. If it doesn't work well, then sure rate it badly, but if it does what it's advertised to do...why bash it? Reading through the reviews of the app, it's just angry Android fans who are just bashing the app just to take a swipe at Apple. Pretty pathetic. My name is…. What would internet be without trolls? Of course we rated 1 star. Because its Apple. GTFO John Not nearly as pathetic as Cooks constant, inflammatory, and misleading swipes at Android. me me Golly, move to Apple, what a fabulous idea. Looking forward to the locked down $900+ phone with 2 year old Android technology which bends in my pocket and feeble battery life. It just trounces my $300 OnePlusOne. Zsolt V I think this year this armored the phone which is why it's thicker, heavier with less battery life. Quite the feat. TechGuy22 yeah their new S line are quite amazing LOL Gregory Fun fact: if Google made similar app to move from iOS to Android, it would most likely get rejected for violating some AppStore review guidelines. Android Developer True, because it has the name of another OS, and as I've read, it's against their rules. Not sure though how Android wear apps can fit in there. Gregory Moreover, it makes it easier for users to abandon the Apple ecosystem. Something that Apple definitely doesn't want to be easy. Android Developer What makes it easier to leave IOS ? Because other OSs cannot be mentioned? PartySmasher Because it would be an app to move from iOS to Android, it's not difficult... Android Developer I don't understand, but here's one opposite app : http://www.androidauthority.com/stick-with-android-move-to-ios-643169/ :) John Doe I think Motorola has one. Roh_Mish It just shows you how to do it. It doesn't do anything for you patrik Well, they don't have to. They can do something similar to Samsung's Smart Switch. Instead of being an app in the Appstore, it's an app in the Play Store, which then connects to a persons iCloud, to download everything from there. serge_guatemala mmm... maybe apple wants all your info...

Kevin Luther This reply made my shitty day much better <3 Seiga Best reply of the day!!!! A part of me feels bad that Serge typed out all those access rights in the comments.... But then the reply makes me feel much better. Serge, whatever time you spent on typing all that out, it's too bad you won't get it back. serge_guatemala Of course they do. Do you think they will delete that data from their servers after that? TouchMyBox I'm surprised that they're not using the HTC G1 as the android phone in the screenshots. Mar "You can recycle your old android phone at any apple store"..

"Steve Jobs inside the coffin rolling eyes...":-P Steve Jobs Suicidal tendencies by Google? I guess Google gave itself up. Please move to iPhone quickly, everyone. Thanks in advance. Seiga And yet, Google needs no such app on the iTunes store because its super easy to transfer from Apple to Google. Thanks Apple for making it easy to just sign up for a Gmail account and sync. GrevenAfSvealand They should make it incompatible with phones priced below 600 bucks, lol. ADofCLE "Not even matieral design. Feels like an iOS port" Lmfao! Seiga Apple developers bit their tongue writing a Java based application instead of Objective-C. Somewhere in all of this, Oracle is smiling. Renaldi I. It wasn't necessarily Java - Android can also do C and C++. Seiga Yes, for NDK purposes. I'm sure their code is filled with onCreate, onPause, onResume, onStop, and on destroy methods. SoulstormS I`m just gonna leave this review here (the first one) "I installed this and then realised that I could just use NFC to pair the 2 handsets and transfer all my stuff across. Cant I? Oh wait... no I cant because despite my Android phones having NFC for the last 4 years its somehow only a "feature" on the newest IOS. Oh well, at least my shiny new IOS device has wireless chargi... what? It doesnt? But my Nexus had it 2 years ago? Even after removing this app my phone is haunted by the ghost of Steve Jobs, so now I have to download the iXorcism app." I just spilled coffee on my keyboard reading that, lol. John Doe Of course they use an HTC device they practically bought them with the patent deal. Ever since HTC signed that patent deal with Apple they went down the toilet. Its a shame since they were the ones that made the first Android phone. wkfp I'm surprised they chose a good looking phone, they could have went with an ugly one. Ryuuie Ahahahahaha I'm not sure what I expected from Apple, but it probably should've been this. I legitimately laughed for a good 10 minutes when I saw the title of this. EDIT: I'd still buy a Mac if they didn't want an arm, leg, and half of my soul for it... :v landon Hey it's Chris from Phandroid. Android Developer THIS IS ... ? Artem Russakovskii Sparta?

On-topic. I hope to see a best-of list of all the user reviews in the coming days :D Lawrence With the lollipop fiasco, no wonder iPhone is getting traction again. Sir_Brizz Except the market share numbers have changed little if at all to back that up "Fiasco"... lol. Lawrence Everybody wants the latest version, then they realize that lollipop is a pos. Then they are stuck, it is not easy for the average guy to downgrade their phones. Adb, kies, restart in bootloader, what is that?? Samsung, lg, Motorola are difficult to downgrade. Sir_Brizz Lollipop is fine. Leo I have to agree, just what's wrong with it? My Nexus 4 is zippy and responsive, the only hiccup being THE GODDAMN FACEBOOK APPS. mo And sucky SoCs from Qualcomm for 2015. Dmitry Stepanushkin installed. gave it one star. uninstalled. because fuck you Apple, thats why. Sam Del Valle I have a dream, where both the Android community and the Apple community can just get along and the terms Fandroid, and iShit (or iSheep) are gone. I have a dream where we unite and make fun of Windows Phone. Ignacio Zippy I have a similar dream where we unite and make fun of Samsung… (!?) Sam Del Valle We already do tim242 Without Samsung, Android would have the user base the size of Windows Phone. Photon They're yet to accept this fact Ignacio Zippy I myself started in the Android world with a Galaxy S2. Better times (?) Renaldi I. I was once loyal to Samsung (until they left me in the dust, update-wise, twice...) Ikhsan Hasbi Dude, not cool! mrjayviper Where's the Android feature where I can restore my phone/device from a backup? Just restored my wife's iPhone backed up data to a new iPhone and Apple/3rd-party app data are all there. I've looked around for something similar for Android that DOESN'T REQUIRE ROOT and I cannot find it? Sir_Brizz Then blame the developers I guess? App developers have been able to save app data to the cloud for ages. mrjayviper The 3rd-party app backups were done by Apple software.... Sir_Brizz That doesn't take the onus off the devs. They could be making it work. I hope Google adds a similar feature as it has been hinted at a few times but devs could be making their apps work better. Maxr1998 Android M brings full data backup support to Google's servers. In before, App devs must jave explicitly enabled that. Leo This. Google has been enabling devs to save to the cloud for what, two major Services releases? Too bad that only a handful chose to - it's more convenient for them to not waste time/resources or have their own save methods (see King for example). Glad to see that Google is now enforcing the policy. Sir_Brizz Oh cool. I forgot they were adding that. lomsha Nice try Apple! Madis Otenurm I rate apps fairly, but I do like that the low rating prevents it from being featured anywhere where it counts. abazigal So has anyone actually tried the app and evaluated it objectively based on how well or poorly it did its job? Many people evidently get their rocks off by spamming the app with 1-star reviews (an immature act I myself would never do), but that says more about their own character than the person they are trolling (or criticizing) here. Besides, what about people who might legitimately find this app useful or helpful? How are your actions helping them? MaryJane This is a free app??! hackRme Yes free. Just you have to buy a 1000$ phone along ben Spent the last 10 minutes reading the comments section for this app. Some truly great gems! LOL Mohamed Al-Refai would Apple allow android phone makers to upload a similar App to their App Store? Proioxix So 100s of Android users are rating the app 1 star even though they never plan to use it simply because it's an Apple app eh, typical I guess. I'm even surprised AP cared to report this. It's a real circle jerk around here. psydex Deal with it. ಠ_ృ Proioxix Yet people in the comments keep bitching about Apple not bringing more apps to the Play Store. If this is the kind of childish reaction they'll get then what do these people expect. The Bilderbergers If you don't like it then you can just GET OUT! Proioxix Calm down you. Leo Being here just for the comments and the reviews makes me a bad person? *munches popcorn* matteventu "You can recycle this Android phone for free at any Apple Store" [cit. app screenshot] Sure!! Stripes I like how this article and some of the comment from the reviews critique Apple because the first app they produce from Android is this, but please take a look on how Google treats Windows Phone. They even removed Microsoft's app made for Youtube, FFS. P.S. I have a Nexus 5 as my main phone and recently I bought a cheap Lumia 535 from my second number. The lack of Google made apps is appalling. Microsoft seem to be the only one who caters for all platforms in as equal matter as possible. Tsun_Pooka Yeah. Google has a really bad record in supporting Windows Phone, only giving you an outdated Google app that actually acts as a shell for the website itself. The rest of Google's services, well uh... Meanwhile, Microsoft is releasing their apps to nearly everywhere that isn't a Blackberry or Java phone. Maybe its better to stick with Microsoft's services in general since they are available everywhere now as apps? saltyzip Windows phone is small fry, just think of the additional development cost companies would need invest, and continue to invest to develop and support applications for three platforms. It's why Microsoft can't get a foothold, and it's not likely to change anytime soon. Tsun_Pooka Is that an excuse for Google to pull out a YouTube app from Microsoft's store? No. Plus, your sorry excuse is even more bad. What has Microsoft been doing these past months? They were developing APIs and stuff to help smoothen the transition of iOS and Android apps into the Windows Phone ecosystem and make it cheaper. Right now, the developers being lazy is the best way to assess the situation of Windows Phone, nothing else. That, and Google should support Windows Phone by releasing their apps on it ASAP. There is no excuse here not to develop for them, considering Microsoft released apps for every device now. saltyzip Irrespective on how easy Microsoft makes the porting, it still takes time, effort and therefore additional cost to undertake this activity. Native apps when ported need testing, and is there any point in doing this when Windows phone is small fry and on a decline. It's business, nothing to do with developers being lazy. Tsun_Pooka Of course that is relevant. They made it EASIER to port so this excuse could not be pulled out. There's a point. 3% of all users isn't a small number considering how BILLIONS of Android phones exist in the 85% (or whatever it is now) margin of Android market share. With the easier porting, its a win-win to port to Windows Phone. That and the future of Windows Phone will also be carried with Windows 10. Windows 10 made up 75 million installs on desktop, and the point of Windows 10 is to be universal. Missing Windows Store for both 10 Desktop and Mobile would be missing a big opportunity. However, you didn't answer my initial question either. Granted I answered it, but I found you dropped it very fast. Is Windows Phone's market share an excuse to REMOVE the YouTube app for Windows Phone? saltyzip I thought the cost of supporting a third platform on a minority os deemed a good enough reason as to why support was likely dropped or maybe Microsoft stopped paying Google to build an app for them. We will never know the real reason. If you owned Google would you develop for Windows phone? Of course you wouldn't, thats business. Tsun_Pooka I'd most likely develop for Windows Phone if I owned Google. With BILLIONS of DOLLARS in the company's hands, it would be verrrrrrrrry easy and effortless to develop for Windows Phone. Think of it. Google has their apps on iOS so to attract more consumers to the ecosystem itself. Nabbing a 3% of phone market share, which I think is not a small number by itself when its not compared to Android or iOS, is an opportunity, right? And iOS is supposed to be taking up 15%, just 5 times more the market share of Windows Phone (correct me if I'm wrong in these percentages). With the 82% of Android in Google's hands in the case of their apps, they wouldn't even look at iOS and company, right? No, they decided to also look after iOS. Which I think is why Windows Phone should be looked at, not admonished. The only reason I see Google not supporting Windows Phone by providing apps to their ecosystem is likely a grudge or something. I can't explain it anyway else with Microsoft developing a YouTube app and Google's all like 'Hey, take this off now!", and even with their only app on the ecosystem being just a shell for the website. saltyzip Why didn't you buy a cheap android phone as your second phone, doesn't make sense to buy a microsoft one? Tsun_Pooka Windows Phone is a good OS. It makes sense that his second phone is a Windows Phone, not a cheap Android. saltyzip It doesn't when the apps he uses aren't available on it, hence his complaint. He should have bought a moto e if this was top priority, if trying out windows then he made a good choice. Tsun_Pooka His complaint is more or less directed at Google for not even actually letting Microsoft provide apps for their own ecosystem on Windows Phone, according to the way he worded the post. So that's one. Secondly, let's say I wasn't interested in trying out Windows Phone, but I was so on the idea that I want a second phone. Why would I want a cheap Android device when I have a high end Android device? Its likely I'll be using my high end device more if its for Android, I'd probably even forget I owned a cheap Android. Hence why it makes sense to choose something else that isn't Android. With that conclusion, I can tell that buying into the Windows Phone ecosystem makes more sense than buying a weaker Android device when I already have a more powerful one. Stripes What is the relevance and importance of my choice? In my original message I was trying to bring attention on other things. Just to indulge you: cheap Android phones suck. There is probably an exception in Moto E (although it has only 4GB of internal storage), but from where I bought the phone, it wasn't available. So for less than 100 Euro (which I will pay monthly, not on the spot) I got a pretty fast phone (Windows on budget phone moves really well, apparently) with 1GB RAM, Snapdragon 200 and guaranteed update to Win 10. Yes the software and store is lacking, but it's still a sweet cheap phone that I will recommend. I also wanted to try different ecosystems for my own curiosity (I'm on Android and only Android since 2011). I would also like to buy an iPad to see how iOS stacks up to Android, but they are to expensive for my tastes. saltyzip The same could be said for BlackBerry, for firefox, or Ubuntu phone. Google supposed to write apps for all these phone platforms too? You bought a phone that doesn't provide the apps you expect, its not Googles fault, surely it's your own for not doing the due diligence first. There are apps on IOS which aren't on Android and vice versa, you just have to pick what best suits you, and if you have to compromise then so be it. Paolo T. Google NEEDS to retaliate by removing their entire app suite from iOS. How dare they insult our freedom of choice. If that's how lowly Apple sees the Android community at large, why should Google see Apple highly? That just makes no sense, the same way car owners judge Uber users as poor as dirt, it make NO sense! Renaldi I. It's just one app. Those are awfully drastic measures for just one app, with a large chunk of your mobile division's income gone with them. Yeah_Whatever.. So Apples first Android app is an Anti-Android app. No surprise there.. k40s I wonder if they would allow a Google app called "Move to Android" in their app store... dude The answer is no. Rami at least Google got quite a lot of apps on Apples App Store since day 1. Anton Kuznetsov I suppose this app is the price Google paid for Android Wear for iOS﻿ Azar I'm surprised it's a free app, after all it should've been at least $99 like the apple pencil Kasnadi Ajisuksmoyo Hand me free 6s and i might think about it. Might. Davin Peterson Unlike Google & Microsoft, Apple does not make it's own apps for available for Android or Windows, which means Apple is limiting to you to their platform. OrionBeast If iPhone users are mindless sheeps, android users are botgoats. Renaldi I. So, would that make you a Windows Phone user? OrionBeast blackberry user. lol MotoDr0id blackberry user ...too stupid to be ashamed. :D OrionBeast you're too stupid to understand sarcasm. take your meds. MotoDr0id lol! Román Rodríguez I just went to the Play Store and gave my 1 star rating. I've never felt so proud in my life. dude Wow the app icon for it looks terrible. Photon Looks scanned The Bilderbergers It felt good to give my 1 star review. Román Rodríguez Move to iOS? Haha Photon Yeah so you can go fuck off ok? resource Instead of looking at the reasons someone might want to leave Android for iOS, you all spam the app with 1-star reviews. Kinda immature. And I say this as a life long Android user. Tsun_Pooka They are rating it 1-star because Apple wouldn't allow an app like that on their app store to move to Android. Joseph Yay, Android community being childish!!!!! That's so nice and revolutionary guys, keep up the good work. I think that people don't really think how and who these comments affects. Apple don't give a fuck if they have low reviews. For them, it's actually better this situation, because they can show the public how shitty fans of Android are and "how they try to" be better. (And yeah, I like Android and I know that it's away better than Apple. But this is really, really awful.) Tsun_Pooka I don't like how this sounds. By the next WWDC we'll be insulted and nobody's gonna bat an eye... Evan Buchholz Yikes Ryan Johnson People are so immature posting troll comments on this app... N&LH Android before IOS ( http://images.pcworld.com/images/article/2012/04/android_before_after_iphone-11352342.jpg ) Just a reminder to you guys in case you forget. Shanika C'mon guys, don't hate Apple. Just don't use it - except for eating. MotoDr0id That's what Tim Cook said to his pool boy. bikrame One xda dev found out its kang from another app. Well done apple. MotoDr0id Appel fanbois are only worried about the color of their fashion accessories and overpaying for shoddy hardware and punitive software at the trough of cult-leader, Tim "Velvet Fist" Cook. Blackangel3942 Possibly, the ultimate insult for proud Android users. I though Apple was finally going to put some of its apps on the Play Store, nope. feren Move to iOS can help you transfer data from android to iphone, which can transfer data like contacts, photos from android to iphone, but you cannot move paid apps, and some music cannot be palyed on iphone, so are the videos. I recommend MobiKin Transfer for Mobile.

Furthermore, the Cupertino company also acknowledges the fact that most users of the iMac are professionals. In line with this, Apple is revamping the all-in-one desktop computer to cater to professional users. According to Digitimes, Apple is already preparing the manufacturing of the iMac 2017. In a report posted yesterday, the website said that just like current generation iMac, the new iMacs will be manufactured by Quanta Computers starting on May 2017. Unfortunately, the report did not specify exactly how many units Apple ordered from Quanta Computer for the upcoming line of iMacs. Perhaps the most promising feature of the new iMac 2017 is the hardware focused on professional use. Last year, some reports suggested that the iMac could potentially sport an Intel Xeon processor instead of a normal desktop version. It seems like this will not be a reality, at least according to the Digitimes report. 2015 iMac (via apple.com) The report yesterday said that the iMac 2017 will sport the later Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor. At the moment, it is still unclear if it will support newer server-grade processors with more than four cores. However, one thing for sure is that the new iMac will finally support ECC type RAM. This will give the upcoming iMacs a more robust build as these memories have in-built error detection and correction. In addition to the Xeon processor and ECC memory, it looks like the iMac 2017 will be the first iMac to finally move to an entirely NVMe storage technology. For those who are unaware, the current generation iMacs still rely on spinning disk hard drives. However, it has an option to include a second NVMe drive on the iMac. This makes use of the Fusion technology from Apple. The new storage configuration will surely give the iMac 2017 an unprecedented increase in data throughput as NVMe storage is known for very fast read and write speeds. At the moment, it is still uncertain when the actual release of the new iMacs will be. But since Apple already said that they will come this year, once can only surmise that it will be between September and October; either on or after the launch of the iPhone 8.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews iPhone New Bloomberg Report Lists Out Confusing iPhone 8 Specs; Confirms iOS 11 Instead By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 19, 2017 12:38 PM Perhaps one of the most talked about mobile device of 2017, apart from the Samsung Galaxy S8, is the iPhone 8. So far, there have been numerous reports about the tenth anniversary iPhone’s specifications, and along with it, its price. However, a new report that has recently surfaced seemed more confusing rather than being helpful. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, Apple is concurrently testing a number of iPhone 8 prototypes. These prototypes have varying hardware specs including the display, camera, and phone build. One of the prototypes mentioned has a stainless steel frame with a slightly curved front and back glass cover. The display itself, the report said, is flat. However, the glass that covers the display panel will have slightly curved edges instead. iPhone 8 concept (via idropnews.com) Another prototype, however, is said to have the dual rear cameras mounted vertically instead of horizontally. According to the source, this new arrangement will result in a much better image quality on the iPhone 8. If that is not confusing enough, another prototype seems to have the fingerprint sensor mounted on the back. It would seem that Apple’s suppliers are still having issues merging the sensor and the display together, as reported earlier. With all these different versions of the phone, it is now quite difficult to confirm which hardware features the iPhone 8 will have. Right now, bets are against the display mounted fingerprint sensor due to manufacturing complications. Other reports suggest that Apple will delay the phone’s release until it is certain that the fingerprint sensor behind the display will work. Meanwhile, others are saying that Apple might be forced to release the iPhone 8 prematurely due to pressure caused by the Galaxy S8. With all these confusing reports, the only thing that the Bloomberg article confirmed is iOS 11 on the iPhone 8. It has been known for a while that Apple intends to release the upcoming major iOS update on the tenth anniversary iPhone. With all that said, it is really quite hard to tell now which features the iPhone 8 will include. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

But it’s probably not enough to convert users of Spotify or Apple Music. By Emily Bary April 18, 2017 3:15 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Getty Images/iStockphoto Pandora was the pioneer in music streaming but it’s been behind the times for years now. With the broad launch of its new Premium service this morning, Pandora has finally entered the world of on-demand streaming -- the service popularized by Spotify and then Apple Music. There is some good news to being late to the party -- Pandora Premium has been able to improve on areas where Spotify and Apple Music still struggle, namely the user interface and better playlist creation.

We’d say Premium is now the sleekest of the three. Still, it might not be enough to compel any of Spotify’s 50 million users to switch. Where Premium might succeed is in convincing users of Pandora’s free ad-supported radio service to pay $10 a month for an on-demand alternative. Pandora has focused on the user experience in areas where Apple and Spotify tend to fall short. It’s easy to play music as soon as you enter the Pandora app -- your most recently played and recently added songs or playlists appear with “play” buttons right away. There’s no need to sort through playlist and artist menus to get back to the song you played last time you were in the app (as is the case with Apple Music) or the one you added yesterday (as is the case with Spotify). Having to hit a few buttons before playing a song isn’t something you necessarily notice as an annoyance when you use one of the rival apps, but Pandora’s simplicity is welcome. One gripe: It’s arguably too easy to play music. In our tests, Pandora started up with our most recent track as soon as we opened the app, before we hit any buttons. It’s less than ideal in an office setting. We like that Pandora pulls a color out of the album art and changes the app’s background color accordingly. The app just looks pretty, especially compared to Spotify’s harsh black color scheme and Apple Music’s utilitarian feel. For those who don’t have the energy to make playlists, Pandora’s algorithms can help. We like a feature that allows you to “add similar songs” to a small playlist. We added a few relatively popular songs by different types of artists, and Pandora did a good job of identifying our tastes. Some of the artists we chose dabble in different genres, but Pandora’s algorithms knew from our song choices that we liked the more slow tracks and suggested new music accordingly. We learned about some new songs this way. The algorithm did struggle a bit, though, on a few lesser known tracks. When we added some show tunes, for instance, Pandora only shot back Hamilton songs -- and not necessarily ones that stand well on their own. The service matched Spotify in terms of predicting what music we’d like, and far surpassed Apple Music on this. More from Barron’s Next Why Music Streaming Might Be a Lousy Business When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare Here’s One Less Reason to Pay for Apple Music Pandora, meanwhile, hasn’t given up on its trademark thumbs-up. Pandora prepares a customized station of tracks related to every song you’ve ever “thumbed up” in your history of being a Pandora user. For folks who might not have used Pandora much in years (since migrating to Spotify, say), you also get a playlist of everything you’ve liked on the service going back perhaps a decade. Of course, by “thumbing” songs, you give Pandora more data on your listening habits, which feeds back into its algorithms. That virtuous cycle should improve Pandora’s recommendations even more in the months ahead. In general, Pandora’s focus on playlists is smart. By creating playlists for you and making it easy to build onto existing playlists, the service makes building a library less of a chore. That, too, is appealing to people who’ve never tried an on-demand streaming service before. If Pandora were starting on equal footing with Apple Music and Spotify, all these positives could push the service to the top of the pack. But here’s where being late becomes painful for Pandora, and possibly fatal: It’s still hard to justify leaving a service like Spotify where you’ve spent years creating and perfecting your own library. But if you’ve never used Spotify or Apple Music, start with Pandora Premium. The personalized recommendations are lightyears ahead of what you’ll get from Apple Music and comparable to what you’ll find on Spotify -- and it has by far the cleanest design and easiest interface of the bunch.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Investigation launched after fatal crash on Monday Tuesday Apr 18, 2017 at 4:46 PM Apr 18, 2017 at 7:28 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — Authorities are continuing to investigate a crash that left a 65-year-old Apple Valley man dead on Monday afternoon. Kirpal Singh Dhaliwa lost his life in the crash, which occurred just after noon Monday in the Jess Ranch shopping center. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials said Dhaliwa was struck by a woman in a 2001 Ford Explorer at the intersection of Jess Ranch Parkway and Town Center Drive. The woman, identified as Shelly Tucker, 47, of Apple Valley, was headed south on Jess Ranch Parkway and was attempting to turn left on Town Center Drive. She did not see Dhaliwa and was unable to avoid striking him with her vehicle, officials said. Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station deputies responded and found Dhaliwa in the roadway with a head injury. Officials said he was taken to Desert Valley Hospital before being airlifted to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center for treatment, where he later succumbed to his injuries. Due to the investigation, Town Center Drive was shut down in both directions between Jess Ranch Parkway and Apple Valley Road on Tuesday afternoon. A portion of Jess Ranch Parkway between the Cinemark theater and Town Center Drive was also shut down in both directions. The closures were expected to last until 8 p.m. Tuesday and motorists were asked to avoid the area. The crash remains under investigation by the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station Major Accident Investigation Team (MAIT).

According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), the state has issued a permit to Apple. Additionally, as of April 14, 2017, Apple is the most recent recipient of such a permit. California has granted self-driving testing permits to the following companies (via Business Insider): Volkswagen Group of America Mercedes Benz Google Delphi Automotive Tesla Motors Bosch Nissan GM Cruise LLC BMW Honda Ford Zoox, Inc. Drive.ai, Inc. Faraday & Future Inc. Baidu USA LLC Wheego Electric Cars Inc. Valeo North America, Inc. NextEV USA, Inc. Telenav, Inc. NVIDIA Corporation AutoX Technologies Inc Subaru Udacity, Inc Navya Inc. Renovo Motors Inc UATC LLC (Uber) PlusAi Inc Nuro, Inc CarOne LLC Apple Inc. Apple has long been rumored to be working on an autonomous electric vehicle under the moniker "Project Titan," though it had previously been rumored that the project was facing difficulties. While none of this means that Apple absolutely will manufacture a self-driving car, it does tell us, conclusively that they have been working on the technology. After all, on of the requirements for receiving this permit is that manufacturers have tested their self-driving vehicle on a closed course in simulated traffic conditions. Whether this means that Apple will offer its own car to the public at some point or is creating a system to be used by other manufacturers remains to be seen.

Though the apps were previously provided for free for those who’d bought a new device, now it’s available for free to anyone who might be running an Apple OS. So yeah, it’s not a change that will affect the average user who has bought a Mac recently – Apple made these apps free for new devices back in 2013. Still, it’s a nifty change for those with older computers, as well as schools and businesses who might want to download multiple copies of the software – not to mention those with a Hackinstosh.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Related iPhone 8 design will be challenging for Apple to pull off iPhone 8 price may be cheaper than you think iPhone 8 will feature a curved OLED display Video Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks The iPhone 8 release date may be delayed until November of 2017, according to a new report from Bloomberg. Echoing similar reports we've seen sprout up over the past few months, the report relays that Apple's 2017 iPhone lineup will showcase three brand new devices. Of course, there will be revamped iPhones in the form of a new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. But without question, the main attraction in Apple's upcoming iPhone lineup will be its 5.8-inch iPhone 8 that will likely wow users with an edge-to-edge OLED display. As tends to be the case, tremendous mobile innovations aren't always straight-forward affairs, which is to say that Apple is seemingly encountering a few roadblocks in its effort to get the iPhone 8 ready for production. As we highlighted not too long ago, Apple is seeing low yields on the iPhone 8 display, likely due to its desire to embed the home button and the Touch ID sensor into the display itself. While other companies like Samsung have sleek looking edgeless displays, the iPhone 8 will perhaps be the only flagship device with an advanced fingerprint recognition sensor embedded right into the display. Additionally, we've also seen indications that Apple's component suppliers -- namely those set to provide the iPhone 8 with advanced 3D camera sensors -- will need a bit more time to ramp up supply ahead of what some analysts anticipate will be the mother of all iPhone upgrades. Taken together, it's perhaps not surprising to see Mark Gurman of Bloomberg -- who has a stellar record with respect to Apple rumors -- relay that the highly anticipated iPhone 8 release may not happen "until one or two months after the typical fall introduction." What remains to be seen, though, is if Apple will release its pair of iPhone 7s models in September as planned. Presumably this is the case, but one can only imagine that the allure of a newfangled iPhone 8 may detrimentally impact iPhone 7s sales during the September to November timeframe. Hopefully, the iPhone 8 won't be subject to too long of a delay because a) iPhone fans have been waiting years for a redesign and b) Samsung's recently unveiled S8 smartphone lineup has seemingly garnered a lot of praise from early reviewers. As for what's going on in Apple's labs as we speak, the report relays that Apple is currently testing multiple devices, though we can only hope that previously leaked reports of Apple moving the Touch ID sensor to the back of the device are outdated at this point. Given Apple's history, I'd venture to say that Apple will not release an iPhone 8 until it manages to figure out a way to seamlessly embed the Touch ID sensor into the display itself, as has been rumored for quite some time. As for the overall design, the iPhone 8 will likely be comprised of stainless steel and slightly curved glass. Notably, the iPhone 8 display will curve to a much smaller degree relative to Samsung's Galaxy S8 devices. Further, more recent leaks claim that the iPhone 8 will feature 4mm bezels all around the device, thereby packing a display about the size of the gargantuan iPhone 7 Plus into a device the size of the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. As for other features, the iPhone 8 will reportedly feature a dual camera system integrated vertically for VR and AR purposes. Additionally, the iPhone 8 may introduce new facial recognition and augmented reality features, not to mention faster hardware, more RAM (to the tune of 3GB), improved water and dust resistance, and last but not least, wireless charging functionality. All in all, the iPhone 8 is arguably the most anticipated iPhone since the original was introduced nearly 10 years ago. Now, the only question is if Apple can release the device in September per usual. Join the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is testing an iPhone model with a touchscreen covering the entire front of the device. The report also says while the screen is larger than the iPhone 7 Plus, the overall size of the smartphone is similar to an iPhone 7. The upgraded, higher-end model of the iPhone will also feature more advanced cameras and stainless steel components, says the report. It's one of three iPhones Apple is expected to unveil this fall. Other models of the device could include a curved display. Apple declined to comment on the report. Since first launching in 2007, the iPhone has become Apple's signature device, and this year's launch could mark a rebound in sales after a slump last year. In January, Apple reported posting strong sales of the iPhone in the first quarter, ending a three-quarter streak of declining shipments. That should improve once Apple rolls out its anniversary editions of the iPhone later this year.

But, at present, things are getting a bit long in the tooth, with the design and more recently the specifications of its latest offerings not providing enough to fulfill some users' needs. Now, this isn't saying that they are hurting when it comes to sales, but users have slowly started to recognize potentially better options from some of Apple's largest competitors. Despite lagging with its desktops, Apple has publicly stated that they are committed and have great desktops on their roadmap. Earlier in the month, we reported that an iMac Pro could make its debut later in the year. Now, we are getting more information about this and other desktop products that could be coming soon. According toDIGITIMES, the new iMac Pro could arrive with "Intel's Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, 16-64GB ECC RAM, up to 2TB NVMe SSD and the latest discrete graphics card". While this all sounds impressive, the competition has certainly not been resting on their laurels, and it could still be a tough fight for Apple to regain consumer confidence. It remains to be seen if a new iMac Pro, should one be released, will be able to take the reins and enable the retirement of the aging Mac Pro. Although Apple has apologized for the disappointment, it won't really mean much until the firm rectifies the issue.

It turns out Apple can can also be hurt by the interconnected supply chain.There is evidence of a little Apple trap in a recent Bloomberg News colleagues’ article about expectations for the next iPhone models. On tap starting this spring will be a shift from two new versions of the iPhone to three. The two expected in Apple’s typical September launch window will be updated versions of the iPhone 7 and its larger-screen sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link A rendering of the new iPhone design by 3D artist Martin Hajek. Photo: www.martinhajek.com The big deal for this year – the 10th anniversary of the iPhone – is a drastically different new phone with a more vibrant type of screen and extra real estate thanks to slimmer frames around the edges. Wall Street has already grown excited that this reimagined iPhone will set off a rush of people splurging for a cool new iPhone with a big ticket price.Oh, but wait. Literally. Related Content iPhone ‘error 53′: Apple taken to court by consumer watchdog Apple update smooths things out for iPhone users The cool new iPhone may not be on sale in September because of hiccups in obtaining enough key components, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. The most visible is a different type of screen – known as organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, display – that allows for a thinner, sharper-looking screens without hogging too much battery life. It gives Apple the technology it needs to make a phone that is essentially all screen.Apple, at least initially, will be depending solely on the leading maker of OLED displays, Samsung Display Co. You know who already has a new smartphone with the same type of screen? That would be Samsung Electronics Ltd. Advertisement Yep. Samsung is one of Apple’s most important suppliers and one of its most bitter rivals. Much has been written about the peril of suppliers relying on Apple for their livelihood. Well, there’s also a risk to Apple from depending on its suppliers.I’m not saying Samsung is doing this deliberately, but the smartphone-making part of Samsung apparently has a sufficient supply of OLED scr… Post navigation Adidas apologises for tone deaf Boston Marathon email To the lawyer who saved my family from our abusive dad: thank you Search for: Recent Posts Alia Bhatt or Anushka Sharma: Who wore Masaba Gupta’s denim-on-denim better?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Apple Stock Price Targets Keep Rising: Why I’m Thinking About Selling In late January, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) blew past analysts’ earnings estimates for the first quarter of its 2017 fiscal year, lifted by strong sales of the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple stock surged in response. The stock had been trading around $120 before the earnings report, but it moved steadily upwards toward $140 during February. For the past month, Apple shares have remained in a $140 to $145 trading range, up more than 20% year to date. Apple Stock YTD Performance, data by YCharts . These share price gains have been helped along by numerous analyst upgrades and price target increases. This optimism could indicate that investors are finally giving Apple credit for its long-term growth prospects. But it could also mark the beginning of a new bubble in Apple stock. As a result, I have already sold a small portion of my Apple shares — and I’m thinking about selling more. Here are three key reasons why Apple stock’s gains may not last. What comes after the iPhone 8? Notwithstanding their overall bullishness, analysts may still be underestimating the potential sales lift Apple will get from its next flagship iPhone (possibly called the iPhone 8). Most pundits agree that Apple is making significant design changes this year, in honor of the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. This could spark a big replacement cycle among loyal iPhone users, similar to what Apple saw after releasing the iPhone 6 in late 2014. Moreover, the iPhone installed base has grown significantly since 2014. The iPhone 8 is also likely to become a status symbol in China , driving strong sales there. The problem for Apple is figuring out what comes next. Assuming that there is sufficient supply, the iPhone 8 should be able to drive strong revenue and earnings growth at Apple beginning this fall and continuing throughout 2018. But by 2019, sales could be slumping again, in line with Apple’s 2016 performance. iPhone sales are likely to surge next year, but the gains may not be sustainable. Image source: Apple. With each successive iPhone product cycle, growth will be harder to come by, due to slower smartphone market growth, longer replacement cycles, and competition from brands that offer more affordable flagship phones. In the long run, Apple faces the risk that its iPhone cash cow will be disrupted by new technology. Thus, investors probably shouldn’t count on the iPhone to be a long-term earnings growth driver beyond 2018. Is Apple’s services profitability sustainable? Most Wall Street analysts recognize that iPhone sales won’t keep growing forever. Furthermore, due to Apple’s massive size, it’s hard for any new products to move the needle. That’s why many analysts are counting on Apple’s services business to drive the company’s future growth — and send Apple stock to new heights. Apple has set out an ambitious goal of doubling its services revenue to around $50 billion over the next four years. This may be achievable, especially if Apple is able to launch a long-rumored subscription video service. However, analysts may be overestimating the long-term profitability of Apple’s services business. Today, the services segment may earn gross margins as high as 70%. However, the new (and relatively fast growing) Apple Music service has a much lower gross margin. The same would almost certainly be true of any Apple subscription video offering. Even the App Store — which currently produces the biggest chunk of Apple’s services revenue and profit — isn’t a silver bullet. Apple appears to have reduced its cut of certain App Store sales late last year, which could negatively impact App Store revenue growth and profitability. The bottom line is that while services growth should provide a meaningful amount of revenue growth in the coming years, the services segment’s profit margin may decline. This will limit the impact on Apple’s earnings. Will tax reform happen — and what will it look like? A third risk is that meaningful corporate tax reform may not occur. A few months ago, it seemed all but certain that the U.S. would significantly reduce or abolish its tax on repatriated foreign earnings. This would encourage Apple to repatriate more than $200 billion of foreign cash, paving the way for a big special dividend, massive share buybacks, or transformative acquisitions. However, Republican infighting has scuttled attempts at healthcare reform thus far. This raises big questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to implement other parts of his agenda, including tax reform. Even if tax reform does get passed eventually, the benefit to Apple will depend on the exact terms and tax rate that would be applicable. Furthermore, it’s not clear how aggressive Apple would be about returning repatriated cash to shareholders. Lastly, the recent run-up in Apple’s stock price means the company wouldn’t be able to buy back as many shares even if it is able to repatriate lots of cash. I still believe that Apple has a bright future. But analysts may be overestimating its post-2018 earnings growth potential. If Apple stock continues rallying in the weeks and months ahead, I plan to trim my holdings further. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Tech Roundup: QCOM Answers Apple, GOOGL Answers DoL, WDC Objects Shutterstock photo Last week saw Qualcomm QCOM filing counterclaims against Apple AAPL in their ongoing patent-related lawsuit, Alphabet GOOGL defending itself against gender inequality allegations by the Labor Department, Western Digital WDC objecting to Toshiba’s chip unit sale to Broadcom AVGO and much more. So let’s jump to the details- Qualcomm Replies to Apple In counterclaims filed in a California Federal court, Qualcomm has indicated that Apple is playing needlessly dirty in an attempt to keep costs down. The point of contention, as has often been in the past, is standard essential patents (SEPs), on the basis of which much of modern day telecommunications takes place. The companies that contributed technology to form the standard are required to license the technology to others on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. But what constitutes FRAND has been debated about a lot because companies offering this technology obviously want to be paid more, especially from companies like Apple that make super normal profits. While on the other hand, the companies that license want to point to all their other innovations built on top of the standards and argue that the standards are just a very small part of the end product and so don’t deserve a good price.  Qualcomm’s complaints are mainly about Apple failing to engage in good faith negotiations over its 3G and 4G patents while also seeking to use both these and its 5G technology at a fraction of the cost that other smartphone vendors are apparently willing to pay. „Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well-established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm” reads the complaint. It also says that Apple made „false statements” to the Korean FTC and encouraged Samsung to go after it to force Qualcomm to change its licensing model. The KFTC investigation ultimately led to an $865 million fine on Qualcomm. Note that Apple doesn’t use Qualcomm technology directly but through its manufacturing partners, which have licensing deals with Qualcomm, some going back to before Apple started using its technology. If Apple withholds payments to its partners they might hold out on payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm may be able to get its agreements enforced in court but it leads to unnecessary and wasteful litigation on multiple levels. This is exactly what Apple is doing according to Qualcomm. Qualcomm further says that Apple „acted to prevent Qualcomm from revealing to consumers the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel’s chipsets” and later falsely claimed that there was „no discernible difference.” Google’s Fight with the Labor Department The U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) has made a sweeping statement that it had „found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce” and DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper said the agency had received „compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” In a detailed response to the allegation, Google’s VP of people operations, Eileen Naughton said that the claims had been made „without any supporting data or methodology.” She also explained the salary analysis system Google currently employs: „Each year, we suggest an amount for every employee’s new compensation (consisting of base salary, bonus and equity) based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings…The analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees’ gender data. An employee’s manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale.” The model then measures individual salary calculations against those received by their peers which is done to eliminate „statistically significant differences between men’s and women’s compensation”. Naughton also said that Google’s methodology is available to other businesses if they want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay. This has been going on since Sep 2016, after which a case was filed in January, asking for its compensation data. Things came to a head after Google failed to comply with a routine audit. Western Digital Objects Toshiba is under pressure to sell its memory chip business after accounting irregularities related to its Westinghouse nuclear project put it into financial trouble. But Western Digital, which recently acquired SanDisk, is in a JV with Toshiba and has also invested billions of dollars in that business. WDC says that Toshiba didn’t have the legal right to split the chip business and it also deserves prior and confidential negotiating rights in case of its sale as a result of this agreement. It also objects to a sale to Broadcom, despite it being the highest bidder because of unsavory dealings with that company.

This was the 10 th straight quarter of PC shipment declines. Business PCs did better than consumer PCs as expected. The spoilers remain largely the same: shift to mobile devices and emerging markets, and a longer replacement cycle.

The BIS reportedly says that this phone will be different from international versions. Apple recently discounted the 4-inch phone to Rs. 19,999, which is expected to help it gain share in the mid-range market. Wistron-owned ICT Service Management Solutions, based in Yeshwantpur, Benguluru has been commissioned for the manufacturing. MKM Optimistic on Alibaba Cloud Growth : MKM analysts have issued a highly optimistic report about Alibaba’s BABA cloud business. They estimate that the business could be worth $20 billion today with the potential to grow to a $65-70 billion valuation over the next 4-5 years. The optimism is driven by data supplied by the analysts: 60K developers are working on the platform, AliCloud has 765K paying customers (up 100% year over year), it has 2.8 million total customers; after large enterprises, which use state-owned infrastructure, AliCloud is the largest private player with 70 of the largest 100 startups using its services. Also, Alibaba has been investing in the business for the past eight years, which is reportedly three years short of Amazon and four years longer than Alphabet’s Google. New Technology/Products AMD Ryzen 5 Release : AMD started selling its Zen-based Ryzen 5 processors (four core/eight thread and six core/twelve thread) into the channel some time back and now, these products are available to consumers. The processors reportedly compare well with Intel’s Kaby Lake-based i5 chips (four core/four thread) going by the considerable number of reviews comparing the two. As may be expected, Intel’s chip is more expensive when you consider the fact that it has fewer threads and cores, but single-core performance is better. On a net basis, while AMD still lags Intel slightly on performance, it’s packing in more compute power at lower costs that is likely to go down well with consumers. Gamers are the biggest drivers of consumer PC sales right now so both Intel and AMD have their work cut out.  Microsoft Tools for Hybrid Cloud Migration : Microsoft MSFT has come out with three new tools that in very broad terms, will help enterprises evaluate the savings generated from moving corporate workloads to Azure, the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit in the Azure Management Portal that can save them up to 40% on their Windows server licenses and Azure Site Recovery to facilitate the process of migrating virtual machines to Azure. Microsoft is en route to delivering annualized commercial cloud revenue of $20 billion by 2018 and its pace of growth indicates that the once unreal target is now within reach. Microsoft Launching Minecraft Marketplace : The Minecraft development team apparently can’t keep up with the demand for customizations and levels and so it’s getting on board independent developers that will supply these and other customizations through the in-game store. The good thing for developers is that Minecraft maker Mojang, now owned by Microsoft is willing to pay out 50% of what the creation generates, with 30% going to Apple, Google, or Microsoft’s app stores and itself retaining the rest. Minecraft is an insanely popular title, having sold 121 million copies worldwide, with 55 million unique monthly players (figures from Microsoft). As of now, nine businesses have been approved for selling feature packs with prices ranging from $1-10 per creation. Microsoft will sell Minecraft Coins that can be used to buy items.  Microsoft intends to eventually make the purchases sync across devices and platforms. Microsoft Ends Support for Vista : Microsoft has officially withdrawn support to its unsuccessful Windows Vista launched in 2009. While some people did buy systems based on the OS, most were dissatisfied and what’s more, Vista was the reason that most XP users simply refused to move on. All that is well behind us and both Windows 7 and Windows 10 have been received well. Microsoft says, Windows Vista users „will no longer receive new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content updates from Microsoft.” So that ends the matter. Google Home Services, Food Delivery App for India : Google has launched an app called Aero in Bengaluru and Mumbai, India that will allow people to connect with home service providers like plumbers, electricians and the like. It will also allow users to search for nearby restaurants and schedule food delivery. M&A and Collaborations Microsoft, eBay, Tencent Invest in India’s Flipkart : Microsoft, eBay and China’s Tencent joined earlier investors Naspers Group, Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners and DST Global for a share in Flipkart, India’s largest ecommerce company. The three companies together invested $1.4 billion. Ebay sold its Indian operations to Flipkart and added $500 million for its share in the company. The company is now valued at $11.6 billion. Microsoft Buys Deis : Microsoft spent an undisclosed amount of money to buy San Francisco-based software startup Deis that was reportedly acquired by Engine Yard back in 2015. The startup has developed an open source tool based on the Kubernetes container management system that Google developed and then open sourced. Microsoft initially agreed to work with Google on Kubernetes back in 2014 but also backed competing platforms Mesos and Docker Swarm. But Kubernetes has gained ground so in February, Kubernetes became available on the Azure Container service as well. The reason this is all so significant is because containerization is extremely important for information stored in the cloud since it creates a virtual box of code that can be shared and moved between applications and across clouds as needed. „At Microsoft, we’ve seen explosive growth in both interest and deployment of containerized workloads on Azure, and we’re committed to ensuring Azure is the best place to run them,” Scott Guthrie, EVP cloud and enterprise group at Microsoft wrote in a blog post. Google to Invest In LG Display : South Korea’s Electronic Times has reported that Google has offered to pay LG Display up to $880 million (one trillion KRW) as its contribution toward a production line for flexible OLED panels for use in second-generation Pixel phones. LG is considering the offer. Google’s Pixel, which has the appearance and features of a premium device and has been marketed as such, will fall back in the race with Samsung and Apple on features if it doesn’t get some OLED screens of its own. So Google’s needs are clear: it also doesn’t need to get into a deal with Samsung, which uses OLED in its own phones and is also in an agreement to supply to Apple. So it’s trying to find another supplier.  Some Numbers Facebook Announces Monthly Advertisers : Facebook FB has announced that the number of advertisers on its platform has grown from 4 million to 5 million between September and now. Businesses with mobile pages now total 65 million while businesses with Instagram profiles are up to 8 million. Among the 5 million advertisers, the biggest industries are e-commerce, entertainment/media and retail. Unsurprisingly, around 75% percent of advertisers are in its fastest-growing markets, which are India, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Nearly 50% of advertisers create ads on mobile devices. Facebook Messenger Users : Facebook Messenger, which the company spun out in 2014 and then enhanced with games, a chat bot platform, voice calling, video calling, as well as a revamped camera with masks, frames, stickers and effects now has 1.2 million users. That’s up from 700 million users when it was spun out and 600 million users on the hot Facebook-owned platform Instagram. Sell These Stocks.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Credit Suisse Thinks Apple Can Hit Its Services Target, Ups Price Target to $170 Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has its work cut out for it if it hopes to hit its ambitious self-imposed goal of doubling its services business in four years. It can certainly be done, especially now that growing services revenue is a high priority at the company, but it won’t be easy. Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha has now put out a research note (via Tech Trader Daily ), and he thinks Apple will be able to reach its goal — and then some. Garcha is reiterating his outperform rating on Apple shares while boosting his price target from $160 to $170. TV may be an important aspect of growing Apple’s services revenue. Image source: Apple. Services are super profitable It’s probably intuitively obvious, but Apple’s services revenue is extremely profitable compared to its hardware-related revenue. Garcha estimates that the services business enjoys a gross margin of around 70%, compared to Apple’s corporate average of around 39%. To the extent that Apple can grow this profitable segment, Apple’s consolidated gross margin could potentially rise above 40%. Apple occasionally posts gross margin higher than 40%, but this is often a function of commodity pricing in component markets, which are inherently volatile and out of Apple’s control. Installed base growth is critical to the services business, and Garcha estimates that the installed base will grow from roughly 1 billion active devices currently to 1.5 billion active devices by 2020. The iPhone should expectedly drive most of that installed base growth as Apple’s most popular product. Combined with a growing number of active devices, average spending per user is expected to rise from approximately $68 in 2015 to around $135 by 2020 — effectively twice as much spending. Apple Pay, Apple Music, and iCloud should really help drive this increase in user spending. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before There’s been renewed debate regarding a blockbuster content-related acquisition, and Garcha brings up a familiar idea: Apple should acquire Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) . That would fill an important „strategic gap” with Apple’s TV offerings, and the analyst believes that buying Netflix is more compelling than alternative candidates like Time Warner Inc. or Disney (NYSE: DIS) . However, the analyst confusingly says that a Disney deal seems unlikely „given Disney’s expensive valuation currently.” Disney may be about three times as expensive as Netflix in absolute dollars, as measured by market cap, but it’s significantly cheaper in terms of earnings power. As a mature media conglomerate, Disney trades at 20.6 times earnings; as a video streamer in high-growth mode, Netflix trades at 333 times earnings. Beyond valuation concerns, there are operational ones. Apple could conceivably want Disney’s media assets, but there’s absolutely no way that Apple has any interest in operating resorts and theme parks, which are a key part of Disney’s business and one of the most powerful ways that it monetizes its franchises. Netflix would be much easier to integrate as a services-only complement. As usual, the biggest concern is the price. Netflix is worth roughly $60 billion right now before factoring in any type of offer premium, which would represent Apple’s largest acquisition ever by a factor of 20. And $60 billion is an awful lot of money — more than Apple holds domestically (if the theoretical deal were to be structured in cash). A giant acquisition of this nature would make it easier to double services revenue, but Apple could probably pull it off organically, which would be far preferable in terms of capital efficiency. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple ‘Almost Certainly’ Exploring The Idea Of Making A Whole Car By Tyler Lee on 04/18/2017 18:04 PDT Back in 2016 we heard a report that suggested that Apple had apparently given up on building its own car. Instead it was suggested that the company could be looking at developing software for cars, and a recent permit granted by the California DMV has suggested that Apple’s car plans are still alive and well, although to what extent is unclear. However it seems that at least one analyst believes that Apple could still be toying with the idea of making a whole car. In a report from CNBC, they quote analyst Gene Munster who suggests that Apple is “almost certainly” exploring building its own car, but he notes that there are several hurdles that could prevent that from being made a reality. As noted on his blog, Munster writes, “Apple is almost certainly exploring how it could build an entire car, but as we learned the hard way with an Apple television, exploration does not mean a product comes to market.” However he adds that while Apple might succeed on the software side of things, finding a manufacturing partner would be something Apple needs to do. Munster also notes that the typical design process of an automotive is 5-7 years, meaning that Apple could be very far behind the likes of companies such as Tesla and Google who have had years on Apple in the self-driving/electric car department, so until then maybe don’t get your hopes up just yet.

The dossier, assembled by Former British spy Christopher Steele, has also been cited by FBI Director James Comey in some of his briefings to members of Congress in recent weeks, as one of the sources of information the bureau has used to bolster its investigation. This includes approval from the secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor the communications of Carter Page. Last year, Page was identified by the Trump campaign as an adviser on national security. even if the application to monitor Page included information from the dossier, it would only be after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation. The dossier alleges that Page met senior Russian officials as an emissary of the Trump campaign, and discussed quid-pro-quo deals relating to sanctions, business opportunities and Russia's interference in the election. Page has denied meeting the officials named in the dossier and says he never cut any political deals with the Kremlin.

In what appears to be an unrelated move, Apple just made a whole host of productivity apps free. Get excited for Pages! (Borat voice: "Not!") Image: Gizmodo But seriously, this is not bad news. Apple's word processor (Pages), spreadsheet program (Numbers) and presentation software (Keynote) are all free to download for both macOS and iOS. GarageBand and iMovie are also free, if you're feeling creative. Many of these apps were free when they launched, and then Apple decided to charge people to use them. Now, they're free again. Life comes at you fast. Why Are You Still Using Microsoft Word? So you're still using Microsoft Word. Seems like an odd decision in the year 2017, but I didn't come here to judge. I'm legitimately curious why some people continue to pump their money into the MS Office Suite, despite mounting evidence that the software offers shitty security and a historically terrible user experience. So why bother? Read more Don't go starting a new word processing-based business quite yet, though. Apple's productivity apps are not exactly awesome. While Keynote earned praise early on for being a slight improvement over Microsoft PowerPoint, Pages and Number seem like good ol' college tries at replacements for MS Word and Excel — attempts that fall well short of coaxing Microsoft loyalists over to the Apple family. Meanwhile, GarageBand and iMovie are perfectly acceptable alternatives to applications like Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro. However, they're far from replacements if you're looking to do serious audio production or video editing. But hey, who can argue with free software? Google Docs has done a great job of winning over users who want to do some basic Office-type stuff without asking them to pay for it. The open-source LibreOffice suite also does a better job at serving as a Microsoft Office replacement without forcing people to pay money for the software. We also know that not everybody gets to pick and choose which productivity apps they use at work, since many companies offer MS Office and only MS Office. So you might be stuck with that. If you aren't stuck, try Apple's newly free again software. You might hate it, but it's hard to hate something that's free.

Samsung Galaxy S8: Australian Review Campbell Simpson 19 Apr 2017 11:00 AM The Samsung Galaxy S8 is Samsung's first big phone launch after last year's Note7 disaster. It's a huge moment for the world's most popular smartphone manufacturer. For a lot of everyday smartphone buyers -- the talkback radio listeners and tabloid newspaper readers of the world -- Samsung is a tarnished name. The Galaxy S8 is the first, and potentially only, chance for the company to change that opinion. Thankfully, the Galaxy S8 and plus-sized S8+ are absolutely brilliant smartphones. They're not without their flaws, but in everything from industrial design to internal hardware to software refinement, Samsung has knocked this one out of the park. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Future iPhones Could Stop Bundling Headphone Jack Adapters By Tyler Lee on 04/18/2017 17:27 PDT When Apple decided to (controversially) remove the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus last year, they did make it a bit easier for customers by including a headphone jack adapter for the Lightning port on the iPhone. This meant that users with wired headphones could still plug their devices into the iPhone. However it seems that in the future Apple may stop bundling these headphone jack adapters with the iPhone. In a note to investors obtained by MacRumors, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis has indicated his belief that iPhone models from 2018 onwards could no longer include the accessory with the phone. “We believe it stays this year but goes away at some point, potentially in the 2018 model.” In a way it makes sense because we can only imagine that Apple is counting on more headphones either going wireless or using Lightning as its connector of choice. In fact last when Apple introduced the new iPhones, several headphone makers came forward and appeared to be unfazed by Apple’s decision. In any case should Apple eventually decide to ditch bundling the accessory, we expect that they could continue to be sold separately where you could by them at $9 each. However with more headphones going wireless these days, perhaps you’ll find one that you like by then, but until that happens take this report with a grain of salt for now.

About US Contact US Registration Tuesday April 18th, 2017 Languages English French Language German Language Italian Language Portuguese Language Spanish Language Latest Intel MIL Analysis-Reportage Apple TV censors “China Uncensored” show By Foreign Affairs Publisher  /  April 19, 2017  /  Comments Off on Apple TV censors “China Uncensored” show       Print       Email MIL OSI NGO – Source: Reporters Without Borders – Headline: Apple TV censors “China Uncensored” show Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemns Apple’s blocking of the satirical Web TV show China Uncensored not only in Mainland China but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Apple’s extension of its blocking to territories not subject to Chinese law is a dangerous example of international corporate submission to the demands of Chinese censorship. The consumer electronics giant seems to have had no hesitation about making generous concessions to China’s authoritarian regime in order to keep itself afloat in the Chinese market. That at least is the impression one gets from its decision last month to make China Uncensored available on the Apple TV app everywhere except China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. China Uncensored, which can also be seen on YouTube, openly sets out to combat Chinese propaganda. It mocks the regime, carries news about dissidents and persecuted minorities and is produced by New York-based New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD.TV), which is affiliated to the Falun Gong, a religious movement that is persecuted in China. [embedded content] Is Apple scared of the Chinese authorities? “We vehemently condemn this unacceptable act of censorship and we are alarmed by the apparent insouciance with which Apple, one of the giants of online programme distribution, seems ready to sacrifice freedom of information for the sake of its market share”, said Cédric Alviani, the head of RSF’s Taipei bureau, which covers Northern Asia. China is Apple’s second biggest market, after the United States and before Europe. But it is a market in which nothing can be taken for granted. Last year, Apple suffered a major fall in its sales and in its share of the Chinese market to its Chinese rivals. Is Apple trying to ingratiate itself with the Chinese authorities in the wake of these setbacks? Apple has already made a habit of withdrawing certain apps from the Apple Store in China on the grounds of complying with local law. But this is new. This time Apple is taking its self-censorship much further, and including territories not subject to Chinese law. Chinese censorship on the rise Content blocking in response to a formal request from the Chinese government is unfortunately not new. Apple removed the New York Times app from the Apple Store in China last January, but the app remained available in its Hong Kong and Taiwan stories. Chris Chappell, China Uncensored’s host, said: “I totally understand why we’re blocked in Mainland China. We’re clearly disrupting the Communist Party’s harmonious propaganda…but Hong Kong and Taiwan are not supposed to be under Chinese law.” Although China recovered sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, the territory has Special Administrative Region status which explicitly guarantees freedom of expression. Although China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, it has functioned in practice as a sovereign state known as the Republic of China for half a century. “Taiwan and Hong Kong represent two alternative models of Chinese-culture societies, ones with a well-established tradition of freedom of expression,” Alviani added. “Blocking a Web TV show critical of Mainland Chinese propaganda in these territories is no small matter.” An accommodating attitude that could spread RSF condemns Apple’s subservience to the Chinese regime, which could encourage other international content providers to censor themselves in exchange for commercial advantages from the Chinese authorities. The behaviour of Apple, which has its headquarters in Cupertino, California, is all the more incomprehensible because it is one of the world’s most powerful multinationals, one that made more than 46 billion dollars in profit last year alone. When contacted by RSF, Apple declined to comment. “We do not issue statements in response to this kind of information,” a spokesperson said. Censoring content and blocking freedom of information is obviously not the best kind of public relations. China continues to be ranked almost at the bottom of RSF’s World Press Freedom Index (176th out of 180 countries), while Taiwan and Hong Kong are ranked 51st and 69th respectively.

Business Technology Will Qualcomm's earnings shed light on fallout from Apple lawsuit? Qualcomm reports fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday, with Apple lawsuit possibly looming large over its results Union-Tribune file photo Qualcomm reports fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday, with the potential fallout from the Apple legal dispute likely to get the most attention from analysts. Qualcomm reports fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday, with the potential fallout from the Apple legal dispute likely to get the most attention from analysts. (Union-Tribune file photo) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Qualcomm reports quarterly earnings after markets close on Wednesday, which could shed light on the financial impact of its festering patent royalties lawsuit with Apple. Wall Street analysts say they’ll be looking for more details after Qualcomm revealed last week that patent royalty payments aren’t being paid by some overseas contract manufacturers that build iPhones for Apple. The amount of the shortfall was redacted from a countersuit that Qualcomm filed against Apple on April 10. But it could become somewhat clearer when the San Diego wireless giant reports licensing revenue for the quarter ending in March and forecasts what it expects for the current quarter ending June 30. “For what it’s worth, we believe Apple could account for as much as a third of Qualcomm’s royalty business, likely $2 billion-plus annually,” said Bernstein Research Analyst Stacy Rasgon in a report titled “Can a bad apple really spoil the barrel?” In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, claiming that it was charging too much for patent licenses for its core technology that links smartphones and cellular networks. Apple’s legal action came after anti-trust regulators in South Korea and the U.S. challenged Qualcomm patent licensing business. Apple also claims Qualcomm is withholding nearly $1 billion in royalty “rebates” because Apple cooperated with regulators. Last week, Qualcomm countersued, denying Apple’s allegations and making business interference claims of its own. Among them is that some of Apple’s contract manufacturers – which are the entities that license Qualcomm’s patents – had stopping making royalty payments because they were no longer being reimbursed by Apple for Qualcomm royalties. Analysts on average expected Qualcomm to post revenue of $5.89 billion and earnings of $1.21 per share for the quarter, excluding certain charges. Market share gains in China, chip sales for the launch of Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and catchup royalty payments in China were driving the expected results. But that was before the news about some of Apple’s contract manufacturers withholding some payments. Tim Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co., estimated that withheld royalties could be as much as $700 million for the quarter ended March 31, or 32 cents per share. In the long run, Arcuri said Qualcomm “appears to have a strong case, and Apple’s record in winning similar litigation is poor.” Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, noted that in past patent spats with LG and others, Qualcomm has deferred recognizing royalty revenue from the company involved -- even when it had already received payment -- until a resolution was reached.. It could take the same stance with Apple, which appears to be ready for a long fight, Rasgon said. “The Apple dispute is likely to persist for a considerable amount of time given that Apple seemingly has little incentive to settle, and the vitriol between the two companies is intensifying,” he said.

Kirpal Singh Dhaliwa lost his life in the crash, which occurred just after noon Monday in the Jess Ranch shopping center. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials said Dhaliwa was struck by a woman in a 2001 Ford Explorer at the intersection of Jess Ranch Parkway and Town Center Drive. The woman, identified as Shelly Tucker, 47, of Apple Valley, was headed south on Jess Ranch Parkway and was attempting to turn left on Town Center Drive. She did not see Dhaliwa and was unable to avoid striking him with her vehicle, officials said. Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station deputies responded and found Dhaliwa in the roadway with a head injury. Officials said he was taken to Desert Valley Hospital before being airlifted to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center for treatment, where he later succumbed to his injuries. Due to the investigation, Town Center Drive was shut down in both directions between Jess Ranch Parkway and Apple Valley Road on Tuesday afternoon. A portion of Jess Ranch Parkway between the Cinemark theater and Town Center Drive was also shut down in both directions. The closures were expected to last until 8 p.m. Tuesday and motorists were asked to avoid the area. The crash remains under investigation by the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station Major Accident Investigation Team (MAIT).

Aside from some of the improvements that it has made to these apps, it has also made a big change rather quietly. The company has decided to make the aforementioned apps free for all macOS and iOS users. This eliminates the need to buy new Apple hardware to get these apps for free. Apple previously provided free copies of these apps to those who purchased new hardware. Free copies were included with a new Mac or iOS device. Now that the apps are free for everyone, users don’t have to buy new devices from Apple to get these apps for free. This obviously makes the apps available for free to those who are using an Apple device even if they’ve never bought a new one themselves or are using an older device. Now they too can use iWork, iMovie, and GarageBand on their devices without having to pay a lot of money for Apple’s software. Apple decided to bundle these apps for free in late 2013 with new iOS devices and Macs or offering them as free downloads to those who picked up new hardware. The iWork apps which include Pages, Keynote and Numbers were previously priced at $19.99 on Mac and $9.99 on iOS individually. iMovie and GarageBand cost $14.99 and $4.99 respectively on Mac and $4.99 on the App Store.

Author Carter Dotson Posted On2017-04-18 20:00:59 Watch App   News, Upcoming Games This April 20th is set to be quite the magical day on the App Store. The dankness will be out of control. Yes, Dan K. Buddinhash's special day, where we celebrate the best grade, good advice, green tea, chronic, and green badger. A day where we can all get geeked, chillin' on the moon. Here, you can see our very own Jared Nelson, an expert on the topic, showing how you should properly celebrate the special day of April 20th: via GIPHY Even Apple Store employees are going to get in on this magical green day with green shirts starting on April 20th. Earth Day's on April 22nd, sure, but for some reason the 20th seems like quite the dank day to start wearing those shirts. Some Earth Day promos have popped up elsewhere on iTunes, and Apple usually has a fatty prepared for Earth Day. In 2016, that meant a major featuring for apps and games that related to the Earth Day theme, or had special updates for Earth Day. It also meant that the app features for the next couple of weeks were pushed down, so there were fewer releases in that time frame, as getting a good feature is some true chronic, but not getting one is some real boogity brown. So if Apple isn't handing out that chess, don't take checkers. Though, for Warbits [$3.99], it worked out pretty well as the game got two weeks of Editor's Choice featuring out of the deal. That's some wizard stuff right there. Vignettes: Look, if there was anything that suggested that Apple wanted to make this a big day for developers, this is it. Because when I played this game at GDC, I knew it was gonna make Apple faded, just straight-up looking for water on Mars. It's a weird, magical game that's easy to play. There's no way this would get buried on April 20th. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel C.A.T.S.: Crash Arena Turbo Stars: ZeptoLab are obviously big-time App Store developers. Cut the Rope [$1.99] is also an obvious example of some fine green. ZeptoLab ain't releasing a game on April 20th without someone from Apple bugging out about them releasing a major new game on that date. It is a game about robots fighting, which seems very un-Earth-Day, but they are makeshift robots? Gotta recycle! Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Ms. Spell: It's another solid roguelike from Jason Pickering, who got a nice Apple feature when MicRogue [$1.99] came out. I'd be worried about this game of picking up papers and smoking enemies to get goofed by a big Earth Day feature, but...maybe not? Trailer Park Boys: Greasy Money: This one's set to release on the 20th, and it's made Eli get cheesecake-factoried at the idea that this slow-burn game is still a-light, despite Eastside bogarting it. But on April 20th, the Trialer Park Boys' game will make Eli and everyone else get monstertrucked. And who better than the developers of Pot Farm themselves to release such arathi onto the App Store on April 20th? Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Wiz Khalifa's Weed Farm: I don't even need to explain this one. Now, maybe we've been puffing a bit too much of the greenest of the goop, and this is all just shaping up to be a non-weak week. There's some other fine chess hitting the App Store that glorious day, like Terra Mystica, Digby Jump, Get Me Outta Here, Neogen Beatz, and Cosmo Race. But, much like that big indie promo, there were weird things and hints everywhere. And it seems like an especially fat week for all these games to be rolled up into, and it's got us all paranoid. Some vague hints of this being a prominent day for releases have been in the haze, too. Hmm. Now maybe Apple just wants to do another big Earth Day promotion, and April 20th is just coincidentally on that day. But last year, it felt like a lot of things were specifically trying to miss the Thursday before April 20th. This year, it feels like releases are especially aiming for the 20th in a way that they weren't in 2016 when the big Earth Day promo happened. Maybe Apple's going to give new apps the big featuring they need instead? Or maybe they're just clearing the field for Wiz Khalifa's Weed Farm, sure to be the game of the year.

Josh Smith09/12/2016 The iOS 10 update is here with a plethora of new features in a more compact download. The iOS 10 update will still take some time to download and install, so not all users should jump and start as soon as the iOS 10 release time arrives. With the iOS 10 update users get new Messages apps, shared iPhone notes, better control of read receipts and a ton of new Messages features. Check out what’s new in iOS 10 for more details. The iOS 10 update runs on most devices device currently running iOS 9, but not all. One question we hear every year with this major update, and that we are already hearing from readers is, ” How long will the iOS 10 update take to download and install?” How long will the iOS 10 update take to install? There is no single answer, but based on our experience with earlier updates we can help you figure out how much time you need to set aside to download and install iOS 10. If you try to download the iOS 9 update as soon as it is available, you will likely see longer download times, that will make the overall installation take longer. Waiting a few hours after the iOS 10 release time can drastically speed up the process. How Long Does the iOS 10 Update Take? Assuming Apple doesn’t run into server problems and you are on a fast Internet connection and you are prepared for the iOS 10 installation it could take as little as 30 minutes to install iOS 10, but that is variable, and it is a good idea to budget an hour. The table below outlines how long each step may take to complete as you work through the process of downloading and installing iOS 10. Task Time Sync (Optional) 5-45 minutes Backup and Transfer (Optional) 1-30 minutes iOS 10 Download 15 Minutes to Hours iOS 10 Update 15-30 Minutes Total iOS 10 Update Time 30 minutes to Hours The iOS 10 update will take longer during the first several hours of the iOS 10 release date as millions of users attempt to download and install the update. If you want to avoid the long download times, try installing iOS 10 later in the day or wait a day for faster speeds. Although the first two tasks are optional, we highly recommend a recent backup of your iPhone before you install iOS 10. The odds of a problem wiping out your phone are small, but it can still happen. With a recent iTunes or iCloud backup you won’t lose anything. Check out our guide to 10 things to do before installing iOS 10 for other tips about how to prepare and cut down on the time it takes to update once Apple starts the downloads. iOS 10 Download Times The iOS 10 download sizes vary from one device to the next, but you should expect to see a more manageable update than two years ago when Apple required massive amounts of storage. The iOS 10 update size is just 1.00GB on for many users although some may see a 1.79GB update. The iOS 10 update is not huge, but it will take a little while to download. In a best case scenario the iOS 10 download will take 15 minutes, but we saw the iOS 8 download times hit six hours as soon as the update was available. Many of these high iOS download times sped up, but if you attempt to download within the first hours of the release, expect to see some times longer than 15 minutes. iOS 10 Installation Time The iOS 10 installation should not take very long to complete. In most cases this will finish within 15 minutes or less. It’s a good idea to make sure you have longer if something goes wrong or in case it takes longer, but this is a safe bet. The iOS 10 installation will likely be faster than the iOS 10 download. When the iOS 10 install is taking place you cannot use the iPhone or iPad at all. Make sure you keep this in mind before you tap install, as you will be otherwise unable to make calls or send texts. During this process you can expect the iPhone or iPad to restart several times. Backup, Sync & Transfer Purchases The longest steps in the iOS 10 update are the housekeeping ones that many users avoid until a major update, or wish they already did when something goes wrong. [contextly_sidebar id=”2q0UCKuf0bZgbf8qG5BWp4zBiUiBhExE”] If you don’t use iCloud Backup, it is a good idea to make sure that you plug-in to your computer and perform a backup before installing iOS 10. If you have not done this in a while, expect to spend 15 to 30 minutes on this process. When you are connected you may also want to transfer purchases from your iPhone or iPad to iTunes. If you choose to do this they will restore back to your device if you need to restore from a backup, if you skip this step they will not. At the least we suggest a recent backup, since you can get your apps from the App Store again if you need to. You can see what’s new in iOS 10 in the video above and see more details about these new features and changes in the slides below that compare iOS 10 to iOS 9. What’s New in iOS 10.1 What's New in iOS 10.1   1 / 30 This is a list of what's new in iOS 10.1, including new features like Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus and a number of important fixes for the iPhone and iPad.      Camera and Photos       Introduces Portrait Camera for iPhone 7 Plus that creates a depth effect that keeps your subject sharp while creating a beautifully blurred background (beta) People names in the Photos app are saved in iCloud backups Improved the display of wide color gamut photos in the grid views of the Photos app Fixes an issue where opening the Camera app would show a blurred or flashing screen for some users Fixes an issue that caused Photos to quit for some users when turning on iCloud Photo Library Maps       Transit support for every major train, subway, ferry, and national bus line, as well as local bus systems for Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya Sign-based transit navigation including layouts of all underground structures and walkways that connect large transit stations Transit fare comparison when viewing alternative transit routes Messages       New option to replay bubble and full screen effects Messages effects can play with Reduce Motion enabled Fixes an issue that could lead to contact names appearing incorrectly in Messages Addresses an issue where Messages could open to a white screen Addresses an issue that could prevent the report junk option from displaying with unknown senders Fixes an issue where videos captured and sent in the Messages app could be missing audio Apple Watch       Adds distance and average pace to workout summaries in the Activity app for outdoor wheelchair run pace and outdoor wheelchair walk pace Fixes issues that may have prevented Music playlists from syncing to Apple Watch Addresses an issue that was preventing invitations and data to appear in Activity Sharing Fixes an issue that was allowing Activity Sharing to update over cellular when manually disabled Resolves an issue that was causing some third-party apps to crash when inputting text Other improvements and fixes       Improves Bluetooth connectivity with 3rd party accessories Improves AirPlay Mirroring performance when waking a device from sleep Fixes an issue where playback would not work for iTunes purchased content when the "Show iTunes Purchases" setting is turned off Fixes an issue where certain selfie apps and face filters used with the FaceTime HD Camera on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus did not display a live preview Fixes an issue in Health where individual strokes are converted to separate characters when using the Chinese handwriting keyboard Improves performance of sharing websites from Safari to Messages Fixes an issue in Safari that caused web previews in tab view to not display correctly Fixes an issue that caused certain Mail messages to be reformatted with very small text Fixes an issue that caused some HTML email to be formatted incorrectly Fixes an issue that in some cases caused the search field to disappear in Mail Fixes an issue that could prevent Today View Widgets from updating when launched Fixes an issue where Weather widget sometimes failed to load data Fixes an issue on iPhone 7 where Home Button click settings would not appear in search results Fixes an issue that prevented spam alert extensions from blocking calls Resolves an issue that could prevent alarm sounds from going off Fixes an issue where audio playback via Bluetooth would cause the Taptic engine to stop providing feedback for some users Resolves an issue preventing some users from restoring from iCloud Backup For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website:  https://support.apple.com/HT201222  Keep reading to check out the iOS 10 features and iOS 10.1 features that these updates offer.   1 / 30 28 Responses 09/16/2015 lucy w Reply HAHAHA be ready to give up your phone for hours and hours. ridiculous 10/15/2015 maestro77j Reply it is currently telling me 10 hours… i am upgrading from IOS 8.3 11/22/2015 Beth Reply It has neatly nearly been an hour since I updated my phone it’s taking the mick 11/23/2015 Trice Reply its been 4 hours and my phone is no where finished updating 12/15/2015 Steve Reply My iPad has been updating for 14 hours, and still not finished what a joke. 02/07/2016 Paul Reply Iphones are seriously a joke…..my wife has been in tears over this POS….we switched carriers and she lost half of our honeymoon pics….all of her contacts and this is all AFTER she did what apples no nothing customer service told her what to do!!!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Credit Suisse Thinks Apple Can Hit Its Services Target, Ups Price Target to $170 Welcome back, Netflix acquisition speculation. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 18, 2017 at 7:31PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has its work cut out for it if it hopes to hit its ambitious self-imposed goal of doubling its services business in four years. It can certainly be done, especially now that growing services revenue is a high priority at the company, but it won't be easy. Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha has now put out a research note (via Tech Trader Daily), and he thinks Apple will be able to reach its goal -- and then some. Garcha is reiterating his outperform rating on Apple shares while boosting his price target from $160 to $170. TV may be an important aspect of growing Apple's services revenue. Image source: Apple. Services are super profitable It's probably intuitively obvious, but Apple's services revenue is extremely profitable compared to its hardware-related revenue. Garcha estimates that the services business enjoys a gross margin of around 70%, compared to Apple's corporate average of around 39%. To the extent that Apple can grow this profitable segment, Apple's consolidated gross margin could potentially rise above 40%. Apple occasionally posts gross margin higher than 40%, but this is often a function of commodity pricing in component markets, which are inherently volatile and out of Apple's control. Installed base growth is critical to the services business, and Garcha estimates that the installed base will grow from roughly 1 billion active devices currently to 1.5 billion active devices by 2020. The iPhone should expectedly drive most of that installed base growth as Apple's most popular product. Combined with a growing number of active devices, average spending per user is expected to rise from approximately $68 in 2015 to around $135 by 2020 -- effectively twice as much spending. Apple Pay, Apple Music, and iCloud should really help drive this increase in user spending. Stop me if you've heard this one before There's been renewed debate regarding a blockbuster content-related acquisition, and Garcha brings up a familiar idea: Apple should acquire Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). That would fill an important "strategic gap" with Apple's TV offerings, and the analyst believes that buying Netflix is more compelling than alternative candidates like Time Warner Inc. or Disney (NYSE:DIS). However, the analyst confusingly says that a Disney deal seems unlikely "given Disney's expensive valuation currently." Disney may be about three times as expensive as Netflix in absolute dollars, as measured by market cap, but it's significantly cheaper in terms of earnings power. As a mature media conglomerate, Disney trades at 20.6 times earnings; as a video streamer in high-growth mode, Netflix trades at 333 times earnings. Beyond valuation concerns, there are operational ones. Apple could conceivably want Disney's media assets, but there's absolutely no way that Apple has any interest in operating resorts and theme parks, which are a key part of Disney's business and one of the most powerful ways that it monetizes its franchises. Netflix would be much easier to integrate as a services-only complement. As usual, the biggest concern is the price. Netflix is worth roughly $60 billion right now before factoring in any type of offer premium, which would represent Apple's largest acquisition ever by a factor of 20. And $60 billion is an awful lot of money -- more than Apple holds domestically (if the theoretical deal were to be structured in cash). A giant acquisition of this nature would make it easier to double services revenue, but Apple could probably pull it off organically, which would be far preferable in terms of capital efficiency.

(Reuters/Yuriko Nakao) Share Written by Josh Horwitz 7 hours ago A bidding war has emerged to purchase the best bit of Toshiba, the once-great Japanese tech giant that’s now on life support. As many as eight companies, from hardware players like Apple and Foxconn, to component makers like Western Digital, to software giants like Amazon and Google, have emerged as potential bidders willing to pay tens of billions of dollars for Toshiba’s chip unit, the only valuable part of the company. If Apple and Foxconn win the deal (the former is reportedly financing a bid from the latter), it would mark a major coup for the two companies. It would make the iPhone cheaper to produce, and therefore more profitable to sell. Yet the win would come at a cost for Japan, as the country would lose yet another one of its iconic technology giants to foreign competitors. (Toshiba, Apple, and Foxconn did not respond immediately to requests for comment, but Quartz will update this piece if they do.) Most consumers think of Toshiba as a maker of televisions or laptops. But the company’s most important product nowadays is NAND flash memory chips—a component in a number of electronic devices (including phones and laptops) that retains data when a device is powered off. Apple uses Toshiba NAND flash in the iPhone 7 and 7 plus according to iFixit, a site that examines the components inside popular phones. NAND a significant cost component in the iPhone. According to research firm IHS, the memory component of the iPhone 6 plus costs $22.50, making it one of the more expensive parts of the device. Last year, Foxconn’s acquisition of Japanese LCD screen maker Sharp marked a major coup for the Taiwanese assembler and Apple, its most important partner. Foxconn primarily oversees only the purchasing and assembly of the iPhone, rather than the actual manufacturing of its most important parts. By purchasing Sharp, Foxconn gained direct control of more of the iPhone’s components—and the priciest one to boot. Purchasing Toshiba’s NAND flash division will further increase Foxconn’s direct control of how it charges Apple for the parts it procures to make each phone. Meanwhile, if Apple goes in with Foxconn on the deal, it can ensure that it gets the best-in-class NAND flash for itself, forcing its competitors to wait to buy up the rest. Buy buying the unit, Apple and Foxconn would also be acquiring a solid business. Unlike Toshiba’s other divisions, its NAND flash division is relatively healthy. Sales have been steady over the past five years, and profits, while subject to boom-and-bust cycles typical of the memory industry, have been generally healthy despite a slump during the company’s fiscal year that ended in March 2016. The sale could put as much as $28 billion in Toshiba’s coffers—money it desperately needs, after a poorly-timed foray into nuclear and an acquisition gone awry caused it to write-down $6.1 billion in assets, jeopardizing its future survival. But even if it saves Toshiba, it marks a minor tragedy for Japan. Japan once dominated the memory business. In the ’80s and into the ’90s, Toshiba, along with Hitachi, Fujitsu, NEC, Mitsubishi, and other companies each generated significant revenue by selling memory chips to electronics makers overseas. Their influence was so great that Micron, then one of the few-remaining US-based memory makers, once accused a group of Japanese tech giants of dumping memory chips. The case was one of many incidents emblematic of American resentment towards Japanese manufacturing prowess. Nearly 30 years later, competition from Korea has forced nearly all Japanese tech firms out of the memory market altogether. Toshiba’s flash NAND division remains a holdout—occupying almost 17% of the market, ahead of SK Hynix in Korea and Micron and Western Digital in the US, and second only to Samsung (but well behind it). “In Japan in the 1980s, if you were to look at the top 10 semiconductor makers in the world, six would be from Japan. Nowadays, there’s only one left and it’s Toshiba. That’s depressing,” says Prof. Ulrike Schaede, who researches Japanese conglomerates at the University of California, San Diego. Of course, Toshiba could turn to another suitor—the Japanese government. The Innovation Network Corporation of Japan (INCJ), a state-backed fund, has offered $18 billion (paywall) to buy the company’s chip unit. That’s lower than Foxconn’s offer. But the government affiliation could help allay concerns that selling a chipmaker to the Taiwan-based assembler would only heighten China’s tech and military prowess, at the expense of its geopolitical adversaries. Yet the precedent for successful INCJ acquisitions remains weak. The fund acquired the struggling display units of Toshiba, Sony, and Hitachi to form Japan Display in 2011 in hopes of staving off bankruptcies and foreign acquisitions. But that company has recorded three consecutive annual net losses since 2016 and repeatedly returns to the state for more cash injections. No matter who or what saves Toshiba, it probably won’t save Japan’s conglomerates from fading away.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Investigation launched after fatal crash on Monday Tuesday Apr 18, 2017 at 4:46 PM Apr 18, 2017 at 7:28 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — Authorities are continuing to investigate a crash that left a 65-year-old Apple Valley man dead on Monday afternoon. Kirpal Singh Dhaliwa lost his life in the crash, which occurred just after noon Monday in the Jess Ranch shopping center. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials said Dhaliwa was struck by a woman in a 2001 Ford Explorer at the intersection of Jess Ranch Parkway and Town Center Drive. The woman, identified as Shelly Tucker, 47, of Apple Valley, was headed south on Jess Ranch Parkway and was attempting to turn left on Town Center Drive. She did not see Dhaliwa and was unable to avoid striking him with her vehicle, officials said. Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station deputies responded and found Dhaliwa in the roadway with a head injury. Officials said he was taken to Desert Valley Hospital before being airlifted to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center for treatment, where he later succumbed to his injuries. Due to the investigation, Town Center Drive was shut down in both directions between Jess Ranch Parkway and Apple Valley Road on Tuesday afternoon. A portion of Jess Ranch Parkway between the Cinemark theater and Town Center Drive was also shut down in both directions. The closures were expected to last until 8 p.m. Tuesday and motorists were asked to avoid the area. The crash remains under investigation by the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station Major Accident Investigation Team (MAIT).

Copycat Syndrome – Good or Bad? April 19, 2017 0 296 ELEVATING TO THE NEXT LEVEL, By Marie-Therese Phido ELEVATING TO THE NEXT LEVEL By Marie-Therese Phido My daughter invited me to a Google dinner as her plus one two weeks ago. I now suddenly find myself in the season where my daughters invite me to events as their companions. The reverse was the case a few years ago. I jumped at the opportunity to attend this particular dinner, when I heard the name Google, as I will soon launch a technology powered business of my own (a story for another day). I wanted to start spending time and hobnobbing with technology egg heads. At the dinner, we got into the conversation of ‘what do you do?’ and I found out that I was seated beside a lady entrepreneur who had launched a technology driven business to address some of our everyday requirements, and other Google staff. When it got to my turn to introduce myself, I told them that I was working on a technology based project which I was not ready to talk about at the time. The lady beside me said, “please share your idea, I do not understand why people are always afraid to share details of the ideas or projects they are working on. Everybody is busy on their own project and nobody is interested in stealing or copying others projects.” I humbly thanked her and said, “while I respect your opinion, I still do not want to share the details of my project”. This conversation got me thinking. I asked myself whether I was being paranoid. Was I thinking too much of myself or did I think my project was so wonderful? I then compared my project to other projects in Nigeria, how ideas have been copied by various people or organisations. Let’s look at a few examples. Ndani TV which started as a quarterly e-Newsletter by GTBank and morphed into its online platform. “Skinny Girl in Transit” a signature programme has gained acceptance and taken the popularity of the platform to a whole new level with global engagement. People across the globe talked about the programme and got hooked. They are now eagerly looking forward to season four. Red TV by UBA and Accelerate by Access Bank have also been launched. I remember when the Lagos Fashion and Design Week started, which was meant to be a replica of the New York, London and Paris Fashion week. We now have the GTBank Fashion Week. What about food and drinks festivals under different umbrellas and name variations – Lagos International Food and Drink Festival, Taste Off Nigeria Food Festival, Eat Drink Festival, GTBank Food and Drink Festival, who first started this food festivals? Will be good to know as establishing who started is confusing. Oded Shanker, a Fisher University Professor in the USA, and author of “Copycats: How Smart Companies Use Imitation to Gain Competitive Edge” argued that “just copying a market leader isn’t clever, instead do what they do better and with a different spin”. Shanker’s argument has played out for the most part where copycats exist. Shanker seems to support the idea of copycats. Global examples will also attest to this, in this case Apple’s IOS and Androids. The claim is that Apple came first and Android followed and improved on the following features according to CNN Money who compared both products using these parameters: login, make a call, check the time, use apps, get and manage notification, listen to music and podcasts, check mail, get directions, find and manage contacts, search, set phone to vibration, talk to your phone, and send text. Android ranked higher than Apple. Crambler an online site also gave ten reasons why the Android is better than Apple. Categories used were: choice, customisation, hardware, the Google Play Store, widgets & multitasking, expandable memory, user serviceability (remove battery), universal charges, durability and other features. Their conclusion was though Android phones and iPhones have their advantages and disadvantages, the Android’s advantages overpowered the advantages you get from the iPhone and gave reasons to back up their assertion. It therefore appears that copying is not such a bad business strategy. Luke Johnson also said, “true entrepreneurs are supposed to shun imitation and try to be authentic and original. I am not convinced this strategy makes commercial sense. Indeed the merits of being a copycat are underrated.” He goes on to say that “after all, every business is derived from something that proceeded it – what lawyers call prior art. The level of replication in any so-called new product or service is simply a matter of degree. Unless you specifically infringe on patent, design, trademark or copyright or are blatantly passing off a rival’s goods as if they were yours”. Some will say Johnson’s opinion lack morals. But, let’s look at it critically; there are very few ideas that are truly authentic and original. Many entrepreneurs find out that it is much quicker, cheaper and lower risk to mimic than to start something from scratch. Luke says, “entrepreneurs need to be humble enough to know when a legal version of someone’s model is better than anything they can devise. I would generally prefer to back a replica of a highly profitable and thoroughly tested business idea – but in a new territory – than invest in a genuinely pioneering idea. What we need to understand about the copycat syndrome: • Note that if you are first to market with any new idea or innovation, be rest assured that the moment you start to achieve traction and success it will be copied. Today we have copycats of Uber in the market – Lyft in the US and Taxify, Swiftly, Redcab amongst others in Nigeria. • Competition exists in all business markets. There is an advantage to this for your business. Competition keeps you on your toes, makes you innovate and differentiate your service or products which will make you more successful. • Copycats are inevitable and unavoidable. Your approach to relating with them will determine your continued success or demise. • Remember that imitation is the greatest compliment and flattery. When people copy you, it means you are on to something great. Anybody copying you is giving you accolades. In conclusion, and a message to myself to address my paranoia, let’s relax, work harder, say thank you, continually improve our service or offerings, improve our customer experience, differentiate, ignore copycats and not allow them steal our mojo!!! – Marie-Therese Phido is Sales & Market Strategist and Business Coach Email: mphido@elevato.com.ng tweeter handle @osat2012; TeL: 08090158156 (text only) Previous articleBridging the Gap Between Official/Parallel Market Rates Next articleNiger Partners NCRI to Boost Rice, Sugar Production Online Editor RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Breaking Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC Nigeria Famine: World Must Aid Nigeria to Avoid ‘Mass Exodus’ Breaking Hunter Becomes the Hunted, House Investigates Arms Probe Panel 988,214FansLike 742,256FollowersFollow Latest News Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC April 19, 2017 Famine: World Must Aid Nigeria to Avoid ‘Mass Exodus’ April 19, 2017 Hunter Becomes the Hunted, House Investigates Arms Probe Panel April 19, 2017 Ex-wife of Factional Boko Haram Leader Caught Loitering in Maiduguri April 19, 2017 NOI Polls: Buhari’s Performance Rating Rises by Five Points April 19, 2017 THISDAY Today (Download) Download Tuesday 18th April 2017 April 19, 2017 0 Recent Comments RumuPHC on The Abuja-Kaduna Airports: A Testimony lukeabu on Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC Fairgame on Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC samG60 on Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC ifobd on Southern Kaduna Killings: Catholic Church Accuses El-Rufai of Alleged Bias MOST COMMENTED Nigeria WAEC Certificate: Buhari Files Appeal against Ruling Dismissing His Objection June 15, 2016 455 Davidson Iriekpen President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed the ruling of Justice Adeniyi Ademola of the Federal High Court in Abuja who on May 26, 2016...

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Apr 18, 2017 at 6:20PM In late January, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) blew past analysts' earnings estimates for the first quarter of its 2017 fiscal year, lifted by strong sales of the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple stock surged in response. The stock had been trading around $120 before the earnings report, but it moved steadily upwards toward $140 during February. For the past month, Apple shares have remained in a $140 to $145 trading range, up more than 20% year to date. Apple Stock YTD Performance, data by YCharts. These share price gains have been helped along by numerous analyst upgrades and price target increases. This optimism could indicate that investors are finally giving Apple credit for its long-term growth prospects. But it could also mark the beginning of a new bubble in Apple stock. As a result, I have already sold a small portion of my Apple shares -- and I'm thinking about selling more. Here are three key reasons why Apple stock's gains may not last. What comes after the iPhone 8? Notwithstanding their overall bullishness, analysts may still be underestimating the potential sales lift Apple will get from its next flagship iPhone (possibly called the iPhone 8). Most pundits agree that Apple is making significant design changes this year, in honor of the iPhone's 10th anniversary. This could spark a big replacement cycle among loyal iPhone users, similar to what Apple saw after releasing the iPhone 6 in late 2014. Moreover, the iPhone installed base has grown significantly since 2014. The iPhone 8 is also likely to become a status symbol in China, driving strong sales there. The problem for Apple is figuring out what comes next. Assuming that there is sufficient supply, the iPhone 8 should be able to drive strong revenue and earnings growth at Apple beginning this fall and continuing throughout 2018. But by 2019, sales could be slumping again, in line with Apple's 2016 performance. iPhone sales are likely to surge next year, but the gains may not be sustainable. Image source: Apple. With each successive iPhone product cycle, growth will be harder to come by, due to slower smartphone market growth, longer replacement cycles, and competition from brands that offer more affordable flagship phones. In the long run, Apple faces the risk that its iPhone cash cow will be disrupted by new technology. Thus, investors probably shouldn't count on the iPhone to be a long-term earnings growth driver beyond 2018. Is Apple's services profitability sustainable? Most Wall Street analysts recognize that iPhone sales won't keep growing forever. Furthermore, due to Apple's massive size, it's hard for any new products to move the needle. That's why many analysts are counting on Apple's services business to drive the company's future growth -- and send Apple stock to new heights. Apple has set out an ambitious goal of doubling its services revenue to around $50 billion over the next four years. This may be achievable, especially if Apple is able to launch a long-rumored subscription video service. However, analysts may be overestimating the long-term profitability of Apple's services business. Today, the services segment may earn gross margins as high as 70%. However, the new (and relatively fast growing) Apple Music service has a much lower gross margin. The same would almost certainly be true of any Apple subscription video offering. Even the App Store -- which currently produces the biggest chunk of Apple's services revenue and profit -- isn't a silver bullet. Apple appears to have reduced its cut of certain App Store sales late last year, which could negatively impact App Store revenue growth and profitability. The bottom line is that while services growth should provide a meaningful amount of revenue growth in the coming years, the services segment's profit margin may decline. This will limit the impact on Apple's earnings. Will tax reform happen -- and what will it look like? A third risk is that meaningful corporate tax reform may not occur. A few months ago, it seemed all but certain that the U.S. would significantly reduce or abolish its tax on repatriated foreign earnings. This would encourage Apple to repatriate more than $200 billion of foreign cash, paving the way for a big special dividend, massive share buybacks, or transformative acquisitions. However, Republican infighting has scuttled attempts at healthcare reform thus far. This raises big questions about President Donald Trump's ability to implement other parts of his agenda, including tax reform. Even if tax reform does get passed eventually, the benefit to Apple will depend on the exact terms and tax rate that would be applicable. Furthermore, it's not clear how aggressive Apple would be about returning repatriated cash to shareholders. Lastly, the recent run-up in Apple's stock price means the company wouldn't be able to buy back as many shares even if it is able to repatriate lots of cash. I still believe that Apple has a bright future. But analysts may be overestimating its post-2018 earnings growth potential. If Apple stock continues rallying in the weeks and months ahead, I plan to trim my holdings further.

Said to feature an edge to edge OLED display, advanced augmented reality features, and a wide array of additional system improvements and features, Apple’s next-gen iPhone will mark a huge technological leap forward and will likely anchor the largest refresh cycle Apple has ever seen. And yet, for the first time in years, what Apple plans to call its next-gen iPhone remains up for debate. Don't Miss: This is supposedly Apple’s final iPhone 8 design From what we’ve gathered from an assortment of credible rumors, Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup will consist of three distinct devices: an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus, and an unnamed 5.8-inch iPhone with a sleek and edgeless OLED display. Unofficially, Apple’s next-gen 5.8-inch iPhone has already been dubbed the iPhone 8, a reflection of the fact that the device will introduce a brand new form factor, a change Apple typically reserves for devices released after an ‘S’ cycle refresh. More recently, we’ve seen reports claiming that the iPhone 8 will actually be called the iPhone Edition, a name which makes much more sense than the iPhone 8 ever did. Consider this: if Apple releases an iPhone 8 alongside two iPhone 7s models, the naming scheme alone would immediately make the two brand new iPhone 7s models appear antiquated. Though new devices, the iPhone 7s models — standing next to the iPhone 8 — would seem like old news. In stark contrast, the iPhone Edition is a clever way for Apple to release three new iPhone models while not steering customers away from the more affordable devices in Apple’s iPhone lineup. Because the iPhone Edition connotes a degree of elegance without masquerading as next-year’s iPhone model, it’s actually a clever way for Apple to designate the edgeless OLED iPhone as a premium device without diminishing the appeal of the iPhone 7s. In effect, the iPhone 7s would be positioned as the MacBook to the iPhone Editon’s MacBook Pro. Problem solved, right? Well, not exactly. It’s no secret that Apple over the past few years has been simplifying its branding. Slowly but surely, the “i” naming scheme has given way to more Apple-centric branding. For example, there’s no iWatch, iMusic or iTV. Instead, we have the Apple Watch, Apple Music and Apple TV. More recently, Apple changed iTunes Podcasts to Apple Podcasts. Consequently, we’re starting to see some chatter and speculation that Apple may keep the train moving and call its next-gen device the Apple iPhone; simple, clear, and unburdened by a legacy of numerical suffixes. The only problem with this idea is that the iPhone is a device that gets updated every single year. In turn, the numerical suffixes are not only helpful when discerning between two devices, they’re essential for both consumer comprehension and Apple’s advertising efforts. If Apple calls its 2017 flagship iPhone the Apple iPhone, what happens when Apple rolls out a new model the next year, or the year after that? If Apple goes this route, it would effectively be sacrificing long-term clarity for short-term simplicity. Interestingly enough, Ken Segall — a marketing legend who worked closely with Steve Jobs on a number of iconic Apple ad campaigns — recently planted a flag in favor of iPhone simplicity. In a recent blogpost, Segall suggests a new naming scheme that would arguably make the iPhone lineup much easier to comprehend. Wouldn’t it be great if each name indicated the phone’s reason for being, and reassured buyers that it contained Apple’s latest technology? Imagine if Tim Cook took to the stage in September to introduce this year’s family of iPhones— • iPhone 8 • iPhone 8 Plus • iPhone 8 Pro • iPhone 8 Mini In this naming scheme, customers could choose a “standard” iPhone 8, a large-screen version, a bigger, more feature-rich pro model, and a beautifully scaled-down thin/light model. Strip away the 8 from every model and it gets even simpler. This is the Great iPhone Naming Opportunity of 2017. As the family of iPhones becomes more diverse, this is the perfect moment to cast off the complexity and give customers an easier choice. Read More This is an interesting take as it completely negates the problems associated with Apple releasing two iPhone 7s devices alongside a flagship device with a completely different naming pattern. It also negates the issues that would arise by calling the next-gen iPhone the Apple iPhone. What’s more, there’s a case to be made for abandoning the ‘S’ naming convention altogether. Rightly or wrongly, ‘S’ upgrades are often viewed as tepid updates that are far less compelling than traditional updates a’la the iPhone 4, 5, 6, and last year’s iPhone 7. All that being said, I think Segall is on the right track here, though the iPhone 8 Mini moniker still seems a bit off. If Apple kept the iPhone SE around alongside the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and the OLED-based iPhone 8 Pro, I think that would really help streamline Apple’s increasingly complex product matrix. If anything, it’s certainly something worth pondering as the iPhone 8 release date (old habits die hard) draws closer and closer. Apple may not need to adjust its iPhone naming scheme, but with the OLED-based iPhone on the horizon, if there were ever an ideal time for Apple to do away with the old and welcome the new, 2017 would be that time.

The iPhone 8 is tipped to ditch Touch ID altogether in a latest analyst report, and separately another report testifies the vertical dual camera setup reported in the past. Japanese blog Macotakara reports that the iPhone 8 will sport a glass back and front, something similar to the iPhone 4 which had a metal frame, but a glass back. It also suggests that the company would bring the dual camera setup similar to the one seen on the iPhone 7 Plus, but will place it on the iPhone 8 vertically, essentially compatible for VR shooting. The report states that this design has recently moved from EVT to DVT status (engineer to design validation test). The report also states that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus may be slightly thicker than the predecessors due to upgrade tweaks. While there's no mention of what happens to Touch ID, a separate analyst report by Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest Securities claims that there might not be one at all. The research note shared by MacRumors, claims that if Apple cannot come up with a viable solution to solve the optical fingerprint sensor yield rate issues, it may just ditch it altogether. "Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone. We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues. If it's able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it's not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether," Hargreaves notes. Apple removing Touch ID altogether and relying only on facial recognition does not seem feasible, and will raise questions over security and convenience. The company does have the option to place the Touch ID at the back, but it's not a user-friendly option, and Apple could look at it as a fall back option if nothing else. Furthermore, a separate report by The Investor claims that Samsung is handling most of the OLED panel derivatives supply chain as well, as Apple is still a novice in this department. Samsung is the largest developer of OLED and has been employing them in its smartphones. It knows the peripheral components that work well with the display, and has been managing it for Apple as well. It is playing 'a key role in the overall supply chain management that consists of its own key parts suppliers'. The report states, "Samsung's non-memory chip unit System LSI will supply display driver IC, the display chip for the OLED screen, while STEMCO and LG Innotek will provide the chip on films that connect it to the printed circuit board. The flexible printed circuit board will be provided by Interflex, BH and Samsung Electro-Mechanics." Apple has reportedly ordered 70 million OLED panels from Samsung for the iPhone 8. Other companies like LG, Sharp, Japan Display, and BOE are in the running to be able to mass produce OLED panels by 2018, but for now Samsung dominates the market.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. MacBook kicked off the future of Apple laptops — but what's the future of the 12-inch MacBook? In March of 2015, Apple introduced the all-new 12-inch MacBook. Not Air. Not Pro. And certainly not at the old, white, plastic MacBook's pricepoint. This was tomorrow's laptop today... As long as tomorrow you was willing to sacrifice power in the name of ultra-mobility. More shocking was its ports. More precisely, it's lack thereof. Gone was MagSafe, Apple's convenient, tumble-preventing, dent-saving connector. Gone was old-school USB-A. Nowhere was Thunderbolt. Instead, Apple introduced USB-C to Mac. And just one. That's the past future, though. What could Apple have in store for the 2017 MacBook? When will Apple update the MacBook? Here's the previous update schedule: March 2015: MacBook with Intel Broadwell CoreM March 2016: MacBook with Intel Skylake CoreM and rose gold color option March 2017 has come and gone without a new MacBook. No Intel Kaby Lake CoreM update so far this spring. Apple could drop a new MacBook at any time. If the updates are iterative, we could wake up to a press release and an updated web page any morning this spring. If there's anything that requires stage time at an Apple Keynote, though, we're looking at June 5 and WWDC at the earliest and September after that. Will the next MacBook get Touch Bar and Touch ID? Touch Bar has proven to be divisive. Apple seems to have anticipated really high attraction levels for Touch Bar. While some people like it, many others do not. So, will Apple stick with Touch Bar the way the company did all-USB-C, and push it out across the line? Or will Apple retrench and rethink its approach to touch? Touch ID, on the other hand, is pure win. It's such a convenience on MacBook Pro that not having it on the next MacBook would be a letdown. The only reason it might not be a lock is price point — it's essentially an embedded Apple Watch so it adds the cost of an Apple Watch, or about $300, to the bill. It's possible Apple could do what it did with MacBook Pro and offer MacBook (Escape) and MacBook (Touch Bar) options, the former with traditional function keys, the latter with OLED. Otherwise, fingers crossed Apple can figure out how to save a few dollars elsewhere and get Touch ID in and under budget. And a Force Touch Bar, right? Love the way you think! Touch Bar is begging for Force Touch, but it's unclear that would debut with a new MacBook rather than the next generation, Kaby Lake MacBook Pro. What about biometric different? Face or iris scan? Apple would have to figure out how to fit a much better camera in that razor-thin lid first, but year. Once iPhone gets a smart camera, there's no reason MacBooks shouldn't get it either. Windows alread does facial recognition to unlock and it'd be great on a Mac. That way, Apple Watch Auto Unlock, Touch ID, and Face Unlock could be in a three-way race! More USB-C? Like — gasp! — two? Apple was adamant that MacBook was the future of laptops. The company wanted to create a MacBook that was entirely wireless. Since wireless charging wasn't an option, though, Apple had to include at least one wire. So, it made that wire a multi-tasker. USB-C can both charge and carry data. Since one was infinitely more than none, that was enough, right? Wrong. Not only isn't wireless charging a thing yet, MacBooks still don't have LTE, and Bluetooth still isn't good enough to support real, diverse peripherals. The future, as always, is a beautiful lie. There are no doubt power and design constraints that may make two USB-C ports more challenging than one in a MacBook, especially when it comes to where they can be mounted on that tiny motherboard. I'd love them on both sides, like on the higher end MacBook Pro, so I can charge from either side. I'd settle for them both on one side. It would show Apple can still bring us the future but in a way that mitigates the real pain points of the present. And they'd be USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, right? RIGHT? Did I mention how much I love the way you think? Look, no blogger should ever substitute their fantasies for engineering realities. But if Thunderbolt 3 is possible on MacBook Pro, it'd be outstanding to have it on MacBook. Consistency is absolutely a customer-facing feature. You mentioned LTE, any chance...? I've always suspected getting LTE in a MacBook was more about the extortion-level licensing fees Qualcomm charges than any real philosophical or technical hurdles within Apple. The current round of lawsuits only deepens those suspicions. I very much hope we get LTE-equipped MacBooks and soon. We may just have to let the lawsuit dust settle first. Any chance it could run iOS, have a full multitouch display, and support Apple Pencil? Been snooping in the product labs again? That's more of a strategic decision for Apple than a technical one. Both MacBook and iPad Pro tackle the problem of ultra-light computing from different directions. Currently, macOS lacks a touch-first interface and that would take time and resources to build out (see Windows 8). Arguably that time and those resources would be better invested in making iOS a better primary computing platform on iPad and larger screens in general. iOS also lacks a pointer system, though adding selection (like on Apple TV) and cursor (like in text editing mode), seems like far less work. (Again, not an engineer, so everything seems both easy and impossible to me!) A MacBook that's essentially an iPad Pro with a proper keyboard, SurfaceBook-style, would be incredibly interesting to me. Apple prototypes everything, so we'll have to see what's interesting to them. But it'd be killer at coffee shops and on planes. I'm just saying... Jet black? (Product) RED? Ha! I knew that was what all this was coming to! MacBook is currently the only laptop from Apple that comes in color. (Sorry, MacBook Pro, silver and space gray aren't colors). Gold debuted with the original and rose gold came last year. I'm not sure if the Jet Black process scales or holds up to MacBook. I'd love to see it, microabrasions, and all. (Product Red) at that size would be a lot of red. Maybe too much red? Apple treats color finishes like features because that's how we treat them. We get as excited for new colors — more excited even — than we do for new configurations. Personally, I'd like to see how Apple would handle Space Blue or Space Purple. What do you want to see from the next MacBook? The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is a bold new machine that pushes the future of displays, ports, and input, but it's also one that risks leaving many traditional Mac users behind. Whether that's ultimately good or bad, we'll have to wait in see. For now, it's your turn. What do you want to see in Apple's next Mac laptop?

Still, it'll beat the onscreen iPad keyboard. The only other feature we'd really want would be a second USB-C slot.

I am excited to use the Touch Bar with many applications. The new space grey 15" is going to compliment my collection in a new way. The larger trackpad is nice. Looking forward to the new keyboard. As a photographer and graphic/web designer, I am going to miss the peripherals for SDHC and USB 3.0, as most of my storage will have to be moved from 128gb cards and drives. I used these small storage devices, left in the slots, for photo libraries, movie storage, cache, and transfers. My goal is to leave the internal SSD clean and free of files. Bring on the dongles! When are we going to get cellular data support built in? I love my LTE iPad Pro, but don't prefer creating a hotspot every time I need WiFi on my laptop. That being said, my MacBook Pro 15.4" is on the way in November (or December)! Cannot wait! 0 5 months ago Reply tadnishida I get the USB-C will soon be all the rage, especially with this push by Apple. But was new camera storage technology is copming out to replace the SDcard slot. I understand (but don't believe in ) Apples desire push the new technologies forward.

Most of the time it's laying mostly dormant with OS features such as AppNap, that's why the fans don't kick in unless you're doing something resource intensive. The fans only really kick in for me if I'm playing a game, installing an OS/large app update, and probably would kick in if I was doing something like video editing though I don't do that. You can always click the battery icon to see what applications are using a lot of power. Also, I'd rather see the iPhone have USB-C instead of Lightning, as opposed to having a Lightning port on the Mac, considering USB-C is a standard and Lightning is proprietary. 0 5 months ago Reply Isaiah Heart Price. Isaiah Heart. 2 5 months ago Reply cyberbob859 Have to agree with others that what needs to be changed is the price. I went to the Apple Store online, and priced out a 13" MacBook Pro (without the Touch Bar) and just went with the lowest end configuration (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD). I included AppleCare (I get it for completely new design changes), and a USB C to USB A dongle (which I will need to attach older peripherals.) With tax, this came out to almost $1800 US. And this is for the lowest end MacBook Pro (which, IMO, with this configuration and specs, should probably be more accurately designated a MacBook Plus.) Wow. This is simply more money than I'm willing to spend. I really don't know what Apple is trying to accomplish. Reading comments here and on other sites on the web, I see two general themes - for general consumers/prosumers, the price is too high. For true professionals, the hardware (especially RAM) isn't good enough. Maybe Apple is just trying to push the general consumer to an iPad Pro, so the whole story won't be told until next year when the iPad line is updated along with the iMac. 3 5 months ago Reply paulrubin3 The MacBook Pros are simply too expensive. No more. No less. They were already too expensive before and were literally many hundreds too expensive over this past year given how obsolete some of the internals were but now they're $300-$500 more than before when they were $100-$300 too much to begin with. That's problem number one. The MacBook Air was overpriced at $999 and now it goes into the holiday season just as overpriced and more obsolete. A token $100 cut was an absolute necessity and there really should have been some upgrades made to the internals even at that price. The 12" MacBook needs to go down $200. There are other laptops with similar components and specs with some additional functionality. $1099 and $1299 for the two models was another must have and if those two devices don't replace the MacBook Air (and get upgraded internally) by this time next year, look for Mac laptop sales to fall off 25% or more. And there's zero reason to have the previous gen 13" MacBook pro at $1299. Apple needs to cut prices of its obsolete stuff like it does the iPhone. 2 5 months ago Reply bunkrich I want a lightning in port. Now no wired headphones with both the iPhone and new Macs.

I personally don't mind them being separate, however I want to see a more "desktop-os" approach to the iPad Pro at least, that means at least a file-system, and some actual Pro apps (Logic Pro, Final Cut Pro) as well as development tools such as Xcode 2 5 months ago Reply GGIBS For the price they are asking I feel that a 4K screen is not an unreasonable ask. Yes you don't need 4K on a 15 inch screen but you don't "need" it on a 21.5 inch screen either.

People were living a #donglelife back then, but only on Thunderbolt 1.0. I could understand the MacBook Nothing giving you no legacy options; the legacy options were to buy other MacBooks. For the Pro machine though, there's been no concession for it. Apparently Phil Schiller has said that powering 32GB RAM would be too costly on battery life. Well then fatten up the machine with more batteries then! They probably could've achieved the appropriate level of battery life and still come in thinner and lighter (just) than the old design. Other than that I'd go for: 1x legacy USB-A Charger to magsafe-ify the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C connector on the male end (still allows any of the 4 ports to take power HDMI 2.0 - yes this will output only 4K, but the old system used 1080p HDMI with Thunderbolt 1 or 2 supporting higher resolutions 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK I don't know why legacy ports are needed on a next-generation MacBook, it should have just next-generation ports. They should just do the same as they did with the iPhone 7 and include the adapters in the box 0 5 months ago Reply DirkUs47 I think for the first of a new-generation MBP, in the here and now, a level of transition should've been considered. They are answering the question of, "What do I do with my gazillion USB peripherals?" by telling you to spend a bit more money (on top of thousands) on dongles. For the iPhone going to Lightning, aside from chargers, USB cables and speaker docks, there wasn't much in the way of different peripherals. This made the transition easier. For USB-A to USB-C, there are so many more devices people have invested in over close to 20 years. Even for Firewire, they included the FW400 6 pin and FW800 9 pin on the same system even though there were so few (comparative to USB) devices in existence and the Firewire market switched to 9 pin very quickly. Whether as you say, include adaptors in the box (the price of these machines would allow that), or build in some legacy ports, they should've addressed the current day landscape better. I still maintain that HDMI 2.0 would've been a good idea. The now old MBPs included HDMI as a user requested feature. 2011 and prior required a dongle from miniDP or mini-DVI to HDMI. They could've continued down that path, but they allowed concession for that port. They've essentially gone back to the 2011 idea of "buy a dongle" when it comes to video out. My girlfriend has a 2011 MBP and she's annoyed when I can hook up my 2012 rMBP to a TV with no fuss. Unless TVs will include video in via type-C in addition to HDMI on mass as a standard feature, we're going backwards. 0 5 months ago Reply Ultimate_Nick I would of kept an Hdmi port because thats the most common one for connecting a monitor and now we have to buy an adapter Sent from the iMore App 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK Technically you're not using any more cables than before.

How many VMs are you running at once? 1 5 months ago Reply smart_burro TL;DR - Make the MBP a 2 in 1 that runs both macOS and iOS or iOS that incorporates macOS features. More port options. Apple Pencil support. Fix the **** Mac App Store. 1. The Touch Bar is a welcome addition, but I want a 2 in 1 device from Apple. They don't need to add a touch interface to macOS to do this. Instead make the screen detachable and capable of running a modified version of iOS. Or just make a version of iOS that supports a trackpad, has finder or something similar, and incorporate other macOS features on the software side. Also, start making Apple Pencil compatible with all Mac and iOS devices. I would be willing to pay the combined price of a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro just so I could have 1 device for all my needs. With their release of the Surface Studio and Surface Book Microsoft is starting to beat Apple at their own game. The updates to the MBP are great, but given how long it's been since Apple done a significant refresh of the MBP I was expecting much more. It's a sad day when Windows PC manufacturers are out innovating Apple. 2. Add back the SD card slot. I have a micro SD adapter that allows me to add 128 GB of additional storage to my current MBP, sits flush with the case and is aluminum so you can't even tell it's there. Removing the SD card slot just means I will need yet another adapter. 3. More ports. 4 USB-C ports is nice, but since so many devices have yet to make the switch it would seem logical that Apple would include a legacy USB port and HDMI. Yes I know there are adapters and dongles, but too many and the Mac becomes a cluttered mess. 4. In lieu of a touch friendly interface it would be cool if they replaced the trackpad with an OLED screen that you could use the Apple Pencil to draw on. 5. Bring the True Tone display to the MBP, and every other product with a screen. 6. "Hey Siri". Im not a fan of having to click something or use a keyboard shortcut to access Siri on the Mac. Hey Siri is great on the iPhone and Apple Watch and would be a welcome addition to macOS. 7. On the software side, get serious about the Mac App Store or shut it down. The quality of apps on the store is hit or miss due to many devs deciding to pull their apps or not sell future versions through the store. Rapid Weaver is a prime example of this. Rapid Weaver 5 is still being sold ok the App Store for $89 while Realmac Software is selling Rapid Weaver 7 on their website but not on the App Store. Apple really needs to come up with a solution that allows trial periods and discounted upgrades to new versions. Devs are what make Apple's devices so good.

Topping out at 16GB works against Apple's theme of "Macbook Pro as workstation", especially for demanding "Pro" workflows like 4k video production, high-resolution photo and image editing, software development running N+1 virtual machines with a side of Xcode, etc. Having toes (cough, entire limbs) in those waters, the extra RAM really does make a difference. This generation of Macbook Pro leaves the high-end to the ever-slower cycle times for the iMac and Mac Pro. Supporting 32GB RAM wouldn't have been a 100% win either, since still there's real value to Apple's push for thinner and lighter. It's hard to handle the svelte Macbook and not imagine a Macbook Pro that gives that same featherweight impression.

Or included an adapter or two in the box. 4) added an extra ThunderBolt 3 port for the 15" MBP at least. 5) had more powerful and dedicated AMD GPUs in the lineup at least for the 15" model. 6) added a 32GB RAM option for the 15" model if Apple is not planning on updating the Mac Pro any longer. 0 5 months ago Reply Rowanova I forgot about the HDMI loss, good point.

That sucks. 0 5 months ago Reply dandbj13 Price! They could have included the Touch Bar on the $1499 model. It is odd that $1500 is not enough to get a Touch Bar. 8 5 months ago Reply Moodyz This. Their recent pricing moves on the Mac side have been downright ridiculous. 5 5 months ago Reply smart_burro Agree. For the price I expected much more. At the very least they should have waited for the Kabylake processors. Going into the event I was planning on buying a new MBP as soon as they are released, but will likely now wait until mid to end of 2017. By then they'll have at least upgraded the processors the Kabylake. If my late 2013 15" MBP continues to do everything I need it to I may wait even longer. I REALLY wish Apple would suck up their pride and make a 2 in 1 device. I have come close a couple times to getting a Surface Pro or Book, but have resisted because I am heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem. That and I really don't care for the Surface Pro's trackpad and paying MBP prices for the Surface Book is hard to justify since I'm not sure how I will like working on a windows machine again. Bad news, my inner geek has to wait a little while longer before scratching the new laptop itch. Good news, my wallet won't be emptied out quite yet.

They're built for portability and yet after these years (decades?) they still possess no LTE chips to do what they were designed to do in the first place - be portable.

I bought a couple LTE iPads but eventually realized that I didn't need the LTE and data plan because I usually had access to wifi (even when out and about) when I was using my iPad. When I didn't it was easy to just use my iPhone as a hotspot or use my Karma Go hotspot. I could see why others would want it though.

The adapter is only needed until everyone moves on to USB-C technology which won't take long. USB-C is capable of replacing the HDMI port so it makes sense the HDMI port isn't there either. Essentially you won't need any more cables for this, you just need to replace your HDMI-HDMI cable with a USB-C to HDMI cable. The SD card reader has been removed because barely anyone uses it anymore. Most people have cameras now that can transfer through Wi-Fi, which is a lot easier than having to take the SD card out, put it in your Mac, transferring the photos, then putting the SD card back into your camera. The headphone jack was removed from the iPhone because it can only deliver audio, it's an old port and needed to go. Using audio via the Lightning port or a USB-C port provides better audio fidelity and also the possibility of other features. Someone mentioned you could have headphones with a thermal sensor, for example, only possible when the headphones are plugged into a digital port. Eventually the headphone jack will be gone from the Mac too. You haven't even tried the keyboard yet, give it a chance. When the new Macs are in store, try the keyboard out, then give us your opinion. I agree with you on removing the glowing logo and MagSafe. I loved both of these things and it's a shame they've gone, but the rest of the changes do make sense to me, the future is having 1 type of port that can handle everything, and anything that can be done wirelessly might as well be done wirelessly. 0 5 months ago Reply apple lover 84 the word future is the key hear. i agree the future is usb type c and that is why i think that they should have added them as well. but to take everything that makes it currently functional away and then tell me oh but you won't need it soon and hear is a bunch of dongles or go buy all new cables is just completely the wrong way to do it. this would have been the right move for the next redesign not this one, its just too soon and this future that is usb c is just not ready yet. in 5 years absolutely maybe even 3 but not now. usb A is absolutely everywhere and still the current standard. i agree in the future usb c will gradually be adopted but the future is not hear yet. and won't be for many years to come. they had the right idea but the wrong execution. sd cards are not going anywhere and not everything is wireless yet the fact is people have thousands and tens of thousands of dollars invested in current technology that still depends on sd cards and usb A not to mention legacy equipment such as storage. i am flexible when it comes to HDMI as i was with ethernet but leave me at least one usb A port and my sd card reader so i can still function at least. DONGLES ARE NOT THE FUTURE THEY ARE THE FAILURE!!! 0 5 months ago Reply badMojo69 Yes USB C on everything even the iPhone. Time to kill the Lightning Port. 0 5 months ago Reply tokekijo Agreed!! Sent from the iMore App 0 5 months ago Reply toneofark I agree. 0 5 months ago Reply smart_burro Should have been done with the iPhone 7 but instead they killed the headphone jack and include lightning headphones. This is basically Apple saying their going to keep the lightning port on the iPhone and not replace it with USB-C. If they did that they would lose their licensing (MFi program) revenue for the manufacturers who make Made for Apple lightning cables. Sent from the iMore App 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK You're completely unaware of how Apple pushes, and has pushed in the past, new standards. Apple has a cruel way of pushing new technology, but I can tell you one thing, it works. By forcing people to use new ports, manufacturers suddenly realize they need to start making USB-C stuff fast. Then there you have it, you've got USB-C accessories in a short amount of time. However, if Apple did what you said and keep USB-A on there because it's "still widely used", manufacturers would be like "Well, the USB-A is still there, we can delay the manufacturing of USB-C accessories until later", and it'd be an incredibly slow process getting USB-C stuff out there. Although it doesn't look like it, Apple has done it the right way and they've done it like this in the past with great results. It's a "be cruel to be kind" situation, just hold tight and soon you won't need dongles anymore when the USB-C stuff comes along, which it will soon 0 5 months ago Reply cmdacos Apple isn't making any push into the future. They are driving arrogance over their former mantra of simplicity and user experience. If they really wanted to move into the future, there wouldn't be any ports at all. Everything can be done through wifi or Bluetooth streaming and although only in its initial stages, power can be sourced either inductively or completely wireless. Apple is not trying to push forward, they proved that 100% by keeping the headphone jack. The inclusion of a USB a port, even a single one would be the right thing to do at this very early stage of tech conversion into the future. The peripherals required by anyone beyond an Instagram Pro like the bloggers on iMore will still be scarce in USB C for over a year. This is Apple saying FU to user simplicity and functionality and saying buy dongles or suffer. Posted via the iMore App for Android -2 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK Saying that Apple doesn't want to move into the future just because they kept the headphone jack on the Mac is silly. Come on, you were hating Apple removing the headphone jack, now that they keep it on this product you still have something to complain about? As usual with people that hate Apple, Apple can do no right in their eyes, it's always a lose/lose situation. Yes everything could be done wirelessly, but some things still need to be kept wired for speed. For example you may have created a very large backup on an external hard drive that you need to move to your Mac, this could take a lot longer through a wireless connection. As for inductive charging, it's clear Apple doesn't support this as they haven't implemented it on their mobile devices either. I don't support inductive charging either, and calling it "wireless" charging is exactly the reason I don't support it, it's not wireless and in essence it limits you even more than wired charged for mobile devices, because as soon as you pick up your phone it will stop charging. To me (and probably Apple too) inductive charging is just a gimmick. When the technology for true wireless charging becomes available, where your device isn't touching anything and is just in the range of a charging station, that's when Apple will implement that kind of charging 1 5 months ago Reply cmdacos That's why I included wireless charging separate from inductive. It exists. Patents are out there. And I am not complaining that the MBP still has the headphone Jack. What I am complaining about is the or spin that was put out saying that the decision was a move to wards the future. It wasn't and the MPB proves it. It was simply apple being arrogant. Saying that wires need to stay because of data speed is also no different then everyone else saying headphone jacks need to stay because of superior sound quality. You said it was a non issue and people need to get over it and move forward. Same goes then for the need for wired data transfer speed. Get over it. You either are simply an apologist or you only have an opinion the mirrors Rene which in turn still makes you an apologist. Posted via the iMore App for Android -2 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK Having the headphone jack removed doesn't mean you can't used wired headphones. You use them with a Lightning/USB-C port so you still get superior audio quality. It is a non-issue. 0 5 months ago Reply MacBipes I believe the new MacBook Pro (both 13 and 15) have the headphone jack. Look at the images on Apple's web site. Apologies if you are referring to something else. 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK They do, although cmdacos is trying to say that Apple do not agree the headphone jack is old simply because they left it in the latest Macs. It will go from the Macs eventually, Apple is just giving the Macs more time than they did with the iPhone 0 5 months ago Reply smart_burro So how are you suppose to use the new lightning EarPods with the new MacBook since it doesn't have a lightning port to plug them into? I agree that USB-C is the future, but the fact is many devices recently, currently, and in the near future will still use legacy USB ports. For a computer that is called a "Pro" I would expect that I could plug in any current device without hr need of yet another dongle. SD cards are used for more than just transferring photos from a camera to a computer. On my 2013 MBP I have a microSD card plugged using an adapter that allows it to sit flush with the case and matches the material of the case. I have this card plugged in 24/7 and use it to add 128 GB of storage to my MBP. The removal of the SD card slot and the USB ports makes my cynical side believe this was all done to push users to buy Apple dongles and purchase a bigger HD than we would need to with options like an SD card. I am a diehard Apple fan but I am growing tired of them taking their customers for fools. Sent from the iMore App 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK I think you're reading into this too much. The majority of MacBook Pro users don't use an SD card, you're a unique case unfortunately, that's why it was removed. With the USB ports, it depends what you class as the "near future", but I think in a year's time most devices won't use any legacy USB ports anymore, it just wouldn't make sense, we have to move forward, not backwards 0 5 months ago Reply Galaxy_Man "Most people have cameras now that can transfer through Wi-Fi" Most?! 0 2 days ago Reply gerardo2068 touch screen on laptops sucks. just stop please stop this BS 0 5 months ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner
Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple iPhone 8 Reportedly Sporting Stainless Steel Frame Corazon Victorino International Business Times April 18, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share New details about the upcoming iPhone 8 point toward a next-generation flagship device that revives the iPhone 4’s design. There is also new information about the handset’s camera, and it corroborates recent reports of a vertically-aligned dual-camera module.  On Monday, Mac Otakara outed some details about the rumored “iPhone Edition,” which is also referred to as iPhone 8 by many technology news sites and analysts. According to the Japanese blog, Tim Cook’s company is adopting a familiar design that makes use of a stainless steel frame to hold together the front and back glass panels of the upcoming iPhone. The enclosure is going to be sandwiched by the glass plates, just like what Apple did to its 2010 edition smartphone.  The blog also indicated that the next-generation iPhone will come with flat OLED display and with 2.5D cover glass on the edges. The slight curvature on the edges would give it distinction from the design Apple adopted for the iPhone 4. The design is said to have already made it through the tech giant’s engineering verification testing (EVT) process, so it’s very likely for the 10th anniversary iPhone to debut with the glass sandwiched hardware.  READ: Is Apple ditching iPhone 8 display-embedded Touch ID?  Interestingly, Apple intends to improve the stainless steel frame for the upcoming iPhone. So unlike the iPhone 4, the company is working on an improved version of the enclosure utilizing the technology it is using with its Apple Watch smartwatches. However, it wasn’t made clear if the steel chassis would be polished or would come with matte finish, as pointed out by Apple Insider. Another feature that is expected to launch with the iPhone 8 is a more advanced dual-camera module. A recently leaked diagram actually shows the module to be vertically aligned. Reports are already spreading the word about the vertically-aligned iSight Duo camera on the back of the next iPhone. According to MacRumors, the reason behind the vertical lenses is in order for the module to be positioned horizontally when the handset is used in a VR headset.  Lastly, the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus that are expected to debut alongside the iPhone 8 are now reportedly sporting thicker bodies than their predecessors. This would mean that the cases for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus won’t fit them.  iPhone 4More Apple’s iPhone 8 is now believed to sport the same stainless steel frame found on the iPhone 4.

Action Alerts PLUS Action Alerts OPTIONS Daily Swing Trade Income Seeker Quant Ratings Real Money Real Money Pro Stocks Under $10 Top Stocks Trifecta Stocks Real Money Pro Portfolio Chairman's Club Compare All The Galaxy S8 Reviews Are In and They're Solid, But Its Camera Leaves Apple and Google an Opening Eric Jhonsa Apr 18, 2017 4:58 PM EDT As much as smartphone makers like to trumpet a plethora of new features every time they launch a new flagship phone, it's primarily only improvements to two features -- a phone's display and rear camera -- that have had much success in recent years at driving strong upgrade activity. Apple's (AAPL)  iPhone 6/6-Plus launch, which satiated huge pent-up demand for iPhones with displays larger than 4 inches, is a good case in point. So are, to a lesser degree, Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge, whose curved OLED display turned heads, and Apple's iPhone 7-Plus, which saw demand outstrip supply thanks in large part to its dual-lens rear camera. With their large, widescreen, edge-to-edge displays -- well-suited for an era in which consumers are constantly scrolling through content feeds -- both driving strong pre-orders and underpinning positive reviews -- Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus appear set to join this group. But with Samsung also leaving the other main feature shown to drive upgrade cycles -- the rear camera -- mostly unchanged, Apple and other rivals still have a big opening to differentiate themselves this fall. A quick scan of the dozens of Galaxy S8 reviews that were published on Tuesday morning reveals plenty of headlines filled with steep praise. "The most beautiful phone in the world," reads the headline for Business Insider's review. "Leaves competitors in the dust," says ZDNet's. "The Samsung phone you've been waiting for," writes Time. Such headlines are unsurprisingly typically followed by glowing commentary about the 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch displays respectively found on the S8 and S8 Plus. ZDNet declares that the iPhone 7 Plus' design "instantly looks dated" when compared with the S8's, given how the latter's curved display both looks good and fits comfortably in one's hand. VentureBeat writes that "doing normal things such as checking email, tweeting, and posting on Facebook on this device is very different than before." Engadget states the OLED panels found on both S8 models provide great color reproduction and viewing angles. The phones' build quality also gets high marks -- like their predecessors, the S8 and S8 Plus have front-and-back glass panels held together by a metal frame. Some reviewers also praised the revamped front camera, which now has an 8-megapixel sensor and autofocus support. Battery life was found to be decent, though not spectacular, with the S8 and S8 Plus respectively lasting about as long on a charge as the S7 and S7 Edge. On the other hand, many reviewers have criticized the placement of the S8's fingerprint scanner -- it's right next to the rear camera lens -- as well as Samsung's much-hyped Bixby assistant. "Bixby is useless," The Verge flatly states in its S8 review even as it gives both models a score of 9.0 out of 10. It notes that Bixby's home panel, which pulls in content from Facebook, Twitter and other sources, isn't too different from services found on rival Android phones, and that Bixby Vision (an object-recognition tool built into the S8's camera software), while neat in theory, doesn't do much that can't be quickly accomplished by an Amazon product or Google image search. And Bixby's voice assistant, which Samsung claims will do a better job than rivals of understanding the context of commands and queries, won't be available until the spring. Fortunately, though, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Assistant is. With the big head-start that Google and others have in developing AI-powered voice assistant and improving them with the help of user data, it feels as if Bixby is less an attempt to provide a useful and well-differentiated service than a questionable attempt to become less dependent on Google and offer a software feature that rival Android devices lack.

By Lawrence C. Strauss Biography March 22, 2014 2:56 a.m. ET David Rolfe's introduction to portfolio management came after a rocky start at the University of Missouri in 1980. Many students "went to the big party school, and they would come home with their tail between their legs," recalls Rolfe, now 52. Count Rolfe among them. Having washed out as an engineering student, Rolfe returned home and re-enrolled at the university's St. Louis campus, switching his focus to finance and economics. Rolfe signed up for an investing class, "and I was hooked the very first day," he says. Thirty years later, Rolfe is now running $7.7 billion as the chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners, a suburban St. Louis asset manager. The firm subadvises the RiverPark/Wedgewood Retail fund (ticker: RWGFX), a $1.5 billion large-company growth fund. Enlarge Image Close David Rolfe limits his RiverPark/Wedgewood fund to about 20 stocks. Risky? Maybe. But the fund has a strong record. Paul Nordmann for Barron's Rolfe hews to an investment philosophy that he began early in his career, managing money at a trust bank in St. Louis: He likes a very concentrated portfolio, now 21 holdings; low turnover, 20% last year; and above-average earnings growth without above-average pricing. Add to that a contrarian streak, such as making Apple AAPL -0.44419375308467884% Apple Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD141.2 -0.63 -0.44419375308467884% /Date(1492549200179-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 14150412 AFTER HOURS USD141.33 0.13 0.09206798866855524% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 547332 P/E Ratio 16.910179640718564 Market Cap 744116783346.936 Dividend Yield 1.614730878186969% Rev. per Employee 1874840 More quote details and news » AAPL in Your Value Your Change Short position (AAPL) the fund's second-largest holding at a time when many growth managers have thrown in the towel on that stock. The large growth-stock sector is a tough place in which to shine, given how many analysts and money managers follow these companies. But Rolfe "knows he's trafficking in an efficient, competitive space, and that he might not be able to out-trade, out-analyze" or get more information than some investors do, says Daniel Culloton, associate director of fund analysis at Morningstar. "But he can outwait people, focus on a small subset of companies, try to buy them at an inefficient price, and hold them for a long time." And that is what Rolfe does, with good results. Launched 3½ years ago, the fund's three-year total return is 18.7%, besting the S&P 500 by 2.7 percentage points and putting it in the top 12% of Morningstar's large-cap growth category. Rolfe's track record for the same strategy in Wedgewood's separately managed accounts is similarly impressive, and goes back more than 20 years. The biggest risk in such a concentrated fund—the top 10 holdings account for 60% of assets—is that one or two bad picks can stymie performance. But for Rolfe, a 22nd stock wouldn't add any meaningful diversification. "We don't own two or three mega-banks or two or three pharmaceutical companies," he says. "A portfolio of 20 businesses that have largely different business models and different paths to profitability is more than enough diversification." So far, Rolfe's fund has shown that to be true: RiverPark/Wedgewood Retail has not been demonstrably more volatile than the broad market. One measure of a fund's riskiness is standard deviation, which analyzes volatility. This fund's standard deviation over three years is 12.6, barely higher than the S&P 500's 12.5, according to Morningstar. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is the fund's largest holding. Rolfe insists that Warren Buffett "has built an underappreciated, perpetually growing cash-generation machine," with underlying businesses—especially insurance, railroad freight, and manufacturing—that will "continue to prosper." Buybacks also play a big role: In his most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett noted that if the shares go down to 1.2 times book value, "we will be aggressive" in repurchasing stock. To Rolfe, that assurance offers plenty of downside protection. The B shares, he estimates, are worth at least $150, versus their recent price of $123. Buffett himself was on the syllabus for the pivotal class that shaped Rolfe's investment philosophy and introduced him to big thinkers, such as Sir John Templeton, Benjamin Graham, David Dodd, and John Maynard Keynes. Rolfe began his career at PaineWebber, but he never settled into the role of a "transaction-oriented stockbroker," as he puts it. A high-conviction approach, culled from his studies, struck him as necessary "to have any chance to outperform." In 1992, Rolfe joined Wedgewood Partners, a small money manager in the St. Louis area that was seeking a chief investment officer. Tony Guerrerio, president and CEO, hired the 30-year-old because his investing style dovetailed with the firm's view. "We are not overly concerned with short-term ups and downs, and Dave was right in line with that," says Guerrerio.

Source: Morningstar, Wedgewood Partners Rolfe's style and success at Wedgewood got the attention of RiverPark Capital founders Morty Schaja and Mitch Rubin, who tapped him to subadvise one of their first funds. "You should be able to apply a value orientation to growth investing, and that's something David had been doing for 20-plus years," Schaja says. That mindset led Rolfe to Apple. "Its growth rates hit a brick wall, and many growth managers have just thrown Apple into the dustbin of history, thinking it will never be a decent growth company again," says Rolfe, who disagrees, citing the company's successful rollout of the iPhone 5s and 5c. Plus, "Apple can buy back an enormous amount of shares," adds Rolfe, who puts Apple's fair value at $675, more than 25% higher than its recent price of $531. Similarly, Rolfe likes the fiscally responsible Express Scripts Holding ESRX -0.8699565021748913% Express Scripts Holding Co.

The company is paying down debt and buying back shares, and the expected rollout of more generic drugs in the next few years will help its bottom line. "It's a unique situation—you can have flat revenue but double-digit earnings growth," Rolfe says. He argues that the stock is worth at least $90, versus $77 now. Another favorite is M&T Bank MTB -1.2100709127577907% M&T Bank Corp.

It trades at 15.4 times expected 2014 earnings, very reasonable for a bank that should have double-digit earnings growth in 2015, Rolfe says, thanks in part to its pending acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp (HCBK). M&T's purchase of the large New Jersey-based bank should close by the end of this year, and will add scale to an already well-run, cost-efficient company. M&T has loyal customers and a lot of employees with strong ties to their communities, fostering strong, long-term banking relationships.   E-mail: editors@barrons.com Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Profile 1.

Right or wrong, Samsung has been seen as the follower to Apple’s innovator. With the Galaxy S8, this perception deserves to change. The Galaxy S8 is a smartphone unlike anything from Apple, or anyone else for that matter – a bold, beautiful design, with just one major flaw.The headline feature of the phone is the Infinity Display, the curved edge-to-edge display with almost no border around it. The Galaxy S8 perfects the curved screen design Samsung began building back in 2015, with the S6 edge. The smooth aluminium edges and curved front and back glass panels make for the most beautiful phone I’ve used, and the most comfortable to hold.

More videos Hands on with the Samsung Galaxy S8 Peter Wells takes a first look at Samsung’s latest mobile device at its New York launch. I was mocked in the comments of my S8 hands on for fetishising the phone, but I stand by it. The Samsung Galaxy S8’s style is unique, and will sit alongside the Nokia 3310 and iPhone 4 in future industrial design museums.As Samsung has been manufacturing these curved displays for two years now, they’ve ironed out the software kinks as well. The phone knows when you’re touching the screen to tap a target, and when you’re simply holding the screen because there’s nothing else to grip onto. Related Content Samsung drags heels on voice assistant Bixby Samsung Galaxy S8: are looks enough? The AMOLED display is gorgeous – a little more vibrant than the awesome LG G6. Like LG’s flagship, the screen is narrow and tall – sporting an 18:9 ratio. The narrow design makes using the phone one-handed a little easier. Not every app supports this new 18:9 ratio, but with Samsung and LG both moving to this new design with their flagships, it can’t be long until the apps that matter are updated.With those tiny bezels, Samsung can fit a huge 148mm display into a shell not much larger than an iPhone 7 – and Samsung still found room for a standard headphone jack. Samsung includes a pair of wired headphones from AKG, which sound great for in-box headphones – an area too many manufacturers scrimp on. Advertisement Like the jet-black iPhone 7, the handset is surprisingly grippy. I was terrified the device would slip out of my hands like a bar of soap, but it’s actually a little easier to hold than most new phones.The camera inside the Galaxy S8 is unchanged from last year’s S7 and Note7. This was disappointing news to some, but the Galaxy S7 was already the leading Android lens on the market, and I’m sure Samsung had a few million components lying around after the Note7 recall. Either way, this is the premier low light shooter in any smartphone. In optimal lighting conditions, the stills and video are as good as the iPhone can produce – the main difference being iPhone images have a more natural colour balance, while the S7 punches up the colour.

Photo: Twitter James Ried Reporter @JamesRied9 Share Tweet Share Reddit Pin EmailComment People desperate to get their hands on the newest version of the iPhone when it is released later this year may have to wait longer than expected. Apple may be forced to delay the release of its highly anticipated 10th-anniversary iPhone as the tech giant struggles to implement its new fingerprint sensor. The redesigned iPhone 8 is reportedly creating problems for developers, with issues configuring its key security feature, the Touch ID, under the device’s new edge-to-edge glass screen. Pacific Crest Securities analysts claimed these manufacturing issues may cause a delay or force Apple to eliminate the component altogether, to meet its mid-September release window. “Likely options for Apple include a delay of production or elimination of fingerprint sensing on the OLED iPhone,” Pacific Crest wrote to its clients on Sunday. “The anticipated move to a full-screen OLED panel in the coming iPhone 8/X eliminates the physical home button … At this point, we do not believe Apple’s optical fingerprint module provider has firm orders for production, which suggests Apple does not have functionality of the optical fingerprint sensor ready. “If it’s able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. “If it’s not able to fix the problems in that timeframe, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether.” A number of reports have surfaced of Apple’s issues with its fingerprint sensor and home button in the past week. Axing the fingerprint scanner will cause security issues with Apple Pay. Photo: Getty Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote the company’s troubles have become so prominent it may have to copy its competitor Samsung’s flagship phone to release the iPhone on time. He suggested that if Apple can’t fix its woes it must either “take out Touch ID completely and rely on facial/iris recognition” or move the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device, much like Samsung’s S8 phone. However, according to RMIT University IT expert John Lenarcic, the adoption would be an incremental risk to Apple’s consumer base. “When people were buying things that were uniquely Apple, they were part of a special club. Now the veneer of being unique may rub off and will annoy die-hard Apple fans,” Dr Lenarcic told The New Daily. “This is a sign of desperation, Apple could be seen as trying to become like Samsung.” He said the Touch ID has become an integral part of Apple’s devices, and must be preserved for security purposes. Apple introduced Touch ID into the iPhone with the 2013 release of the iPhone 5S and has been its key security feature. The Touch ID fingerprint sensor has been required for unlocking the phone, signing into apps and services, and using Apple Pay. Relying on its new facial recognition feature alone will only cause more problems, Dr Lenarcic said. He also said he’s not surprised Apple’s difficulty in implementing the new fingerprint scanner. “It would have to have multiple functionality because it has to do the normal things an interface does, and switching the fingerprint scanner on and off, but then that would create its own problems,” he added.

Today, President Trump issued a directive of particular interest to the technology industry; we've got a preview of what devices Apple is expected to unveil this fall; and the U.K.'s prime minister unexpectedly called for a general election to take place in just a few months. –Emily Banks Trump took aim at tech outsourcing, ordering a review of H-1B visa programs with an eye toward favoring more skilled and highly paid applicants. Trump announced the directive during a trip to Wisconsin, along with instructions that federal agencies examine their purchasing systems in favor of buying American goods. The order follows through on Trump's campaign promise to use presidential authority to encourage companies to buy U.S. products and hire American workers. Apple is preparing an iPhone overhaul for the device's tenth anniversary. The company is readying three smartphones for launch as soon as this fall, including upgraded versions of the two current iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line revamped handset. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass, and stainless steel materials. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Theresa May’s call for a snap U.K. general election June 8—something she has repeatedly said she wouldn’t do—caught everyone off guard. May wants to win her own electoral mandate and widen the Tory majority in Parliament at a time of historic weakness for the opposition. The goal: to strengthen her hand in the upcoming Brexit negotiations and gain political capital if concessions are needed in the talks. Facebook gave its staff the green light to protest Trump. The company said it won’t punish employees who take time off to join pro-immigrant protests on May 1. And, in a nod to security staff, janitors, shuttle-bus drivers, and others who work for Facebook contractors, the company also said it will investigate if any of those vendors illegally crack down on their employees’ protest rights. France's presidential race is down to the wire, with no clear winner in sight as the main contenders scrap for votes at a flurry of campaign rallies. Almost a third of the electorate remains undecided, heading into the first round of voting April 23. Centrist Emmanuel Macron holds a slim lead. Get the latest every day at our election hub. Young white America is haunted by a crisis of despair. Middle-aged white Americans without four-year degrees are at increasing risk of dying, a well-documented trend driven not only by drug use but also alcoholism, suicide, and slowing progress against heart disease and cancer.

In the 19th century, the band collar shirt was standard, when most dress shirt collars were detachable. But to wear them out in public could still provoke scandal. Even today, it can read as a relic.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 18, 2017 at 3:11PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made a rare move earlier this month in acknowledging that its 2013 Mac Pro suffered from some fundamental design flaws (mostly around thermal management) that prevented the professional desktop from being regularly upgraded with refreshed specs. Marketing chief Phil Schiller also teased that Apple was planning on introducing iMacs that are more geared toward professional users, since the company's flagship all-in-one (AIO) desktop is also extremely popular among professional users. These "configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind" are expected to launch later this year. According to John Gruber, software chief Craig Federighi added, "But there's still even further we can take iMac as a high-performance, pro system, and we think that form factor can address even more of the pro market." As such, it's no surprise that rumors are now starting to appear about these presumed "iMac Pros." The current iMac lineup. Image source: Apple. Rumor has it DIGITIMES reports that two new iMacs are set to begin production next month ahead of a launch in the latter half of 2017. That could potentially include a "new server-grade iMac for the high-end sector" that could compete with Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) new Surface Studio AIO launched late last year. DIGITIMES estimates that the AIO subset of the PC market sells about 12 million to 13 million units annually. Like the broader market, AIO average selling prices (ASPs) trend down over time, but at a relatively slower rate due to less competition compared to more popular categories like laptops. AIO ASPs may rebound, particularly if you assume that Apple's professional iMac will be priced at a premium; Surface Studio starts at a pricey $2,999 but reaches up to $4,199. It's worth noting that Apple has decidedly shut down the idea of a touchscreen iMac, maintaining its long-standing position that touchscreen PCs are an ergonomic nightmare. Schiller added, "Touch doesn't even register on the list of things pro users are interested in talking about. They're interested in things like performance and storage and expandability." That will be an important differentiating factor between the iMac Pro and Surface Studio. Quanta Computer will be the contract manufacturer for the two new iMacs, according to the report. The "server-grade" iMac will reportedly use Intel's Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, which should significantly boost performance for the professional market; the current Mac Pro uses Xeon E5 processors. There's no mention of any design changes, so the new models may sport the same overall tapered look that was introduced in 2012. Buying some time The real question is whether or not these new iMac Pros can indeed satisfy the needs and demands of Apple's professional user base, which is rightfully feeling a bit neglected at the moment. In addition to the lack of Mac Pro updates, the whole Donglegate situation with the new MacBook Pros also alienated some users that don't want to spend even more money on a collection of dongles and then have to lug said dongles around as well. It's going to be at least another year until Apple's redesigned modular Mac Pro sees the light of day, and it could very well be two years since it seems like Apple has only very recently begun development of the new model. Hopefully, these new iMac Pros can appease the professional crowd and buy Apple some time. Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Pictured (from the left) are: First Attendant Madison Haislop, Queen Alyssa Proehl, and Second Attendant Kira Mullins. All three are students at Jackson High School and will reign over this year�s festival set for Sept. 19-23. (Telegram Photos By Pete Wilson) Newly crowned Apple Festival Queen Alyssa Proehl (back to the camera) receives an embrace from her joyful mother, Angela Hale, just moments after she was crowned. Looking on happily are Alyssa�s sister, Amber (left) and her father Don Proehl (right). PETE WILSON Editor In 2006, 6-year-old Alyssa Proehl became the Little Miss Apple Festival Queen, achieving a little girl's dream. Eleven years later, 17-year-old Alyssa Proehl achieved a girlhood dream when she was crowned as the 2017 Jackson Apple Festival Queen on Saturday evening, April 15, at the Jackson Middle School auditorium. Thus, she becomes the third girl in the long history of the festival to serve as both the Queen and Little Queen. The others achieving that distinction were 2010 Queen Taryn Strawser and 2011 Queen Karena Fulks. Alyssa, who is a Jackson High School junior, will reign over the 2017 Jackson Apple Festival in September along with her newly selected court: First Attendant and Jackson High School sophomore Madison Haislop, and Second Attendant and Jackson High School junior Kira Mullins. The field of nine candidates were asked the same final question by 2016 Queen Tori Leonard: "If you could do one thing to be remembered in the future, what would that be"? Alyssa did not have to ponder long to answer and it had everything to do with why she was standing there at that very moment. "I want to be the third girl to be the Little Queen and Big Queen. It's always been my dream." The newly crowned queen is the daughter of Angela Hale and Don Proehl. She is a junior at Jackson High School, 5'2' tall, with blue eyes and light brown hair. Her school activities include being a five-year member of track, soccer, and nine years of cheerleading; Youth-in-Government, and achieving perfect attendance since Pre-K. Her hobbies and interests include being a 12-year member of Franklin Guys & Gals 4-H Club with turkey and rabbit projects; working at Sonic, walking her dog and tumbling. She plans on attending The University of Cincinnati and majoring in Dental Hygiene. Madison Haislop, 16, is the daughter of Bobby and Betsy Haislop. She is 5'4' tall, with hazel eyes and dark brown hair. At school, she is involved in the Jackson High School girls' soccer program and the Leo Club. She also enjoys drawing, being around friends and family, making everyone's day better, helping with the community, and going to church. She is undecided on her choice of college, but plans to major in Optometry. Kira Mullins, 17, is the daughter of Dawn and James Mullins. She is 5' 2' tall, with hazel eyes and dark brown hair and has the distinction of serving as the 2015 Jackson County Fair Queen. At school she is involved in the majorettes, varsity golf, varsity track, Future Farmers of America, the livestock judging team, Rotary-sponsored JHS Interact Club, Student Health Council and Youth Leadership Association. She also enjoys hiking, 4-H, hunting, cooking, volunteering and agriculture. She plans on attending the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and majoring in Agricultural Extension. The other six candidates for the 2017 Jackson Apple Festival royalty were: Haley Webb, Chloe Rasp, Kylie Laug, Lexi Vest, Madeleine Polcyn, and Lauren Gardner. All six are students at Jackson High School. Tara Byrd once against served as the mistress of ceremonies and was assisted by Queen Tori. There were two full rounds of judging, closed-door interviews conducted earlier in the day and the contest itself which included on-stage interviews and the posing of a final question. Three out-of-town judges evaluated the candidates in six categories: Overall appearance, poise, grammar, speaking, personality, and the ability to communicate. Saturday evening's contest also served as the official farewell appearances for the 2016 royalty: Queen Tori Leonard of Oak Hill, First Attendant Hannah Phipps of Jackson and Second Attendant Loryn Strickland of Jackson. They spoke prior to the announcement of the new royalty and in addition to many expressions of thanks and gratitude, they all realized they had carried out important responsibilities as role models and representatives. There were a number of important announcements made during the program by Apple Festival President Joe Wyant, including the 2017 grand marshal and theme. The grand marshal will be Osborne Equipment Service Owner/Operator and longstanding festival supporter, Terry Osborne, Sr. The theme will be "Apple Blooms and Harvest Moons" and was submitted by Laura Rose Armstrong as part of the theme-naming annual contest. Wyant also announced that pre-sale tickets for all-day ride passes for this year's festival were now on sale for $10 each. Jackson Area Festivals and Events (JAFE) members have tickets for sale now, but they will be available later at such locations as Ohio Valley Bank, Coll Auto Sales, Southern Ohio Smiles, Walmart and the Lewis Agency of Oak Hill. Wyant also invited individuals to step forward and be community sponsors for $100 each. In addition to supporting the Apple Festival, community sponsors will be acknowledged in the official festival program and a random drawing will be held with two different sponsors to have the honor of riding in a festival parade (one is held on Wednesday and one on Saturday night). Wyant also tipped his hat to the festival's sponsors, whose support is essential. Those sponsors recognized during the program and in the printed program were: Aeron Johnson Photography, Andrea's Prom and Bridal, A.L. Terry Jewelers, Classic Cleaners, Carman's Used Cars, Trucks and RVs, Quality Inn of Jackson, Dairy Queen of Jackson, Days Inn of Jackson, Elizabeth's Flowers and Gifts, Jones-Stephenson Insurance Agency, Lewis Insurance Agency of Oak Hill, Milton Bank, McDonald's, Ohio Valley Bank, Osborne Equipment Service, Sheward-Fulks Insurance, and Southern Ohio Smiles. Wyant offered a verbal salute to the Apple Festival Committee members of JAFE, the so-called "red shirts" who volunteer their time to organize and conduct the festival and related events. He also thanked their wives for their assistance, support and understanding. Ryan and Kristen Shoemaker are co-chairs of the Apple Festival Queens Contest and also will serve as the main chaperones following the retirement of long-time chaperones Curt and Judy Wiggins. The 2017 Jackson Apple Festival is scheduled for Tuesday through Saturday, Sept. 19-23.

It’s the iPhone’s 10th anniversary this year so Apple is expected to launch a revolutionary product to commemorate a decade of its most popular product. A new report suggests that Apple is going to launch three new iPhones later this year, two of them will be upgraded versions of the current iPhone models and one will be an entirely new handset. Bloomberg reports that the iPhone 8 is going to have a new type of screen that utilizes curved glass. The handset is also going to have stainless steel materials and more advanced cameras. The iPhone 8 is reportedly going to have a display that covers almost the entire front of the device. The size may be larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but the increased screen-to-body ratio will allow for the handset’s overall size to be similar to that of the iPhone 7. Apple may also free up more space for the display by integrating the home button into the display itself in a manner not unlike the one we’ve seen Samsung utilize with the Galaxy S8. Previous reports have already suggested that the iPhone 8 is going to use an OLED display. This will be the first time that Apple will make the shift from LCD panels for its smartphone. Upgraded models of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are said to retain their 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch LCD displays respectively. Apple is reportedly testing prototypes of the iPhone 8 with slightly curved glass on the front and back. The company is said to be testing versions of its dual camera system for the new iPhone which have the dual camera system positioned vertically instead of horizontally in a bid to further improve the imaging performance. It goes without saying that none of this is confirmed at this point in time and Apple is unlikely to confirm anything about its new iPhones before the time comes. Apple’s new iPhones are expected to be launched this fall. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 8.

Exploring the possibilities of a fully-designed car or the platform powering it By Bob O'Donnell on Apr 18, 2017, 12:15 PM 28 comments TechSpot As your mother or other caregiver likely told you as a child, just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you necessarily should. So, given last week’s news that Apple has obtained a permit to test drive three autonomous cars on public streets and highways in California, the existential question that now faces the company’s Project Titan car effort is, should they build it? Of course, the answer is very dependent on what “it” turns out to be. There’s been rampant speculation on what Apple’s automotive aspirations actually are, with several commentaries suggesting that those plans have morphed quite a bit over the last few years, and are now very different and perhaps more modest than they originally were. While some Apple fans are still holding out hope for a fully-designed Apple car, complete with unique exterior and interior physical design, a likely electric drivetrain, and a complete suite of innovative software-driven capabilities—everything from autonomous and assisted driving features, the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system, and more—other observers are a bit less enthusiastic. In fact, the more pragmatic view of the company creating autonomous driving software for existing cars—especially given the news on their public test driving effort—has been getting much more attention recently. Regardless of what the specific elements of the automotive project turn out to be, there remains the philosophical question of whether or not this is a good thing for Apple to do. On the one hand, there are quite a few major tech players who are trying their hands at autonomous driving and connected car-related developments. In fact, many industry participants and observers see it as a critical frontier in the overall development and evolution of the tech industry. From that perspective, it certainly makes sense for Apple to, at the very least, explore what’s possible, and to make sure that some of its key competitors can’t leapfrog them in important new consumer technologies. In addition, this could be an important new business opportunity for the company, particularly critical now that many of its core products for the last decade have either started to slow or are on the cusp of hitting peak shipment levels. Bottom line, Apple could really use a completely different kind of hardware hit. The prospect is particularly alluring because some research conducted by TECHnalysis Research last fall shows that there is actually some surprisingly large pent-up demand (in theory at least) for an Apple-branded car. In fact, when asked about the theoretical possibility of buying just such an automobile, 12% of the 1,000-person sample said they would “definitely” buy an Apple car. (Note that 11% said they would definitely buy a Google-branded car.) Obviously, until such a beast becomes a reality, this is a completely speculative exercise, but remember that Tesla currently has a tiny fraction of one percent of car sales in the US. If it doesn’t make sense or seem feasible to offer just a portion of an automotive experience and if doing a complete branded car seems out of reach, what other options are left? Look at the possibility of an Apple car from another perspective, however, and a number of serious questions quickly come to mind. First, is the fact that it’s really hard to build and sell a complete car if you’re not in the auto industry. From component and supplier relationships, to dealer networks, through government-regulated safety requirements, completely different manufacturing processes, and significantly different business and profitability models, the car business is not an easy one to successfully enter at a reasonable scale. Sure, there’s the possibility of finding the auto equivalent of an ODM (Original Device Manufacturer) to help with many of these steps, but there’s no Foxconn equivalent for cars in terms of volume capacity. At best, production levels would have to be very modest for an ODM-built Apple car, which doesn’t seem like an Apple thing to do. Speaking of which, the very public nature of the auto business and the need to reveal product plans and subject products for testing well in advance of their release is also very counter to typical Apple philosophy. Similarly, while creating software solutions for existing car makers is technically intriguing, the idea of Apple merely supplying a component on products that are branded by someone else seems incredibly unlikely. Plus, most car vendors are eager to maintain their brand throughout the in-car experience, and giving up the key software interfaces to a “supplier” isn’t attractive to them either. So, then, if it doesn’t make sense or seem feasible to offer just a portion of an automotive experience and if doing a complete branded car seems out of reach, what other options are left? (And let’s be honest—in an ideal situation, autonomous driving capabilities should be completely invisible to the driver, so what’s the brand value for offering that?) Theoretically, Apple could come up with some type of co-branded partnership arrangement with a willing major car maker, but again, does that seem like something Steve would do? There’s no doubt Apple has the technical ability and financial wherewithal to pull off an Apple car if they really wanted to, but the practical challenges it faces suggest it’s probably not their best option.

Only 200 of the machines were ever made, and each was built by hand. To say that Apple I computers are rare might be a bit of an understatement. However, a museum in Seattle, Washington has just acquired the rarest of the rare. The Living Computers museum, founded by Paul Allen of Microsoft fame, has obtained Steve Jobs’ personal Apple I computer and placed it on display. The computer had previously been owned by Don Hutmacher, an early employee of Apple. Apparently, Don had grabbed the computer back in 1985 after Jobs had left the company for the first time. According to TechCrunch, Hutmacher died in 2016 leaving it to his wife. Rather than allowing the computer to collect dust, she is allowing the museum to display and care for it. Curators were unsure if the item was genuine, but a full inspection revealed that it was certainly an Apple I and a unique one at that. In fact, a tag with the initials “BF” on the inside seems to indicate that Bill Fernandez, Apple’s first employee hired after incorporation, was the one who built it. A circled “2” in the corner of the tag may also mean that it was the second one ever assembled. That is speculative, but considering each computer was hand-built, it would make sense that they would be numbered. This particular computer was unique from the rest, not just because it was the one that Jobs kept in his office as a demo model, but because it is the only one housed in a chassis. Apple I computers were built on boards with no housing. This one was also different from the rest in that it had been fitted with a custom EPROM. The Apple I did not have a ROM or any other permanent storage solution. Since Steve wanted to use it as a demo, he had the EPROM set up to initialize the computer and boot up with BASIC. It also appears to have extra RAM to help prevent it from crashing during demonstrations. Living Computers is a hands-on museum, but obviously, curators are reluctant to allow patrons to handle such a rare device. Since the gallery is host to two other Apple I computers, technicians decided to modify one of the other units and outfit it with the contents of the EPROM from Jobs’ computer, and allow the public to handle it. If you are ever in Seattle and are into vintage computers, pay Living Computers a visit. They have enormous mainframes from the 1960s and even a couple old Altair 8800s. Best of all, you can play with and touch everything. Well, except for maybe the second Apple I ever built, but at least you can see it.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Global Flexible OLED Market Analysis & Forecast, 2016–2024 Sarasota, FL — (SBWIRE) — 04/18/2017 — Zion Market Research, the market research group announced the analysis report titled „Flexible OLED Market: Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecasts 2016–2024„ Global Flexible OLED Market: Overview Flexible OLED stands for flexible organic light emitting diode. Flexible OLEDs are manufactured on flexible substrates and works on the same. These flexible OLEDs are more flexible, lighter, and thinner as compared to conventional glass-based displays. Flexible OLEDs are generally seen in Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. They accommodate thin films of organic semiconductors of thickness about 100 nanometers, emitting light. Flexible OLEDs use a flexible plastic as the substrate, which is made up of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). For instance, Apple is launching „Revolutionary” iPad with flexible OLED display in 2018. The design will come up with radical changes along with flexible AMOLED panel. This is anticipated to increase the overall sale of Apple. Global Flexible OLED Market: Segmentation The global flexible OLED market is segmented on the basis of materials used as amorphous and solution-castable amorphous flexible OLEDs, and crystalline flexible OLEDs. The crystalline flexible OLEDs segment is further sub-segmented as poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK), PET, and polyethylene naphtholate (PEN). Amorphous and solution-castable amorphous segment is further sub-segmented as polyethersulphone and polycarbonate. Based on the technology, the flexible OLED market is bifurcated as AM OLED, SM OLED, PM OLED, PH OLED, and P-OLED. On the basis of application, the global market is divided as micro-displays, mobile phones, televisions, tablets and notebooks, automotive and aerospace, industrial, wearable electronics, and others. The automotive and aerospace application segment is the leading segment in the global market. Request Free Sample Report @ https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/sample/flexible-oled-market Global Flexible OLED Market: Growth Factors Technological advancement is the major driving factor of the global flexible OLED market. Moreover, rising disposal income and growing electronics industries are also impacting the global market growth in a positive way. Changing customer preferences for electronic products with new technology is expected to boost the flexible OLED market in the near future. Huge investment in research and development (R&D) by many companies in order to improve the production is also anticipated to impact the global market in a positive way.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive From zebras to cupcakes, Ignite High Desert presenters will speak on a variety of topics Tuesday Apr 18, 2017 at 1:01 PM Apr 18, 2017 at 5:49 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Ignite High Desert may have a new location this year, but its aim is still to spark critical thinking and problem-solving conversation among community leaders and residents. Organizers of the fourth annual event, hosted by the Hesperia Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, said this year’s Ignite will be held at the Apple Valley Conference Center and will feature 14 speakers who have five minutes to share their “burning ideas” and stories. “Ticket sales are going well, but we’re not yet sold out,” Event organizer Sam Thatte told the Daily Press. “The speaker lineup is super exciting this year.” Chris Ackerman, who has spoken at previous Ignite events, will open the event with his message, "What is Ignite?" Other speakers include: Rebekah Curtis: “Hello...My Name is Diabetes” Bryce Dettorre: “Your B.S.” Robert Du Haime: “How to Break Through Self-Limiting Fears” Bryan Dunn: “Don't Know Where Ye've Been Laddie, but I See Ye've Taken First Prize: The Intriguing History of the Scottish Tartan” Irene Gaulke: “Don’t be a Naked Cupcake” T. Fay Griffin: “How to Fit a Round Peg in a Apple Shaped Hole” Lindsay Kerry: “Generation of Me?” Kathie Martin: “Grief in the Digital Age” Amanda Meere: “The Lyme Light” Molly Jo Realy: “How to be a Zebra on Social Media” Christina Rudsell: “Collect Moments, Not Things” James Quigg: “The Blue Cut Fire and the Blue Cut Teapot” Caroll Yule: “You are One of 7 Billion!” Realy said her presentation will explain how people who use social media are like zebras, with each zebra "Striped differently — much like a fingerprint with a different pattern.” An author who speaks at the High Desert branch of the California Writer’s Club, Realy joked that she’s speaking at the event because Thatte did not accept her many rejections. “I do a lot of speaking so I don’t have the pre-ignite jitters,” Realy said. “I get nervous after events — reviewing my presentation mentally and wishing I would have phrased something differently.” Held in Hesperia the last two years, previous speakers have included Assemblyman Jay Obernolte and former Hesperia Mayor Eric Schmidt. Each Ignite speaker will use a 20-slide presentation and is limited to five minutes on stage covering a topic, not a product or business. Hesperia Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Brad Letner said the event was moved to Apple Valley in order to share the spirit of Ignite with the entire High Desert. Known as Ignite Talks, Ignite is a worldwide event carried out in over 100 cities, inspiring attendees one innovative speech at a time. Thatte pitched the idea to the Hesperia Chamber in hopes of bringing the event to the entire High Desert community. The event also will include food samples, a cash bar and vendors. Advance tickets are $20. Tickets at the door are $25. Ignite High Desert is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. Thursday at the Apple Valley Conference Center, 14975 Dale Evans Parkway.

We like this definition. Flexible OLED stands for flexible organic light emitting diode. Flexible OLEDs are manufactured on flexible substrates and works on the same. Sarasota, FL — (SBWIRE) — 04/18/2017 — Zion Market Research, the market research group announced the analysis report titled "Flexible OLED Market: Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecasts 2016–2024" Global Flexible OLED Market: Overview Flexible OLED stands for flexible organic light emitting diode. Flexible OLEDs are manufactured on flexible substrates and works on the same. These flexible OLEDs are more flexible, lighter, and thinner as compared to conventional glass-based displays. Flexible OLEDs are generally seen in Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. They accommodate thin films of organic semiconductors of thickness about 100 nanometers, emitting light. Flexible OLEDs use a flexible plastic as the substrate, which is made up of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). For instance, Apple is launching "Revolutionary" iPad with flexible OLED display in 2018. The design will come up with radical changes along with flexible AMOLED panel. This is anticipated to increase the overall sale of Apple. Global Flexible OLED Market: Segmentation The global flexible OLED market is segmented on the basis of materials used as amorphous and solution-castable amorphous flexible OLEDs, and crystalline flexible OLEDs. The crystalline flexible OLEDs segment is further sub-segmented as poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK), PET, and polyethylene naphtholate (PEN). Amorphous and solution-castable amorphous segment is further sub-segmented as polyethersulphone and polycarbonate. Based on the technology, the flexible OLED market is bifurcated as AM OLED, SM OLED, PM OLED, PH OLED, and P-OLED. On the basis of application, the global market is divided as micro-displays, mobile phones, televisions, tablets and notebooks, automotive and aerospace, industrial, wearable electronics, and others. The automotive and aerospace application segment is the leading segment in the global market.

And while it’s not available yet, one of the standout partners announced was Apple Music. Near the end of his presentation at Facebook’s F8 conference this afternoon, David Marcus, head of Messenger, said, “I’m really excited to share with you that Apple Music will soon be on the platform as well.” Listen without leaving Messenger There weren’t any details beyond that, and Apple Music only got a “coming soon” label, so there isn’t even a firm ETA on when it’ll be available. But Facebook and Apple have worked together before on music integrations — songs from Apple Music can be embedded in the News Feed — so it isn’t a huge surprise to see this partnership, even from the usually go-it-alone Apple. From the sound of it, the integration will allow people to browse Apple Music from inside of Messenger, find a song, and send it into their chat. Everyone will then be able to play the song back without leaving Messenger, which is a huge plus over how Facebook’s older integrations work, kicking users out to separate apps. Of course, you’ll almost certainly still need a subscription to hear a full song. For those who don’t want to wait, Spotify is launching an extension that does all of this right away. Spotify first started working inside Messenger just over a year ago, but it wasn’t a great experience since you had to go out to Spotify to both find and listen to a song.

In late 2013, Apple began offering the software for free to anyone that purchased a new Apple device — either a Mac or iPhone / iPad — on or after September 1st, 2013. Owners of older hardware who wanted to install the apps had to pay for them. iMovie and Garageband were $4.99 for iOS, according to 9to5Mac, and the iWork apps were each $9.99. Some of their desktop Mac counterparts were more expensive; iMovie was $14.99 and Pages, Numbers, and Keynote were the priciest at $19.99 each. Apple’s Eddy Cue at a 2013 event. Previously, these apps were only “free” with a recent Apple hardware purchase. But now, no one has to pay anything to use these apps anymore. Some of them — GarageBand in particular — remain killer apps for iOS with no direct Android competitor. (Google has said that it plans to include new APIs and features focused on musicians in Android O.) Some are great, others are okay, but none of them are really bad, so they’re definitely worth trying if you somehow haven’t yet.

The company is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this fall, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look, according to people familiar with the matter. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the people said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait because supply constraints could mean the device isn't readily available until one or two months after the typical fall introduction. The iPhone is Apple's most important product, representing about two-thirds of sales. It also leads customers to buy other Apple devices like the iPad and Apple Watch, and serves as a home for lucrative services like the App Store. This year's new iPhone lineup comes at a critical time. Last year, Apple broke its typical upgrade cycle by retaining the same iPhone shape for a third year in a row and endured a rare sales slide. Samsung's new S8 lineup has also been thus far well received after last year's Note 7 battery debacle. For the premium model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device, according to people familiar with the matter. That results in a display slightly larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, the people said. Apple is also aiming to reduce the overall size of the handset by integrating the home button into the screen itself via software in a similar manner to Samsung's S8, the people said. The overhauled iPhone will use an organic light-emitting diode display that more accurately shows colours, while the other two phones will continue to use liquid crystal display technology and come in the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple's iPhone feature and design plans are still in flux and can change, they added. For its redesigned phone, Apple has tested multiple prototypes with manufacturing partners in Asia, including some versions that use curved glass and stainless steel, according to one of the people. One of the latest prototype designs includes symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back. The curves are similar in shape to those on the front of the iPhone 7. The new OLED screen itself is flat, while the cover glass curves into a steel frame. The design is similar conceptually to the iPhone 4 from 2010. An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides. Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007, one of the people said. Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone's fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version, which would be technically challenging, the people said. Samsung also tried this approach for the S8, but ended up installing a more standard fingerprint reader on the back of its phone due to the challenges, another person said. Significant camera changes are also in testing for Apple's overhauled iPhone. For the back of the phone, Apple is testing versions of the phone with the dual-camera system positioned vertically, instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which could result in improved photos, according to people familiar with the matter. For the front-camera, Apple is testing dual-lenses, one of the people said. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have single front cameras.

Its answer to Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Google's, um, Google Assistant was to be called Bixby. And it would, according to Samsung Mobile CTO and Bixby architect Injong Rhee, be an "interface revolution." Well, the reviews are in and Bixby is more Shixby. Samsung has a lot to do with the release of its Galaxy S8: the company was making significant headway against Apple's iPhone with its Galaxy range. It offered phone hardware that was in many respects better than Apple's and included features that have still yet to appear in the iPhone. But then came the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries, which led to a massive recall. The S8 not only has to deal with the fact that people are waiting to compare it with Apple's new iPhone, expected this summer, but also get over the brand damage of the exploding batteries. Presumably, the company thought that crowing about Bixby and how it would also connect with other Samsung devices – everything from TVs to fridges via VR glasses – would give it that edge. About the voice thing... But then it confirmed just one week before launch that the Bixby voice assistant would not actually come with the "voice" part. Instead, customers will have to wait until "later this spring" – a vague timeframe that in the tech world means anything from the end of May to January next year. If the failure to actually include the most important element of Shixby in the phone wasn't bad enough, early reviewers are also unimpressed with what the digital assistant can do on the phone itself. "Bixby is an intelligent user interface," said CTO Rhee last month, stressing that it would focus on the phone's functions rather than trying to act like a digital encyclopedia. But that intelligence appears to comprise little more than flashing up information derived from apps – like things trending on Twitter, things in your calendar and breaking news. These things already exist in other (Apple and Google) phones. And there are countless apps that do the same, sometimes better. Samsung has dedicated an entire button on its phone to Bixby. The desperate drive for a digital assistant so the company doesn't get left behind has even led to Samsung going against one of the features that people most like its phones for: keeping unnecessary clutter to a minimum. In fact, some reviewers have reported that they are using Google's Assistant – which also comes on the S8 – in preference to Shixby, putting Samsung in the embarrassing Apple camp where people shove unwanted apps forced on them by Cupertino into an "Apple shit" folder. So what do we have? When it admitted voice wasn't coming at launch, Samsung tried to put a brave face on it by hyping up the stuff that Bixby would do: "Bixby will make your phone more helpful by assisting in completing tasks, telling you what you're looking at, learning your routine and remembering what you need to do," it said, flagging up Home, Reminder and Vision. Home is a little menu that pops up when you hit the dedicated Bixby button on the side. It does the same as every other smartphone on the market – aggregating recent alerts from your apps. To make it worse, the promise of customizing what pops up when you press the Bixby has been removed at the last minute, so you are stuck with whatever Samsung decides you need (how very Apple). Reminder is exactly that and no more: a reminder app. Leaving Vision. Which is pretty much the only thing that people like about Shixby. It helps you buy things (oh, thank god because we all have trouble finding things to buy). Basically it's RedLaser or Amazon Flow but built into the phone: press an icon while looking through the camera to scan a barcode. But this is not something that people are going to use all the time, especially when there are apps like Amazon's main app, which lets you do the same. Vision also does translation – point it at a sign and get a translated version – but apparently doesn't work as well as other existing apps. Samsung swears that this will all get much, much better soon. The inclusion of voice will make it work much better, and it will shortly start integrating with other products (think smarthome tech and saying "turn off the lounge lights" into your phone). And the company intends to open it up to third parties – which might, if done well, help it become the smartphone version of Amazon's Alexa. But that's all future possibilities. All we know for sure right now is that Samsung has significantly under-delivered. Shixby it is. ® Tips and corrections 9 Comments More from The Register Samsung Galaxy S8: Slimmer bezels, a desktop mode – and yet another me-too AI pal Pics And it doesn't explode ... hopefully 62 Comments Samsung Galaxy S8 will be a no-show at MWC, exec says MWC 2017 Preview of next flagship delayed as embers of Note 7 debacle still burn 9 Comments Siri, clone yourself and dive into this Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone Say hello to Bixby – Sammy's hopefully non-exploding AI assistant 49 Comments VMware, Citrix to have a crack at desktops on docked smartphones Samsung Galaxy S8 can do it natively.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Facebook confirms Apple Music integration coming soon to Messenger Christian Zibreg on April 18, 2017 0 Apple has offered an Apple Music API for some time now and Facebook leveraged it to integrate the service with Music Stories, a song-sharing feature available within its mainland iOS app. Soon, Apple Music will integrate with the Messenger platform, too (currently used by more than 1.2 billion people every month). At the F8 conference today, the social networking behemoth announced that Spotify integration will be available on Messenger at launch and Apple Music real soon. Near the end of his F8 presentation, Messenger head David Marcus confirmed that Apple Music is one of the standout partners for the app’s new integrations. “I’m really excited to share with you that Apple Music will soon be on the platform as well,” he said. As for Spotify, its own Messenger extension is available at launch. Using Messenger’s new chat extensions, Spotify’s updated bot lets you access (within chats) your playlist recommendations based on mood, activity or genres. Chat extensions let users contextually bring a bot into a chat to collaborate on tasks like creating shopping lists, ordering food, splitting payments, sharing music and more. You can also search and share Spotify songs, albums and playlists into your chat and preview 30-second clips directly within Messenger. To activate the chat extension, tap the blue plus icon to the left of Messenger’s text field while in a conversation, the select the Spotify bot. As mentioned, you’ve been able to embed songs from Apple Music in your News Feed since November 2015 with the Music Stories feature. That said, the new integration on Messenger will go much deeper than Music Stories. If Spotify’s chat extension is an indication, users should be able to find a song on Apple Music and send it into their chat with inline playback, without leaving the app. An Apple Music membership will likely be required to hear a full song within Messenger. To stay in touch with the latest from F8, be sure to check out the official F8 website, download Facebook’s F8 app for iPhone from App Store or add the F8 bot from within Messenger. Facebook Messenger is a free download from App Store.

Logitech introduced the Pop Smart Button on Tuesday, and it works with Apple HomeKit-enabled devices, like smart blinds, light bulbs and more. Tap it, and you can have the smart devices in your house execute pre-determined tasks. Trust me, it's a lot different from a light switch. As we rely more on our gadgets, it's easy to control anything from around the house. It's harder, however, to control multiple devices at once. And what if your phone is on another floor? That's where the Pop Smart Button comes in. The Pop Smart Button is just a tiny device, about the size of a small coffee-table coaster. You can place them all around your house — on your bedside table, on the wall, on the counter — and program them to do all sorts of tasks. Logitech Maybe you want to set the lights to dim in the dining and living room at night, for example, while also locking the door and activating your alarm. A couple taps of the Pop Switch can do all of that. It can also be programmed with Sonos to play certain tunes or stations, or configured with a Logitech Harmony remote to start movies on your TV. Logitech The kit, which will retail for $59.99, includes a bridge that connects to an outlet and each Pop Smart button. Each button can store up to three different commands, so you can assign actions to one tap, two taps or a press-and-hold gesture on the button. Better yet, the Pop Smart Button has up to five years of battery life, so you won't need to worry about charging it or replacing the batteries. The Pop Smart Button is launching in Apple Stores and on Apple.com soon, with wider availability planned for later this year. Todd HaseltonTechnology Product Editor

Using the Spotify chat extension, users can search and share Spotify songs, albums, and playlists. Song links will play 30 second clips, with users able to tap on a link to open the Spotify app to listen to a full song. The Spotify bot, in addition to allowing songs to be shared, will offer up playlist recommendations to users based on mood, activity, and genre. It's not clear if Apple will introduce a similar feature. Apple has made an effort to make Apple Music widely available on multiple platforms and services. It already integrates with the main Facebook app, and there's also an Android app and an iMessage extension. Spotify is available in Facebook Messenger first, with Apple Music integration coming at a later date.

Apple makes iWork, iMovie & GarageBand apps free to all Mac & iOS users Posted 11 hours ago by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Audi’s latest concept is a new all-electric Tesla Model X competitor Apple quietly rolled out updated versions of its iWork, iMovie and GarageBand apps on Mac and iOS today, making them free for all customers on both platforms. Many customers already had free copies of these apps, as they came free with new Mac or iOS devices. The pricing change, however, removes the requirement to have bought new Apple hardware to get the apps for free. This expands the apps’ reach to anyone using Apple devices, even if they never bought new or are using older devices. The news of the price change was first reported by MacRumors, and we’ve confirmed. iWork is actually a suite of productivity apps — Numbers, Keynote and Pages — meant to rival Microsoft Office and Google Docs. Meanwhile, GarageBand and iMovie are more consumer-focused tools, for music and video editing. Prior to the price change, the Mac versions of the iWork apps were $19.99 and the iOS versions were $9.99 apiece for those customers who hadn’t bought a new device in the past few years. iMovie and GarageBand for Mac were $14.99 and $4.99, respectively, and their iOS counterparts were $4.99 on the App Store. Since late 2013, Apple had been bundling these apps with new iPhones, iPads, iPod touch devices and Macs, or making them free to download. Below is a list of the now free apps, along with the software version requirements needed to run the latest versions: iWork Mac: macOS 10.12 or later iWork iOS: iOS 10.0 or later iMovie Mac: macOS 10.11.2 or later iMovie iOS: iOS 9.3 or later GarageBand Mac: macOS 10.10 or later GarageBand iOS: iOS 10.2 or later   0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase iWork Description iWork is an office suite of desktop applications created by Apple for the Mac OS X operating system.

BODE MARKS Popular Stories UPDATE: Police release video of terrifying clown robber Donations flow for teen who had arm amputated LOTTO WIN: Ipswich man's 'heart-pounding' moment Local Real Estate Subscribe Now WITH only four sites in Queensland, Springfield could be set to get its very own Apple store. The popular store was the talk of many Facebook users recently, with the mention of a potential store putting Springfield on the map for Apple customers across the region. As part of a post on the Greater Springfield Facebook page, the idea for a Springfield Apple store drew a range of comments, with Kmart and the distance to other current Apple stores the main themes. "A Kmart, Chemist Warehouse and a few more clothes stores would be far more appropriate," KC Jane said. "When is Kmart coming?" Stefanie Webb said. "Chemist Warehouse and Kmart first!" Jo Price said. "Yes! Besides Kmart this would be the best," Samantha Surgeoner said. "Yes please, saves me driving to Robina," Nicole Gebbie said. "Oh thank god! No more driving to Carindale!" Tania Gimbert said. "I'll be very surprised if it happens. They are known for only having them in major centres like Westfield. Orion would have to become four times the size for that to happen," Brendon Moffatt said. Springfield Land Corporation Commercial Development Director, Naren Sinnathamby, said there was nothing set in stone yet, but was interested in hearing what Springfield residents had to say about the idea. "The opening of an Apple store is super tentative, but we posted the idea on Facebook as we wanted Apple to see for themselves what the reaction would be like," Mr Sinnathamby said. "I think the age of social media gives people the option of voicing their opinion on things and I think it's a good thing for the business owners to see." Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce President, Neil Coupland, said he thought it would be great for the people of Springfield and also a good thing for Orion Springfield Central. "I think it would be awesome because if you go to any Apple store, it's almost like a feature store or something iconic," Mr Coupland said. "It's a funky concept and I think it would be a great draw card for the shopping centre. "I think it would also employ a lot of people and provide more job opportunities than some of the other similar retail stores." Apple currently has stores in Carindale, Brisbane City, Robina and Chermside. apple store Read More Login to follow orion springfield central Read More Login to follow springfield Read More Login to follow Topics:  apple store orion springfield central springfield 0 PRINT Have your say Just In Ipswich juniors enjoy silver success Doctors on alert for virus after CQ patient's 'suspicious rash' Sharks teammates back Bird to star A few home truths when purchasing See this outsider's stunning victory in Ipswich Headspace issues warning against Netflix's 13 Reasons Why Top Stories BOMB HOAX: Redbank Plaza evacuated as police called to bank A MAJOR bank was evacuated after a bomb threat was called in this afternoon.

Last week, Wall Street was buzzing about a Disney acquisition. Today, an analyst floats the idea of Netflix. By Emily Bary April 18, 2017 1:43 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple’s original-video efforts are underwhelming. An acquisition of Netflix would help the company become a real player in video. Illustration: Getty Images If the iPhone is investors’ favorite thing about Apple, the company’s “services” segment likely ranks second. Apple’s services business -- things like Apple Music, iTunes, and iCloud -- is growing quickly, provides a recurring revenue stream, and helps drive up overall profit at the company. CEO Tim Cook hopes to double its revenue within four years, to about $50 billion annually. Get the best of Barron's Next every weekday. By signing up, I agree to the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.

That’s an ambitious goal, but Credit Suisse analyst Kulbiner Garcha thinks Apple can meet it more quickly -- in just three years. The catch: The company needs to find a way to really compete in video. [Our take: it wouldn’t hurt if the services were also just better.] Apple could continue to sell downloadable movies and shows via iTunes, Garcha wrote Tuesday, but there’s less of a market for these now that streaming options are available. What the company needs is a recurring revenue from its video offerings. Garcha points out that Apple could create a live-streaming service for traditional networks, much like DirecTV Now, or it could start investing heavily in original content so that people would consider paying a monthly fee for a subscription, much like Netflix. So far, though, Apple’s original-video efforts are underwhelming. The company might also consider a big acquisition. Disney was floated as a possibility by another analyst last week, but Garcha thinks Netflix makes the most sense given the demand for streaming content. “Of the available assets, we believe Netflix is the best fit all around, even if it’s a low probability event,” Garcha wrote. Big Picture: Consensus is growing around Apple’s need for video content. The debate: Create its own or make a big acquisition.

Oritsetimeyin Nengite stole an Apple Macbook, iPhone 7 and Apple Watch from a flat at Mercia Lodge in the city centre and then sold them on to Cash Generators pretending to be the legal owner. The 20-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of theft as a trespasser and three counts of fraud by false representation when he appeared at Coventry Magistrates’ Court. He was given a 182-day prison sentence suspended for a year and a community order including 180 hours unpaid work and a rehabilitation activity requirement. Nengite, of The Butts, Spon End, was also ordered to pay £1,100 compensation, £185 court costs and a £115 victim surcharge. Other cases heard at Coventry Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday, March 7, included: Farouck Ali, 61, of Cambridge Street, Hillfields, admitted failing to provide a specimen. He was banned from driving for two years, given 100 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay £135 court costs and a £85 victim surcharge. Carl Barnes, 41, of Tom Mann Close, Longford, admitted a breach of the peace and was bound over to the sum of £100. John King, 43, of Coundon Road, Coundon, admitted stealing a bottle of Prosecco worth £10 from Iceland. He was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £75 court costs and a £20 victim surcharge. Ksenija Solnceva, 37, of Mohawk Bend, Bannerbrook Park, admitted drink-driving in Earlsdon Road (breath 60, limit 35). He was banned from driving for 17 months, fined £450 and ordered to pay £150 court costs and a £45 victim surcharge. Graham Wright, 65, of Wigston Road, Woodway Park, admitted speeding. He had three points endorsed on his driving licence, fined £150 and ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £30 victim surcharge.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Philip Bump By Philip Bump April 18 at 3:02 PM Follow @pbump If you pick up your iPhone and ask Apple’s personal assistant software the age of Mets third baseman David Wright, you get a direct answer: Wright, born in 1982, is 34 years old. You also get some ancillary information: A photo, his height, a nickname that no one uses. Apple’s Siri. Ask Google’s artificially intelligent question-answering system, same deal. David Wright is 34. Google’s Assistant. But until Monday evening if you were to ask the same question of Alexa, the Amazon system that powers the company’s Echo devices, you got a much different response. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) David Wright, according to Alexa/Echo, is 234 years old — by far the oldest person on the Mets roster or in professional baseball or in the recorded history of the human race. Wright may be injured a lot, but that’s only because he’s older than the Constitution of the United States. The Alexa app suggests that maybe you’d like to learn more about Wright at Microsoft’s search engine Bing. If you do so, you learn that Wright is … 34 years old. Microsoft’s Bing. I first noticed this bug back when David Wright was only 233. At my sister’s house, we were for some reason suddenly curious about how old the Mets all-star was, so we asked her Echo, which stands in the corner of her living room. “Alexa,” we said, triggering the device to listen, “how old is David Wright?” When we learned he was over two centuries old, we were obviously intrigued. Over time, we’d ask the same question repeatedly, to see if the error was fixed. Repeatedly, it was not. It is now, because, at long last, I reached out to Amazon to try to figure out where the problem was. Over email and on the phone, the company’s Art Pettigrue explained how Alexa works — and why, in this case, it didn’t. So let’s walk through what happened, step by step. When you make a request of an Echo device (I have the hockey-puck-sized Dot), you get it to listen by prefacing your request with a “wake word,” usually “Alexa.” (Recently, the company expanded the list of wake words it accepts to include “Echo” and “Computer.”) It’s always listening to what you say, but it doesn’t do anything until you say the wake word — which is why it’s called a “wake” word. At that point, the device begins recording what you are saying, isolating the request you’ve made. The Echo doesn’t do anything with that question itself. It simply ships the question off to Amazon over the Internet in the form of an audio recording. Once it’s at Amazon, the processing begins. First, Pettigrue explained, Alexa figures out what you’re trying to ask. This is harder than it may sound, requiring the system to pick out a consistent phrase from background noise of conflicting speech patterns. If you’re listening to music as you ask your question, for example, Alexa needs to understand that you’re asking “how old is David Wright” not “how old I shot the is David Wright sheriff but I.” Amazon calls this “automatic speech recognition.” Then once Alexa has your question, it figures out what exactly you’re asking. In this case, the system needs to understand that I’m looking for the age of someone named David Wright. The Amazon term here is “natural language understanding.” “A human being is very good at disambiguating multiple responses,” Pettigrue explained, “but with a voice interface you want to try to make the one, right choice from the very beginning for them.” So now Alexa knows what we’re looking for. At this point, the system dips into “a variety of trusted sources” (per Pettigrue) to figure out an answer, if possible. In this case, it’s clear that Alexa knew which David Wright I was referring to, given that the response was exactly 200 years off. (Pettigrue said that he’d tried to track down other possible David Wrights with whom Alexa might be confusing the Met — without luck.) It’s just that, in the database, Wright’s year of birth was incorrect, apparently identifying him as having been born in 1782, at the tail end of the Revolutionary War. Pettigrue said that this was a function of data being input incorrectly by a human user, but was “not able to share the exact source of the error.” (It has, as noted above, already been corrected.) Once Amazon has its answer — correct or not — it uses a text-to-speech tool called Alexa Voice Service to convert the answer into an audio file that gets passed back to your Echo. When it receives that audio file, your Echo plays it, informing you that David Wright is 234 years old, which he isn’t. There is a saying in the computing world: Garbage in, garbage out. Computers — even sophisticated artificial intelligence systems — are simply connections and calculators that manipulate raw data that they are given. Amazon’s Alexa does a very good job of figuring out what you’re asking it, analyzing English language speech patterns to pick out what particular (admittedly simple) question you’re hoping it will answer. But if it’s pulling information from a database that has a garbage birth date for the person you’re wondering about, it will spit out a garbage answer. The good news for Mets fans is that David Wright is not 234 years old. The bad news is that, once again, he’s on the disabled list.

 Apple just made its Microsoft Office killer free — here's how to download it Kif Leswing Apr. 18, 2017, 2:31 PM 66,592 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Pages app for MacApple It's not as well-known as Microsoft Word, but Apple makes a complete suite of office apps called iWork that directly competes with Microsoft Office.  Now Apple's productivity apps have gone free. On Tuesday, Apple made the latest versions of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote for iPhones, iPads, and Mac free. We first saw the news on MacRumors.  Previously, the Mac versions of these apps cost $19.99 per app, and the iOS versions cost $9.99 per app. However, Apple has included its first-party apps for free with new iPads and Macs in the past, so you might already have already downloaded these apps.  Apple also made iMovie and GarageBand free for iOS and Mac as well. Previously, the iOS versions of those apps cost $4.99 on Apple's App Store.  Apple users can now get a fully featured word processor, slideshow app, or spreadsheet app for free by using the links below: Pages (iOS) Numbers (iOS) Keynote (iOS) Pages (Mac) Numbers (Mac) Keynote (Mac) GarageBand (iOS) GarageBand (Mac) iMovie (iOS) iMovie (Mac) NOW WATCH: Forget the iPhone 7 — here are 13 reasons the next iPhone will blow everyone away Loading video...

Anytime. Anywhere. Apple Design, Supply Issues Might Delay This Year's iPhone Release By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: APRIL 18 2017 There's rising speculation that Apple might come out with its next iPhone later than expected this year due to unresolved design and supply issues. The company, which normally releases new flagship devices in September, is said to be exploring a variety of new features that could push back the launch date. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone, which Asymco analyst Horace Dediu earlier this year proclaimed "the most successful product of all time," having sold an expected total of 1.2 bllion units from 2007 through the first half of 2017. The latest iPhone could arrive one or two months later than usual because of possible constraints on the supply of OLED screens and other materials, according to a report in Bloomberg today. It's also possible that at least one model of the new device will be called the "iPhone Edition," rather than the iPhone 8, the Japanese site Mac Otakara reported last month. Expect 'Top-of-the-Line' Handset Like its rival Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, which arrive on the market Friday, Apple's next iPhone could feature a curved-edge screen face that's nearly bezel free, various sources have reported. iPhone fans might also have to drop more cash than usual for Apple's newest phone, which is rumored to be priced in the $1,000 range. Three new iPhone models could appear in Apple's lineup this fall, including "a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look," according to Bloomberg. The article also noted that Apple is likely feeling added pressure to succeed with the new iPhone design in light of previous few models that didn't feature any big changes. The well-received Samsung Galaxy S8s could also up the ante for Apple, according to the article. Two of the new iPhones planned for launch later this year will likely be updates of 2016's iPhone 7 (pictured above): an iPhone 7s and an iPhone 7s Plus, BGR reported today. BGR added that might be the reason Apple is considering a name other than "iPhone 8" for the third device, as that could make the iPhone 7s handsets appear out of date from the moment they arrive. Could New iPhone Lose Touch ID? Ongoing design issues surrounding the new iPhones are one reason Apple might be delaying this fall's launch. Like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus hitting the market this week, Apple's update could relocate the iPhone's fingerprint sensor from the front screen to the back. It's also possible the new iPhone could drop the Touch ID sensor altogether, according to a report yesterday by MacRumors. The publication cited comments made in a research note by Pacific Crest Securities Analyst Andy Hargreaves. "We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues," Hargreaves stated. "If it's able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it's not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether." Citing unnamed "people familiar with the matter," Bloomberg today noted that Apple has ordered around 100 million OLED display screens for its new iPhones from Samsung because "other suppliers won't be ready to supply mass quantities until later."

Next Article > Samsung Galaxy S8 Pre-Order Numbers Race Past S7, Note 7 By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: APRIL 11 2017 Over just two days last week, Samsung received 550,000 pre-orders for its new Galaxy S8 smartphone, which is set to hit the U.S. market on April 21. Citing industry sources, Business Korea yesterday reported that the number of Galaxy S8 pre-orders coming in Friday and Saturday was 5 1/2 times higher than pre-orders for the Galaxy S7. The publication added that Galaxy S8 pre-orders also outpaced those for last year's fire-prone and recalled Galaxy Note 7, which had a record 400,000 pre-orders. Announced at the end of last month, the new Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are the latest iteration of Samsung's flagship smartphone. Priced starting at $720 for the 5.8-inch S8 and $840 for the 6.2-inch S8 Plus (pictured above), the new devices are being positioned as premium phones designed to compete with Apple's iPhone 8, which is expected to come out this fall. Samsung's Q1 Sales Top Apple After coming in behind Apple during the fourth quarter of last year, Samsung grabbed the top spot in global smartphone market share in the first quarter of 2017, according to a report released today by the Taiwan-based market research firm TrendForce. However, the report attributed most of Samsung's strong performance to its low-end and mid-range smartphones, rather than its premium devices. "The economically priced, high-performing Galaxy J series sustained Samsung's shipments and contributed significantly to the expansion of the brand's overall smartphone production volume," TrendForce reported. However, the report offered a more muted forecast for Galaxy S8 sales. "[T]he high-end model is expected to make limited sales contribution because the buzz surrounding the next-generation iPhone devices is dampening demand for products from non-Apple vendors," TrendForce noted. Leaks and rumors surrounding Apple's iPhone 8, which is likely to launch in September, indicate that phone could share some of the same features seen in the Galaxy S8. Design documents for the iPhone 8 show a device with a curved-edge screen and narrow bezels at the top and bottom, similar to the "Infinity Display" being introduced with the S8. Like the S8, the iPhone 8 is also believed to feature a fingerprint scanner that's been relocated to the back and a pressure-sensitive, rather than physical, home button on the front. Dual-Screen Galaxy X on the Way? In other Samsung developments, Korea's ET News and The Investor reported today that the company has ordered components that would allow it to produce 2,000 to 3,000 prototypes of a new dual-screen smartphone during the first half of this year. Citing industry sources, the publications said the prototype could be "a preliminary version of its upcoming foldable smartphone, dubbed Galaxy X." An anonymous source told ET News and The Investor, "Samsung seems to be testing the waters with the dual-screen device to gather ideas about its upcoming foldable phone." Various news reports have also suggested other companies, including Apple and Google, are planning to develop flexible screen devices in the near future. Earlier this week, for example, ET News reported that Google was considering an $877 million investment in LG Display to ensure its access to LG's OLED (organic light-emitting diode) flexible screen technology. Both Samsung and LG Display currently lead the market in flexible screen displays, and LG recently began investing billions of dollars to expand its production capabilities for that technology.

The news is according to a research note out today from Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis who speculates that Apple will likely drop the complimentary adapter sometime in the future, possibly with the 2018 lineup: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Debate whether Lightning adapter stays in box, we believe it stays this year but goes away at some point, potentially in the 2018 model The research appears to originate from supply chain intel, with the report noting that Apple supplier Cirrus Logic will benefit from the bundled adapter for which it provides components. When Apple decided to introduce the iPhone 7 as its first smartphone to ditch the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, there was much speculation regarding what adapters or alternative options the company would provide to customers. The company ultimately decided to include a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter to use old headphones via the device’s proprietary Lightning port also used for charging. It also provided a pair of Lightning EarPods with the device that connect directly and not long after introduced its $159 cord-free wireless AirPods as a premium option for use with iPhone 7. While reports early this year suggested Apple was possibly considering replacing the Lightning connector with a USB-C port, later reports from often accurate supply chain analysts said the company would instead keep its proprietary Lightning connector and implement support for faster charging.

Now Apple is totally removing the price from its iWork and iLife apps and making both suites free for all Mac and iOS users. Sony A6500 Both iMovie and GarageBand for iOS previously carried a $4.99 price for new customers using iOS devices not purchased in the last few years. Pages, Keynote, and Numbers for iOS each carried a $9.99 price for new customers on older hardware. iMovie for Mac was listed for $14.99 and GarageBand for Mac sold for $4.99. Pages, Keynote, and Numbers for Mac each carried a $19.99 price for new customers on older hardware. For new iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Macs sold since late 2013, Apple has either bundled or made free downloads available for each of these apps with free updates and the ability to re-download versions for free. The shift to going fully free for all users (via MacRumors) enables customers on older devices to now have access the latest versions of each of these apps at no cost. Apple has also shared a new document for institutions that need to distribute Apple apps through the Volume Purchase Program. The move also simplifies the price structure for iWork and iLife apps and may be one more sign that Apple plans to stop supporting 32-bit devices with iOS 11. Earlier this year Apple modified its warning on 32-bit apps that a future version of iOS would require 64-bit apps. It has since been rumored that iOS 11 will be the update that drops legacy app support which will make older apps incompatible. By making GarageBand, iMovie, and the iWork apps free on iOS, Apple prevents customers from paying for apps that may soon no longer be updated for older devices, and the strategy on the Mac unifies the price structure.

Facebook is introducing new music sharing features through its Messenger platform, and Apple Music is officially confirmed as a partner. Sony A6500 Messenger’s new music sharing feature will launch with Spotify initially, which will let users share song snippets with friends over the platform. Apple Music is already committed to integrate as well and will similarly be available in the near future. Facebook already integrates with Apple Music in the main app with a song sharing feature called Music Stories. This feature lets users share tracks from Apple Music directly to the Facebook feed where music can be previewed inline and opened in Apple Music. Here’s how the new feature will work with Spotify: Apple Music already offers a similar music sharing feature natively on iOS 10. While the new Facebook integration will come in the form of a Messenger app, Apple Music includes an iMessage app for Messages on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch that lets you share tracks including currently playing music. The latest move shows that Apple Music operates a bit differently than Apple’s other apps and services. For example, Apple Music offers its paid subscription service on Android as well and now the new sharing feature will be coming to Facebook’s Messenger.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple Launching 3 New IPhones To Celebrate IPhone’s 10th Anniversary Posted: Apr 18 2017, 12:35pm CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, Updated: Apr 18 2017, 12:48pm CDT, in News | Apple   Apple launching 3 new iPhones to celebrate the product’s 10th anniversary   The latest iPhone lineup will be revamped with an all-screen front, curved glass and a stainless steel frame Apple is preparing to launch not one but three new iPhone this coming fall. The reason for such a huge incoming haul is the iPhones upcoming 10 year anniversary. Out of the three iPhones being prepared two will be upgraded versions while the third will be a new top-of-the-line anniversary model handset. Don't Miss: Today's Electronics Bargains at Woot.com The anniversary model will come with a completely redesigned look. New components of the look will include a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials. Similarly Apple is also working to add new and improved cameras in the upcoming iPhones.  In the new iPhone lineup the special stainless steel tenth anniversary model with acurved glass will also be the flagship device. According to Bloomberg's Apple guru Mark Gurman, the anniversary models will not have the curved OLED display. Instead the new and potentially more expensive models will have curved glass on the back and front. Recently it was expected Apple will revamp the next iPhone design with a curved OLED display. However Apple now seems to have abandoned the design upgrade due to supply delays. Basically the upcoming iPhone would have an OLED screen which is the same size as the current iPhone 7 Plus. But the screen will take up most of the front of the device, meaning it will probably be somehow fitted into the body of the iPhone 7. It was previously reported Apple had ordered 100 million OLED screens from Samsung.  Although Apple will introduce the new iPhone models by fall 2017, the actual handsets will not reach the market for quite some time. Supply chain constraints could delay the device release for at least one or two months after the introduction.  This story may contain affiliate links.

Image Credit: Screenshot Apple will be introducing an Apple Music chat extension to Facebook Messenger, making it possible for people to bring the music streaming app into conversations with friends and family members and share music. Chat extensions are part of version 2.0 of Facebook’s Messenger platform. Spotify, perhaps the biggest competitor to Apple Music, is also introducing a chat extension. Within a Messenger conversation you can access Apple Music — or Spotify — by clicking the newly launched plus sign next to the text box and then finding the extension in the carousel. Apple Music is available on Android and iOS. Now it’s being packaged up in one of the most popular mobile apps that’s not controlled by Apple itself. Apple Music, which has no free tier and is only available through subscriptions, is one of the most prominent contributors to Apple’s fast-growing Services business, and the company has shown a willingness to make Apple Music widely available. Apple Music in Messenger does make sense in that context. In December Apple had more than 20 million subscribers. Apple Music does have an iMessage app, but iMessage is not available on Android.

When Samsung released its first Galaxy phone back in 2009, it was clear that the company would become a contender in the revitalized smartphone market. When it released the first Galaxy Note smartphone two years later in 2011, it was clear that Samsung wasn’t afraid to take chances. And when Samsung released the Galaxy S4 in 2013, it was clear that the company’s displays would be the best in the industry for years to come. But something else was clear during all that time. Despite Samsung’s willingness to take countless pages out of Apple’s playbook, the company’s hardware designs were still sorely lacking. The look of Samsung’s phones was boring. The thin plastic backs felt cheap and flimsy. Long story short, Samsung smartphones looked and felt like cheap iPhone knockoffs. Now, in 2017, the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ mark a changing of the guard. The torch has been passed. The student has become the teacher. Call it whatever you want, but the bottom line is this: Samsung has out-designed Apple with its new flagship smartphones. They look and feel like the future, and Apple’s three-year-old iPhone design is stuck in the past. Samsung’s transition began in 2015 when the company released the Galaxy S6. It was the first flagship phone from the South Korean electronics giant that looked and felt like a flagship phone. The smooth glass front and back were joined by a sturdy aluminum mid-frame, and there were only a few small pieces of plastic on the phone’s exterior — the small strips that separated each section of the aluminum frame, and the home button. It was official: Samsung was a premium smartphone maker. The company’s flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Note handsets have always featured cutting-edge specs. They have always offered terrific performance that was on par with the best Android phones in the business. And they have always had stunning displays with vivid colors and great contrast. Now, starting with the Galaxy S6, they also featured designs to match. But still, few people would argue that the company’s phones looked as sleek or felt as premium as Apple’s iPhones. Until now, that is. In terms of hardware design, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are the complete package. They’re industry leaders in terms of specs, as Samsung’s flagship phones always have been. They also feature Super AMOLED screens that are unrivaled. Again, this has been the norm for Samsung for years. But the biggest story in terms of Samsung’s growth as a smartphone maker is the design. Samsung has always been a follower, ever since it released its first smartphone nearly a decade ago. But now, Samsung is a leader. In fact, diehard Apple fans have been unable to find anything to complain about, so some of them have resorted to insignificant nonsense like the alignment of the USB-C port and speaker openings on the bottom of the phone. While it’s true that Apple’s alignment on the bottom of the iPhone 6/6s/7 is perfect, I’m not sure there’s a sane end user on the planet who would actually care about something like this. But it’s indicative of the difference between Samsung and Apple when it comes to attention to detail! Perhaps. Or perhaps Samsung decided it was more important to squeeze in the phone’s internal components as tightly as possible so that it could create a design with a remarkable screen-to-body ratio of 83%. Trust me, Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ users are going to appreciate the narrow bezels around the Infinity Display far more than any iPhone user appreciates his or her perfectly aligned ports. Also of note, Samsung managed to make its new flagship phones IP68 water-resistant without removing the 3.5mm headphone jack, misaligned though it may be. Read More Speaking of screen-to-body ratios, welcome to the next smartphone battleground. First, it was specs. Then, after Apple introduced the Retina Display, it was pixels. Now, beginning in 2017, it’s bezels. Every top smartphone vendor in the world is hard at work shrinking the bezels on their flagship phones so that the screen takes up as much of the phone’s face as possible. Is doing away with bezels on smartphones really that important? In a word, yes. Apart from being crucial to upcoming advances in augmented reality, barely-there bezels like the ones surrounding the Galaxy S8 display allow for a much more immersive user experience. Distractions fade away and content becomes the sole focus. Why do you think Apple has never included a logo or anything else that might be distracting on the faces of its iPhones? It’s because when someone is using his or her phone, the content on the screen is all matters. The 83% screen-to-body ratio on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ is the best in the business among top-tier global smartphone makers right now. By comparison, the three-year-old iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus design has a screen-to-body ratio of 66%. As I wrote in an earlier opinion piece, using the iPhone after having used the Galaxy S8 feels like going back to a tube TV after having upgraded to a flat-screen. On the flip side, Samsung had to remove its physical home button from the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in order to achieve such an impressive screen-to-body ratio, and the company tried its best to copy Apple with its new virtual home button. It failed. The virtual home button on Samsung’s new phones is pressure sensitive, similar to Apple’s 3D Touch home button on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple’s solution utilizes advanced pressure sensors coupled with a Taptic Engine to make pressing the virtual home button on an iPhone feel and sound like pressing a real button. On the Galaxy S8, pressing the home button feels like pressing a plain old touchscreen, and presses are accompanied by the same weak vibration feedback you’d find on any other phone. It might seem like an insignificant detail, but it’s not. As we move further toward phones that don’t have any buttons at all, advanced haptic feedback systems can make flat glass feel like a button. Apple has a huge head start in this area, and it will be quite some time before other companies catch up. Like the LG G6, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ both feature screens with a tall 18:9 aspect ratio. As a result, it’s difficult to compare their sizes to other smartphones. For example, the 5.8-inch display on the smaller Galaxy S8 is technically bigger than the screen on Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus phablet, but Apple’s screen is wider than the one on the S8. Long story short, diagonal measurements no longer tell the whole story. What matters is that both new Galaxy S8 models have nice big displays that are simply unrivaled right now. They both feature Quad HD+ (2960 x 1440) resolution, so the 5.8-inch screen on the Galaxy S8 has a pixel density of 570 ppi while the Galaxy S8+ has a 6.2-inch screen with 529 ppi. On paper, it’s a fairly big discrepancy. In reality, it’s difficult to notice a difference in most scenarios. What matters is regardless of which model you end up with, you’ll hold in your hand the finest smartphone display that has ever existed. As was the case with the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, the sides of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are curved on both the front and the back. The phones are each about the same width as comparable smartphone models from other vendors, but the curved sides help them sit more comfortably in the hand because they feel narrower. They also feel much thinner than they are thanks to the curves, though widths of 8mm for the Galaxy S8 and 8.1mm for the Galaxy S8+ aren’t very thick even without the curves on either side. Inside, the US versions of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are both powered by Qualcomm’s new 10nm octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset, which marries a 2.3GHz quad for heavy lifting with a 1.7GHz quad for everything else. When they are released on Friday, April 21st, they’ll be the first widely available smartphones in the world to feature 10nm chips, which should offer advantages both in terms of power and efficiency. You’ll also find 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM in Samsung’s new flagships, along with 64GB of UFS 2.1 flash storage and microSDXC support. I can vouch for the Snapdragon 835’s performance. Everyone has seen the benchmarks by now, but that’s only part of the story. Everything on the Galaxy S8 feels faster than on rival Android phones, from opening apps, to switching apps, to using apps. It really does feel turbocharged. In my testing over the past few days, I have yet to find anything that can trip up the phone’s performance in any meaningful way. Unfortunately, I cannot vouch for any gains in power efficiency that might be afforded by the Snapdragon 835 or any other optimizations Samsung has made in the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Samsung delivered my review unit just this past Friday, and my usage while testing the phone is obviously nothing like average usage on a day-to-day basis. Normally when I review phones, I like to beat them up with heavy testing for a couple of days and then use them normally so I can communicate real-world battery performance. What I can say about the batteries in Samsung’s new phones is that they refuel quickly. I tested Samsung’s standard fast charging via USB-C as well as its wireless fast charging, and both methods were fast to fill up the phone. As long as they don’t explode, Samsung appears to have done a fine job with the batteries in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. I believe either phone will carry a person through a full day of average usage, and they charge up very quickly to minimize the hassle on days with heavy usage. When Samsung confirmed that the rear camera on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ would be the same 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera found on the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, and Galaxy Note 7, I saw a number of bloggers and smartphone enthusiasts complain online. On one hand, I can certainly see where they’re coming from — no mobile camera is perfect, so we’re used to seeing camera tech improve with each new generation of smartphone. But on the other hand, Samsung’s Dual Pixel camera is easily one of the best in the business. In some lighting it is the best, hands down. It’s difficult to complain about such a solid smartphone camera. Samsung says that it has made some changes to the rear camera on the software side, though I really haven’t noticed much of a difference in my testing. The Galaxy S7 captured great photos, the Galaxy S7 edge captured great photos, the Galaxy Note 7 captured great photos, and now the Galaxy S8 and S8+ capture great photos. What’s not so great, however, is the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner next to the camera on the back of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The back of a phone is an awful, awful place for a fingerprint scanner. Even after you’ve spent months with a phone and you know it like the back of your hand, unlocking a smartphone with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner means blindly sliding your finger around the back before finding the scanner. It’s bad enough on phones with scanners that are placed on the center of the back, and it’s even worse with the Galaxy S8’s fingerprint reader, which is high up the back and off-center next to the camera lens. Side note: Thanks to Samsung’s scanner placement, your rear camera lens will always be covered with plenty of oil from your finger. Speaking of oil, the rear glass panel on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is not treated with an oleophobic coating like the front, so prepare for a permanent layer of grease and grime unless you plan to use a case. Of course, this issue will be familiar to anyone who has owned a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S6. The positioning of the fingerprint scanner is, without question, a poor design choice. Complaining about misaligned charging ports is stupid, but the scanner placement is a very valid complaint, and I would wager that Samsung’s own design team would agree. Rumor has it the company wanted to embed the fingerprint reader in the display itself, like Apple is rumored to be doing, but Samsung and its parts suppliers couldn’t find a way to make it work in time for mass production. If fumbling around for a fingerprint scanner doesn’t sound appealing, there are plenty of other ways to unlock your Galaxy S8. Beyond PINs, patterns, and passcodes, the S8 and S8+ also support iris scanning and facial recognition. The latter isn’t terribly secure since it has already been discovered that it can be fooled with a photo. The iris scanner is a bit more secure, but it can also be inconvenient since you have to swipe over from the lock screen by default before the phone will scan your eyes. This was done to avoid accidental unlocks when the user is trying to read notifications or check other lock screen content, which certainly makes sense. If you don’t can about seeing lock screen content, you can configure the phone so that you don’t need to swipe to scan your irises. But you obviously still have to hold the phone out in front of you and position it so that your eyes are in the alignment circles that appear at the top of the screen. It’ll never be as quick as a fingerprint scan. Moving inside the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, you’ll find a newly refined software experience. As is the case with the Galaxy S8 hardware, the company’s “Samsung Experience” software in 2017 is its best yet. Each year, Samsung continues to strip away more and more clutter, moving ever closer to a stock Android experience. Closer, yes, but make no mistake — there’s nothing stock about the Android build on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+. The first thing you’ll notice about Samsung’s software on the Galaxy S8 is that it’s fast. Very, very fast. Hardcore Android fans were upset when they found out that a special upgraded Galaxy S8 with 6GB of RAM would be made available in some Eastern markets and not in the US, but I can assure you that the Snapdragon 835 and 4GB of RAM provide more than enough oomph and memory to keep things humming along. From news readers, Twitter and email apps to media streaming apps, 3D games and more, the Galaxy S8+ powered through all my tests without a hiccup. Long story short, it can handle anything a user might throw its way. I had videos streaming in half of Samsung’s multi-window layout while I was loading large web pages in the other half, and again, not a single stutter or stammer to speak of. Apart from a few Android oddities here and there — seriously, is Google EVER going to get scroll physics right?! — the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ offer the smoothest experience you’ll find on a Google-powered smartphone. While some other manufacturers have moved away from developing their own apps when Google already offers, Samsung still insists on holding onto a few dupes. For example, you’ll find Samsung’s Gallery app in addition to the preinstalled Google Photos app, which is clearly superior. Samsung also includes its own web browser in addition to Chrome. While moves like these made precious little sense on older phones, there’s a method to the madness on the Galaxy S8. Using a device that Samsung calls DeX, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ can connect to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to power a desktop computing experience. Samsung’s apps are optimized for this experience, while third-party apps might not always perform as well in desktop mode. The DeX solution looked impressive when Samsung demoed it briefly for me last month before the Galaxy S8 was announced, but the company didn’t supply a DeX dock with my review phone so I haven’t yet been able to test it myself. Beyond Samsung’s apps, the TouchWiz experience — sorry, Samsung Experience — has been tweaked in a number of areas on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Some changes are minor, such as the option to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. Other changes are more significant, like Samsung’s move to on-screen home, back, and app switcher buttons, an obvious necessity since the physical home button was scrapped. Samsung staples like the Always On Display feature and Samsung’s customization options are all still present on the S8. There’s also an “Advanced features” section in the settings app that provides access to several Samsung-only features. Here are some examples: Smart stay: Eye detection keeps the screen on as long as you’re looking at it Game Launcher: A special launcher that can hold all your games instead of mixing them with apps in the drawer One-handed mode: Swipe up from a corner to shrink the size of the screen so everything can be reached with one hand Finger sensor gestures: Open and close the notification panel by swiping up or down on the fingerprint sensor Quick launch camera: Double-tap the power button to launch the camera Multi window: Open two apps on the screen at the same time Smart alert: This feature makes your phone vibrate when you pick it up and have missed notifications Video enhancer: This setting automatically upscales videos to enhance picture quality There are a bunch of other ones in there, and they vary in their usefulness. Another new addition to the Samsung Experience on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is Bixby. As many people might have already read, however, Bixby is a huge letdown for the time being in the US market. In a nutshell, Samsung’s voice-controlled virtual assistant can’t yet be controlled using one’s voice. The weirdest part about is that there’s a dedicated Bixby button that is supposed to offer two functions. Pressing and holding the Bixby button is supposed to launch the Bixby voice assistant, which is like Siri or Amazon Alexa. At launch, this core Bixby feature won’t actually exist; Samsung has delayed the voice portion of Bixby in the United States. Tapping the button launches the Bixby Home page, which is a collection of cards similar to Google Now. At least, it’s supposed to — the alternate method of accessing Bixby Home (swiping right on the first home screen) is the only method of accessing Bixby Home that actually works on my review unit. So, right now on my review unit, the Bixby button does nothing at all. As it stands now, Bixby Home is Samsung’s answer to Google Now. The interface is the same cascade of cards, and the content therein is similar as well, offering time, location, and context-aware content. One nifty feature that Google doesn’t yet have, however, is Bixby Vision. This is similar to the Firefly feature Amazon introduced on the ill-fated Fire phone. Point the camera at an object and Bixby will offer information and context, if it recognizes the object. Bixby Vision can also offer information about points of interest using the camera and your location, and it can translate printed text in real-time in more than 50 different languages. Bixby could grow into a very useful feature on Samsung phones, but right now it’s painfully incomplete. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ run Android 7.0 Nougat, however, so they also include the much more complete Google Assistant solution. I certainly plan to revisit Bixby once it’s a more complete product, but Google Assistant is clearly the way to go for the time being. Remember, Siri was a mess as well when it first launched, and now it has evolved into a fantastic tool that millions of iPhone owners use all the time. Give Samsung a while to work through Bixby’s initial growing pains before you dismiss Bixby completely. Nearly everything about Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ leaked long before the company actually unveiled its new flagship phones last month. We thought there was no way there would be any surprises left. While all the phones’ new features were indeed covered by the leaks and rumors that led up to the unveiling, we were still entirely unprepared for the devices Samsung showed off that day. The fact that Samsung has managed to out-design Apple is nothing short of shocking. The South Korean company has been chasing Apple ever since it first entered the smartphone market, but matching the iPhone in terms of design and build is something I never thought I would see Samsung manage. The company hasn’t just matched Apple’s iPhone design with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, it has surpassed Apple’s iPhone design. Like anyone else who has been keeping an eye on iPhone 8 rumors, I fully expect Apple to make a strong showing later this year when it unveils its redesigned tenth-anniversary iPhone. There’s a lot of time between now and September, however, and I have a feeling many Apple fans will have some soul-searching to do when they finally get the chance to check out Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ following their release this Friday, April 21st. For Android fans, meanwhile, the Galaxy S8 is a no-brainer unless you absolutely must have stock Android. There are a number of good reasons to stick with stock Android, and the timeliness of operating system updates is at the top of the list. It’s a big tradeoff though, when you consider the power, performance, and beautiful design of the Galaxy S8.

The company is expected to release three iPhone models, but the premium iPhone 8 could see a delay of up to two months due to a complete overhaul.  ( Jack Taylor | Getty Images ) Advertisement Advertisement Apple is celebrating 10 years of iPhone in 2017 and it's planning something special to mark the occasion, but the premium iPhone 8 might see a notable delay. The very first iPhone hit the scene back in 2007, when the concept of "smartphone" was still new and the mobile market was vastly different from what it is today. Things have come a long way since and the iPhone had an impressive growth, with Apple and Samsung now ruling the smartphone game as the undisputed leaders. 3 iPhone Models In 2017 To celebrate the iPhone's 10th anniversary this year, Apple is reportedly planning to release three iPhone models - two smartphones with incremental upgrades, which may arrive as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, and a third handset with premium specs and a complete overhaul, which is expected to launch as the iPhone 8. Apple is expected to unveil all three 2017 iPhone models at the same time, but the premium iPhone 8 might not go on sale until later in the year. iPhone 8 Delay According to a new report from Bloomberg, the overhauled iPhone 8 could see a significant delay of "one or two months" compared to the company's regular launch schedule. The premium handset is reportedly more difficult to manufacture, so it will take longer to bring it to market. Bloomberg's report echoes similar news from Japanese outlet Mac Otakara, which revealed back in early March that the iPhone 8 might arrive later than the other two 2017 iPhone models. The iPhone 8 is reportedly more difficult to manufacture because it will boast a design overhaul with a larger, curved-edge display that will cover most of the front panel - much like Samsung's redesigned Galaxy S8. iPhone 8 In-Display Fingerprint Authentication Apple is reportedly experimenting with fingerprint authentication as well, considering embedding the fingerprint scanner into the display. In-display fingerprint authentication would likely boost the iPhone 8's appeal, but it would also increase the complexity of manufacturing the device, thus further contributing to the delay. Samsung wanted to embed the fingerprint scanner into the display of the Galaxy S8 as well, and it even started working on it with Synaptics, but ultimately dropped the plan and launched its flagship with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, uncomfortably placed right next to the rear camera. Rumor has it that Samsung ran out of time implementing the technology and rather than delaying the Galaxy S8 launch, it opted for a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner instead. The company will likely implement the in-display fingerprint authentication with the Galaxy Note 8 expected later this year. Apple Innovation: iPhone 8 Design Overhaul Based on the latest reports, it seems that Apple is willing to delay the iPhone 8's market release to achieve the design overhaul it plans. Looking at the big picture, it makes sense. Samsung had to make up for the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, so it couldn't afford to delay the Galaxy S8 release. Apple, on the other hand, has been facing criticism over its lack of innovation in recent years and with the iPhone's 10th anniversary this year, it needs something big - releasing a boring iPhone 8 could be worse than delaying it. The iPhone 8 is further rumored to boast a number of innovative features such as a 3D, depth-sensing front camera, an OLED display, fast charging, and more. The upgrades and the design overhaul would delay the iPhone 8's release, but might make it worth the wait. Since it's all in the rumor state, however, take all leaks and reports with a grain of salt.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | April 18, 2017 0 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               Depending on where you look, there are a lot of rumors regarding the iPhones Apple plans on launching later this year. The company itself hasn't announced anything at all yet, of course, but that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from spitting out just about anything it can in regards to features and specifications on a regular basis. One of the key elements is that Apple isn't going to just launch a follow up to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. That means we're going to see another phone on top of the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus that are rumored to be unveiled this year. That extra handset is supposedly the true flagship of 2017: the iPhone 8. It's also being called the iPhone Edition and the iPhone X, and it's supposedly going to adopt a plethora of features that have been rumored for the iPhone lineup for years. That includes adopting an OLED display, adding support for wireless charging, and more. Basically what we've seen on Android devices for a long time already. A lot of these rumors are going to become true just by default eventually, because they are so lackluster that it's just a matter of time before it happens. Yes, it will be great for iPhone fans when they finally get an iPhone with an OLED screen, and yes, it'll be awesome when they get standard wireless charging support. In the grand scheme of things, the majority of these rumors are just boiled down to, "It's about time." But there's one piece of speculation that has caught my eye. One rumor has pegged the iPhone 8 starting at $1,000, and going up from there. There's some questions swirling regarding how many different variations there will be, but the shaky consensus at this point seems to be that there will be two: A 64GB model and a 256GB variant. So the 64GB iPhone 8 is rumored to start at $1,000, which means that the 256GB option could retail for $1,200 -- unless Apple breaks the consistency of its pricing and charges $1,100 for a significant upgrade in built-in storage. Either way, any one of these options is expensive. If it were simply a rumor by itself, there might not be much to stand on. But there have also been analyst reports detailing their cost expectations for different aspects of the upcoming flagship iPhone, from the inclusion of an OLED panel, different modules, the new "enhanced" camera, and more. Plus, this is an anniversary model, and Apple may see it as a sort of special edition variant. (This also means they'll probably be ridiculously hard to come by, depending on production issues that might, or still might, pop up.) Samsung has a Galaxy S8 variant, which features 6GB of RAM and 128GB of built-in storage, that is priced at $1,018. I think the existence of this phone, despite maybe not having a global launch (at least not soon), is a harbinger for what might be coming down the pipe from Apple, too. Of all the rumors out there, the inclusion of an OLED front panel and that high price tag are the ones I'm pretty sure might be the real deal. It's also possible that the 64GB iPhone 8 costs $969 and the other iPhone 8 variant retails for $1,069 or just a bit more. Right now you can buy a 256GB iPhone 7 Plus for $969. For this scenario to happen, though, I think Apple would have to drop the cost of its iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models, by at least $100 for each variant. I don't necessarily think that's impossible, because it would also spur even more buyers to go with those handsets, especially if they can't readily get their hands on the iPhone 8. So I'm wondering just how much you're willing to spend on a smartphone. Payment plans from carriers (and Apple) may make it easier to obtain, but are you still willing to fork over that kind of cash for a smartphone? Is $1,000 a reasonable price to ask for an iPhone (or any phone for that matter)? Let me know!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Meadow in the Sky now available in eBook for Kindle and Apple   View as PDF  Print View    Elizabeth Stone O’Neill is launching her first eBook (updated, revised with newly digitized illustrations) „Meadow in the Sky: A History of Yosemite’s Tuolumne Meadows Region”, available on kindle and Apple Ibook, targeting fans of the Environmental Movement. More information is available at the website: http://www.greatowlpress.com Stockton, United States – April 18, 2017 /PressCable/ — Elizabeth Stone O’Neill has backpacked and hiked, botanized and birdwatched, throughout the Sierra and other mountain ranges. She has written extensively about mountain subjects and nature in periodicals as well as in her books, Meadow in the Sky, Mountain Sage, and Tioga Tramps – the last in collaboration with her late husband, J. Carroll O’Neill, whose photographs grace many of her pages, not to mention her children’s books. O’Neill is launching her first eBook, „Meadow in the Sky: A History of Yosemite’s Tuolumne Meadows Region.” Set to go live April 17, 2017, it is available for kindle on Amazon and Ibook from Apple. The paperback remains available on line from greatowlpress.com, from Amazon and independent bookstores in and near Yosemite National Park. It is expected to become a big hit with fans of the history of the environmental movement and lovers of the mountain world. Excitement surrounds this book launch as it is the first of the author’s books to be available as an eBook. More information on the book can be found here: http://www.greatowlpress.com This is the First of 13 book O’Neill has authored. Although about the mountains in the past, it is „with some hope for the future. As long as we have the meadow, there is much left that is good in our world. May we cherish the meadow for those who will yet come with open souls and youthful hearts, as to a world newborn, and who will find peace and joy and happiness there, and perhaps wisdom. It is not too much to hope.” Meadow in the Sky: A History of Yosemite’s Tuolumne Meadows Region sets its main focus on the history of the Tuolumne Meadow Region of Yosemite National Park in California which cannot be separated from the history of the conservation movement itself.. Readers will likely find a particular interest in how the past in these mountains of California informs the very future of humankind. The book’s cover art was created by John Carroll O’Neill, Jr.. Meadow in the Sky: A History of Yosemite’s Tuolumne Meadows Region is being released by Great Owl Press. Elizabeth Stone O’Neill has a background is a graduate of the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, where she majored in French and earned a Master’s degree in Inter-American Studies with a major in History. She taught elementary school in inner-city schools and spent her vacations backpacking and climbing in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges. Her love of the area shaped the creation of the book. Her background in the mountains ignited a passion to find out more about their history and an interest in their preservation.. When asked about why she wrote the book, O’Neill said: „This book came to be because of an ending. In 1976 the National Park Service closed the walk-in campground at the Soda Springs. Benches and tables were removed, fireplaces were razed and raked clean, and one sun warmed hillside of Tuolumne Meadows returned to forest. Not a bad thing, one might say. Yet for me, and I am sure for many others, a deep sadness arose at the thought that this historic spot, site of so much history and of so many happy personal memories, was being shut down. After knowing this place for thirty years, I suddenly wondered how it came to be. This book is the result.” O’Neill hopes that through it you will share with her the joy of the mountains and of those who have loved them. May it signify for you not an ending, but a beginning. This positive outlook from the author is certainly a testament to her optimism considering some of the challenges during its creation. It was written on a portable typewriter in a trailer in Tuolumne Meadows. Any typo or change required rewriting at least an entire page. New information found also required new writing. She had none of the luxury of copy machines or computers with search engines and cut-and-paste technology. In a recent interview, the author made a point of thanking the help of many knowledgeable people. She would like to express her thanks to Dr. Mary Hill of San Francisco State University for going over the geology chapter; to Yosemite Park Indian Specialist Craig Bates and to Dr. Michael Moratto, both of whom read and commented on the Indian sections; to David Gaines of the Mono Lake Committee, who checked the material on birds; to Dr. Carl Sharsmith, who gave special attention to the geology and botany; to Dr. William A. Douglass of the University of Nevada Basque Studies Program, who read the chapter on sheepherders; to Evelyn P. Wiggen, who shared her recollections of Fran�ois Matthes; and to Lee and Dorothy Verrett, who shared their memories of Tuolumne Meadows with her. Additional thanks go to Yosemite Park Superintendent Bob Binnewies, David Gaines, Henry Berrey of Yosemite Natural History Association, Chief Park Naturalist Leonard McKenzie, Dr. Walter Payne of the University of the Pacific, Catherine Rose, Dr. Carl Sharsmith, and Yosemite Research Librarian Mary Vocelka, each of whom read the entire manuscript. Her most heartfelt appreciation is for her husband, Carroll, who introduced her to the Sierra, shared with her the joy of innumerable mountain days, read and considered the manuscript more times than anyone else, helped and encouraged her, and donated his photograph for the cover, which commemorates some of the best days of their lives.” Those interested in learning more about the book can visit here: http://www.greatowlpress.com Contact Info: Name: Adele O’Neill and David Carpenter Organization: Great Owl Press Address: 7445 Andrea Avenue, Stockton, CA 95207, United States Phone: +1-209-475-9237 For more information, please visit http://www.greatowlpress.com Source: PressCable Release ID: 187165 Recent Press Releases By The Same User Paul Gaston Petznick DMD FAGD Opens New Dental Clinic Office in Homewood Alabama (Tue 18th Apr 17) Tissue Engineering 2017 Global Market Size,Status and Forecast to 2021 (Tue 18th Apr 17) Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) Market 2017 Global Analysis,Opportunities and Forecast to 2021 (Tue 18th Apr 17) Event Management Software (EMS) Market 2017 Global Analysis, Opportunities and Forecast To 2022 (Tue 18th Apr 17) Aircraft Seat Market 2017 Global Analysis, Opportunities and Forecast To 2022 (Tue 18th Apr 17) CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Antipyretic Analgesics Market Sales Analysis and Growth Forecast by Regions, Type and Application to 2021 Next PostNext DesignMax® from WS Packaging Group Breathes Exciting New Life into Brands Search Recent Posts Silicon Valley Innovation Center (SVIC) Hosts The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan During His Visit to Silicon Valley Meet the „Strait Paloma,” a New Cocktail inspired by George Strait at Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille in Oak Brook Gold Medal Olympian, Bryan Clay Strikes Gold with ETF Fitness!

Tech Search Search Autonomous VehiclesChinese Search Behemoth Baidu Set to Launch Self-Driving Car Technology in July WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: April 19 PoliticsWhite House Meeting on Paris Climate Deal Has Been Postponed PoliticsBernie Sanders Urges Democrats to Reach Out to Trump Supporters Google This Google Chrome and Firefox Phishing Scam Is ‘Practically Impossible to Spot’ Robert Hackett Apr 18, 2017 Security experts are warning people about an incredibly devious scam that's guaranteed to trip up even the most attentive Internet users. The attack is a variety of phishing, an age-old con that involves tricking people into trusting a malicious website by directing them to a malicious link or, alternatively, into downloading a booby-trapped computer file. The hackers then steal the victims' passwords or install malware on their computers. This particular iteration of the ploy uses domain names, also known as web addresses, that look nearly identical to legitimate ones of well-known brands. This scam goes beyond the usual version where fraudsters dupe people into visiting, for example, a "gmail.com" knockoff like "gmail.co" (which has a different top-level domain), "gmial.com" (misspelled), or "gmai1.com" (where the number "1," as in one, replaces the letter "l"). Indeed, this scam is far subtler. It works like this: fraudsters are able to register domains with characters plucked from various alphabets other than the default Latin script. When displayed, it's all but impossible to tell apart a Greek "O" from a Cyrillic "O" from a Latin "O," for instance. Good luck seeing the difference between a domain like "Google.com" (Latin) from "Google.com" (Cyrillic). Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter This attack is not exactly new. The scam is called an "IDN homograph attack," and it dates back to 2001. Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert who works at IBM (ibm), warned more than a decade ago about an early version of the attack mimicking PayPal (pypl) with PayPaI, which ends in an uppercase "i" rather than a lowercase "l." The attack received renewed attention on Friday when Xudong Zheng, a web developer at the small software firm SliceOne, raised the alarm about a particular version of the scam in a blog post on his personal website. Zheng created an example site, "apple.com," to spoof the legitimate "apple.com," thus demonstrating the potential for duplicity.

This alphanumeric gobbledygook renders as "apple.com" in the web browser due to a tool called "punycode," which translates characters from Unicode, an encoding standard for computers to display thousands of kinds of symbols, including ones from many different languages, into the more limited set of characters available in ASCII, another encoding standard that only contains symbols more familiar to English readers, including "A-Z," "a-z," 0-9," and various punctuation marks. Browsers use punycode to display foreign domain names in English. So "xn--80ak6aa92e.com," which references Cyrillic letters (in Unicode), becomes "apple.com" (in ASCII). Vulnerable web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera browsers. Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Edge browsers are apparently unaffected. To see for yourself, copy and paste "xn--80ak6aa92e.com" into your web browser.; vulnerable ones convert to "apple." "I first learned about the general attack in 2011 when I purchased my first Unicode domain," Zheng told Fortune in an email. (He said he has since forgotten what that domain name was.) The issue popped back into his mind a few months ago as he was registering a new domain,"xn--s7y.co," which thanks to punycode renders as a single Chinese character, "短.co," or "short" in English. While Chrome and Firefox protect against bogus domains that mix and match letters from different writing systems, like Cyrillic and Latin, they do not protect against bogus domain names that use characters entirely from a particular language, like Cyrillic. "In many instances, the font in Chrome and Firefox makes the two domains visually indistinguishable," Zheng said in his post. Related GoogleGoogle Comes to Terms With Russian Antitrust Watchdog in Android Case Google Google Comes to Terms With Russian Antitrust Watchdog in Android Case In many cases, the only way to catch the deceit is to check a site's SSL certificate, a digital file that cryptographically verifies a site's identity. In Chrome you can do this by clicking the "three dots" button in the upper right hand corner of the browser window, clicking "more tools," then "developer tools," then selecting "security," and finally "view certificate." Doing so on Zheng's proof of concept attack site retrieves a certificate that should look like this; notice the "xn--80ak6aa92e.com." One of the best examples of this Unicode domain-spoofing phishing scheme was demonstrated by security researchers at WordFence, a company that creates security plugins for the blogging site WordPress. (WordFence previously warned about another recent Gmail phishing scam, which has since been fixed.) To make the latest threat more palpable, the team created a spoof of "epic.com" that goes by—wait for it—"epic.com". See the screenshots below showing how Chrome displays the web addresses. The team obtained an SSL certificate, thereby granting the bogus domain a "secure" green lock icon. As a result, people might think they're on the real website, when in fact they're visiting a fake one. Can you tell the difference? Didn't think so. The first URL displays the domain of the fake page (actually, it's "https://xn--e1awd7f.com/," which renders as "https://epic.com" in the browser thanks to its punycode settings), and the second shows the homepage for a real Wisconsin-based firm that develops software related to electronic health records. Even to the trained eye, the URLs appear as one and the same. Unicode phishing attacks are practically impossible to spot - these examples are positively alarming https://t.co/ErXGlhGui2- Alan Woodward (@ProfWoodward) April 17, 2017 Zheng reported the issue to the Chrome security team on Jan. 20, earning a bounty of $2,000 for what Google (goog) deemed a medium-severity bug. The Chrome security team crafted a fix on March 23. Initially aiming to deploy the patch in Chrome version 59 (now in beta, due out June 6th), the Chrome security team decided instead to roll out a patch with version 58, due out in a stable release around April 25th, according to its software development calendar. Mozilla, on the other hand, is still debating how best to fix the problem, as you can see in this thread. Until this debate resolves and a patch is made available, users can manually change the settings in their Firefox browsers so they may more readily detect these kinds of attacks. To do so, open the Firefox browser, enter "about:config" in the URL bar, search for "punycode," and set the value type from "false" to "true." (Default setting seen below.) "I t's a really worrying problem as it makes phishing so much easier," Alan Woodward, a security expert and professor at the University of Surrey in England, said in an email to Fortune. "T hese tricks make it easy for even the most cautious of us to click on a link." He added: "The only advice I can really offer is never use a link in an email or other similar message." In other words, it's safer to manually type any intended web addresses in the URL bar, as annoying as that might be, than it is to click on links around the web, in email, and on social media. Password management tools can also help reduce the threat by automatically entering login credentials only on the trusted sites. Till the fixes land, protect yourself and spread the warning.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated April 18, 2017 10:33AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple iPhone iPhone 8 Touch ID OLED Smartphone Samsung Galaxy S8 Top Tech News There's rising speculation that Apple might come out with its next iPhone later than expected this year due to unresolved design and supply issues. The company, which normally releases new flagship devices in September, is said to be exploring a variety of new features that could push back the launch date. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone, which Asymco analyst Horace Dediu earlier this year proclaimed "the most successful product of all time," having sold an expected total of 1.2 bllion units from 2007 through the first half of 2017. The latest iPhone could arrive one or two months later than usual because of possible constraints on the supply of OLED screens and other materials, according to a report in Bloomberg today. It's also possible that at least one model of the new device will be called the "iPhone Edition," rather than the iPhone 8, the Japanese site Mac Otakara reported last month. Expect 'Top-of-the-Line' Handset Like its rival Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, which arrive on the market Friday, Apple's next iPhone could feature a curved-edge screen face that's nearly bezel free, various sources have reported. iPhone fans might also have to drop more cash than usual for Apple's newest phone, which is rumored to be priced in the $1,000 range. Three new iPhone models could appear in Apple's lineup this fall, including "a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look," according to Bloomberg. The article also noted that Apple is likely feeling added pressure to succeed with the new iPhone design in light of previous few models that didn't feature any big changes. The well-received Samsung Galaxy S8s could also up the ante for Apple, according to the article. Two of the new iPhones planned for launch later this year will likely be updates of 2016's iPhone 7 (pictured above): an iPhone 7s and an iPhone 7s Plus, BGR reported today. BGR added that might be the reason Apple is considering a name other than "iPhone 8" for the third device, as that could make the iPhone 7s handsets appear out of date from the moment they arrive. Could New iPhone Lose Touch ID? Ongoing design issues surrounding the new iPhones are one reason Apple might be delaying this fall's launch. Like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus hitting the market this week, Apple's update could relocate the iPhone's fingerprint sensor from the front screen to the back. It's also possible the new iPhone could drop the Touch ID sensor altogether, according to a report yesterday by MacRumors. The publication cited comments made in a research note by Pacific Crest Securities Analyst Andy Hargreaves. "We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues," Hargreaves stated. "If it's able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle. If it's not able to fix the problems in that time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing from the OLED iPhone altogether." Citing unnamed "people familiar with the matter," Bloomberg today noted that Apple has ordered around 100 million OLED display screens for its new iPhones from Samsung because "other suppliers won't be ready to supply mass quantities until later."

Updated April 14, 2017. Austin Russell, now 22, was barely old enough to drive when he set out to create a safer navigation system for robot-controlled cars. His ambitions are about to be tested. Five years ago, Russell [pictured above] co-founded Luminar Technologies, a Silicon Valley startup trying to steer the rapidly expanding self-driving car industry in a new direction. Luminar kept its work closely guarded until Thursday, when the startup revealed the first details about a product Russell is touting as a far more powerful form of "lidar," a key sensing technology used in autonomous vehicles designed by Google, Uber and major automakers. Lidar systems work by bouncing lasers off nearby objects and measuring the reflections to build up a detailed 3-D picture of the surrounding environment. The technology is similar to radar, which uses radio waves instead of lasers. Russell says Luminar's version, consisting of its own patented hardware and software, will provide 50 times more resolution and 10 times the range of current lidar systems. Those improvements, he said, will enable self-driving cars to be sold on the mass market more quickly. Thiel Backbone During an interview in an empty warehouse on a San Francisco pier where Luminar has been testing its lidar, Russell wasn't shy about making big claims for its technology. "When you see your vehicle is powered by Luminar, you will know you will be safer," he said. "We need to get to the point where humans don't have to constantly baby-sit and take control" of autonomous cars. If Luminar's lidar lives up to its promise, some of the world's biggest technology and auto companies may have been upstaged by a precocious entrepreneur who says he memorized all the periodic table of the elements when he was 2 years old. By the time he turned 11, Russell says he was tinkering with supercomputers. Like another technology prodigy -- Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg -- Russell won the early support of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who became a billionaire after investing $500,000 in Facebook during the company's infancy. One of Luminar's early investors is a venture capital firm backed by Thiel and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Russell also dropped out of Stanford University after just three months when he won a Thiel fellowship, which pays students $100,000 to work on promising ideas instead of pursuing a degree. Cost or Safety? Also like Zuckerberg, Russell is CEO of his company. Most of Luminar's roughly 150 employees are older than him, including his former mentor in photonics, 45-year-old Jason Eichenholz, now the company's chief technology officer. Russell's father, a former commercial real estate specialist, is the company's chief financial officer. Now Russell will have to prove he has indeed invented something revolutionary. While lidar is a key component in self-driving clears, some believe Luminar may be working on the wrong problem. The big issue for lidar systems these days is cost, not safety, said Alex Lidow, CEO of Efficient Power Conversion, which supplies chips for lidar. The systems currently cost thousands of dollars apiece. "You don't need the resolution that would allow a car to stop before a bug hits its windshield," Lidow said. "The question comes down to, what is the exact right amount of information for the car to make exactly the right decision all the time?" Luminar plans to being manufacturing 10,000 lidar units at a 50,000-square-foot plant in Orlando, Florida, this year. Russell won't disclose what they'll cost. About 100 of the lidar systems will be tested by four makers of autonomous cars that Luminar isn't identifying. The partners include technology companies and automakers, Russell said. The Lidar Landscape Luminar will be competing against other lidar suppliers such as Velodyne and Quanergy Systems, which have each raised $150 million so far. Velodyne's backers include Ford Motor, which invested $75 million last summer. By comparison, Luminar has raised $36 million, some of which has been used to set up its headquarters on a former Silicon Valley ranch that used to be home for a collection of vintage military tanks. Waymo, a company spun off from Google's early work on self-driving cars, also looms as an imposing competitor. It hopes to sell its technology, which includes a lidar system, to automakers. One sign of lidar's importance: Waymo has accused Uber of stealing its technology in a high-profile legal battle. Uber has denied the allegations , contending it is designing its own superior lidar system. Waymo's lidar has a solid track record so far. Its self-driving cars have logged more than 2 million miles in autonomous mode on city streets without being involved in a major traffic accident. Most of the roughly three dozen accidents that Google had reported through last year were fender benders. Russell isn't impressed. "It's very easy to build an autonomous vehicle that is safe 99 percent of the time," he said. "It's that other 1 percent that's the tricky part." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

But Apple is working to make sure its reign doesn't last long. Image Credit: Mac OtakaraMore Image Credit: Mac Otakara A new report from Japan's Mac Otakara adds some weight to the more prevalent iPhone 8 rumors out there, including rumblings of a stainless steel design and a flat OLED display. The report, as translated by Apple Insider, claims that the iPhone 8 will have a "glass sandwich" design reminiscent of that of the iPhone 4, with a sturdy steel center and slabs of glass on the front and back. The phone will reportedly use an improved version of the stainless steel that comprises the Apple Watch. MORE: iPhone 8 vs. Galaxy S8: Rumors vs. Reality Mac Otakara also notes that the display will be a flat OLED panel (contradicting some previous flexible display rumors), and could sport a vertically oriented iSight camera that would allow the next iPhone to work more seamlessly with mobile VR headsets. The report also seems to affirm the iPhone 8's oft-rumored virtual home button, which would replace the physical Touch ID key and would allow for more screen real estate. While Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone will likely steal the show later this year, it could be joined by improved versions of the iPhone 7. According to Bloomberg, Apple will launch a total of three handsets this fall: An all-new high-end model (which could be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X), as well as the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, which would get the usual refresh treatment Apple gives to its new phones after a year. However, while the 7s and 7s Plus are expected to arrive in September, we might have to wait a bit longer for Apple's big 10th-anniversary redesign.

More information is available at the website: http://www.greatowlpress.com Stockton, United States - April 18, 2017 /PressCable/ -- Elizabeth Stone O'Neill has backpacked and hiked, botanized and birdwatched, throughout the Sierra and other mountain ranges. She has written extensively about mountain subjects and nature in periodicals as well as in her books, Meadow in the Sky, Mountain Sage, and Tioga Tramps - the last in collaboration with her late husband, J. Carroll O'Neill, whose photographs grace many of her pages, not to mention her children's books. O'Neill is launching her first eBook, "Meadow in the Sky: A History of Yosemite's Tuolumne Meadows Region." Set to go live April 17, 2017, it is available for kindle on Amazon and Ibook from Apple. The paperback remains available on line from greatowlpress.com, from Amazon and independent bookstores in and near Yosemite National Park. It is expected to become a big hit with fans of the history of the environmental movement and lovers of the mountain world. Excitement surrounds this book launch as it is the first of the author's books to be available as an eBook. More information on the book can be found here: http://www.greatowlpress.com This is the First of 13 book O'Neill has authored. Although about the mountains in the past, it is "with some hope for the future. As long as we have the meadow, there is much left that is good in our world. May we cherish the meadow for those who will yet come with open souls and youthful hearts, as to a world newborn, and who will find peace and joy and happiness there, and perhaps wisdom. It is not too much to hope." Meadow in the Sky: A History of Yosemite's Tuolumne Meadows Region sets its main focus on the history of the Tuolumne Meadow Region of Yosemite National Park in California which cannot be separated from the history of the conservation movement itself.. Readers will likely find a particular interest in how the past in these mountains of California informs the very future of humankind. The book's cover art was created by John Carroll O'Neill, Jr.. Meadow in the Sky: A History of Yosemite's Tuolumne Meadows Region is being released by Great Owl Press. Elizabeth Stone O'Neill has a background is a graduate of the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, where she majored in French and earned a Master's degree in Inter-American Studies with a major in History. She taught elementary school in inner-city schools and spent her vacations backpacking and climbing in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges. Her love of the area shaped the creation of the book. Her background in the mountains ignited a passion to find out more about their history and an interest in their preservation.. When asked about why she wrote the book, O'Neill said: "This book came to be because of an ending. In 1976 the National Park Service closed the walk-in campground at the Soda Springs. Benches and tables were removed, fireplaces were razed and raked clean, and one sun warmed hillside of Tuolumne Meadows returned to forest. Not a bad thing, one might say. Yet for me, and I am sure for many others, a deep sadness arose at the thought that this historic spot, site of so much history and of so many happy personal memories, was being shut down. After knowing this place for thirty years, I suddenly wondered how it came to be. This book is the result." O'Neill hopes that through it you will share with her the joy of the mountains and of those who have loved them. May it signify for you not an ending, but a beginning. This positive outlook from the author is certainly a testament to her optimism considering some of the challenges during its creation. It was written on a portable typewriter in a trailer in Tuolumne Meadows. Any typo or change required rewriting at least an entire page. New information found also required new writing. She had none of the luxury of copy machines or computers with search engines and cut-and-paste technology. In a recent interview, the author made a point of thanking the help of many knowledgeable people. She would like to express her thanks to Dr. Mary Hill of San Francisco State University for going over the geology chapter; to Yosemite Park Indian Specialist Craig Bates and to Dr. Michael Moratto, both of whom read and commented on the Indian sections; to David Gaines of the Mono Lake Committee, who checked the material on birds; to Dr. Carl Sharsmith, who gave special attention to the geology and botany; to Dr. William A. Douglass of the University of Nevada Basque Studies Program, who read the chapter on sheepherders; to Evelyn P. Wiggen, who shared her recollections of Fran�ois Matthes; and to Lee and Dorothy Verrett, who shared their memories of Tuolumne Meadows with her. Additional thanks go to Yosemite Park Superintendent Bob Binnewies, David Gaines, Henry Berrey of Yosemite Natural History Association, Chief Park Naturalist Leonard McKenzie, Dr. Walter Payne of the University of the Pacific, Catherine Rose, Dr. Carl Sharsmith, and Yosemite Research Librarian Mary Vocelka, each of whom read the entire manuscript. Her most heartfelt appreciation is for her husband, Carroll, who introduced her to the Sierra, shared with her the joy of innumerable mountain days, read and considered the manuscript more times than anyone else, helped and encouraged her, and donated his photograph for the cover, which commemorates some of the best days of their lives."

By: Bloomberg | Published: April 18, 2017 11:28 PM Ten years after Steve Jobs held up the original iPhone to a gushing San Francisco crowd, Apple Inc. is planning its most extensive iPhone lineup to date. (Reuters) Ten years after Steve Jobs held up the original iPhone to a gushing San Francisco crowd, Apple Inc. is planning its most extensive iPhone lineup to date. Apple is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this fall, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look, according to people familiar with the matter. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the people said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait because supply constraints could mean the device isn’t readily available until one or two months after the typical fall introduction. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, representing about two-thirds of sales. It also leads customers to buy other Apple devices like the iPad and Apple Watch, and serves as a home for lucrative services like the App Store. This year’s new iPhone lineup comes at a critical time. Last year, Apple broke its typical upgrade cycle by retaining the same iPhone shape for a third year in a row and endured a rare sales slide. Samsung Electronics Co.’s new S8 lineup has also been thus far well received after last year’s Note 7 battery debacle. Also watch: For the premium model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device, according to people familiar with the matter. That results in a display slightly larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, the people said. Apple is also aiming to reduce the overall size of the handset by integrating the home button into the screen itself via software in a similar manner to Samsung’s S8, the people said. The overhauled iPhone will use an organic light-emitting diode display that more accurately shows colors, while the other two phones will continue to use liquid crystal display technology and come in the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as last year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple’s iPhone feature and design plans are still in flux and can change, they added. The people asked not to be identified discussing Apple’s private testing and design plans. For its redesigned phone, Apple has tested multiple prototypes with manufacturing partners in Asia, including some versions that use curved glass and stainless steel, according to one of the people. One of the latest prototype designs includes symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back. The curves are similar in shape to those on the front of the iPhone 7. The new OLED screen itself is flat, while the cover glass curves into a steel frame. The design is similar conceptually to the iPhone 4 from 2010. An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides. Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007, one of the people said. Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves, the person added. The company is also testing a simpler design that has an aluminum back, rather than a glass one, and slightly larger dimensions, one of the people said. Because of its early lead in the mobile OLED display space, Samsung will enjoy a rare upper hand in this year’s high-end smartphone contest. At launch, Apple will exclusively use Samsung Display Co. OLED panels for the redesigned iPhone, as other suppliers won’t be ready to supply mass quantities until later, Bloomberg News reported last year. Apple has ordered around 100 million panels from Samsung, the people said. “This fall, it would be three years since we had a remarkable shift in iPhone hardware. This raises expectations for this year’s phone having a material change in functionality and look,” said Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a veteran Apple analyst. “The Samsung Galaxy S8 raises the bar for Apple to hit a home run.” Spokespeople for Apple and Samsung declined to comment. Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone’s fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version, which would be technically challenging, the people said. It’s currently unclear if that feature will make it into the final product. Samsung also tried this approach for the S8, but ended up installing a more standard fingerprint reader on the back of its phone due to the challenges, another person said. Significant camera changes are also in testing for Apple’s overhauled iPhone. For the back of the phone, Apple is testing versions of the phone with the dual-camera system positioned vertically, instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which could result in improved photos, according to people familiar with the matter. Some prototypes in testing continue to include the slight camera bump found on current iPhones, rather than having them flush with the back surface, the people said. For the front-camera, Apple is testing dual-lenses, one of the people said. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have single front cameras. As it has done in the past, Apple is using camera components from Sony Corp., the person added. Apple has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its iPhone camera system, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year. Company engineers in the past have also experimented with integrating cameras into screens, another person said. All the new iPhones will run iOS 11, a mobile operating system that will include a refreshed user-interface and will be announced in June at the company’s annual conference for developers, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple has been testing using faster processors based on a smaller 10-nanometer production process for all three new models, a person familiar with Apple’s chip plans said. That’s down from 16 nanometers for existing iPhones. The smaller processors are more efficient, allowing Apple to retain its battery life standards while adding more advanced features. No Comments.

The iPhone 8, which may be called the iPhone X, is expected to be completely redesigned. While the form of the phone is not clear yet, it could have an all glass body, edge-to-edge display and no home button. Apple is rumoured to be working on three versions of the phone, including a 4.7-inch model, a 5.5-inch Plus size and a premium handset that has a screen size similar to the Plus but a body closer to that of the smaller phone. Apple iPhone - by numbers 01:26 The premium device is expected to have an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) curved screen that almost entirely fills the front of the phone. In order to maximise space on the premium device Apple may embed the home button within the screen, in a similar way to how Samsung has designed the Galaxy S8, Bloomberg reports. It has also considered embedding the fingerprint sensor within the screen, but this could be too technically challenging to make it to the final product.  Apple is still testing different designs for the three iPhone 8 handsets, tweaking the way the phone curves at the edge and the material used on the back of the device, which could be glass, stainless steel or aluminium. The phones are expected to have more advanced cameras than the iPhone 7, which could be compatible with augmented reality software and have better depth-of-field capabilities. They could also feature wireless charging and come with a USB-C port instead of the Lightning port that has been a staple since the iPhone 5.  They could also run on a 10-nanometer chip, which would be more efficient and allow for a longer battery life than the current 16-nanometer ones used in the iPhone 7.  Every iPhone ranked: from worst to best   Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics Gadgets Mobile phones iPhone Apple Show more Technology latest 18 Apr 2017, 11:58pm Donald Trump orders review of H-1B visa program to encourage hiring Americans 18 Apr 2017, 7:11pm Mark Zuckerberg admits Facebook has 'a lot of work to do' after murder video 01:33 18 Apr 2017, 4:00pm Samsung Galaxy S8 review: The best looking phone ever made 5 18 Apr 2017, 3:36pm Uber's problems deepen as executive behind self-driving cars joins exodus 18 Apr 2017, 2:57pm New app promises to sort your mortgage by iPhone as home buying goes digital 18 Apr 2017, 12:05pm Uber could soon add button for tipping drivers 18 Apr 2017, 10:32am WhatsApp may soon let you unsend messages Gallery 18 Apr 2017, 8:00am Gallery: The top 10 most-liked Instagram pictures 17 Apr 2017, 11:39pm Facebook to review handling of videos after Cleveland killing 16 Apr 2017, 7:50pm Regulating Bitcoin: how new frameworks could be a catalyst for cryptocurrencies  16 Apr 2017, 6:53pm Is 3D printing homes the answer to the UK's housing crisis?  16 Apr 2017, 6:52pm Comment: Brexit might not be the biggest challenge facing fintech James Titcomb Premium 15 Apr 2017, 7:43pm Micro Focus signals job cuts after £7bn HP deal 15 Apr 2017, 5:27pm Comment: Cutting down my smartphone use has cured my loneliness – and reconnected me with my family Rachel Halliwell Premium 15 Apr 2017, 4:02pm How artificial intelligence is refashioning the retail industry Premium 15 Apr 2017, 12:37am Apple joins race to produce self-driving cars  14 Apr 2017, 8:55pm Mobile payments struggle to make impact on contactless card use 14 Apr 2017, 12:36pm Apple mulls throwing its weight behind £21.5bn bid for Toshiba chip business 13 Apr 2017, 5:51pm Instagram Stories overtakes Snapchat with 200m daily users  13 Apr 2017, 4:47pm Glowing bacteria could help detect unexploded landmines  13 Apr 2017, 11:16am Aga security flaw could let hackers turn ovens on and off Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We've noticed you're adblocking.

Compal will produce Apple Watch and Apple Watch Series 2 to account for 20-30% of total shipments initially and is setting up assembly capacity at its factory in Kunshan, eastern China. Compal will begin shipments as early as the fourth quarter of 2017. Quanta Computer is currently the sole OEM for Apple Watch, and Apple's move to add of Compal is to decrease Quanta's price bargaining power as well as increase total assembly capacity due to an optimistic sales outlook for the device, EDN indicated. Apple may also be planning to shift second generation Apple Watch production to Compal ahead of the Apple Watch 3 which will reportedly debut in the second half of 2017.

Apple also celebrates Earth Day by updating the logos on its retail stores around the world, adding a green leaf accent to the traditional white Apple. Earth Day represents one of the few days a year Apple alters its logo. Apple employees on Earth Day 2016, via Angela Ahrendts Apple often uses Earth Day as a way to highlight its environmental efforts and reaffirm its commitment to recycling, renewable energy, and other initiatives. According to a recent interview with Apple's VP of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson, 96 percent of the energy Apple uses around the world now comes from renewable sources like wind and solar. Last year, Apple released a host of earth-inspired Apple Music playlists, launched a "Siri and Liam" ad outlining its recycling practices, and launched an "Apps for Earth" promotion, with proceeds donated to the World Wildlife Fund. Similar promotions could take place this year, with announcements coming this week ahead of April 22.

According to a retail source that shared the news with MacRumors, employees have been told that display parts are constrained until further notice, and it's not known how long it will be until display components are more widely available. Stores that have no display repair components on hand will outright replace iPhone SE models in need of repair. The reason behind the component constraint is unclear, as Apple did not provide details to employees. Supply constraints are not likely indicative of an imminent refresh because no new iPhone SE model is expected. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who often shares reliable information on upcoming Apple products, Apple will not introduce a new iPhone SE during the first half of 2017. Apple also recently bumped up the storage space in the iPhone SE, offering the iPhone SE in 32 and 128GB capacities for $399 and $499, respectively. It isn't yet clear if Apple is planning on introducing another 4-inch device, or if the SE was the last 4-inch phone Apple plans to produce. Kuo's information only covered the first half of 2017, so if another 4-inch phone is in the works, it could come later in the year. Update: According to a second source, the serial numbers for the displays weren't added to Apple's system correctly, so the displays were unable to be validated. All affected displays were pulled and sent back to Apple, impacting much of the stock at most retail stores. Some flagship stores have been getting rerouted shipments and will be able to offer repairs.

Rating: 7 Votes nibfiledotcom 13 hours ago at 11:36 am Still one of the best looking iPhones Apple has made. It's the best design Apple ever created for a "smartphone," per se. The width of that device was specifically chosen to be comfortable in, and operable with, the average human hand. The choice to make them bigger was purely market driven. The newer devices at larger sizes are better for watching video, reading books, and accommodating larger hands; but for general usage— making a phone call, using an app, sticking it back in your pocket— you can't beat that 4" form factor... it just feels awesome. I would also posit that it has a more "luxury" oriented aesthetic than the 6/7 design. Rating: 6 Votes LordQ 14 hours ago at 10:33 am Man, the rose gold SE looks very, very, very beautiful.

Rating: 3 Votes nibfiledotcom 13 hours ago at 11:16 am ugh....just seeing those bezels makes me want to hurl... Funny you should say that, because the lack of a bezel is far more likely to cause discomfort, as it can negatively impact your perception of visual information. It's the same reason that we prefer to see pictures in frames... the visual separation between the image and its background makes it easier for the brain to process what it's seeing. It's probably not something that you'll notice in the first five minutes of looking at a bezel-free display, but it can definitely make your brain work harder to process what you're seeing. Hopefully, Apple takes this into account, and re-adds that visual separation in software, within the UI of iOS and the layout of views in the SDK.

The technology giant is working on three iPhone models this year, including one that will deliver an updated design and an "advanced" camera, Bloomberg is reporting citing sources. The other two models will deliver only minor design and feature upgrades over last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models, according to the report. Apple's (aapl) third model—which has been rumored to be called the iPhone 8, iPhone X, or iPhone Edition—will come with a screen that nearly entirely covers the face of the device, Bloomberg's sources said. The display will run on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology instead of the liquid-crystal display the company has employed in its iPhones since 2007. OLED, which is also found in Samsung's (ssnlf) Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, generally offers better color accuracy than LCD alternatives. Apple's decision to boost the iPhone screen's surface area will also mean it'll be larger than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus' display, though the Bloomberg report didn't say how much bigger the handset's screen might be. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter On the design front, Apple is reportedly planning a glass face and glass backplate, and a steel spine between them. The design could look somewhat similar to the iPhone 4 Apple released in 2010, according to the report. Apple has been rumored to be working on three new iPhone models for several months. Nearly all of those rumors agree that Apple will sell two minor iPhone 7 upgrades that could be known as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus to complement a bigger update in the third model. The company surprised some analysts last year after only offering a modest upgrade over the 2015 iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Apple has historically clung to a "tick-tock" release schedule, in which it releases major iPhone design changes every two years. Apple bucked that trend with its small updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple hasn't commented on that apparent change and what it has planned for the future. But there is extra fervor this year as it will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's debut in 2007. The third model in this year's lineup could be used to commemorate that anniversary. However, Apple might have some trouble getting ample supply to customers during its regular fall time frame for releasing new handsets, Bloomberg reports. Apple is expecting widespread demand for the 10th anniversary model, yet it might only offer only a limited number of units up to two months after its expected release this fall. If the device launches then, it might also come with improved front- and rear-facing cameras that could take better-looking photos. Apple is also considering baking the device's fingerprint sensor into the screen, according to the report. Apple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on the report.

Apple is largely expected to do something big for this milestone, and thus far a lot of the rumors have pointed toward a special anniversary edition iPhone that could cost as much as $1,000. Today we’re hearing more about this anniversary iPhone, and just what Apple will do to make it stand out from the more standard offerings launching alongside it. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is looking to back this iPhone with a lot of premium features. The first – and likely most important – is an OLED display that takes up most of the front of the device. That obviously wouldn’t leave much space for the iPhone’s home button, but Bloomberg’s sources say that Apple will opt for a software home button, much like the one found on the new Galaxy S8. Apple is also said to be experimenting with different types of curved glass to cover the display. Though the OLED panel will remain flat – no curved edges like we see on the Galaxy S line – Apple has considered glass panels with curves of varying depth. It sounds like we can probably expect a handset where the front glass panel slightly curves into the stainless steel back, similar to what we’ve seen with the iPhone 6 and on. That’s another big part of the rumor: Apple’s decision to make the back panel stainless steel instead of aluminum. That could certainly add to the premium feel of the device, as could Apple’s plans for the cameras on the anniversary iPhone. According to people close to development, Apple is considering dual-lens set ups for both the front and back cameras, with the rear-facing lens becoming vertically arranged for this release. If all of this turns out to be true, then that $1,000 price tag that’s been thrown around could indeed become a reality. We’ve heard most of this before, so Bloomberg’s report corroborates more than it offers new rumors. Even with only speculation to go on, it certainly seems like Apple is planning something big for later this year. As always, take this with a grain of salt. We don’t have official confirmation from Apple yet, and at the end of it all, that confirmation is the only thing that counts. We should find out what Apple’s plotting sometime in mid-September, so stay tuned.

The publication claims that Apple is currently in the process of finalizing the design of the handset. Sources assert that the so-called iPhone Edition has finally passed through Apple’s engineering verification testing (EVT) stage and into the DVT (Design Verification Test) stage. The phone apparently sports a vertical iSight Duo camera and glass sandwich design. The latter is similar to the iPhone 4’s style, featuring 2.5D glass on the front and back tied together by a thin stainless steel frame. The steel chassis is rumored to be an improved version of the material used in the Apple Watch. The OLED display is supposedly going to be flat and not curved like Samsung’s Galaxy S flagship series. Also See: Apple may eliminate Touch ID on the iPhone 8 The report further states that the iPhone 8 will feature a virtual home button. Mac Otakara claims to have heard rumblings of Touch ID integration underneath the display, but could not confirm the rumors. It also discussed the rear shooters, predicting that the module will be a good fit for VR headsets when turned sideways. As for the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, the two will likely be launched alongside the iPhone Edition and could be slightly thicker than its predecessors. This could mean that users won’t be able to use their existing cases with the next-gen smartphones.

Donklephant Menu Contact Donklephant Privacy Policy Terms of Use Home iPad Pro 2 to be the Biggest new Release by Apple iPad Pro 2 to be the Biggest new Release by Apple Costea Lestoc >Categories: Tablet Tags: Apple, iPad Pro 2 April 18, 2017 According to reports, Apple will be releasing their brand new iPad Pro 2 in 2017 and will be equipped by the Cupertino company with laptop hardware, like the A10x chip, bigger RAM and will be water-resistant. A media outlet poll has shown that iPad users do not purchase new tablets on a yearly basis. Just 6% of the poll respondents decide to buy a new iPad when it’s released every year while the rest of them do not find it necessary to switch to a new one. It will be interesting to see if this year things will change as Apple is preparing a major improvement in their iPad Pro line of tablets. It is even considered that the iPad Pro 2 will be replacing the MacBook Air since the technical specifications of the new tablet will be so powerful. As far as specifications are concerned, iPad Pro 2 will be equipped to handle process-intensive tasks and it has been speculated that it will be replacing hybrid tablets such as the Surface Book and the Lenovo Yoga on the scene. What we know so far is that the iPad Pro 2 will have a Touch Bar feature, super-thin bezels, an updated Apple Pencil with more integrated apps and an overall focus on making the tablet more accessible for individuals that require a faster rate in their task completion. Although there are speculations that the new iPad will have bigger ram, this could potentially not be the case as the current iPad Pro already has 4 GB of RAM and equipping the new iPad Pro 2 will most likely be equipped with the same RAM and bigger internal memory. We do not yet have an official launch date for the iPad Pro 2 but it’s expected that the tablets may be released in May or June of 2017.

The Apple device management platform plays a key role in the district’s efforts to provide equitable access to technology to all of its students. “We use Jamf Pro as our device management solution for our 1:1 iPad program district-wide. As a result, we are driving student success with iPads and meeting their individual needs via personalized learning — something we weren’t able to previously do,” says Lyons, technology service director for the School District of La Crosse. “Giving each student an iPad has really made a difference in their lives, especially for those who didn’t previously have technology at home.” BE SURE NOT TO MISS: IT execs tout benefits of SD-WAN 5 must-have security tools Top U.S. colleges for computer science 10 reasons to look for a new job How San Diego fights off 500,000 cyberattacks a day Self-service features enable students to get their devices up and running in less than 20 minutes, Lyons says. “Once iPads are deployed, we’re able to collect dynamic inventory, reduce risks and protect resources, and ensure peace of mind with remote lock and wipe, automated patches, and reporting on backup status,” she says. Being able to easily inventory, deploy and secure Apple devices also eases the management burden on IT: “Our district has grown the program from 3,000 to more than 8,000 iPad and MacBook Air devices — all without having to increase our technical staff,” Lyons says. “Jamf Pro has made management of our Apple devices simple and secure. Most importantly, it’s helped us close the digital divide, and empower our students by providing them with digital equity in and outside of the classroom,” she says. Lyons shared her experience with Jamf as part of Network World’s annual Fave Raves project, which asks IT pros to talk about their favorite enterprise tech products. (Related: 31 tech pros share favorite IT products). This year, a number of IT pros from the education industry weighed in on their must-haves. At Concordia University, Jonathan Mierow depends on Code42 CrashPlan to back up distributed end-user data. “We needed a backup/DR solution that would be easy to deliver, maintain and administer. It's been the easiest deployment we've done for our university,” says Mierow, senior network administrator at the St. Paul, Minn., university. CrashPlan simplifies the deployment of freshly imaged machines to Concordia faculty and staff if they have issues with broken hardware or malware, he says. “With Code42, the faculty and staff know they can restore their own data as they need it. This alone has reduced calls to our help desk, as well as instilled confidence in our end users that the IT department is providing the right tools to protect their data.” “It can be difficult in higher education to get faculty and staff to buy into changes that IT would like to make, but after a brief explanation and some simple training, our users were off and running,” Mierow says. A few IT pros also talked about the tools they use to bolster security at higher-education institutions. Flush with personal data and valuable research, universities can be prime targets for hackers. Dutchess Community College, which is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system, relies on DatAdvantage from Varonis. The data security platform is designed to show organizations where sensitive data exists, who is accessing it, and how to keep it safe. “DatAdvantage is the only product in this space that gives you a single window into your unstructured data. In that one interface I can see who has access to my data, where the data lives, what type of data it is, and how long it has been since it was touched,” says Howard Ignal, director of information security and system architect at SUNY Dutchess in Poughkeepsie, NY. “DatAdvantage also [addresses] key regulatory requirements through data classification, which digs into your files looking for personally identifiable information/sensitive business material. The interface is very easy to use for both technical and non-technical staff.” “Varonis in the first month identified four locations where sensitive data was being stored,” Ignal says. “These locations would never have been located without Varonis running. During the first six months of using Varonis we identified multiple ransomware attacks and stopped them with ZERO data loss.” Looking ahead, SUNY Dutchess plans to expand its DatAdvantage deployment to include its Office 365 implementation and protect its offsite storage. “Doing this will give us full view of our data on premises and in the cloud,” Ignal says. “This is very important to our organization.” At Texas A&M University System, Daniel Basile has deployed Vectra’s cybersecurity platform to help defend the statewide higher-ed system that spans 11 universities and seven state agencies. “There are very few tools that allow you to distil cybersecurity event information to a level where a tier-1 analyst can make a meaningful decision with the information presented to him within five minutes,” says Basile, who is executive director of the security operations center at Texas A&M University System. “If the tool can do this without agents, without signatures, and without logs, many people would claim disbelief. With Vectra, we are able to obtain this.” The effectiveness of Vectra has allowed A&M System to monitor its system network and run a security operations center with an extremely small staff. “We are able to leverage student workers with an affinity for cybersecurity to act as our tier-1 analysts. This turns our titled tier-1 individuals effectively into tier-2 analysts,” Basile says. Vectra has also reduced the risk of costly data breaches. “On average, in the past, if you had a breach you called forensics and you found out about it usually a month after it actually occurred,” Basile says. “With Vectra, we found seven incidents, but we found them quickly enough I didn’t need to call an outside forensics team.” Early detection has saved A&M System millions of dollars, he says. Philip Grabowski, who is an IT, network, and security forensic instructor at Pittsburgh Technical College, shared his experience with Paessler’s PRTG network monitoring software. “Within minutes you can begin monitoring your network and get a visual on the topology. Immediately you can start researching problems on your network and fix them,” Grabowski says. “I use PRTG in a botnet lab to show students an attack from a Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), which creates a denial of service on the domain controller. We are also monitoring traffic in the botnet lab to detect if client machines are downloading torrents,” Grabowski says. “Students get hands-on experience using the product in the classroom without fear of harming a production environment. This provides confidence in the product in the field.” On the customer service front, Grand Canyon University uses Calabrio ONE to streamline contact center operations. Calabrio ONE, a workforce optimization suite, “makes my job easy,” says Sara de la Fuente, quality assurance specialist at Grand Canyon University. “I spend my entire day working out of Calabrio. It is easy to navigate, great for culling data/analytics, the customer support has been amazing, and the system is continuously rolling out new features.” Colleague Josie Trimnal, who is an operations quality analyst, adds that Calabrio ONE “has helped Grand Canyon University to streamline our quality management process and has assisted us in providing our agents with necessary, instant feedback to improve our overall customer experience.” Why Performance Matters When Building Your SD-WAN More from Silver Peak Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The iOS 10.3 update’s reign lasted just a week. A week after its highly anticipated release, Apple released a brand new version of iOS 10 dubbed iOS 10.3.1. With iOS 10.3.1 now out for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we can assume the iOS 10.3.2 update that’s currently in beta testing will be next in line. Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3.2 release date for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but with each passing day, the release gets closer. The company is currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 3 but we could see a few more iOS 10.3.2 beta releases emerge as we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date. We’ve been taking a close look at iOS 10.3.2 and today we want to share some tips that could help you on the road to its release. iOS 10.3.2 Release Time The iOS 10.3.2 update is shaping up to be a small release with under-the-hood improvements and security patches. That could change as the beta progresses but we’re expecting it to be a maintenance release. It’s not as exciting as iOS 10.3 but iOS 10.3.2 could be an important update for your device, particularly if you’re struggling with iOS problems. While you might be tempted to check your phone every 15 minutes for the iOS 10.3.2 update, that’s not how Apple iOS releases work. It’s difficult to predict the exact iOS 10.3.2 release date but it’s very easy to predict the iOS 10.3.2 release time. Here are a few things to keep in mind as we close in on the iOS 10.3.2 release date. Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend so there’s no need to check for iOS 10.3.2 on Saturday or Sunday. iOS updates almost always arrive between 9AM and 10AM Pacific. General rule of thumb is to check around 10AM Pacific. This goes for the iOS 10.3.2 beta releases as well. Betas typically come every 1-2 weeks, usually on Monday. While some of you will want to download the iOS 10.3.2 update the second it arrives, many others will want to wait. Don’t Try the iOS 10.3.2 Beta Unless You Really, Really Want To Given what’s on board (bugs and little else), the only people that should be trying the beta are those people who really, really want to help Apple squash problems, developers, and those who really, really want to test performance. Most of you should avoid the early version of iOS 10.3.2, especially if you’re having an outstanding experience on your version of iOS. Be it iOS 10.3.1 or something older. Again, Apple could add some more meat to the iOS 10.3.2 update in the future but as of right now it’s pretty bare bones. Now that we’re on beta 3, we don’t expect much. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, take a look at our guide. Prepare Your iPhone, iPad or iPod It’s never too early to start preparing for an iOS update’s release. Here are a few pre-installation tips to keep in your back pocket as we approach the iOS 10.3.2 update’s release: Use this time to cleanup your device. Get rid of files (apps, music, etc), anything you no longer use. Cleaning up your device could improve your device’s performance. Start backing up your data. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll want to research iCloud backups, iTunes backups, and the differences between the two. If you want to download iOS 10.3.2 right when it comes out, make sure your device has at least a 50% charge (or you’re near a charger) around 10AM Pacific. Get your login information handy. Make sure you have the device’s passcode, Apple ID, and your important logins ready on release day. The update might log you out of various apps and services. Dig into feedback from iOS 10.3.2 beta testers. You might learn about a potential problem or benefit to your version of iOS 10.3.2. A little prep work will help you avoid major problems during the iOS 10.3.2 installation process. It’ll also help you avoid headaches once you get the new update on board your phone or tablet. Dig Into iOS 10.3 and iOS 10.3.1 If You Need To If you failed to download iOS 10.3 and you plan on skipping the iOS 10.3.1 update, make sure you know what you’re getting into before you download the iOS 10.3.2 update on your phone. If you skipped iOS 10.3 and don’t have plans to download iOS 10.3.1, you’ll get the changes from those updates baked into your iOS 10.3.2 update. (Note: You’ll also get the features and fixes from any other iOS update you missed.) If you plan on downloading iOS 10.3.2, you’ll want to get familiar with these changes ahead of the iOS 10.3.2 release. A new iCloud storage breakdown in iOS 10.3 shows you exactly how your using your space. We’ve put together a broad guide to the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve also put together a more in depth walkthrough that will take you step-by-step through the changes. You’ll also want to get familiar with the new Clips application that arrived earlier this month. Again, you’ll need to download iOS 10.3.1/iOS 10.3.2 in order to use the Clips app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Report iOS 10.3.2 Problems If you choose to install iOS 10.3.2 on release day there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue during or after the installation process finishes up. If you do run into an iOS 10.3.2 problem on your phone, there’s no need to panic. Sometimes, it can take a couple of days for an update to settle in. If you notice weird battery life on release day, give it a day or two to even out. If problems persist after two days with iOS 10.3.2, or if the issues are serious, you’ll want to take action. There are tons of resources out there but our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is a great place to start. If you don’t consider yourself an expert, you’ll want to bookmark those fixes so you’re ready to tackle problems as soon as they popup. If you can’t fix your problem and/or you want to help the community, you’ll want to report iOS 10.3.2 problems as you see them. There are a few places to do that. You can relay your problem to Apple Support on Twitter and/or get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. We also recommend reporting your problem on Apple’s Discussion forums to alert Apple and other users to your issue. You Can Test iOS 10.3.2 Remember, if you don’t want to deal with the iOS 10.3.2 beta, you can still take the official version of iOS 10.3.2 for a test drive provided you’re on iOS 10.3.1 when it arrives. For a short time, Apple will allow you to downgrade from iOS 10.3.2 to iOS 10.3.1. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 so you won’t be able to drop back to either of those iOS 10 updates. Most of you will probably choose to remain on iOS 10.3.2 but others might benefit from dropping down to the older version of iOS 10. It could help improve your device’s performance in key areas like battery life, connectivity, and speed. If you aren’t familiar with the iOS downgrade process, now is the time to get familiar with it. How to Get Off iOS 10.3.2 Beta If you chose to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta and you don’t want to get thrown onto the next iOS 10 beta , you’ll want to unenroll from the iOS 10.3.2 beta once the final version is released. Here’s how to do that. Go to Settings > General > Profiles and then tap the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears on your device. Enter your passcode, if there is on associated with the device, and tap Delete Profile. You will no longer receive beta software. Go into your Settings or iTunes and download iOS 10.3.2. If you’ve been running an iOS 10.3.2 beta and the watchOS beta on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to take a few more steps before, on, or after the iOS 10.3.2 release date. Here’s how to get the watchOS beta off your device, Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab. Go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile you want to remove. Enter a passcode if needed and then tap Delete Profile. If you want to use iOS beta software again you’ll need to install the correct beta profile. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 2 Responses 03/25/2017 James Burton Reply Hi I’m impressed with the amber alert system in the future is there going to be FBI warrants support 04/18/2017 Chile Reply DellLundg Slovakien NicholRan SherrillH Elfenbenskusten CaroleSch JacquieDe Schweiz ValorieHi BonnyMgrx Osterrike WindyChid OrvalGoul Nederlanderna MarthaSpa GabrieleC Everton SKKRalfgc GlendaXvr Spanien DakotaCam BrainBole Rumanien GeorginaE NoellaEll Valencia EstelleNe TerranceR Wales StaceyThe Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Information from sources back previous rumored features expected on the 10th anniversary device this fall. However, the new technology could possibly delay the iPhone 8’s release date by one or two months after it is revealed because of supply constraints, the report said. Read: Apple's Gift Suggestions For Mother's Day Include The iPad Pro And BeatsX Earphones Here are some features the iPhone 8 could come with, according to the Bloomberg report: iPhone 8 Rumored Design Features Apple is apparently testing a “revamped iPhone with an all-screen front, curved glass and a stainless steel frame,” the report said. The design features of the iPhone 8 mentioned by the sources are similar to previous rumors. On Monday, Japanese blog Mac Otakara said the iPhone 8 would come with stainless steel frame to hold together the front and back glass panels of the device. iPhone 8 Rumors: OLED Display And Screen Size The iPhone 7S and 7S Plus are expected to have LCD displays, like previous rumors have indicated. For the iPhone 8, the sources said Apple will use an edge-to-edge OLED screen display provided by Samsung, backing a recent Nikkei report which said Apple placed orders for 70 million OLED panels from Samsung. However, the Bloomberg report said Apple ordered around 100 million panels from Samsung. The DigiTimes reported recently Apple signed a $9 billion two-year contract with Samsung for OLED displays. Read: iPhone 7 Vs Galaxy S8: Speed Test Video Shows Apple Still Ahead of Samsung The display is said to be larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus, released last year, but will have an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, sources told Bloomberg. Embedded Touch ID Apple will reportedly reduce the smartphone’s size by embedding the home button into the screen via software like the in the Samsung Galaxy S8, people close to the matter said. However, this week, Pacific Crest Securities equity research analyst recently said Apple will likely ditch its plan of embedding the Touch ID into the iPhone 8 display. A note to investors from an analyst at Cowen and Company last week said Apple’s biggest trouble among iPhone 8 features was embedding the Touch ID. He also said Apple could ditch the idea or delay the production of the iPhone 8. New Camera Technology The Bloomberg report said Apple is testing more advanced cameras for the iPhone 8. For the back camera, Apple is reportedly testing versions of the iPhone for better photos by positioning the dual-camera system vertically instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is apparently testing dual-lenses for the front camera, an upgrade from the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which have single cameras. The company has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its iPhone camera system, it was learned earlier this year. The iPhones this year will run iOS 11 that will “include a refreshed user-interface,” the report said. The software update is expected to be announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif. this June.

The agreement most likely includes Apple writing a big check, and the patent holding company agreeing to leave the iPhone and Mac maker alone. Apple settles Unwired Planet patent infringement lawsuit just a day before going to trial The path leading to the settlement is something of a drama starting with Unwired Planet claiming Apple products infringed on ten of its patents related to voice recognition, location services, secure cellular data transmission, and device provisioning. The iPhone, iPad, iOS, iCloud, the App store, and iTunes were all listed in the case. Planet Unwired was asking for US$33 million and a $0.07 to $0.09 royalty for the sale of every infringing device. That list was later trimmed down to four claims and the court ruled Apple wasn’t infringing on three of the four patents, but didn’t grant summary judgement in Apple’s favor on Unwired Planet’s location services patent. The court did rule Apple’s customers weren’t liable for infringement related to location services. Apple Fires Back at Planet Unwired Apple accused Planet Unwired of using a “kitchen sink” strategy with its lawsuits by throwing as many claims as it can against defendants to see what sticks in court. Apple followed up by filing its own lawsuit calling UP’s case frivolous, and asked for $15 million to cover legal expenses. The Federal Appeals Court put UP’s claims back into play last summer by sending the case back to the lower court for review, and vacating part of the summary judgement. That brings us up to last week when a jury was selected for the trial, and yesterday’s settlement filing. That stopped today’s scheduled trial, and once the court approves the settlement both companies can go their separate ways. Neither company is talking about the settlement, so we don’t know what Apple’s reasoning was for bringing the suit to an end. Apple likely felt UP had a good chance of winning in court, or saw the case as manpower and financial drain it didn’t want. Either way, UP is the big winner because it gets to walk away with a check and the knowledge that sometimes being just a patent holder pays off.

Which Won't Make it to 2067? Apple's iPad Fights For the Education Market Why Apple Should Eventually Build Family Service Robots View All Editorials → Bloomberg Backs Up iPhone 8 Big Screen Design Reports Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Apr 18th, 2017 10:05 AM EDT | News 2 minute read Another report is out saying the iPhone 8 will sport an almost bezel-free display, and this time it’s from Bloomberg. This one backs up what we’ve already heard: A bigger display in an iPhone 7-size body, curved glass edges, OLED, and no physical Home button. New report backs up full-screen iPhone 8 design The latest information leak comes from insider sources speaking with Bloomberg said Apple has been experimenting with several design variations. Some have been axed because of production concerns, like the version with a curved display surface instead of just curved edges. Matching other reports, Bloomberg’s sources said the physical Home button is going away to make more room for the display. In its place we’ll see an on-screen virtual button. Right now Apple is considering a design that’s a throw back to the iPhone 4 with glass front and back and a metal band running around the edge. An aluminum back version is also in the running. The Touch ID sensor is still in flux. Apple wants to embed the fingerprint scanner in the display, but may be facing technical issues. Moving it to the back of the phone is an option, but the sources didn’t have anything to say on that. Matching iPhone 8 Reports Bloomberg’s report is inline with renderings we’ve seen over the past few days. First up is Benjamin Geskin’s rendering showing pretty much exactly the phone design we’re hearing about today. Geskin says his renderings are based on “real blueprints,” and a 3D model he got to see. Then we have the renderings from KK Sneak Leaks. Those, too, match what Bloomberg’s sources are describing, and are nearly identical to the images from Geskin. Both have a reputation for finding reliable sources, which adds some weight to their renderings. Based on what we’re seeing now, it looks like Apple plans to stack dual cameras on the iPhone 8 instead of placing the lenses side by side. The vertical lens positioning is supposed to offer better image quality. The flash placement, however, seems odd. It’s set between the two camera lenses, which seems like a perfect setup for light leaks in photos. Apple is adding a second front-facing camera, and both will be embedded below the display glass. That’ll have the effect of making them invisible until they’re being used. iOS 11 Gets a Reboot We won’t know much about iOS 11 until Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June. That’s where we typically get our first look at the next versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The insider sources said we’ll get to see iOS 11 at the event as expected, but it’ll be a more drastic change compared to previous updates because it’s getting what they’re calling a refreshed interface. That could mean visual style changes—like when Apple dropped skeuomorphism—or there may be more fundamental interface changes in the works. We won’t likely see what the iPhone 8 will look like at WWDC. That’ll come this fall when Apple hosts its new iPhone launch event. When that event happens—typically in September—sources expect we’ll see the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, along with the iPhone 8. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are expected to ship within a few days of Apple’s launch event. The iPhone 8, however, may not ship until several weeks—or even months—later.

Twitter Facebook Mobile, security tools among education tech favorites IT pros in education rave about MDM, security, network monitoring wares Ann Bednarz (Network World) 19 April, 2017 02:18 - - - - print email Comments In the school district of La Crosse, Vicki Lyons depends on mobile device management software from Jamf to manage the Wisconsin district’s fleet of iPads and MacBook Air devices. The Apple device management platform plays a key role in the district’s efforts to provide equitable access to technology to all of its students. “We use Jamf Pro as our device management solution for our 1:1 iPad program district-wide. As a result, we are driving student success with iPads and meeting their individual needs via personalized learning — something we weren’t able to previously do,” says Lyons, technology service director for the School District of La Crosse. “Giving each student an iPad has really made a difference in their lives, especially for those who didn’t previously have technology at home.” BE SURE NOT TO MISS: IT execs tout benefits of SD-WAN 5 must-have security tools Top U.S. colleges for computer science 10 reasons to look for a new job How San Diego fights off 500,000 cyberattacks a day Self-service features enable students to get their devices up and running in less than 20 minutes, Lyons says. “Once iPads are deployed, we’re able to collect dynamic inventory, reduce risks and protect resources, and ensure peace of mind with remote lock and wipe, automated patches, and reporting on backup status,” she says. Being able to easily inventory, deploy and secure Apple devices also eases the management burden on IT: “Our district has grown the program from 3,000 to more than 8,000 iPad and MacBook Air devices — all without having to increase our technical staff,” Lyons says. “Jamf Pro has made management of our Apple devices simple and secure. Most importantly, it’s helped us close the digital divide, and empower our students by providing them with digital equity in and outside of the classroom,” she says. Lyons shared her experience with Jamf as part of Network World’s annual Fave Raves project, which asks IT pros to talk about their favorite enterprise tech products. (Related: 31 tech pros share favorite IT products). This year, a number of IT pros from the education industry weighed in on their must-haves. At Concordia University, Jonathan Mierow depends on Code42 CrashPlan to back up distributed end-user data. “We needed a backup/DR solution that would be easy to deliver, maintain and administer. It's been the easiest deployment we've done for our university,” says Mierow, senior network administrator at the St. Paul, Minn., university. CrashPlan simplifies the deployment of freshly imaged machines to Concordia faculty and staff if they have issues with broken hardware or malware, he says. “With Code42, the faculty and staff know they can restore their own data as they need it. This alone has reduced calls to our help desk, as well as instilled confidence in our end users that the IT department is providing the right tools to protect their data.” “It can be difficult in higher education to get faculty and staff to buy into changes that IT would like to make, but after a brief explanation and some simple training, our users were off and running,” Mierow says. A few IT pros also talked about the tools they use to bolster security at higher-education institutions. Flush with personal data and valuable research, universities can be prime targets for hackers. Dutchess Community College, which is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system, relies on DatAdvantage from Varonis. The data security platform is designed to show organizations where sensitive data exists, who is accessing it, and how to keep it safe. “DatAdvantage is the only product in this space that gives you a single window into your unstructured data. In that one interface I can see who has access to my data, where the data lives, what type of data it is, and how long it has been since it was touched,” says Howard Ignal, director of information security and system architect at SUNY Dutchess in Poughkeepsie, NY. “DatAdvantage also [addresses] key regulatory requirements through data classification, which digs into your files looking for personally identifiable information/sensitive business material. The interface is very easy to use for both technical and non-technical staff.” “Varonis in the first month identified four locations where sensitive data was being stored,” Ignal says. “These locations would never have been located without Varonis running. During the first six months of using Varonis we identified multiple ransomware attacks and stopped them with ZERO data loss.” Looking ahead, SUNY Dutchess plans to expand its DatAdvantage deployment to include its Office 365 implementation and protect its offsite storage. “Doing this will give us full view of our data on premises and in the cloud,” Ignal says. “This is very important to our organization.” At Texas A&M University System, Daniel Basile has deployed Vectra’s cybersecurity platform to help defend the statewide higher-ed system that spans 11 universities and seven state agencies. “There are very few tools that allow you to distil cybersecurity event information to a level where a tier-1 analyst can make a meaningful decision with the information presented to him within five minutes,” says Basile, who is executive director of the security operations center at Texas A&M University System. “If the tool can do this without agents, without signatures, and without logs, many people would claim disbelief. With Vectra, we are able to obtain this.” The effectiveness of Vectra has allowed A&M System to monitor its system network and run a security operations center with an extremely small staff. “We are able to leverage student workers with an affinity for cybersecurity to act as our tier-1 analysts. This turns our titled tier-1 individuals effectively into tier-2 analysts,” Basile says. Vectra has also reduced the risk of costly data breaches. “On average, in the past, if you had a breach you called forensics and you found out about it usually a month after it actually occurred,” Basile says. “With Vectra, we found seven incidents, but we found them quickly enough I didn’t need to call an outside forensics team.” Early detection has saved A&M System millions of dollars, he says. Philip Grabowski, who is an IT, network, and security forensic instructor at Pittsburgh Technical College, shared his experience with Paessler’s PRTG network monitoring software. “Within minutes you can begin monitoring your network and get a visual on the topology. Immediately you can start researching problems on your network and fix them,” Grabowski says. “I use PRTG in a botnet lab to show students an attack from a Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), which creates a denial of service on the domain controller. We are also monitoring traffic in the botnet lab to detect if client machines are downloading torrents,” Grabowski says. “Students get hands-on experience using the product in the classroom without fear of harming a production environment. This provides confidence in the product in the field.” On the customer service front, Grand Canyon University uses Calabrio ONE to streamline contact center operations. Calabrio ONE, a workforce optimization suite, “makes my job easy,” says Sara de la Fuente, quality assurance specialist at Grand Canyon University. “I spend my entire day working out of Calabrio. It is easy to navigate, great for culling data/analytics, the customer support has been amazing, and the system is continuously rolling out new features.” Colleague Josie Trimnal, who is an operations quality analyst, adds that Calabrio ONE “has helped Grand Canyon University to streamline our quality management process and has assisted us in providing our agents with necessary, instant feedback to improve our overall customer experience.” 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Camera-Camera+ The iPhone 8 may come with a dual-lens front camera indeed, leaked schematics suggestAfter the Wall Street Journal, as well as various analyst shops, published their iPhone 8 tips in the last day or two, now is the turn of Bloomberg's sources to chip in on what is to be expected from Apple this year. Sadly, there isn't much new info in the report, but it does reiterate that Apple will issue no less than three new iPhones - two with orthodox 4.7" and 5.5" LCD displays, and one with an edge-to-edge OLED panel that will fit a screen slightly bigger than that of the 5.5" iPhone 7 Plus, in a chassis not much larger than the iPhone 7. Apparently, Apple has finalized a design for the OLED iPhone 8 with a flat, instead of the rumored curved OLED display, just as Macotakara tipped as well. There will still be slight curves towards the stainless steel frame, claim Bloomberg's anonymous sources, but those will be of the cover glass, rather than the display itself, and not as pronounced as earlier prototypes have suggested. Apple has even toyed around with a sample chassis that has been as curved as the soapy OG iPhone, but apparently left it on the shelf in the lab. In addition, it is said to equip the iPhone 8 with a vertical dual camera setup that will allow enhanced depth-of-field effects and augmented reality scenery. Also, the new Apple A11 chipset will be done with the trendy 10nm process, promising powerful frugality that may eventually lead to better battery life. So far so good, all of these tips we have heard already, but what took us by surprise is that Apple may have been testing a dual camera setup for the front cam as well. Given the edge-to-edge display that might be incorporating the earpiece, judging from some leaked schematics, it's not hard to see where will Apple fit a dual-lens selfie snapper there, as well as the rumored face-recognition tech. Apparently, some remaining features are still in flux, though, even at that late stage in the design process. For instance, Bloomberg reports that the engineers from Cupertino have indeed tried to shoehorn an in-screen finger scanner in the area where a virtual home button will be at the bottom of the iPhone 8 display, but those efforts haven't been fruitful so far, so that solution is very much up in the air, too, just as we heard recently.  All in all, the 2017 iPhone crop is shaping up to be a very intriguing mix of two phones with legacy design, so as not to spook the Apple loyals who are used to the current chassis, and an OLED device that will give those fans who crave a change something to consider, and potentially attract new blood to the iOS ecosphere. Speaking of iOS, Bloomberg says that the new iPhones will ship with iOS 11 (duh), which will usher in a visual interface overhaul, and that's something to look forward to as well. source: Bloomberg Huawei Watch 2 launches today in the US, free access to Google Play Music 18 Apr Prev news Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery life test result is out 18 Apr Next news Close newer posts Smartphone use reverses 40 years of car accidents decline 18 Apr Stable Android 7.1.2 Beta update is now available for Google Pixel phones 18 Apr Samsung Galaxy S8 unboxing and first look 18 Apr Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery life test result is out 18 Apr Now reading: The iPhone 8 may come with a dual-lens selfie camera The iPhone 8 may come with a dual-lens selfie camera 18 Apr Huawei Watch 2 launches today in the US, free access to Google Play Music 18 Apr Now that both are out, which would you buy: LG G6 or Samsung Galaxy S8 18 Apr Snapchat introduces World Lenses, transforming your surroundings into an 18 Apr Instagram introduces Collections, puts Pinterest on top of its hit list 18 Apr Samsung's upcoming Galaxy J5 (2017) seen in live images 18 Apr older posts Related phones Apple iPhone 8 Compare Specifications News[40] Rivals Photos Size it Videos iPhone 8 Related News   Apple is preparing a completely overhauled premium iPhone model: full-screen design, improved cameras and more   No 'wraparound' iPhone 8 display?

While the Galaxy S has been regarded for years as the best Android phone money can buy (at least until the Pixel came around), it’s always existed in the iPhone’s lengthy shadow. Even with a higher market share, a dominant OS, and a years-long lead on features like screen size and water resistance, the Galaxy S has stayed just out of reach of the iPhone zeitgeist. No matter how much it tried to create its own end-to-end experience, Apple fans saw it as a copycat and Android enthusiasts lamented its aggressive TouchWiz interface overhaul. All that has changed with the Galaxy S8+. With a stunning design that absolutely needs to be seen and a harmonious integration between hardware and OS, the Galaxy S8+ is the first phone in a long while that truly changes the conversation and resets our expectations. It might be a touch hyperbolic to compare it to the original iPhone, but it's hard to deny that the S8+ is a watershed moment for modern smartphones, despite the tragic and confounding placement of its fingerprint sensor. After years of barely-distinguishable rectangles jammed with features of dubious usefulness, Samsung has brought something entirely new to the table. [ Further reading: The best Android phones for every budget. ] And when the iPhone 8 comes out in September, people might not look at it quite so admiringly. Impossible dream If I didn’t know better I would have though Samsung sent me the wrong phone. The S8+ doesn’t look or feel anywhere near as big as it is, with a screen that makes other phablets seem small by comparison, despite a much smaller frame. Christopher Hebert/IDG The Galaxy S8, center, has a 6.2-inch screen, but is about the same size as the 5.7-inch HTC U Ultra (left) and the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus (right). Even after using it for several days, it’s still hard to believe that the S8+ has 6.2-inch display. At 159.5mm tall, it practically defies logic. Consider this: it’s smaller than the HTC U Ultra, and only a few millimeters taller than Galaxy S7 Edge, Pixel XL, and LG G6 but somehow adds a full half-inch of screen (and in the case of the Pixel and S7, nearly three-quarters of an inch). It’s like holding an optical illusion. And the Infinity Display, as Samsung is calling it, is an absolute pleasure to behold. The curved edges rest gracefully in your hand, and whether you’re using one hand or both, its natural contours and glass-and-metal craftsmanship give it a smooth feel without it being too cumbersome or slippery. Which is good, because it’s practically a crime to put it in a case. Slim is in Unlike some other slim-bezel smartphones, the Galaxy S8+ is blissfully symmetrical, with perfectly proportioned slivers of bezel above and below the screen. But where the S7 was available in white, silver, and gold, the S8+ only comes with black front plate, a move meant to seemingly put even greater emphasis on the screen. Every phone I’ve ever owned has had a black frame, so I’m on board with the decision, but some are sure to grumble over the silver and grey-backed versions having black bezels on the front. I think such a small area of color at the top and bottom of the screen would have been distracting. Christopher Hebert/IDG No matter which color you pick, you’ll be getting a black front plate with the S8+. The only quibble I have with the design is the same one I have with other Galaxy phones: the placement of the charging port. Where the speaker and the headphone jack are centered on the bottom edge of the device, the new USB-C port is a just a touch too low, otherwise ruining the perfect equilibrium. For a phone that pays such fastidious attention to its design, it’s a head-scratcher. Christopher Hebert/IDG Everything about the Galaxy S8+ is perfectly symettrical except for the USB-C port, which is just slightly off-center. Samsung has sculpted a real work of art with the Galaxy S8+. Features that would grab headlines on either phones, like IP68 water resistance and wireless charging, are practically an afterthought, and its competitors, including Apple, are going to have their work cut out for them. And the fact that Samsung was able to do all his without removing the 3.5mm headphone jack makes Apple’s “courageous” decision seem all the more outlandish. Christopher Hebert/IDG The AKG earbuds that ship with the Galaxy S8+ are hands-down the best bundled earphones I’ve ever used. As if to drive that point home, Samsung has bundled a pair of AKG wired earbuds, which are far and away the best sounding earphones I’ve gotten inside the box. I’m no audiophile, but the bass, balance, and volume of these things are top-notch, rivaling the sound I get from my PowerBeats3. Fingerprint fumble With an 83 percent screen-to-body ratio, Samsung didn’t leave much room on the Galaxy S8+ for much of anything else. Aside from the sensors, the front of the device has no distinguishable markings, and that includes the Samsung logo. However, even without its name emblazoned below the display, the S8+ is unmistakable, easily as identifiable as an iPhone 7. Doug Duvall/IDG Even next to another slim-bexeled phone like the LG G6 (left), the Galaxy S8+ is unmistakable. For the first time, Samsung is also doing away with the physical home button and back/recents buttons; hardly an innovation in Android land but new territory for Galaxy phones. And it kind of shows. While the pressure-sensitive virtual on-screen home button is a winner, the fingerprint button is in the worst possible place. Surely you’ve seen images of its location to the right of the camera, but it’s even more awkward than the pictures would have you believe. It took me longer to set up a single fingerprint than it does for multiple ones on other phones. A left-handed colleague actually had a slightly easier time, but I consistently missed the target when trying to use it. At times when I needed to use the fingerprint sensor for apps like Mint or 1Password, it took me several tries, sometimes to the point where it would have been quicker just to type in my password. (However, on the off chance that I hit it on the first try, it worked extremely quickly.) Doug Duvall/IDG You practically need to be a finger acrobat to hit the fingerprint scanner on the first try. Thankfully (or perhaps consequently), Samsung has provided multiple ways to unlock the S8+. In addition to the standard passcode and password options, there’s face and iris unlocking, both of which are quick but require you to stare at the front-facing cameras above the screen. The iris scanner is particularly impressive as well as being far more secure. It worked flawlessly nearly every time, even when I was wearing glasses. The only time I had difficulty was in direct sunlight, when the infrared sensor struggled to lock onto my irises until I took my glasses off. Doug Duvall/IDG The Galaxy S8+ has an iris scanner that works remarkable well. I quickly learned how to position my phone so my eyes would unlock it as quickly as possible, but I had a harder time adjusting to the face scanner. All in all, I would still prefer using my fingerprint. I also would have liked the ability to tap an area other than the virtual home button to wake the screen, but even so, the new unlocking methods are a nice upgrade for the S8+. Just keep in mind that face recognition could be spoofed by a picture, as Samsung warns, so iris scanning is your best bet here, unless you happen to have fingers like Elastigirl. At a Glance Galaxy S8+ Greenbot Rating $850.00 MSRP $850.00 View on Samsung With a gorgeous 6.2-inch display and a design that needs to be seen, the Galaxy S8+ truly changes the smartphone conversation. Pros Amazing, brilliant, eye-popping display. An incredible design that makes a 6.2-inch screen feel like a 5.7-inch one. Camera offers nice refinements over the S7, especially for selfies. Cons Fingerprint sensor is in a horrible location. Bixby isn't very useful or compelling.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile 5 ways the Galaxy S8 is better than the iPhone 7 Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye April 18th, 2017 at 11:25 AM Share Tweet With just three days to go before the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are officially released, the buzz surrounding Samsung’s next-generation flagship phones has reached new heights. I published my in-depth Galaxy S8 review earlier on Tuesday, and I made my feelings perfectly clear: Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the best Android phones of all time, hands down. In terms of hardware and design, they’re the best smartphones, period. That’s right, Samsung managed to pull off the unthinkable and out-design Apple for the first time ever. For a deep dive into Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, definitely be sure to check out BGR’s full review. In this supplemental post, we’ll cover five key ways the Galaxy S8 is better than the iPhone 7. Don't Miss: Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Meet the envy of every iPhone user Display Design The screen is obviously one of the most important components in any smartphone since it’s still the primary means of displaying content and interacting with content. And in the case of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, the display is the star of the show in so many ways. Beginning with the phone’s design, Samsung has managed to increase the screen-to-body ratio on its new phones to an impressive 83%. That compares with a screen-to-body ratio of just 66% on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Are these ratios really that important? You won’t be able to fully appreciate it until you experience it for yourself, but the answer is yes. Apart from looking much better, the user experience on the Galaxy S8 is so much more immersive than it is on the iPhone 7. It feels like you’re holding content in your hand, not a phone. Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8 is expected to adopt a similar design that is nearly all screen but until then, the Galaxy S8 has the upper hand in a big way. Display Quality This won’t come as much of a surprise to anyone who has ever used a Samsung flagship phone before, but the Galaxy S8’s screen advantage extends well beyond design. In terms of display quality, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ have no equal. Samsung’s Super AMOLED screens on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are simply stunning. They both have the same QHD+ resolution so the 5.8-inch screen on the smaller Galaxy S8 model actually has better pixel density than the larger 6.2-inch display on the Galaxy S8+. The difference is pretty big on paper — 570 ppi vs. 529 ppi — but I doubt even someone with 20/20 vision would be able to notice any difference at a normal viewing distance. In terms of comparing these screens to the displays on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, it couldn’t be easier: Samsung’s screens are better in every way. Blacks are deeper, colors are more vivid, the resolution is better, the contrast is better, and the clarity is better. Samsung has absolutely hit yet another home run with its Galaxy S8 and S8+ screens. Curved Edges Samsung’s first curved smartphones was a total gimmick that should not have existed. The Note Edge was the company’s first smartphone with a curved screen (on one side only), and it was also a gimmick that was next to useless. The curves on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are far from useless, however. They’re awesome. In terms of software features, the only benefit afforded by the curved screen on the S8 is an option that makes the exposed edges light up with incoming calls when the phone is face-down on a table or desk. Yeah, it’s not exactly Earth-shattering. The real benefit of the curved sides on the front and back of the phone is usability. The Galaxy S8+ is about the same width as the iPhone 7 Plus, and it’s actually a bit thicker than the 7 Plus at its center. But with one hand, I can comfortably reach from one side of the S8+’s display to the other. And Samsung’s rounded sides on the front and back don’t just extend the user’s reach, hey help the S8 and S8+ sit comfortably in the hand. It’s an awesome design. Charging Charging certainly isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you weigh the pros and cons of a smartphone. But if you stop for a moment and really think about it, this is a hugely important part of the user experience. We charge our phones each and every day, so the speed a phone can charge and the convenience with which it can be charged are actually a very big deal. The Galaxy S8 supports multiple fast charging standards. The iPhone 7 does not. The Galaxy S8 supports wireless charging, and even fast wireless charging. The iPhone 7 does not. Long story short, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ charge much faster than their iPhone counterparts, and they also have bigger batteries. Google Assistant Siri has come a long way since it was first introduced, and there’s no question that Apple’s virtual personal assistant is solely responsible for the recent explosion in similar solutions from rival companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung. As an iPhone user, however, I really enjoyed the personal assistant on Samsung’s Galaxy S8+ while I was reviewing it. No, not Bixby. Sure, Samsung’s own personal assistant solution shows promise, but its inability to support English-language voice commands at launch makes it a non-starter for the time being. I’m talking about Google Assistant, the latest evolution of Google’s assistant software. These AI driven assistants are always evolving, but Google’s young Assistant solution has already surpassed Siri in many ways. I often find that Siri gets confused, has trouble with context, or just flat-out gets things wrong when I ask it a question or speak a command. Google Assistant, on the other hand, is far more consistent and accurate. This is a big check in the Galaxy S8’s box for me.

Apple’s mobile payment service launched just over two years ago with hundreds of additional regional banks and credit unions added every few weeks. You can find the latest banks added below. Sony A6500 Agriculture Federal Credit Union Al-Gar Federal Credit Union Alabama Credit Union Andrew Johnson Bank Bay Federal Credit Union Cache Valley Bank City National Bank of Florida Co-op Credit Union of Montevideo Deere Employees Credit Union Farmers Bank (both AR and OH now) First National Bank of Barry Home Bank (both IN and LA now) Liberty National Bank Mid Minnesota Federal Credit Union My Community Federal Credit Union NET Credit Union Northwest Community Credit Union O Bee Credit Union Peoples Bank of Alabama Suffolk Federal Credit Union The Citizens Bank (both AL and KY now) The Old Fort Banking Co. Travis County Credit Union Four new institutions join Apple Pay’s list in Mainland China as well: Great Wall West China Bank Jinzhong Bank Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank The Rural Credit Union of Hainan Province As for new businesses, we wrote last year about the opportunities to expand support in the United States at many retail categories based on reader feedback. Jennifer Bailey, the head of Apple Pay, shared late last year that Apple’s mobile payment service is coming to GAP stores this year and is currently accepted by 35% of US retailers. And Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the first Mac to include Touch ID and support Apple Pay without a nearby Apple Watch. Apple Pay also recently became an option online for donations to several non-profit organizations. The Apple Store app for Apple Watch also supports Apple Pay for purchasing favorited items and Western Union has enabled cash transfers and bill payment through Apple Pay. Since launching in the United States, Apple Pay has expanded to Canada, France, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, Spain, Ireland, and Taiwan. Apple Pay lets you make purchases in supported stores using your iPhone or Apple Watch. Apple Pay can also be used to make purchases in supported apps on iPhone and iPad. Here’s how to set up Apple Pay if your bank is supported (full list): On the iPhone, just head to the Wallet app on iOS 9 or later and tap the plus (+) icon in the top right corner to begin, then follow the prompts. To add a debit card to the Apple Watch, go to the Apple Watch app on iPhone and look for the Wallet & Apple Pay section, then Add Credit or Debit Card section. iPads with Touch ID can use Apple Pay in apps; go to Settings then Wallet & Apple Pay to add your card there. If you’re looking for places to test out Apple Pay, Exxon Mobile added support for buying gas with Apple Pay through its SpeedPass+ app earlier this year. Stores like the Apple Store, Best Buy, Whole Foods, and Walgreens all accept Apple Pay as payment at checkout, and McDonalds, Subway, Starbucks and many restaurants through OpenTable accept Apple Pay payments as well. Apple also has a list of official partners here, and anywhere with the contactless payment logo at checkout should accept Apple Pay. Some stubborn retailers like CVS are still resisting Apple Pay in favor of their own solution despite having upgraded terminals, and Walmart has rolled out its own alternative while avoiding NFC terminals. Apple Pay works with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus; all Apple Watches; iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2, and both iPad Pro models. Macs can also now use Apple Pay with macOS Sierra.

The battery went to zero in less than three hours, far from the eight or so hours it used to go after a recharge. I called Apple – even though my computer (bought in 2011) was well beyond its warranty – and found the technical support people were friendly and caring in trying to diagnose my problem. Once, I hung up when the phone line was poor and the rep called back after I’d started another call, so I was juggling two technicians at once. But my battery charging problem persisted. I went to an Apple store, where a staffer checked my laptop and said it was operating normally. He even showed me a printout of the metrics. Really? I know my battery life is painfully short, so I plug my laptop into an outlet before most uses. That’s my Apple story. What’s yours? When I asked Toronto Star readers, they were enthusiastic about this admired company’s service and ability to resolve tough problems. I’ll relate a few stories today from satisfied customers and follow up with problems I sent to Apple to address. (This takes a while, it seems.) And yes, poor battery performance was mentioned by several readers. Grant Lowe: My older iPad 2 had software issues, with apps crashing and not displaying web pages properly. I spent time calling and sending emails. The diagnosis process took months. Apple finally replaced the tablet at no cost, though I’d purchased it secondhand refurbished from eBay. Unfortunately, the company doesn’t design products for longevity. Erwin Revin: I had a problem with my six-year-old iPad. I had updates waiting for two apps (Google and Google Maps), but they went dark when I started them. Rogers could not help me. I called Apple and they cured the problem after 30 to 45 minutes. They made me feel so important. I could not have been treated any better. James Busby: I went through three Apple TV 3rd generation products. Each one didn’t work. Finally, after many hours of calls, emails and trips to the official Apple stores, I spoke to a customer rep from California who was amazing. He sent me a new one, as well as a free AirPort Extreme base station (worth $249) for my troubles. Wow! The last Apple TV 3 I received has the same problem and it is way out of warranty. I wish managers were more accessible at Apple stores when you have serious non-warranty issues (a minor complaint). I own many Apple products and love them all. Judy Bernard: I had a battery problem with an iPhone I purchased in July 2016, still under warranty. My battery wouldn’t hold a charge. Online customer service found nothing wrong. They did a reset and then a restart, with no difference in battery life. I live in Havelock, Ont., almost two hours from an Apple store. I was desperate and took my phone there. Tests found nothing wrong. I went back two weeks later. Again, I was told this was normal. We had lunch and returned to the store. Because this was the third trip for the same problem, they gave me a new phone. I was warned the new phone probably wouldn’t solve the problem, but it lasts two to three days without recharging under normal use. Where does Apple service excel? I had no trouble chatting with or seeing a technician in a reasonable time. They were always polite. I did have trouble getting them to believe it was a product fault, even when they could see the battery was losing power quickly. But I did get a new phone that works as I believe it should. Mo Jansons: My son had a 15-minute school project recorded on an Apple phone. It was too large to be transferred via conventional means. Loading it into our older Apple laptop wouldn’t work either. The staff at the Apple store spent three hours with us (serving other clients while our files were loading) until the problem was resolved. Naturally, the new laptop we bought was from them. Dad of autistic 7-year-old son: We received an iPad Mini to foster his communication skills as a “talkie.” This includes Apple Care, where we get three replacements, no questions asked, for a $50 fee. He’s learned to use this device to ask for things and reduce frustrations in everyday life. But my son is very active. We have broken five devices in two years and gone through countless “indestructible cases,” which Best Buy replaced without an issue (OtterBox has lasted the longest). At the Apple store, when the damage appears to be their fault, they replace the device. I haven’t had to pay the deductible. For a small cost, we’ve been able to replace many devices and not have it cost a fortune. I like to see how accommodating and inquisitive their staff is when they hear it’s a communicative device. Because of the protection and the humanity of such a huge chain, I will definitely continue to use them. Now if only they can custom-make some devices that are more sturdy. Dear readers: Join the conversation. What is your experience of Apple’s products and services compared to others you’ve owned? And what can you do with a fading battery if not ready to buy a new device?

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 18, 2017 4:15 pm UTC Enlarge / The Jet Black iPhone 7, replete with fingerprints. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 113 Share this story Apple is said to be planning not one, not two, but three new iPhones for release this fall, if "people familiar with the matter" speaking to Bloomberg are to be believed. Further ReadingSamsung Galaxy S8 hands-on: Samsung produces a stunning redesign Two of those models will use the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch IPS screens that we're already used to, though Bloomberg doesn't say whether the designs will look much different from the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. But this year Apple is also said to be preparing a third higher-end model with a dramatically different approach, a slim-bezeled design with curved glass and an OLED screen that takes up most of the front of the device. If true, it's something that doesn't sound all that different from what Samsung is doing with the Galaxy S8. According to the report, all three phones would be revealed at the same time, but the redesigned model wouldn't actually ship until later. Other than this basic information, the report is heavy on guesses about what Apple could do with the redesigned iPhone while offering little concrete information on what it will do, which isn't totally surprising five months out from its September-ish reveal (the iPhone is currently the only one of Apple's products still updated on a predictable yearly cadence). Apple could ship a dual-lens camera system with the lenses aligned vertically instead of horizontally; the design could include a camera bump; the design could use a dual-lens front camera; Apple might integrate the TouchID sensor into the display glass instead of using a separate button; the phone could use curved glass on the front and back with a thin iPhone 4-style metal band around the edges; it could also use glass on the front that curved to meet a metal back, much like the current designs. Also, none of that could be true. Apple has tested all of these things, according to the report, but it's not clear which ideas the company actually plans to use. There are just a couple of points on which the report does not equivocate: the phones will ship with iOS 11, which will include some design changes; and all three phones will use processors manufactured on a 10nm process rather than the current 16nm TSMC process used for the Apple A10. Both Samsung and TSMC are working on 10nm manufacturing processes that ought to be ready by the time new iPhones are shipping, so Apple could use either manufacturer (Samsung made the A7 and many chips prior to that; TSMC makes the A10) or both (as with the A8 and A9, though the latter chip caused some controversy at the time). A shift in strategy A three-iPhone strategy would be a major departure from the two-phone strategy that has served Apple so well since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus came out in late 2014. Those phones sold so well throughout 2015 that iPhone sales actually fell year-over-year for the first time in 2016, since the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus couldn't match that performance. Even still, having a medium-sized phone and a big phone has been good for Apple's sales, and it's the only iPhone design that Apple has used (with minor external tweaks) for three hardware generations. And while the "three iPhone" strategy has been reported before by less reliable analysts and rumor sites, it does seem like an odd way for Apple to mix up its strategy. Yes, after three years of the same basic iPhone 6-era design, pundits are hoping for something that looks new, and it probably would help drive upgrades from people using 6 and 6Ses. But why release two upgraded 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones and then depress their sales by simultaneously announcing another, better iPhone that won't be available for weeks? At a bare minimum, I'd expect pre-orders to go up at the same time and for the new phone to be available at least in limited quantities shortly thereafter. It's also possible that the new 4.7 and 5.5-inch phones are designed to occupy Apple's middle iPhone tier, currently occupied by the iPhone 6S. Normally the iPhone 7 would just be bumped down upon the release of a new phone, but Apple has been known to release new phones to its middle tier (the iPhone 5C, a very modestly refreshed version of the iPhone 5) and its low tier (the iPhone SE, which put most of the iPhone 6S' parts into a 5S-style case). The redesigned iPhone could then sit comfortably atop the lineup, rather than creating some new fourth ultra-high-end tier that would disrupt the "good-better-best" system Apple has used for iPhones for most of a decade.

If you're the world's biggest smartphone maker, you keep doing what you know -- tweaking, innovating, improving and building the very products that lead to success. Samsung could have taken the easy route, slightly changing the modern S7 design while it regrouped. Instead, Samsung pushed the smartphone narrative forward with the Galaxy S8. After using the Galaxy S8 for almost a week, one thing is abundantly clear to me: Apple is now in a position of playing catch-up when it comes to design and features. Specifications: Size : 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm, 155g Water/dust resistance: IP68 Display: 5.8-inch Quad HD+ (2960x1440) 570 ppi Storage: 64 GB with microSD support up to 256 GB Memory: 4 GB RAM Battery: 3,000 milliamp-hour Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in the US, Samsung's Exynos in regions to be announced Camera: Rear-facing dual pixel 12-megapixel. Front-facing 8-megapixel with autofocus Operating System: Android 7.0 with Samsung Experience 8.1 Connectivity: USB-C, NFC, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth From design follower, to design leader Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Apple has, for years, been considered the leader in the design of smartphones, setting the standard for the entire industry, and Samsung spent years copying those designs. At times, Samsung's devices were a blatant rip-off of Apple's hard work. For the past few years, Samsung has slowly moved away from following Apple's lead, finding its design prowess. We had the first glimpse -- quite literally -- when the Note 7 launched. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 However, with the Galaxy S8, Samsung has set the bar for all smartphone makers in 2017. Ditch the bezels, increase screen size, and get rid of the camera bump for good. samsung galaxy S8 Samsung's near-perfect comeback leaves competitors in the dust 11 reasons why Galaxy S8 is better than iPhone 7 for business Galaxy S8 does DeX: Is it a Chromebook challenger or virtual desktop play? Android flagships: Which is best for the enterprise? Samsung confirms Galaxy S8 red display issue Samsung blocks ability to remap Galaxy S8's Bixby button I can already hear Apple pundits crying foul in regards to that statement, finding fault with the fact that the various ports and holes dotting the edges of the S8 still aren't lined up; but it's a tired narrative and needs to end. Apple takes the time to ensure all of the ports line up perfectly and it does look nice. That said, I find it frivolous to discount an entire device based on the alignment of ports. Also: Galaxy S8 Plus: Stunning display, balanced design, advanced technology | CNET: A big-phone lover's dream, but, man, that fingerprint reader | Video: Samsung Galaxy S8: The good, the bad, the beautiful Speaking of ports, on the bottom of the Galaxy S8 is a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-C port, and a lone speaker grill. It's unfortunate the S8 doesn't have stereos speakers, especially considering Samsung's continued approach powering Gear VR with its flagship phones. The right side is home to the lone power button. The top of the phone has a SIM card and microSD tray. The left side is the busiest, with a volume rocker and the dedicated Bixby button. Samsung's physical home button is gone, replaced by a pressure sensitive digital button that appears and disappears depending on what you're actively doing on the phone. At any time, you can press where the home button should be to activate and use it. The fingerprint sensor moved to the back of the phone, to the left of the camera lens. It's an odd place for the sensor, with most Android device makers instead putting the fingerprint sensor below the camera lens. Doing so reduces the number of inadvertent fingerprint smears across the camera lens which can muck up photos. My first day of using the S8, I consistently struggled to find the sensor with my left or right hand. And when I did find it, I failed to line up my finger to get an accurate reading to unlock the phone. After about three days of use, finding the sensor became second nature, and now I hardly encounter issues unlocking the phone with my fingerprint. It's an adjustment that users will fret over for a few days, and then any reservations will go away. It's all about the (lack of) bezels Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Due to the S8's taller 5.8-inch display and odd 18.5:9 aspect ratio, the phone is narrower and easier to hold with one hand than Apple's iPhone 7 Plus, despite the S8's bigger display. Placing the iPhone 7 Plus next to the Galaxy S8, the iPhone's design instantly looks dated, as does the LG G6's box-like design The curved edges serve two purposes. First, they look good. Second, they make the phone fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. Previously, I noted my switch from the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone to the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. I was hesitant in the past to make the switch due to just how big the Plus size iPhone is. The bezels of the iPhone 7 Plus, making room for sensors and the home button, are to blame for its gigantic size. Rumors indicated Apple is planning to follow Samsung's lead by trimming down the bezels and potentially moving the fingerprint sensor to the back of this year's iPhone -- all things Samsung has already done and has in customers' hands. The Samsung Experience Drill down into the settings app, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a single reference to Samsung's longtime proprietary Android skin, TouchWiz. The lack of TouchWiz references isn't new, as Samsung has slowly moved away from a term associated with overbearing changes and features. As Samsung's focus on design has increased, its focus on making substantial software changes has decreased. Starting with the Galaxy S8, any alterations made to Android are considered part of the "Samsung Experience." Specifically, the S8's settings menu lists Samsung Experience 8.1. TouchWiz is dead, long live... actually, never mind. The Samsung Experience includes a new launcher, ditching a button dedicated to opening the app drawer and giving users the option to abandon the app drawer altogether (going with an iOS-like home screen with every app on display). There are still some changes Samsung makes to Android that seem more confusing than they are helpful. For example, a long-press on an app icon displays a popup menu to uninstall or put an app to sleep, instead of Android 7.1's quick actions shortcut. How is Samsung going to reconcile the two interactions when the S8 is updated to Android 7.1? In spite of quick actions, the overall changes Samsung has made to Android have added to the experience, instead of completely distracting from it as has been the case in the past. Half-baked Bixby Jason Cipriani/ZDNet As Samsung announced last week, the company's personal assistant isn't quite ready. At launch, the S8 will have Bixby Reminders, Home, and Vision. Voice, arguably the most important aspect of the feature, will arrive via an update later this spring. Bixby Home is a feed of information and services such as your daily agenda, contact and app recommendations based on time of day, news updates (pulled from Flipboard), and Samsung Health data. The Home panel is accessed through a quick press of the Bixby button, or by swiping to the right on the S8's home screen. In my testing, Home has been slow to open and buggy. However, Samsung updated the Bixby app while I was writing this review and in the short amount of time since installing it, the lag seems to have been fixed. Notwithstanding its sluggishness to open, Home has presented helpful information, with minimal interaction on my part. Bixby Vision uses the camera to scan objects, giving you shopping results via Amazon, translate or extract text, and identify landmarks. I used Vision a few different times, and it correctly identified various items like a coffee mug, down to the color, along with an iPhone 7 Plus and provided Amazon listings for screen protectors and cases for it. It's frustrating and unfortunate Bixby isn't ready. Samsung included a dedicated button for the service, and right now that button is crippled. When Bixby Voice is released in the US, a long press on the button will prompt the phone to wait for commands such as "Text my wife" or "What's the weather like?" As disappointing as it is for Bixby Voice to be missing right now, delaying a product that isn't ready is the right move by Samsung. I'd rather have a product that's available for use than try to use something that's nowhere near ready. Performance In the US, Samsung continues using Qualcomm's Snapdragon line of processors. For the S8, the Snapdragon 835 is making its debut. Outside of the slowness, I experienced when launching Bixby Home -- something I'm fairly sure is a software issue -- I rarely experienced any sluggishness or slowing on the S8. One aspect of using Android devices I've learned to live with is some stuttering when quickly scrolling through the Facebook app or my Twitter feed. From the Google Pixel to the Galaxy S7 Edge to the LG G6, a stutter while scrolling, no matter how small, is always present. With the S8, I have yet to notice any scrolling stutter. Battery life has been mixed during my testing. One day my review unit would run low on battery by mid-afternoon, other days I would go to bed with 40-percent of charge left. Part of my experience is due to receiving a T-Mobile unit, which has almost no coverage where I live, so the phone is repeatedly searching for a signal, impacting the battery. As for the new iris scanner and facial recognition features, I didn't use either one all that often. I found it faster to put my finger on the sensor as I removed the phone from my pocket, instead of lifting up the S8 and waiting for it to scan my face. On the days during testing when I wore a baseball hat facial recognition was slower than it was without one. On days when I wore glasses instead of contact lenses, iris scanning all but quit working. While it's fun to advertise either one as a positive feature, fingerprint unlock continues to be the quickest and most reliable method to unlock the S8 using biometrics; especially for those of us who wear glasses. Camera Samsung left its rear camera unchanged, instead relying on software processing improvements to provide better image quality. I'm not sure the S8's camera is noticeably better than the S7, and that's not a bad thing. The camera on the S7 was already one of the best in a smartphone. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet I captured the above photo with the S8 during my son's soccer game. After holding the phone, ready to catch my son as gameplay came near the sideline where I was sitting for several minutes, I eventually put the phone in my lap. Later in the game, as I realized the ball was heading towards me with my son right behind it, I double-pressed the power button on the S8 to open the camera, lifted it up, and pressed the shutter button. I didn't focus, let alone frame the shot at all, and the result was the above photo. The entire picture is in focus, has virtually no motion blur (they were running, after all) and required zero thinking on my part. The speed and ease of which I snapped that picture left me impressed. The front-facing camera is 8-megapixels and has auto-focus with facial recognition. A nearly perfect device Jason Cipriani/ZDNet The standard is set. Between the hardware design, software tweaks and services such as Samsung Pay, Samsung has not only put the Note 7 fiasco firmly in its rear view mirror, but it's passed every other smartphone manufacturer. The Galaxy S8 is as close to a perfect smartphone as you can get. The fingerprint sensor is accurate, but the facial tech is still a work in progress. Samsung's new less-is-more approach to software is welcomed, though some changes are still confusing. And launching a flagship device without its flagship software feature is a huge miss. Even with its imperfections, Samsung's Galaxy S8 is the best smartphone money can buy right now. And unless Apple surpasses everyone's expectations later this year, it likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

According to the approval, the DMV will let Apple experiment with its self-driving software and technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h SUVs. Six people are authorized to take control of those cars if it is needed during the testing procedure, which means that the team will work in pairs and shifts. It is worth noting that Google, Apple’s rival in many areas, has also started its self-driving car program using Toyota and Lexus models, and it still operates a fleet of Lexus RXs in its centers. However, Google has since moved on to collaborate with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, meaning the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will be the next mule for this technology. The Cupertino giant has long been rumored to make an entry in the self-driving car field, and leaked information has revealed that the company named the department “Project Titan.” Initial rumors referred to an autonomous car as the final objective of Apple’s efforts, but other reports have announced that it has changed its goals to making software for driverless vehicles. Switching the plan from a hardware and software vendor to relying on someone else’s hardware was a surprising move from Apple, but it may make sense if you consider the costs involved in launching a new car brand. After all, even companies that are funded by billionaires struggle to put their dreams on the road, so Apple’s decision must be linked to strategy and finances. Google has a different philosophy here, and the Mountain View conglomerate has even built its proprietary vehicles. However, even the search giant chose to partner-up with a traditional automaker on this project, so Apple’s idea of sticking to software may not have been wrong. Other sources reported that Apple is thinking about developing a “transportation platform,” NY Times notes, which could refer to an ecosystem of self-driving vehicles that could be shared by clients who have an app installed on their smartphones. This would be a comfortable playing field for the Cupertino company.

Twitter Facebook Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be great phones -- once Bixby works Enterprise features stand out on this excellent flagship line, but the touted Bixby virtual assistant doesn’t come close to delivering. Dan Rosenbaum (Computerworld (US)) 19 April, 2017 01:01 - - - - print email Comments Smartphone reviewers throw around the term "flagship" pretty loosely, to the point where it's come to mean "a high-spec phone from a major or mid-level manufacturer." But when you get your hands on a phone with the technical excellence and attention to detail of the Samsung Galaxy S8 series, you're reminded that there's more to a great phone than a bunch of chips. Like Apple and Google, Samsung has something more in mind than just selling phones. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are devices that bring you into a useful ecosystem in exactly the same way that Apple does with the iPhone and Google does with Android. The front door to that ecosystem is the assistive software that Samsung calls Bixby. Intended as a direct competitor to Google Assistant, Bixby is an ambitious feature that's in its very early days. But wait, there's more: For enterprise customers, Samsung has given us DeX, a device that lets you attach a keyboard, mouse and monitor to the phone and use it as a desktop machine. Admittedly, it's been an epically lousy year for Samsung. The Galaxy Note 7 phone showed a propensity for bursting into flames, and was recalled and banned by airlines. A line of high-end washing machines was recalled because the lids sometimes flew off during the spin cycle. Lee Jae-yong, head of Samsung's parent company, Samsung Group, and a pillar of industry in the company's home country of South Korea, was arrested and accused of bribery in a wide-ranging political scandal. That the company is able to maintain focus and produce anything of value is a remarkable achievement. The Galaxy S8 phones are, by any measure, excellent. I was provided with the jumbo-sized S8+ in black, operating on the T-Mobile network. The 8+ is 2.9 x 6.3 in., but crams a 6.2-in. diagonal quad-density (2680 x 1440) Super AMOLED screen into that space. The S8 is slightly smaller: 2.7 x 5.9 in. with a 5.8-in. quad-density Super AMOLED screen. (That and a slightly less powerful battery in the S8 are the only differences between the two.) By way of comparison, the S8+ is the same width and about a quarter-inch taller than the withdrawn Note 7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge. The Note 7 had a 5.7-in. screen and S7 Edge has a 5.5-in. screen; the S8+'s display is 6.2 in. Somehow, all that extra real estate does not translate into an unwieldy feel. Yes, the phone is big, but it avoids feeling out of scale or too large for your hand -- and I'm not generally a fan of plus-sized phones. [ Further reading: 30 tasty tips for Android Nougat ] The phones are fully wrapped in Corning Gorilla Glass 5. In both, the screen curves along the long edges, giving the illusion of no bezel; in truth, the bezel that's there is minimal. The S8+'s chin and forehead each measure 0.25 in. The impression is that of a full-screen bezel-less glass device, a window rather than a phone, the edges of which are curved in a way that make it easy to hold. Hardware specs are as premium as you'd expect. The exact components you'll get depend on where you live. In the U.S., the S8s use the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 8-core chipset; everywhere else, Samsung uses its own Exynos chips. Certainly, with the U.S. chips, graphics rendering and application speed were excellent. If you're interested in test figures, AnTuTu benchmarks came in at 163307, topping all Android phones, although barely besting the OnePlus 3T's 162297. (The iPhone 7 Plus' 184546 still rules the roost.) The 3500mAh battery needed 7 hours, 30 minutes to run down with the screen set to full brightness and all power saving off, and the phone took just 3 hours 10 minutes to charge (wirelessly) from zero to 100%. (The smaller-screened S8 comes with a 3000mAh battery.) Certainly, the S8+ will get you through your day -- several of them, if you're a light user. Oh -- and charging/discharging battery temperatures never got higher than 103 degrees F. On the bottom of the phone is a headphone jack, USB-C port and single speaker; along the right edge is a power/wake button; at the top is the SIM/microSD drawer, and along the right is a volume rocker and a button that activates the Bixby assistant. The back is flat and carries the phone's only branding, which is an extraordinarily subtle gray logo on black. There's a thin, barely visible ridge around the camera, near the top edge on the back, next to the phone's fingerprint sensor, which has a similar ridge surrounding it. I generally approve of fingerprint sensors on the backs of phones, but the relatively small size and placement of this one -- right next to the camera lens -- seems to be begging for smudged photos. The other tech aboard the S8 phones is everything you might expect and maybe a little more. Android 7, of course. There's an NFC chip that runs Samsung Pay. Wi-Fi at 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5.0 (the first device I've seen with that), and GPS radios for A-GPS, the Russian GLONASS, the European Galileo and the Chinese BDS (which I also don't think I've noticed on any other phone). No FM radio, but there are heart-rate and pulse oximetry sensors, and ANT+ for communicating with fitness devices. And, for the clumsy among us, the Galaxy S8s continue to have an IP68 rating, which means your phone can survive five feet of water for half an hour, which is lots more than you can do. The spirit of near-excess carries over to the software side of the S8s, too. It's not uncommon for phones to have a PIN lock, a pattern lock, and a fingerprint lock. The S8s add iris scans and face recognition to the biometrics package. Iris scans don't work particularly well if you wear glasses (as I do). On the other hand, the face recognition is several notches better than Android standard. It takes a little practice to use, is a bit fussy about light, and works about 75% of the time. But it wasn't fooled by photos or family members. And if it won't unlock your phone, you can always fall back on fingerprints or PIN. One thing: You have to choose either iris scan or face recognition; you can't fall back from one option to the other. The user interface, based on Samsung's TouchWiz Android skin, is so flexible that I was left wondering sometimes if the company wasn't just showing off. The company redesigned the basic icons, which wasn't really necessary, but I suppose the new versions are all right. There's no explicit icon for bringing up the app tray -- you can just swipe up from any home screen to see your installed apps -- unless you want one, in which case there's a setting for that. Edge apps -- shortcuts that are activated by swiping from a screen edge -- first appeared on the S7 Edge and return on both S8 models, but it's a feature that still seems less useful than it ought to be. There's a nine-band parametric equalizer and high-res DAC for when you use the included AKG earbuds (remember that Samsung bought Harman last November). You can also decide to play sound from, say, YouTube on your phone speaker while directing Spotify to output on a Bluetooth device. If the phone feels too big for your hand, you can enable thumb gestures that temporarily shrink the contents of the screen so you can reach everything easily. The Settings menus are extensive but clear. If you can't find some elusive setting, though, search is easily accessible, and the UI team did a good job at including links within the Settings menus that guide you where you might want to go. T-Mobile's app stack is typically lightweight, nonintrusive and useful. There are apps for TV streaming, voicemail, call blocking and account management. DeX For enterprises, maybe the biggest triumph of the Galaxy S8 is something called DeX, which lets you plug your phone into a dock and use it like a desktop device. It's not the first phone to do this -- HP's Elite x3 Windows phone got there last year, although it's not a mainstream device and didn't seem to get much traction. The thing about DeX is that it Just Works. The DeX device itself costs $150. It's a puck about 4 in. in diameter and 2 in. high. (It looks like a wireless charger, but isn't.) Around the back are two USB-A ports, an Ethernet port, an HDMI port and a USB-C port. The top of the puck slides up to reveal a male USB-C plug where you dock the phone. Plug in an HDMI monitor, a USB or Bluetooth keyboard, power through the USB-C port on the back, pair a Bluetooth mouse to the phone (although I imagine a USB mouse would work), pop the phone onto USB-C plug, and presto! You've got a desktop computer. Barbara Krasnoff/IDG Samsung's DeX lets you dock the phone and connect it to a large monitor, keyboard and mouse. When you look at the monitor, along the left edge of the screen you'll see icons for a file manager, Samsung's browser, Samsung's email app, a photo gallery and the phone's settings. On the bottom left are familiar Android icons for Back, Home and Recent. Next to that are icons for all open apps, and to the right along the bottom are icons that you normally see on an Android phone's eyebrow line: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, battery charge and the like.Â  Jon Phillips/IDG When DeX is plugged in, you see a variety of phone- and application-related icons along the sides and bottom of the screen. What may be most remarkable about DeX is how unremarkable it seems. I ran it on an Asus 1920 x 1080 monitor -- which has significantly lower resolution than the phone's native screen -- and there was no noticeable lag or obvious video flaws. I didn't run a full-resolution movie or live sports, because that's not the main application here, although full-screen news simulcasts were crisp. You will want a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, because audio is otherwise routed through the phone's indifferent speaker, which is largely blocked by the DeX unit itself. I fired up a browser, and found that Google Docs and Microsoft Office Live worked perfectly well. So did the associated Android apps. I'm too much of a traditionalist to abandon my laptop to carry a DeX and trust that I'd be able to find a keyboard, monitor and power source when I need one. But an S8/DeX combination makes for a totally credible light network client, and appears to be something that enterprises can think about planning around. Bixby With the Galaxy S8 line, Samsung is rolling out a personal assistant called Bixby. The promise of Bixby is that it will replace Google Assistant as both an information source and a voice interface. Shortly before the phones shipped, however, Samsung announced that the voice interface part of Bixby was being held back for a while because it just wasn't fully cooked. What did ship with the S8+ was the image recognition and information feeds that are part of Bixby, and they're not quite fully cooked, either. The image recognition feature is very ambitious: Bixby promises to recognize objects you view with the camera and propose places you could buy them. Another Bixby tool promises to translate words that it sees with the camera. In my tests, none of this worked well at all. Bixby was unable to recognize anything, much less shop for it, and although it recognized text, it didn't do so well enough to make translations enlightening. Tapping the Bixby button twice on the phone's left edge or swiping right from the home screen showed a list of Bixby cards that will look extremely familiar to users of Google Now. This worked fairly well, although Bixby doesn't yet know me, my interests, and my habits nearly as well as Google does. How could it? In any movie about sentient computers, the first reel is about how the AI doesn't know anything, the second reel is about how the AI becomes alive and useful, and the third reel is about how it takes over humanity. Bixby is at the beginning of the first reel, and whether Google has yet reached the second reel is a matter for debate. But the point is, it's very early days for Bixby. It doesn't work very well at all, but it would be a mistake to think that Samsung is going to give up on it. One downside of Bixby: It requires a Samsung Cloud login. It's free, but it's just one more cloud service to be worried about. What's strategically interesting about Bixby is that it's Samsung's loudest signal yet that it's uncomfortable under Google's Android umbrella. The S8 comes with Samsung native apps -- a browser, an email app, a messaging app -- front and center. The standard Google app stack here is noticeably light: Android Pay, Gmail, Drive, Play, Play Store, YouTube, Duo and Photos. Chrome and Google Calendar are not preloaded. You can get to Google Assistant's voice interface by holding down the Home button, but swiping right will only get you Bixby's cards. And although I didn't hack around with it, there are reports that Samsung has made it impossible for programmers to reassign the Bixby key to something more useful -- like Google Assistant. It feels as though Samsung considers Android to be something of a necessary evil. Cameras The cameras on the S8+ are as feature-ridden as the rest of the phone. The main camera is a 12MP f/1.7 device that can shoot both JPEG and RAW files in Pro mode. Video resolution goes up to 4K. The selfie camera is an 8MP device that can shoot quad HD resolution and be triggered by touch, by voice or by showing your palm. One very nice camera control allows zooming by dragging the shutter button left or right. It's much more convenient than pinching and spreading your fingers. Camera modes include a very detailed Pro mode, panorama, slow motion, hyperlapse, a food mode and a 3D "bullet" mode. You can enhance skin tone, put color filters on pictures, and attach Snapchat-style masks and annotations if you swing that way. Bottom line Not everyone wants to spend $750 for a phone, and not everyone should. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are beautiful pieces of well-conceived and magnificently executed technology. You can spend half the money (or less) and have a perfectly good phone that will serve you well. But if you're in the market for an elegant top-of-the-line Android phone that can do anything you'd expect plus a few other things besides, the current state of the art is the Galaxy S8 line. And if you're equipping a mobile enterprise, the S8/DeX combination might make for a compelling choice. At a Glance Galaxy S8 and S8+ Samsung Price:Â $750/$850 (AT&T); $720/$840 (Verizon); $750/$850 (T-Mobile); $750/$850 (Sprint); also available at various retailers Pros: Great performance; fine build quality; more configurability than with revious models; dock allows use as desktop computer Cons: Bixby virtual assistant still half-baked; high price in comparison to similar phones 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Twitter Facebook Review: Samsung Galaxy S8 fails the likability test The big-screen Android smartphone is too slick for its own good, with poor design decisions that render it unnecessarily hard to use IDG Galen Gruman (InfoWorld) 19 April, 2017 01:00 - - - - print email Comments What happened? Samsung’s Galaxy S7, released last year, was a very nice smartphone: comfortable to hold and a pleasure to use. It was Samsung’s best Galaxy model ever—not so much the new Galaxy S8, which goes on sale today and ships on April 20. The Galaxy S8 seems to suffer from the same disease afflicting Apple’s latest MacBooks: engineering navel-gazing leading the product design astray. [ Review: [[add link here]]Samsung Dex brings Android to the desktop. | Android is now ready for real usage in the enterprise. Read InfoWorld’s in-depth guide on how to make Android a serious part of your business. | Get the best office suite and the 38 best business-worthy apps for your Android device. ] Poor ergonomics make using the Galaxy S8 a pain Take the new shape. It’s taller, the fingerprint sensor is moved to the back, and both sides of the so-called Infinity display are curved. These changes have unfortunate implications in everyday usage: The Galaxy S8 is hard to use one-handed, because much of the screen is too far from the finger reach of most people. I tested the smaller 5.8-inch unit; I can only imagine the larger 6.2-inch Galaxy S8+ model has to be double-handed like a small tablet. Yes, the Galaxy S8 includes Samsung’s one-handed mode optimizations (in the Settings app) available to previous Galaxy models, but with the new taller aspect ratio of the Galaxy S8, one-handed use is still awkward. There’s no real benefit to that extra height. The fingerprint sensor is hard to work with because you can’t see where it is. And you have to pick up the phone to use it, so forget about quickly checking status from the phone resting on your desk or airplane seat tray. Worse, the sensor is right next to the rear camera, so it’s harder to find by touch and results in the camera lens getting covered in fingerprints. (Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL also have a fingerprint sensor in the back, with similar issues resulting; at least Google kept the fingerprint sensor far from the rear camera. I dearly hope that the rumors of Apple moving the fingerprint sensor or home button to the back of the next iPhone are false—it’s a bad trend.)  The curved sides create a bowed effect for the screen, which can make text on the edges harder to read. I don’t get the appeal. It’s a tad wider than the Galaxy S7’s screen, but the curved areas become avoidance zones for information. In effect, the Galaxy S8 is no wider. Because of the curved sides, the Galaxy S8 is also harder to grip. The wedge shape is less comfortable to press against your hand and harder to pick up from a surface. The midnight black Galaxy S8 I tested was slippery to hold, similar to Apple’s glossy black iPhone 7. (The casing almost feels oily.) Due to the slipperiness, it’s also harder to pick up. I have not had Galaxy S8s with the other two finishes—arctic silver and orchid gray—to test to see if they are as slippery. The Infinity screen is glossy, so it’s one big mirror in many lighting conditions. The usual hardware improvements but nothing else special Ergonomics matter, but not apparently to the Galaxy S8’s design team. The Galaxy S8’s ergonomic issues don’t go away as you use it, though you’ll learn to adapt somewhat out of necessity. I also found the touchscreen on the Galaxy S8 to be less responsive than those on the predecessor Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7, or the iPhone 6, iPhone 7, and Google Pixel XL. At least Samsung kept the audio jack. I’m still not happy about its removal from the iPhone 7. If the Galaxy S8’s poor ergonomics don’t turn you away (some folks absolutely love it), you’ll get a powerhouse smartphone that holds its own against Apple’s iPhone 7, Google’s Pixel series, and LG’s G6. Me, I’d go for the classier Pixel or save some money and get the classier Galaxy S7. (For people willing to leave Android, I’d recommend the older iPhone 6s or, if the audio jack omission doesn’t bother you, the iPhone 7.) Every new smartphone has better specs, and the Galaxy S8 is no exception. (One exception: Its rear camera hasn’t yet made the leap to dual cameras like other flagship smartphones have.) But any flagship is more than capable enough, so specs alone are no reason to ditch any recent flagship smartphone you may have. Beyond the weakened ergonomics and the beefier hardware, the Galaxy S8 has a few new features. One is the new facial recognition system for unlocking the phone. It’s not especially secure, so Samsung won’t let you use it for purchasing through Android Pay or Samsung Pay. It’s also a bit slow to recognize your face (and can’t deal with things like people wearing glasses), similar to its predecessor in the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. But you might want to use it to unlock your phone rather than fiddle with the hidden fingerprint sensor. Personally, I find entering an old-fashioned PIN easier and faster than going with either the fingerprint sensor or facial recognition. Another new feature is Bixby, Samsung’s attempt to join the virtual assistant party. (Siri, Google Assistant, and Cortana must be feeling a lot less exclusive these days with Amazon Alexa and now Samsung Bixby joining the fray.) But Bixby doesn’t work yet; Samsung pulled it at the last minute and now says it will be made available through an upgrade later this year. Rumor has it Bixby couldn’t understand English. I don’t care whether Bixby works or not, since I struggle to be understood by Siri, Google Now, and Cortana (I guess I slur my words too much) and thus am an outsider in the world of voice assistants. But if you are a fan of voice assistants, you still have Google Assistant on the Galaxy S8—it is an Android phone, after all. Samsung would prefer people use its Bixby assistant instead of the standard Android one, just as it wants people to use Samsung Pay instead of Android Pay, but you don’t need Bixby to get a voice assistant on the S8. Samsung’s internet browser is also a bust: Use Google’s Chrome instead, so your Galaxy S8 browser syncs with your other devices’ Chrome browsers. I understand why Samsung wants to steer users to its proprietary services, for data mining and other income possibilities, but ecosystems only work when they are broad, and Samsung’s ecosystem is confined to its mobile devices. The Galaxy S8 uses the USB-C port standard, joining the Google Pixel in jettisoning MicroUSB. You’ll get two adapters in the box: one to connect the Galaxy S8 to any MicroUSB cables you already have, and the other to connect the Galaxy S8 to a standard USB-A cable. Try not to lose them! Finally, there’s Dex, Samsung’s add-on dock that lets you use the Galaxy S8 in full-screen mode on a monitor, with a keyboard and mouse, to essentially convert the smartphone into a lightweight PC. Does it work? You’ll have to read InfoWorld’s [[add link here]]review of Samsung Dex]] to find out. The Samsung Galaxy S8 costs $720 and has a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front camera, 64GB of internal storage, a MicroSD slot that supports up to 256GB cards, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, NFC radio, and a 300mAh nonremovable battery. It’s available from all four major U.S. carriers, comes in three color choices (arctic silver, midnight black, and orchid gray), and runs Android Nougat 7.0 (not 7.1). The larger Galaxy S8+ costs $940. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Twitter Facebook Review: Samsung Dex nearly nails smartphone-as-desktop Difficult setup and hardware issues mar an otherwise successful marriage of a smartphone to the traditional desktop experience IDG Galen Gruman (InfoWorld) 19 April, 2017 01:00 - - - - print email Comments We all love our smartphones and tablets, but boy do we miss our big screens, mice, and keyboards when doing complex work on those mobile devices. That’s why the notion of a smartphone that acts like a PC when connected to those peripherals has kept recurring ever since the iPhone redefined mobility for the modern era. But so far, reality has not delivered on that promise of the mobile-on-desktop notion. Now, Samsung is trying its hand at this puzzle, with the Dex dock available for its [[link to review]]new Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones]]. [ Review: [[link here]]Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is an unpleasant smartphone. | iPad Pro vs. Surface Pro vs. Pixel C vs. Galaxy TabPro S: The “tabtop” tablet/laptop hybrids compared. ] The journey from the Lapdock to the Dex Station The Motorola Lapdock back in 2011 was the first dock to put smartphone screens on a computer monitor, as well as provide a full-screen browser and connections for physical keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals. But the constrained smartphone apps weren’t much easier to use as big-screen windows, and the Linux-based browser was too limited. Apple took a dockless approach, using its AirPlay protocol to beam an iPhone’s or iPad’s screen to a TV via an Apple TV box and provide typing access via Bluetooth keyboards. That didn’t make the app user interfaces usefully bigger (they were magnified, but contained the same number of pixels as the Apple devices’ own screens). And moving your hand between the physical keyboard and device touchscreen (iOS still has no mouse support) is an awkward experience you do only when required. In effect, Apple’s AirPlay approach is limited to presentation use, and Apple has clearly decided to focus on making the iPad itself work better as a laptop surrogate. Last fall, HP tried its hand at the mobile-on-desktop game with its Elite x3 with Desk Dock, also with unfortunate results. The Elite x3 smartphone is too big and clunky to use as a phone, and although the Desk Dock works decently, the whole thing is undermined by the use of Windows Mobile. People expected to run real Windows applications via the Desk Dock, but they got a few, limited Windows Mobile apps instead. That’s a no-go zone. Samsung has had a dock before, for 2013’s Galaxy Note II and Galaxy S4, but that Samsung Smart Dock wasn’t very smart. It merely projected the mobile device's screen to a TV, like Apple’s AirPlay but via a cable, plus it allowed use of USB input devices. It disappeared quickly and quietly. Now Samsung has the $150 Dex Station, a dock that works only with the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Dex comes the closest yet to delivering on that mobile-on-desktop promise. It requires the S8 series for two reasons: their beefy processor and memory, as well as their USB-C connector. That’s too bad because I dislike the Galaxy S8 [[link to review]] and would love to use Dex with its better predecessor, the Galaxy S7. Oh well. You really get close to a PC experience with Dex When you plug your Galaxy S8 into the Dex Station that is connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, in a few seconds you get a PC-like desktop screen on your monitor, with a Windows-like system tray containing relevant controls from the Android system tray. Running apps show up in a MacOS-like Dock at the bottom of the screen. You can drag apps from the Android Home screen to the Dex desktop, like putting shortcuts in the Windows or MacOS desktop for easy access. IDG The Samsung Dex Station does a very nice job of creating a desktoplike user experience for Android apps, while retaining mobile-specific Android capabilities and controls. Too bad it works only with the Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones. Apps that support both tablet and smartphone layouts open up in computerlike windows, which can be resized as they would on a computer. Microsoft’s Office and Google’s G Suite are among such apps, which means they feel very computerlike when running via Dex. Other, smartphone-only apps—including the Phone app, for making calls—display in smartphone-shaped windows, which you can rotate to use vertically or horizontally. To be clear, you’re running Android apps, not traditional desktop applications. You won’t get the same capabilities for a suite like Office or G Suite via Dex as you would on a PC. But in these two main suites, the Android versions are good enough for everyday use. Because you know you’re running Android, you won’t experience the disappointment that Windows Mobile users get when running the lightweight Windows Mobile apps in what seemed to be “real” Windows. If you need real Windows apps, you can always run them using a VDI client on the Galaxy S8; although VDI is expensive to implement on the back end and awkward on mobile devices, Android (like iOS) has long supported such apps. They’ll be more usable on Dex’s larger screen and with a physical keyboard and mouse. You could of course run apps like Office or G Suite on an Android tablet to get a more desktoplike user experience without having a dock in the middle and even connect to a large screen via HDMI or Google Cast screencasting. But Dex Station gives you not only a larger screen but a more detailed one—your windows hold more pixels with Dex than the blown-up screens do via direct external display from your Galaxy S8. Dex nicely integrates the Android mobile interface elements with the more desktoplike elements it creates for you. Setting up Dex Station is too hard, as is using the smartphone As much as I like the Dex software experience, I don’t like its hardware experience. Samsung made a few poor design decisions that keep the Dex Station from achieving a five-star rating. First, the setup process is nightmarish. You would think all you have to do is plug the Galaxy S8 smartphone into the Dex Station, then connect the Dex Station to your monitor via HDMI. Nope. First, be careful with the HDMI connections. The cable can appear to be fully inserted in the Dex Station when it isn't. If the cable isn't seated, your monitor won’t detect the Dex Station’s video signal, and your smartphone will beep incessantly to warn you something is wrong. But it won’t tell you what is wrong; there’s no textual alert or way to view one. Also, you must set up all peripherals before you connect the smartphone to the Dex Station, because you need to have the keyboard and mouse up and running to do anything via Dex. If you’re using Bluetooth peripherals, note that you cannot set them up once the Galaxy S8 is docked to the Dex Station. In a really dumb move, Samsung disables the Galaxy S8’s screen and touch interface when it is docked, so you can’t use it to do any forgotten setup or even check status if something is not right. Contrast that to HP’s approach in the Elite x3, where the smartphone itself acts as a peripheral, in addition to whatever other input devices you have set up. The Elite x3 can also continue to function as a smartphone in its Desk Dock. By contrast, once your Galaxy S8 is docked in the Dex Station, you can only use it via the external keyboard and mouse. At least the fingerprint sensor still works when the Galaxy S8 is docked, if you can reach it. There are more poor hardware design decisions in the Dex Station. The circular dock is pretty lightweight, so your cables’ weight and tension can rotate it. Because you can’t use the smartphone itself when docked, that’s not a disaster. But it is annoying, and it can prevent easy access to the fingerprint sensor. Also, the USB-C power cable that comes with the Dex Station is much too short; there’s no way it will reach a wall outlet. It could reach a free USB port on a laptop on your desk, but if you have a laptop at your desk you don’t really need a Dex Station, do you? Prepare to put a charging USB hub on your desk or get a much longer USB-C cable. I also found it awkward at first to use a Bluetooth mouse with Dex. I tried both Samsung’s S Action Mouse and Apple’s Magic Mouse. Both moved much too fast, often jerkily, so it's difficult to select items, click buttons, and so forth. Android provides no controls over mouse speed, as MacOS and Windows do. Fortunately, Samsung provides a way to modify the pointer speed, but it’s not so easy to find. The secret is you go to the Settings app from the Dex desktop; you’ll see a new Settings option called Samsung Dex that appears only when the Galaxy S8 is running Dex; go there to change the pointer speed from the way-too-fast Medium setting to something slower. The Dex Station’s hardware is clever in one respect: Its top flips down to become a back for the Galaxy S8, which plugs into a USB-C connector with the dock. This approach allows the Dex Station to accommodate the disparate sizes of the two Galaxy S8 models. A better hardware design would make the Dex Station a truly great mobile-on-desktop dock. Even with these flaws, the Dex Station finally delivers on the promise that the Motorola Lapdock first made. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Apple Reportedly Prepping Completely Overhauled iPhone For 10th Anniversary Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Reportedly Prepping Completely Overhauled iPhone For 10th Anniversary Image courtesy of (josepqr) April 18, 2017 11:28 am EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler 10 Years Of iPhones apple curved glass ios iphone making it new again Overhaul redesigns smartphones The iPhone will celebrate its tenth birthday this June, and just like a precocious pre-teen who decides it’s time to pay more attention to their hair and clothing, Apple is reportedly planning a complete revamp of its signature device — for those willing to pay extra. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reports that Apple is prepping three phones for launch this fall — two are upgraded models of current phones, while the third is supposedly the most expensive, best-of-the-best iPhone you’ve ever seen. While Apple is currently working with manufacturing partners in Asia to create several prototypes of the newly redesigned phone — meaning that descriptions could change before the estimated fall debut — sources provided Bloomberg with an idea of what the device will be. For example, the new stainless-steel premium model will have the overall size of the current iPhone 7. However, with a curved glass screen, it will have the display size of the larger iPhone 7 Plus. This display, the sources say, will more accurately show color and feature a home button that is incorporated into the screen instead of a separate button below the display. For now, the sources say the prototypes have been designed as an homage of sorts to previous versions of the iPhone, specifically to the 2010 iPhone 4 and 2007’s original iPhone, compete with dramatic curves and screens that curve into a steel frame. The company is also testing new camera options for the forthcoming phones, including dual camera systems and different placements. Because of the ongoing tests and potential supply issues, Bloomberg notes that the overhauled phone may not be available for sale one or two months after its debut, as is traditionally the case for Apple’s phones. As for the two upgraded iPhones, the sources say they will come in the same screen sizes as the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices with liquid crystal display technology. All three phones will run on iOS 11, which is expected to be released in June, sources tell Bloomberg, adding that the system will include a revamped user interface and faster processors.

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 18, 2017 10:49 AM EDT APPLE INC -0.63 At Closing, April 18th 141.20 USD SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD -30000.00 At Closing, April 19th 2045000.00 KRW Apple is responsible for the health or mortal sickness of the cottage industry of companies that make parts for iPhones or assemble them. It turns out Apple can can also be hurt by the interconnected supply chain. There is evidence of a little Apple Inc. trap in my Bloomberg News colleagues' article about expectations for the next iPhone models. On tap starting this fall will be a shift from two new versions of the iPhone to three. The two expected in Apple's typical September launch window will be updated versions of the iPhone 7 and its larger-screen sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus. The big deal for this year -- the 10th anniversary of the iPhone -- is a drastically different new phone with a more vibrant type of screen and extra real estate thanks to slimmer frames around the edges. Wall Street has already grown excited that this reimagined iPhone will set off a rush of people splurging for a cool new iPhone with a big ticket price. Apple Ascent Apple's market value has recovered from a 2016 low point as investors anticipate an iPhone sales surge from new models expected this year Source: Bloomberg Oh, but wait. Literally.   The cool new iPhone may not be on sale in September because of hiccups in obtaining enough key components, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. The most visible is a different type of screen -- known as organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, display -- that allows for a thinner, sharper-looking screens without hogging too much battery life. It gives Apple the technology it needs to make a phone that is essentially all screen.  Apple, at least initially, will be depending solely on the leading maker of OLED displays, Samsung Display Co. You know who already has a new smartphone with the same type of screen? That would be Samsung Electronics Ltd. Yep. Samsung is one of Apple's most important suppliers and one of its most bitter rivals. Much has been written about the peril of suppliers relying on Apple for their livelihood. Well, there's also a risk to Apple from depending on its suppliers. Friends and Enemies Apple and Samsung compete head-to-head in high-end smartphones. Samsung also is an important supplier of parts for Apple devices. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence and IDC I'm not saying Samsung is doing this deliberately, but the smartphone-making part of Samsung apparently has a sufficient supply of OLED screens. Those parts are already rolling off factory assembly lines as the screens for Samsung's new S8 line of smartphones that compete with the iPhone. (My Gadfly colleague Tim Culpan wrote about Apple's risk in relying on Samsung for important components, including OLED screens.) Guess Who Has Enough OLED Screens? Samsung  The enemy-and-friend relationship between Apple and Samsung has been evident for years. Apple worked hard to wean itself off Samsung computer chips for its iPhones and iPads. Apple sued Samsung for copying key elements of the iPhone even as Apple continued to buy parts from Samsung.  If the OLED iPhone model goes on sale in October or November, it won't be a disaster for Apple. The company is no stranger to muddling through shortages of important iPhone components, and Apple CEO Tim Cook is a wizard of supply-chain management. But the experience is a salient reminder that in the smartphone industry, no company is an island. Not even Apple.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

As we heard in the past, the centrepiece of the 10th anniversary iPhone is a new OLED screen, sourced from Samsung, that occupies the majority of the device’s front-facing real estate. According to Gurman, Apple is testing several different designs that incorporate curved glass, stainless steel and more advanced cameras. However, the one through line between each design is that Apple is working towards releasing a smartphone that’s close in size and footprint to the iPhone 7 but with an iPhone 7 Plus-sized screen. The curvature of the front of the screen is something that’s currently in play. For its first stab at a curved screen iPhone, Apple may release a more “subdued” model due to the fact its manufacturing partners have had issues producing highly curved prototypes at scale. Whatever shape the new iPhone takes, supply constraints may limit how effectively the company is able to stock the device at launch. Gurman also states the new iPhone may not include an on-screen Touch ID fingerprint sensor as previously rumoured. Like Samsung, Apple has encountered technical challenges integrating the sensor technology into a screen, says Gurman Corroborating his report is a technical drawing from late last week that shows a prototype iPhone model that features a back-facing Touch ID sensor. Moving to the new iPhone’s camera package, Gurman says is testing prototypes that feature a vertically stacked back-facing dual camera array (the technical drawing I mentioned earlier shows a similar detail). Several prototypes feature a camera bump, while others do not. Apple is also testing a 10th anniversary iPhone model that includes two front-facing cameras. Gurman suggests the second camera will allow the new iPhone to offer depth-of-field and augmented reality functionality. Lastly, with the new iPhone, Apple may move to a 10-nanometer fabrication process, allowing the company to produce a mobile chipset that’s faster and more energy efficient than the company’s current silicon. iOS 11, which Apple will detail at WWDC in June, will include a “refreshed” user interface, according to Gurman.

Apple is working on a refreshed iPhone with a new design and other improvements, says Bloomberg. It’s said that Apple is testing a phone with a screen that takes up almost all of the front of the device and has slightly curved glass on its front and back. The device reportedly features a stainless steel frame. This new iPhone’s screen is said to be OLED and is reportedly slightly larger than the 5.5-inch display of the iPhone 7 Plus, but because it takes up nearly all of the front of the phone, the body of this device is closer to the iPhone 7 and its 4.7-inch screen. Apple also wants to integrate this iPhone’s home button into the display using software like Samsung did with the Galaxy S8. Apple has also tested integrating a fingerprint reader into the OLED screen, but it’s said that this is technologically difficult and that it’s unknown if this feature will make it into the final product. When it comes to the camera, it’s said that Apple’s new premium iPhone may have dual rear cameras positioned vertically rather than the horizontal layout on the iPhone 7 Plus. This could result in improved photos. Apple is also considering dual front-facing cameras. The bad news is that folks interested in Apple’s all-new iPhone may have to wait a bit longer than expected. It’s said that the new iPhone may not be readily available for one to two months after Apple’s typical fall launch due to supply constraints. Apple normally intros new iPhones in September, meaning that this new model may not be readily available until October or November.  Along with this premium iPhone, Apple is said to be working on upgraded versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Recent Android flagships like the Galaxy S8 and G6 offer large screens and slim bezels that look more modern than Apple’s recent releases and also enable the GS8 and G6 to offer larger screens in a smaller footprint. Apple has been using a similar front bezel design for all of its iPhones, and so with the iPhone’s 10th birthday coming up and new Android phones offering nice designs with slim bezels, now seems like a good time for Apple to refresh the iPhone’s look with slim bezels, too.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman with Min Jeong Lee have published a report in which they claim Apple "is planning its most extensive iPhone lineup to date." Previous rumours have suggested we will see an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus arrive alongside the iPhone 8, and this latest report backs up such claims, while warning we may have to wait a little longer for the models to arrive this time around. Related: What will the new iPhone be called? According to "people familiar with the matter", the iPhone 8 will come with an overhauled design that will make use of curved glass either side of a stainless steel frame. It's a rumour we've heard numerous times before, but coming from a decent source such as this gives it a certain legitimacy – though it's still far from confirmed. However, the report cites "supply constraints" as causing potential delays that could mean the overhauled iPhone won't arrive until a couple of months later than usual. Other popular rumours repeated in this latest report include the use of a full-face OLED display and the removal of the physical home button. This week we've already heard rumours that the screen itself will not be as curved as numerous rumours have suggested, with Japanese blog Mac Otakara claiming the screen on the newly-redesigned handset will be almost entirely flat. An unofficial render shows the vertically stacked camera lenses on the rear and full-face screen Bloomberg claims Apple has been testing numerous prototypes, one of the latest of which apparently features "slightly curved glass on the front and the back." According to the report, the OLED panel on the iPhone 8 prototype is flat, but the glass curves into the stainless steel frame, while another prototype features more dramatic curves on the glass. This curved glass has apparently caused the aforementioned supply issues, while Apple is also said to be struggling to integrate the Touch ID fingerprint sensor into the display of the device. Analyst Timothy Arcuri claimed the same last week, saying the fingerprint scanner could either be moved to the back of the upcoming phone, or removed altogether. Bloomberg's sources do say the display-integrated version of the scanner is proving "technically challenging," so the expected shipping delay could well be down to this, too. Other new features tipped by the sources include augmented reality features for the phone's camera, and vertically stacked dual camera lenses on the rear – another big rumour we've been hearing in recent months. Bloomberg's sources also revealed Apple's plans could still change before the phones arrive, so there's no guarantee what we've heard, if it's accurate, will be the final design. Apple is also yet to provide any details about its plans, so for now, this all remains unconfirmed.

When Samsung first announced the smartphone, I felt like I was watching a replay of last year's Galaxy Note 7. A curved display, an iris scanner, and enough tech under the hood to make a geek's knees clatter with excitement. We've heard this story, though, and last year Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 was recalled twice and ultimately killed due to faulty batteries. I had ordered and returned the phone twice, and so, for the first time in recent memory, I decided not to buy the Galaxy S8. Todd Haselton | CNBC Now, after a week testing Samsung's new device, I think I might actually buy it. It's the most exciting device to launch so far this year, is supposed to be much safer (though only time will tell if the battery will hold up this time) and is future-proofed to support faster Gigabit LTE networks as carriers begin rolling them out this year. The Galaxy S8 has shortcomings, which I'll discuss in this review, but so long as Samsung can avoid any major recalls, it's enough to put the company's smartphones right back on the map. A screen worth staring at The highlight feature of the Galaxy S8, at least the one most folks are going to notice first, is the sharp, rounded and colorful AMOLED display, which was recently rated the best on the market by display experts. Todd Haselton | CNBC Samsung is selling two versions of the Galaxy S8. The only difference is standard model has a 5.8-inch display while the Galaxy S8+ sports a 6.2-inch screen. The new "Infinity" form factor, however, allows the 5.8-inch screen to fit on a device that's much smaller and more pocketable than the iPhone 7 Plus, even though Apple's device has a smaller 5.5-inch screen. The curved edges help remove borders along the side of the screen, allowing it to look like it's flowing over the sides of the device. It's taller and spans almost from top to bottom. You feel like you could sink right into the device. Todd Haselton | CNBC Samsung confirmed the larger model is already more popular, but I found it more cumbersome to use. It's hard to reach the top of the phone with one hand, which was frustrating. The 5.8-inch display size of the smaller Galaxy S8 was more than large enough for gaming and watching movies and much easier to hold. And speaking of easier to hold, Samsung embedded the home button right into the display. There's a small area at the bottom of the screen that can be pressed to return back to the home screen at any time. It works great, and helps provide a much cleaner design. I have two gripes about the phone's industrial design. First, the back of the device feels slimy and gross really quickly. It also attracts fingerprints and looks pretty dirty even after just a few minutes of use. I recommend a case to help resolve this problem instantly. Second, the screen seemed to scratch really easily during a week of tests, even though I was careful to try to keep it from sharing a pocket with my keys. Next-gen networking Samsung is using Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor in the Galaxy S8. In fact, it's the only smartphone maker that's been able to get its hands on this new chip, leaving competitors to scramble to either build their own chips or use Qualcomm's older Snapdragon processors. The Snapdragon 835 is one of the first chips to support Gigabit LTE. That's a stepping stone to next-generation 5G networks, which carriers are going to start rolling out this year. Todd Haselton | CNBC In my tests, with the Galaxy S8 and the iPhone 7 Plus next to one another, I always got faster download speeds on Samsung's device. That's without Gigabit LTE even active yet, and testament to the power of Qualcomm's modem and Samsung's antenna design. Think of it like this: if you buy the Galaxy S8, you're preparing yourself to get much faster download speeds, perfect for streaming HD or even 4K video, when they're available. It's a nice way of future-proofing yourself. The basics are covered Samsung stuffed the whole kitchen sink in the Galaxy S8. Let's cover the basics before we dive in too much. Connectivity was great on T-Mobile's network during my tests, and I didn't experience any dropped calls. Just once I had to repeat myself during a phone call when the other user wasn't able to hear me for a few seconds. Todd Haselton | CNBC Also, the Galaxy S8 runs on Android Nougat, the latest major release of Android. The UI is clean, which hasn't been typical of Samsung phones in the past, and very quick and fluid. As with earlier iterations of Samsung Galaxy S devices, you can run apps side by side, or pop out video for watching while performing other tasks. Todd Haselton | CNBC I also like features like the Blue Light shade, which cuts out blue light while you're reading at night so you can fall asleep easier. Apps like Samsung Connect will let you tap into SmartThings accessories throughout your home, everything from refrigerators to light bulbs and smart vacuums, though I didn't own any of these to test with. Ok, on to the goodies, some of which you don't see on most smartphones. The entire kitchen sink is here, too There are a few features we've seen before, like wireless charging and quick charging, the latter of which allows the device to juice up faster at the outlet. There's even an iris scanner, which is secure and works well but initially made its debut on the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. My favorite feature is face unlock. It unlocks the display almost instantly, before I can even type in my pin code, so long as it recognizes me. It's not secure, though. I was able to fool it with a picture of myself. Samsung says it's not meant for security and is simply meant to make the phone easy to unlock. I'm not sure I buy those claims, so beware that it's not meant to keep your phone locked from would-be hackers. Todd Haselton | CNBC There's a fingerprint reader, too, which can be used to verify your identity to unlock the phone or for mobile payments either online or at tap-and-go stations in places like coffee shops or grocery stores. It works well, but it's placed in such a terrible spot. It's next to the camera which makes it hard to reach — I was always flipping my phone and looking for it — and caused smudging on the camera when I missed the fingerprint reader. Todd Haselton | CNBC Speaking of mobile payments, the Galaxy S8 sports Samsung Pay. It's my favorite mobile payment technology, even ahead of Apple Pay, because it allows you to make purchases at terminals without NFC readers. That's thanks to technology it acquired from LoopPay which allows wireless mobile payments to work with simple mag stripe readers in most locations. Even cooler, Samsung includes easy access to coupons and other deals right inside the app, so you can swipe through them while you're waiting in line at the checkout counter. I even received a $20 gift card for registering my first credit card in Samsung Pay, which I used at a Dunkin Donuts without hiccup. Camera: still beautiful The Galaxy S8 features the same camera sensor as the Galaxy S7 that launched last year, though Samsung says it fine tuned some of the software under the hood to make it even better. I didn't have much to complain about last year and that still holds true here. CNBC: Todd Haselton The camera autofocuses nearly instantly and snaps beautiful photos. It's one of the best smartphone cameras on the market, right up there with the Google Pixel — often viewed as the best of the best — and the iPhone 7 Plus. Bixby doesn't do much yet Finally, Samsung is introducing its new "Bixby" artificial intelligence assistant on the Galaxy S8. It's useless right now. Todd Haselton | CNBC Bixby can help show you the weather or news stories for topics you might care about in a panel that sits to the left of the home screen. You'll also find things like trending topics on Twitter, random GIFs, calendar updates, Samsung themes and more. Save for the weather forecast, I never once looked to Bixby for assistance. Bixby also exists inside the camera app, allowing you to point your camera at specific items and then shop for them online. It barely worked with specific things, like a tube of Clorox wipes I had at my desk, but not at all with more obscure objects, like the Sony camera sitting on my desk. In the case of the latter, I just saw an image search for random cameras. It doesn't work well and you'll find better performing software built into apps like Amazon, which provide a more seamless buying experience, too. Todd Haselton | CNBC The voice functionality that will allow Bixby to act more like Siri isn't yet available yet, which means you can't say things like "Hey Bixby what's the Yankees score?" There's even a dedicated function for this feature that should be useful once voice support is added in the coming weeks. For now, though, it just launches the Bixby side panel. Bixby should ultimately be a major aspect of this smartphone. It's bizarre Samsung isn't including full functionality at launch. The good news is users can still access Google Assistant, which works really well. Final thoughts The smartphones we're going to start to see later this year and beyond will have screens that take over most of the front display, support for the next-generation of wireless networks that will begin rolling out this year, thinner designs than ever before and new biometric security features like iris scanners. Samsung is the first to bring all of these to market in a mass consumer device. I suspect Apple will follow with some of these features, including the advanced screen and the iris scanner. Todd Haselton | CNBC If there's one thing you should take away from this review, it's that the Galaxy S8 is a fantastic smartphone that's well worth the cost. Will it blow up? I hope not, but I also think that there's enough here to draw Samsung fans back to the brand, and to help Samsung replant itself as one of the leaders in the smartphone market.

According to a report corroborated by multiple outlets, the highlights of the new design will be stainless steel sides and a glass back. Apple has been rumoured to be working on a radically different iPhone design for several months. References to a glass and metal chassis, similar to 2011's iPhone 4s, have previously circulated. Today, Bloomberg published a report adding credence to rumours from Japanese Apple news site Mac Otakara, claiming Apple's now exploring polished stainless steel to complete the phone. The concept render developed by Mac Otakara sees the iPhone's front and back layered in edge-to-edge glass. The two faces are joined by sides formed from stainless steel, lending the handset a similar overall look to the Apple Watch. As per previous reports, the new design will only be used on the flagship "iPhone Edition." The rumoured iPhone 7s-series, also to be unveiled this year, will retain the aluminium backs of the current generation. According to Bloomberg, the iPhone Edition's display will be slightly larger than the 5.5-inch panel currently used on the iPhone 7 Plus. However, the use of edge-to-edge glass means the complete handset will be little bigger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Apple will be following the lead of its Android-based competitors in cutting down the iPhone's historically large bezels. In a first for the company, it'll abandon its front-mounted home button altogether, instead using a software-based approach already favoured by most Android manufacturers. Changes will be coming to Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor too. It's thought Apple is attempting to integrate the sensor directly into the phone's screen, a challenging feat of engineering that Samsung failed to achieve with its Galaxy S8. The S8's fingerprint sensor is instead installed on the back of the phone. It's possible Apple may end up adopting this approach too. Earlier rumours that the iPhone Edition will feature a curved display now appear to be unfounded. Bloomberg reports that while some initial prototypes of the device did include a curved OLED screen this has now been replaced with a flat panel. The glass on the back of the handset does taper inwards slightly towards the edges. It's thought the troubles faced by Apple suppliers in manufacturing curved screens at scale has prompted the decision. With iPhone 8 anticipation now increasing as the number of weeks until September dwindles, Apple is heading towards the final stages of completing the new device. With the time until launch fast elapsing, the company will be close to finalising the iPhone's design. Although nothing's official until Apple takes to the stage, it looks like this year's iPhone will draw heavily on the looks pioneered by Apple's rivals and past devices.

By Nicholas Quah April 18, 2017, 11:17 a.m. April 18, 2017, 11:17 a.m. Editor’s note: Hot Pod is a weekly newsletter on the podcasting industry written by Nick Quah; we happily share it with Nieman Lab readers each Tuesday. Welcome to Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts. This is issue 116, published April 18, 2017. Midroll formalizes the Stitcher editorial brand. When I wrote up the return of First Day Back for last week’s newsletter, I was mostly thinking out loud when discussing its label as a Stitcher show and how that might’ve hinted towards the spinning out of the podcast app as its own editorial brand. It looks like I was a day early on that, as the company announced last Wednesday that it was indeed firming up the Stitcher branding, and that it was shuffling some Earwolf shows into its purview. Stitcher will now carry The Longest Shortest Time and the Katie Couric Podcast, both of which were previously categorized as Earwolf shows. The new umbrella will also carry The Sporkful, whose departure from WNYC I covered two weeks ago, and Tell Me Something I Don’t Know, the Stephen Dubner-led game show previously housed in The New York Times’ audio unit. The reason for all of this shuffling? In a word: #branding. Speaking over the phone yesterday, Midroll CEO Erik Diehn explained that, while he ultimately thinks a network’s brand won’t mean very much to a broad audience, he does find that it carries significant weight with its core audience. As such, any programming move has to make sense within the context of that audience’s relationship with the brand. “Every once in a while, a content brand rises above the fray to stand for something more than the individual shows organized within it,” Diehn said, also pointing to Gimlet Media, Barstool Sports, and The Ringer as examples. “There is value there for a certain core audience.” The company bumped up against this when it initially attempted to broaden the Earwolf network out from its core comedy and comedy-adjacent sensibility; Diehn told me that Stranglers, a true-crime documentary podcast that Midroll published under the Earwolf network, was perceived by some to be a parody in large part due to its association with Earwolf. (It is most certainly not that.) The decision to carve out Stitcher as a separate entity from Earwolf, then, is meant to create a separate audience architecture for the more newsy and serious shows that Midroll hopes to get more involved in. For what it’s worth, I personally feel that a brand means as much to listeners, audiences, and consumers as it makes itself out to be — which is to say, I tend to believe its effectiveness — and, for that matter, the effectiveness of things like bylines and datelines — is chiefly derived from the amount of work put into making it mean something. Anyway, when I asked about how Stitcher Premium was doing, Diehn noted that it was “doing quite well,” and that it was “hitting all of its forecasts for the year so far.” He declined to share specific numbers when asked. Speaking of brands… “Apple Podcasts.” Last week saw a quiet announcement from Apple’s iTunes teams that nonetheless sent ripples throughout the community: The company is rebranding “iTunes Podcasts” as “Apple Podcasts.” Aside from an updated set of marketing guidelines and visual assets for use by publishers — get those badges and switch up your tags, folks — the announcement was made with little accompanying information that could tell us anything substantial about how (or even whether) Apple is actually fundamentally rethinking its relationship with the growing podcast ecosystem — a possibility that was first hinted back in February’s Recode Media conference when Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services Eddy Cue vaguely noted that the company was “working on new features for podcasts.” Which is to say, we know nothing new about whether the company plans to: revamp the podcast app’s underlying user experience (long criticized as being virtually unchanged since its introduction over a decade ago); provide any further analytics support; allow for external verification of metrics (as in the case of Apple News); increase the sophistication of podcast discovery and publisher promotion on the podcast app; provide additionals pathways for monetization within the Apple podcast ecosystem; or clarifying the editorial and symbolic significance of the podcast charts. RELATED ARTICLE Hot Pod: Like it or not, audio is entering the Content Wars. How do we navigate that fight? May 10, 2016On the flipside, it does maintain a status quo that continues to leave unreconciled the larger question about how the space will continue to play out structurally — that is, it holds in place the tension between podcasts-as-blogs contingent and podcasts-as-future-of-radio contingent that seemingly came to a public head last summer. (Here’s the relevant Hot Pod column from that time.) A lot has changed since then; the industry has continued to grow, more hit shows have come to be, more platforms have begun to encroach on Apple’s majority share with experiments in windowing and exclusives, and so on. There’s a legit story in here somewhere…but this isn’t quite it. Looks like we’ll have to keep being on the lookout. “If a Serial episode was a mountain peak, then S-Town was the Himalayas.” On Friday, PRX chief technology officer Andrew Kuklewicz published a Medium post discussing the backend of hosting the hit podcast — which, as you probably know by now, opted to drop all of its seven episodes at once as opposed to a recurring drop structure. In case you didn’t know, This American Life hosts all of its podcasts on Dovetail, the CMS platform created by PRX (which also distributes the company’s shows to public radio stations). I’ve briefly written about Dovetail before, but the platform has kept a relatively low profile compared to its more aggressive competitors, like Art19 and Panoply’s Megaphone, and I suppose you could read this post as the company flexing its muscles somewhat. “After S-Town, we are that much more confident in our technology, both in new ways of using it, and under extreme load,” Kuklewicz wrote. “Plus, the next time someone asks me what Dovetail can do, I have a new graph to show them.” The post is chock-full of interesting stuff — including some fascinating insights into binge-download behavior — but I’d like to draw your attention to something: Long-time observers of the podcast industry are probably familiar with the conversation around dynamic ad insertion technology, how its proponents argue that it allows for greater advertising inventory and opportunity (by allowing ads to be dynamically switched out according to who is listening), and how the current generation of professionalizing podcast companies have generally integrated the technology by treating the ad slot as the unit that gets dynamically switched out. According to Kuklewicz’s post, it appears that the S-Town team made a peculiar request: to treat the entire episode as the dynamic unit. This effectively maintains the baked-in nature of the ad-read while still allowing for the fundamental utility of each individual episode being able to serve different ads to different kinds of people. When I asked Kuklewicz about the logic behind this, he said: “They wanted to maximize the flow between show and spots, and allow for music under the end roll. So I understand it to be an aesthetic motivation, and considering the years of time put into the show, and the way the music is practically a character, I can see now why they wanted it just that way.” Related. BuzzFeed has a chunky feature up on S-Town that should be interesting to fans on two major levels. First, it sheds some additional light on the narrative threads that the podcast ultimately leaves unresolved — which, as we learn from the piece, is purely by design. And second, it serves as a nice companion to host Brian Reed’s interview on Longform. Also, this from The Awl: “Call it Shit Town, because that is its name.” Call Your LLC. I highly recommend digging into last week’s episode of Call Your Girlfriend, the well-loved conversational podcast by Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow (produced by Gina Delvac), which features a pretty substantial look at how the team has built out an independent business around the show. No specific figures were disclosed — other than mention that ad slots cost at least four figures and a solid-sounding revenue range — but there’s a lot going on here. The episode touches on the uncertainties involved in working with a network, the general weirdness of the podcast industry, and figuring out a business model that best fits the values of a production. Check it out. Missing Richard Simmons on TV? The Hollywood Reporter is apparently reporting that First Look Media, which led the production for the podcast, has “begun meeting with would-be buyers for a small screen narrative adaptation of the investigative show searching for the reclusive fitness guru.” Two things on this: It’s yet another data point in the emerging trend that sees the podcast category as another IP pool for TV and film to trawl in for potential adaptations. (Though, it should be noted that real life — or very recent history — remains the IP pool du jour.) Maybe I lack vision, but I can’t for the life of me see how the adaptation could possibly either (a) a good idea, given the myriad of ethical questions surrounding the podcast, or (b) effective or interesting in the same way, probably as a result of those ethical conundrums surrounding the podcast. But then again, I am but a humble podcast bard, and not a wheelin’ dealin’ TV exec. Tracking… Looks like CNN en Español recently rolled out a Spanish-language podcast slate, most of which are repackages of existing shows. There’s one original production in there, however: a culture show called Zona Pop. With this rollout, the company steps into a lane whose primary current occupant appears to be the Revolver Podcast network, which has built out a sizable Spanish-language podcast portfolio in addition to its work with music executive Jason Flom on the Wrongful Conviction podcast. The Outline, daily. I suppose I should start looking for another way to describe the daily news podcast space in terms other than “heating up” — if only to avoid ledes defined by a cliche — but it does seem like the experimental genre is certainly growing more active by the week. The latest of such experiments comes in the form of World Dispatch, a new daily morning podcast by the digital curiosity known as The Outline. John Lagomarsino, The Outline’s audio director, told me that show is meant to be the closest approximate representation of the publisher’s coverage in the audio format. Episodes are between 8 to 12 minutes, and segments will be a mix of stories that draw from material already on the site and stories produced specifically for the podcast. (“We’ll also be leaning on freelancers a fair amount for more reported-out, strictly audio stories — get at me!” he adds.) I’m told that the show is the result of some internal experiments with social audio that didn’t go very far. (“Turns out audio still is not particularly shareable,” Lagomarsino quipped.) Those experiments eventually shifted to the social audio app Anchor when it re-launched back in March, and the team ultimately decided to move those efforts over to a daily podcast feed as a natural next step. The resulting podcast is an intriguing artifact: strange, compelling, but ultimately a little confusing — which, given the show’s explicitly conscious sense of style, is probably the point. Lagomarsino notes that the podcast isn’t exactly meant to be newsy. “The podcast is for curious humans who are not looking for a news rundown that barely goes past headlines,” he said. “These are angled stories, often *about* news, but this is not for the listener who wants the ‘what I need to know today’ thing.” Hmm. World Dispatch debuted yesterday, with new eps dropping Mondays to Thursdays. Explainer ambition. In times of confusion, go back to the basics. That was, more or less, the thinking behind Civics 101, the explainer podcast by New Hampshire Public Radio that covers the fundamental institutions, mechanisms, and even concepts that make up the United States. That approach has proven to be pretty successful: Since launching on Inauguration Day, Civics 101 has clocked in about 1.88 million listens, with episodes averaging about 75,000 listens per month. (To be clear: that’s per episode per month, suggesting strong back catalog activity.) The way Civics 101’s editorial director Maureen McMurray tells it, the podcast was the product of a completely organic process. The show came out of an ideas meeting for the station’s daily show, Word of Mouth, shortly after the elections. “Our producer, Logan Shannon, expressed frustration over the endless ‘hot take’ election coverage and said something along the lines of, ‘I don’t want any more analysis. I just want to go six steps back to find out how things work,'” McMurray said. What started out as a segment idea soon broadened out into an accompanying podcast experiment pegged to the first 100 days of the Trump administration. It was all pretty scrappy. “There were some clever titles thrown about, but I insisted on calling it Civics 101,” she said. “Logan made the logo, and we sent a trailer and pilot episode to iTunes.” “In retrospect, I guess we just did it. There wasn’t a big meeting with executives or anything,” McMurray added. As the weeks rolled on, the show steadily grew into its own. It consistently dived headfirst into wonky subjects (emoluments, the Office of Scheduling and Advance, gerrymandering) while remaining fundamentally accessible, and the podcast eventually adopted an appealing topical edge (calling your congressperson, impeachment, the nuclear codes) that nonetheless retains a broad, evergreen perspective. Almost three months in, Civics 101 has grown in depth and complexity. And, as I found in a recent email correspondence with McMurray, it has certainly grown in ambition. Here’s our chat: Hot Pod: How has the show evolved over the past four months? McMurray: Our editorial vision has shifted a lot, and continues to evolve. Civics 101 was intended to be a short-run series. We planned to drop one episode per week for the first 100 days of the Trump administration. In part, we thought “How many governmental agencies and cabinet positions do people really want to know about?”, but I was also concerned about resources. Our production team is responsible for producing a daily magazine program, Outside/In, the 10-Minute Writer’s Workshop podcast, and a series of live events, among other things. After iTunes featured Civics 101 in its New and Noteworthy section, everything went to hell in a good way. Our audience numbers shot up and we started to receive unsolicited listener questions. We captured the moment, and began releasing two episodes per week, created a Civics 101 website where listeners could submit questions via Hearken, and started a Civics 101 hotline with Google. A lot of the questions coming in stemmed from current events. For example, when Steve Bannon was appointed to the National Security Council’s principals committee, there was an uptick in National Security Council-related questions. So, Civics 101 became newsier than I anticipated, but editorially, I wrestle with it. It’s easy to be seduced by the latest scandal, and to bump those questions to the top of the list, but I want Civics 101 to be a meaningful resource for future listeners. What’s timely today may sound dated in six months, and it will certainly sound dated by 2020. For the time being, we’re trying to balance the timely issues with the evergreen questions. Oh, and a shout out to our producer, Logan Shannon, who created the Civics 101 weekly newsletter, Extra Credit. We’ve seen a lot of audience engagement around it, and it has quizzes and gifs. Hot Pod: Does NHPR have any future plans for Civics 101 — and for its podcast operations more generally? McMurray: Civics 101 will continue answering listener questions on a biweekly basis. New questions come in everyday, so there’s no shortage of content. Of course, we want to grow and monetize our podcast audience, and that’s where a distributor will come in handy. We’re planning to repackage the podcast content for different platforms. Specifically, we’d like to become a multimedia resource for educators, and hope to create and distribute supplemental materials to teachers and students. That includes anything from videos to lesson plans. My real dream, though, is to farm Civics 101 out to other stations/production units in time for midterm elections. We cover the national stuff well, but member stations are in a unique position to tackle state and local politics. And, as our yet-to-be-created production guide will show, Civics 101 is a scalable, turnkey format, and a fairly easy lift for smaller teams. In 2018, I’d love to see Civics 101: Louisiana, Civics 101: Albany, Civics 101: Michigan. Heck, you could do Civics 101: Canada, Civics 101: Australia, Civics 101: Brazil. Of course, resources are the elephant in the room. We’re currently working out ways to resource this thing. So check back in with me. As far as podcast operations go, Civics 101 and Outside/In have been great proofs of concept for NHPR, but weren’t part of a formal, top down strategy. Our first major podcast, Outside/In, was intended to be a weekly, one-hour broadcast. When the show was in development, we found ourselves gravitating to longer stories that involved original reporting, narrative arc, sound design, and (for lack of a better adjective) a “podcasty” tone. Long story short, we put those early experiments into a podcast feed and came to realize those 15-30 minute prototypes were what distinguished Outside/In from other environmental shows and, given the size of our team, producing an hour-long program with those elements would be impossible. At the same time, the Outside/In podcast was developing an audience. So, the question became: is the podcast the show? In a way, our failure to deliver a sustainable, one-hour broadcast model coupled with the success of Outside/In and Civics 101 forced NHPR to consider the value and potential of podcasts. It’s been a learning curve for everyone, from producers to the underwriting department to membership, but we’re starting to develop an infrastructure that supports and leverages podcast creation. One more really important detail: in order to double down on Civics 101, we had to make an editorial decision to ease up on something. So, we’ve been strategically replaying interviews and stories on our daily magazine program, Fresh Air-Friday style. There are some upcoming changes that will ease our production load, but for the time being, it’s a quick fix. Bites: Reminder: Edison Research’s Podcast Consumer 2017 report comes out later today.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Report claims Apple is planning a Xeon powered iMac with ECC RAM Report claims Apple is planning a Xeon powered iMac with ECC RAM Matthew Wilson 16 hours ago Apple, CPU, Featured Tech News, Memory Earlier this year, Apple began sharing its plans for the future of its desktop systems. The next big Mac Pro refresh is coming in 2018 but in the meantime, Apple is said to be planning a ‘pro-grade’ iMac all-in-one for release this year. Now reports this week claim to give us an idea of what to expect, including an Intel Xeon iMac, with ECC memory. According to supply chain sources speaking with DigiTimes, Apple is planning an iMac with ‘server-grade’ components, including an Intel Xeon E3-1285 processor and up to 64GB of ECC RAM. This particular source isn’t always accurate so take the information with a pinch of salt. However, given Apple’s recent talks of new pro-level iMacs, this isn’t a huge stretch. The report also claims that Apple will utilise NVMe SSD solutions for storage, with options going all the way up to 2TB. Whether or not this is the ‘pro’ iMac that Apple alluded to a few weeks ago still remains to be seen. However, perhaps we will find out more information at WWDC in June. KitGuru Says: Given the iMac’s thin form factor, I do wonder how Apple would even manage to cram that much hardware in there and manage to keep it cool. Either way, it would be interesting to see, though I’m not really putting much belief in this particular rumour.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Apple imac Intel Xeon news Previous This guy built his own iPhone using recycled parts from Chinese markets Next MSI is offering up to £94 cashback on motherboards and GPUs Check Also Canadian researcher patents LI-RAM technology A researcher at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, has developed a new technology for … Anthony Wagner Maкe m੦n℮y bү աᴏrkｉոɡ ɑt hסᴍe ｆrom tաo-ｓｉx hoцrs ev℮ᴦy dɑy, ɑϖd ｓtarτ ɡ℮tᴛıng ρɑіᏧ ab౦ᴜt 1Ο0Օ-Зଠ0Ｏ Ꮷ൦lΙarƽ ɑt ｔhe еnᑯ оf eacᏂ ѡеｅᴋ܂ AppΙy Ꮒerｅ˃ DELICIOUSURL.COM//2t Patsyktaylor Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off “Work at home” method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Sources in the Taiwan supply chain claim that Apple is testing a new server grade iMac for the high-end sector that will compete with the Microsoft Surface Studio. The two new iMacs for 2017 are expected to be manufactured by Quanta Computer. Thanks to its orders from Apple and HP, Quanta is expected to remain the largest AIO PC maker in 2017. However, Quanta declined to comment on its orders or clients. The new iMacs are expected to be upgrades of the current 21.5-inch and 27-inch models. They should be available in the third quarter to capture holiday season sales. The server grade iMac is said to feature Intel's Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, 16-64GB ECC RAM, up to 2TB NVMe SSD and a latest discrete graphics card. It likely will not be available until the end of 2017. Notably, Apple has officially announced that it will release a pro iMac later this year. "We’re going to begin making configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind", said Apple SVP Phil Schiller.

He also shares details about the roadmap for SAP’s joint development with Apple. Why is the partnership with Apple so important? Rick Knowles: “With the SDK centered around iOS in the enterprise we are creating a new development community.” We have released software development kits (SDKs) in the past, but this is the first time that we have delivered an SDK that was jointly built in collaboration with our partner.  This was a huge engineering effort for the past 11 months to build and deliver. Our development team worked diligently to deliver the most robust SDK for iOS early while also supporting our early adopters. This enterprise-grade SDK for iOS is the key foundation for our partnership and is the first major deliverable. Along with the release of the SDK, we also launched our first iOS application, SAP Project Companion for Managers & Consultants, and have opened registration for the SAP Academy for iOS to train mobile developers and designers. What are the benefits for customers and partners? We are giving our customers and partners the ability to speed up the development life cycle for creating native iOS based applications. A customer who has iOS skills will be able to develop an app faster using the SDK – the SDK is focused solely on increasing a developer’s time and effectiveness. SAP and Apple partners or customers can adopt the SDK to discover, design, develop, and deploy enterprise-grade iOS applications. The SDK will help extend our ecosystem and enable SAP to build an entirely new channel of iOS-based partners who will build on top of SAP Cloud Platform. If I were a partner, I would think, “How can I adopt the SDK to better serve our joint customers?” This is a huge opportunity for partners to expand their offerings and build upon the SAP Cloud Platform. How will the SDK impact the development community? Today, there are about 13 million Apple iOS developers and 2.5 million SAP developers. With the SDK centered around iOS in the enterprise we are creating a new development community within the SAP franchise. To grow this new community, we launched the SAP Academy for iOS to provide users the necessary training and education. The Academy offers classes focused on Swift, Apple’s modern programming language; the core fundamentals of the iOS SDK; and the fundamentals of the backend system, SAP Cloud Platform and how to use the SDK to build enterprise applications. Earlier this year at Mobile World Congress we heard from early adopter customers. Can you give us an example how they are using native iOS apps for their business? All our early adopters are fully embracing the design-led approach to re-think their process and work.  This is about engaging and focusing on the end-users, the people closest to the work and enabling them to be more productive. Through the partnership with Apple, we can be empathetic to customers and their workers by starting with the end-user in mind to find out what their challenge is and can use technology to improve their job by reimagining how the work gets done. For example, the German precision-tool manufacturer, MAPAL, is one of our early adopter customers. We worked with MAPAL’s users to determine one of their biggest challenges, which was a severely manual process that was a heavily paper based. When MAPAL’s tool manager experienced an issue with a tool breaking on the floor, they had to go to a shelf, pull out a huge binder, find the serial number of the tool/part, record all the machine data and then write a lengthy report. After all that paper work was completed, the problem was routed to the plant manager, then to headquarters and finally to R&D to understand why the tool broke or to conduct analysis. This entire process took 7 to 14 days every time there was a broken tool. Now with the iOS app in place and deployed for the tool manger along with the SAP Cloud Platform, this process takes less than a minute to complete, and analytics and data are stored in the system. MAPAL is now evaluating how best to leverage machine learning capabilities and IoT information to pull information from their machines automatically to populate their iOS application. How can developers benefit from the SDK? With the SDK, many redundant activities such as writing logging scripts are already pre-built into the SDK. The SDK saves time for developers so they can focus more on the end user and the process redesign instead of mundane time-consuming activities. This is all about developer efficiency and ensures we help them to be more productive when building an iOS application. If they already know iOS, they can now easily bring the consumer user experience into the enterprise. Millennials coming to the workforce especially want to work the way they live. In our private lives, we have beautiful user friendly apps, now with the Apple partnership we can offer that same great experience to enterprises and their employees. What is the roadmap for the joint development with Apple? Under the terms of the partnership, we are creating a handful of applications that were showcased earlier this year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, such as the Asset Manager and Project Companion App. We believe that most of the innovation will come from customers based on their needs, or partners serving customers. We are also modernizing some of our iOS applications such as SAP SuccessFactors. Of course, we also want to improve our other native iOS application portfolios for our customers of Ariba, Fieldglass, Concur, etc. Through our partnership with Apple, we will build beautiful native apps that deliver a better user experience for our customers for all our lines of business. Our customers deserve the best experience and we will leverage our partnership with Apple to bring the best design and user experience to how we serve our customers worldwide. As for development, we made a commitment together with Apple that there will be updates to the SDK approximately every four months. The SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS (1.0 version) was made generally available on March 30. 2017. We will continue to invest and enhance the SDK with richer functionality with each release going forward. The SDK 1.0 version is only the beginning. What can we expect in the future? There are so many apps in the consumer space, now is the time to bring that same competition to the enterprise world. For TechEd, I see a growing iOS focus as a new thread beginning in 2017 but taking off in 2018. I hope to create an incentive/recognition program to reward enterprise developers who find ways to drastically change how work gets done under the Apple partnership. Additionally, I can envision in 2018 seeing a hackathon/code jam where the best iOS developers can showcase their work at SAP TechEd. We are bringing developers from the ABAP world together with iOS developers to grow an entirely new ecosystem and development community centered around iOS.

The Galaxy S8 represents the pinnacle of smartphone innovation - from its stunning "infinity" display to its cutting-edge iris recognition software and its new "intelligent interface", Bixby. Samsung has avoided falling into the trap of using gimmicks to make the Galaxy S8 stand out, and focused on combining sleek design with raw power. While retaining many of the widely-praised features of the Galaxy S7 Edge , such as the curved screen, 12-megapixel rear camera, wireless charging and water resistance, it has added just enough to elevate it above its rivals. Design Samsung has really excelled itself in terms of design. The company has taken the curved glass screen that proved so popular on the Galaxy S7 Edge and mirrored it on the back of the device, giving the Galaxy S8 a pleasingly symmetrical appearance. The Galaxy S8's display takes up most of the front of the phone (Photo: Daily Mirror) The physical Home button has been replaced with a pressure-sensitive digital button, meaning the entire front of the phone is a single pane of glass, interrupted only by a narrow slit for the speaker at the very top. The size of the rear camera module has been reduced so that it sits flush with the back of the device, and the fingerprint reader has also been moved to the back of the phone, so that in can be used with an index finger rather than a thumb. All of the buttons and ports are positioned on the narrow metal band that runs around the outside of the phone and binds the two glass panels together. This includes the 3.5mm audio port, which Samsung decided to include, despite rumours that it was planning to follow Apple in ditching the headphone jack . It is, without doubt, a stunning device. My only real quibble is that the glass picks up fingerprints very easily, so you're constantly having to wipe it down. The glass back of the device mirrors the front panel, and is prone to picking up fingerprints (Photo: Daily Mirror) In reality, you can combat this by putting the device in a case - something you'd probably want to do anyway to protect it from scratches. Tech21's Pure Clear case is a good option, as it protects the device while still allowing you to appreciate the sleek design. I also found that the fingerprint reader on the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8+ was too high up on the back of the device to use it easily while holding the phone with one hand. This is less of a problem with the standard S8, which has a 5.8-inch display, but in replicating the design on the plus-sized device, Samsung appears to have overlooked this issue. Luckily the Galaxy S8 comes with a variety of authentication options, including an iris scanner and facial recognition, so you don't have to rely solely on the fingerprint reader to unlock your phone. Display The Quad HD+ display with high dynamic range is stunning (Photo: Daily Mirror) The display is without a doubt the standout feature on the Galaxy S8. Samsung has massively reduced the size of the bezels along the top and bottom of the screen, so that the display takes up almost the entire front of the device. This gives it an unusual aspect ratio of 18.5:9, which is great for browsing the internet or scrolling through social networks like Facebook or Instagram. Most videos still use the 16:9 aspect ratio, meaning you'll end up with black bars to the left and right of the picture, but some apps like YouTube give you the option to crop the video to fit the screen. Just be aware that by doing this you are losing part of the picture. Users can choose which mode to view videos in (Photo: Daily Mirror) With several smartphone makers including LG and Apple working to reduce the size of the bezels on their devices, new content is increasingly being optimised for a wider screen format. The "Quad HD+" display, which is the first to be certified as "Mobile HDR Premium", serves up sharp images and eye-popping colours, making the most of the larger screen space. Despite some reports from Korea that the display has a reddish tint, I saw no evidence of this. There is, however, the option to switch on a blue light filter, to reduce eye strain by limiting the amount of blue light emitted by the screen. Camera The Galaxy S8's rear camera is the same one Samsung used on the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge - that is a 12-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/1.7 - something that Samsung calls "dual pixel". Aperture is a measure of how much the lens opens to allow light onto the sensor. The wider it opens, the more light hits the camera's sensor, and the better the camera performs in low light. Samsung's camera has long been one of the best smartphone cameras in this respect, although other phone makers have made big improvements over the past year. The camera comes with some handy software features to make it easier to use with one hand. For example, you can launch the camera from the lock screen by double-pressing the power button, and you can switch between the front and rear cameras by swiping up or down on the screen. You can also swipe right to select different modes such as panorama, slow motion or selective focus, or swipe left to add filters, effects or stickers. To test out the Galaxy S8's camera, Samsung took me on a helicopter ride over London at dusk to see what I could capture. Here are some of the results: City of London, captured on a Galaxy S8 The Shard, captured on a Galaxy S8 Hyde Park, captured on a Galaxy S8 Piccadilly Circus, captured on a Galaxy S8 Royal Albert Hall, captured on a Galaxy S8 While some of the pictures came out blurry, the Galaxy S8 did a pretty good job of counteracting the vibrations from the helicopter, and as you can see, it had no problems capturing detail in low light. Once I was back I solid ground, I used the phone's in-built "Auto adjust" feature to bring out the colours, and in some cases increase the brightness, but no third party software was used to enhance the pictures. Video also benefits from the phone's image stabilisation software and "multi-frame image processing", which improves the quality of images in low light conditions. You can choose to shoot in Full HD (1920 x 1080), Quad HD (2560 x 1440) or Ultra HD (3840 x 2160), although obviously the higher you go, the more storage space the video files will take up on the phone. As for the selfie camera, Samsung has upgraded this from a 5-megapixel to an 8-megapixel sensor, and added Snapchat-style augmented reality "stickers" that can overlay animated effects onto your face. There are also various "beauty" settings to even out your skin tone slim your face and even widen your eyes, if you're into that sort of thing. Power and battery life The Galaxy S8 runs on Samsung's own Exynos 9 chip, sports the "industry's first 10nm application processor". The company claims this offers 27% higher performance compared to its previous 14nm chip, while consuming 40% less power. The chip comes paired with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, which can be expanded up to 256GB with a microSD card. There's a 3,000mAh battery inside the Galaxy S8, and a bigger 3,500mAh battery inside the S8+. While these offer no improvement over the S7 and S7 Edge, they will comfortably survive a day of heavy usage. Although the Galaxy S8 has wireless charging capability, I wasn't able to test this out, as the wireless charging pad has to be purchased separately. Wireless charging pads are sold separately (Photo: Daily Mirror / Sophie Curtis) Audio These days people carry most of their music on their smartphones, so being able to provide a top-notch sound experience is crucial. Samsung has teamed up with audio brand AKG by Harman to provide a great little pair of earphones with two-way dynamic speakers in the box, which are comfortable to wear and provide great sound quality. The Galaxy S8 ships with AKG earphones in the box If you prefer to listen to music on speakers, the Galaxy S8 supports Bluetooth Dual Audio, which allows you to play music from two Bluetooth devices at the same time. Software The Galaxy S8 runs Android 7.0 Nougat , topped with Samsung's custom "Experience". This includes its "Snap Window" software, which lets you pin an app to the top of the screen for multi-tasking, which is handy if you want to keep Google Maps on the screen while writing a Facebook post, for example. Samsung's Snap Window software lets you run two apps side by side It also includes Bixby , which theoretically adds a layer of artificial intelligence over the top of this other software. However, the Bixby experience you get at launch is a bit underwhelming. Bixby Voice assistant (Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri) has not yet been enabled on UK devices, so the only thing I could really try out was Bixby Vision, which uses image recognition to detect what you're looking at and predict what you need. The most effective use of this I could fine was scanning the labels on wine bottles to bring up information such as vintage, price or suggested food pairings. Bixby is very good at recognising wines (Photo: Daily Mirror) Scanning a bottle of Hellmann's mayonnaise gave me the option to order it on Amazon, and scanning an apple brought up other images of apples as well as recipes including apples information on how to freeze apples. Object recognition is accurate, but not particularly useful (Photo: Daily Mirror) While of this is fairly amusing, it's also rather pointless. I can't imagine many situations when I'd actually want to use this feature. Then again, it's still early days for the software, and Samsung promises there's a lot more to come, so it will be interesting to see how it develops. The Galaxy S8 also comes with Google Assistant as part of the Android system, which can be accessed by holding down on the digital home, so you can use that to control you phone with yous voice until Bixby gets up to speed. Other features Like its predecessor, the Galaxy S8 is IP68-rated, which means it's dust-resistant and can be dunked in water to a depth of 1.5m for up to 30 minutes. It also comes with several biometric authentication options, so if you find the fingerprint sensor too awkward to use, you can can use the new facial recognition functionality, or the built-in iris scanner, which Samsung claims is one of the most secure methods available on a smartphone. Read More How waterproof is the Galaxy S7? We put Samsung's new smartphone to the test The facial recognition option is arguably the quickest and most convenient, but it is not as secure as the other methods, as it can be faked using a picture of your face. For this reason it cannot be used to authenticate access to Samsung Pay or Secure Folder The iris scanner takes a few seconds longer, and doesn't always work when the device is used in direct sunlight, but is the most secure option. Price and release date The Galaxy 5.8-inch S8 costs £689 up-front and SIM-free, while the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8+ costs £779. Anyone who has pre-ordered the device will receive it from Thursday April 20, subject to stock availability. Devices will be available in shops from April 28. Two colour variants will launch in the UK - Midnight Black and Orchid Grey - with potential availability of a third colour, Arctic Silver, to be announced in due course. Read More Where to pre-order the Samsung Galaxy S8 - the cheapest deals from networks including EE, O2 and Three Verdict All in all, the Galaxy S8 is hard to fault. It looks great, it's a powerhouse of a device, and it offers every type of biometric authentication going - from fingerprints to iris scanning and facial recognition. It's hard to imagine how the smartphone, as a concept, could be refined much further without reinventing the device altogether - Apple certainly has its work cut out with the iPhone 8 . Read More iPhone 8 leaked pictures show Apple could copy Samsung Galaxy S8's signature feature There are some nice software enhancements, but not so many that they overpower the core Android experience, and Bixby offers an opportunity for the device to evolve over time. Some pay prefer the "pure" Android experience offered by the Google Pixel, but this is really a matter of personal taste. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is unfortunate, and some may find the phone's propensity to pick up greasy fingerprints a turn off. Bixby also has a long way to go before it becomes truly useful. But overall, there are more than enough other features to compensate, and the sleek design, impressive camera and top-class features like water resistance and iris scanning make it 2017's best Android smartphone so far.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Meet the envy of every iPhone user Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye April 18th, 2017 at 11:00 AM Share Tweet I have to be perfectly honest with you… I never thought this day would come. When Samsung released its first Galaxy phone back in 2009, it was clear that the company would become a contender in the revitalized smartphone market. When it released the first Galaxy Note smartphone two years later in 2011, it was clear that Samsung wasn’t afraid to take chances. And when Samsung released the Galaxy S4 in 2013, it was clear that the company’s displays would be the best in the industry for years to come. But something else was clear during all that time. Despite Samsung’s willingness to take countless pages out of Apple’s playbook, the company’s hardware designs were still sorely lacking. The look of Samsung’s phones was boring. The thin plastic backs felt cheap and flimsy. Long story short, Samsung smartphones looked and felt like cheap iPhone knockoffs. Now, in 2017, the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ mark a changing of the guard. The torch has been passed. The student has become the teacher. Call it whatever you want, but the bottom line is this: Samsung has out-designed Apple with its new flagship smartphones. They look and feel like the future, and Apple’s three-year-old iPhone design is stuck in the past. Samsung’s transition began in 2015 when the company released the Galaxy S6. It was the first flagship phone from the South Korean electronics giant that looked and felt like a flagship phone. The smooth glass front and back were joined by a sturdy aluminum mid-frame, and there were only a few small pieces of plastic on the phone’s exterior — the small strips that separated each section of the aluminum frame, and the home button. It was official: Samsung was a premium smartphone maker. The company’s flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Note handsets have always featured cutting-edge specs. They have always offered terrific performance that was on par with the best Android phones in the business. And they have always had stunning displays with vivid colors and great contrast. Now, starting with the Galaxy S6, they also featured designs to match. But still, few people would argue that the company’s phones looked as sleek or felt as premium as Apple’s iPhones. Until now, that is. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR In terms of hardware design, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are the complete package. They’re industry leaders in terms of specs, as Samsung’s flagship phones always have been. They also feature Super AMOLED screens that are unrivaled. Again, this has been the norm for Samsung for years. But the biggest story in terms of Samsung’s growth as a smartphone maker is the design. Samsung has always been a follower, ever since it released its first smartphone nearly a decade ago. But now, Samsung is a leader. In fact, diehard Apple fans have been unable to find anything to complain about, so some of them have resorted to insignificant nonsense like the alignment of the USB-C port and speaker openings on the bottom of the phone. While it’s true that Apple’s alignment on the bottom of the iPhone 6/6s/7 is perfect, I’m not sure there’s a sane end user on the planet who would actually care about something like this. But it’s indicative of the difference between Samsung and Apple when it comes to attention to detail! Perhaps. Or perhaps Samsung decided it was more important to squeeze in the phone’s internal components as tightly as possible so that it could create a design with a remarkable screen-to-body ratio of 83%. Trust me, Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ users are going to appreciate the narrow bezels around the Infinity Display far more than any iPhone user appreciates his or her perfectly aligned ports. Also of note, Samsung managed to make its new flagship phones IP68 water-resistant without removing the 3.5mm headphone jack, misaligned though it may be. Speaking of screen-to-body ratios, welcome to the next smartphone battleground. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR First, it was specs. Then, after Apple introduced the Retina Display, it was pixels. Now, beginning in 2017, it’s bezels. Every top smartphone vendor in the world is hard at work shrinking the bezels on their flagship phones so that the screen takes up as much of the phone’s face as possible. Is doing away with bezels on smartphones really that important? In a word, yes. Apart from being crucial to upcoming advances in augmented reality, barely-there bezels like the ones surrounding the Galaxy S8 display allow for a much more immersive user experience. Distractions fade away and content becomes the sole focus. Why do you think Apple has never included a logo or anything else that might be distracting on the faces of its iPhones? It’s because when someone is using his or her phone, the content on the screen is all matters. The 83% screen-to-body ratio on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ is the best in the business among top-tier global smartphone makers right now. By comparison, the three-year-old iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus design has a screen-to-body ratio of 66%. As I wrote in an earlier opinion piece, using the iPhone after having used the Galaxy S8 feels like going back to a tube TV after having upgraded to a flat-screen. On the flip side, Samsung had to remove its physical home button from the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in order to achieve such an impressive screen-to-body ratio, and the company tried its best to copy Apple with its new virtual home button. It failed. The virtual home button on Samsung’s new phones is pressure sensitive, similar to Apple’s 3D Touch home button on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple’s solution utilizes advanced pressure sensors coupled with a Taptic Engine to make pressing the virtual home button on an iPhone feel and sound like pressing a real button. On the Galaxy S8, pressing the home button feels like pressing a plain old touchscreen, and presses are accompanied by the same weak vibration feedback you’d find on any other phone. It might seem like an insignificant detail, but it’s not. As we move further toward phones that don’t have any buttons at all, advanced haptic feedback systems can make flat glass feel like a button. Apple has a huge head start in this area, and it will be quite some time before other companies catch up. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Like the LG G6, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ both feature screens with a tall 18:9 aspect ratio. As a result, it’s difficult to compare their sizes to other smartphones. For example, the 5.8-inch display on the smaller Galaxy S8 is technically bigger than the screen on Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus phablet, but Apple’s screen is wider than the one on the S8. Long story short, diagonal measurements no longer tell the whole story. What matters is that both new Galaxy S8 models have nice big displays that are simply unrivaled right now. They both feature Quad HD+ (2960 x 1440) resolution, so the 5.8-inch screen on the Galaxy S8 has a pixel density of 570 ppi while the Galaxy S8+ has a 6.2-inch screen with 529 ppi. On paper, it’s a fairly big discrepancy. In reality, it’s difficult to notice a difference in most scenarios. What matters is regardless of which model you end up with, you’ll hold in your hand the finest smartphone display that has ever existed. As was the case with the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, the sides of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are curved on both the front and the back. The phones are each about the same width as comparable smartphone models from other vendors, but the curved sides help them sit more comfortably in the hand because they feel narrower. They also feel much thinner than they are thanks to the curves, though widths of 8mm for the Galaxy S8 and 8.1mm for the Galaxy S8+ aren’t very thick even without the curves on either side. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Inside, the US versions of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are both powered by Qualcomm’s new 10nm octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset, which marries a 2.3GHz quad for heavy lifting with a 1.7GHz quad for everything else. When they are released on Friday, April 21st, they’ll be the first widely available smartphones in the world to feature 10nm chips, which should offer advantages both in terms of power and efficiency. You’ll also find 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM in Samsung’s new flagships, along with 64GB of UFS 2.1 flash storage and microSDXC support. I can vouch for the Snapdragon 835’s performance. Everyone has seen the benchmarks by now, but that’s only part of the story. Everything on the Galaxy S8 feels faster than on rival Android phones, from opening apps, to switching apps, to using apps. It really does feel turbocharged. In my testing over the past few days, I have yet to find anything that can trip up the phone’s performance in any meaningful way. Unfortunately, I cannot vouch for any gains in power efficiency that might be afforded by the Snapdragon 835 or any other optimizations Samsung has made in the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Samsung delivered my review unit just this past Friday, and my usage while testing the phone is obviously nothing like average usage on a day-to-day basis. Normally when I review phones, I like to beat them up with heavy testing for a couple of days and then use them normally so I can communicate real-world battery performance. What I can say about the batteries in Samsung’s new phones is that they refuel quickly. I tested Samsung’s standard fast charging via USB-C as well as its wireless fast charging, and both methods were fast to fill up the phone. As long as they don’t explode, Samsung appears to have done a fine job with the batteries in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. I believe either phone will carry a person through a full day of average usage, and they charge up very quickly to minimize the hassle on days with heavy usage. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR When Samsung confirmed that the rear camera on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ would be the same 12-megapixel Dual Pixel camera found on the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, and Galaxy Note 7, I saw a number of bloggers and smartphone enthusiasts complain online. On one hand, I can certainly see where they’re coming from — no mobile camera is perfect, so we’re used to seeing camera tech improve with each new generation of smartphone. But on the other hand, Samsung’s Dual Pixel camera is easily one of the best in the business. In some lighting it is the best, hands down. It’s difficult to complain about such a solid smartphone camera. Samsung says that it has made some changes to the rear camera on the software side, though I really haven’t noticed much of a difference in my testing. The Galaxy S7 captured great photos, the Galaxy S7 edge captured great photos, the Galaxy Note 7 captured great photos, and now the Galaxy S8 and S8+ capture great photos. What’s not so great, however, is the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner next to the camera on the back of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The back of a phone is an awful, awful place for a fingerprint scanner. Even after you’ve spent months with a phone and you know it like the back of your hand, unlocking a smartphone with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner means blindly sliding your finger around the back before finding the scanner. It’s bad enough on phones with scanners that are placed on the center of the back, and it’s even worse with the Galaxy S8’s fingerprint reader, which is high up the back and off-center next to the camera lens. Side note: Thanks to Samsung’s scanner placement, your rear camera lens will always be covered with plenty of oil from your finger. Speaking of oil, the rear glass panel on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is not treated with an oleophobic coating like the front, so prepare for a permanent layer of grease and grime unless you plan to use a case. Of course, this issue will be familiar to anyone who has owned a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S6. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR The positioning of the fingerprint scanner is, without question, a poor design choice. Complaining about misaligned charging ports is stupid, but the scanner placement is a very valid complaint, and I would wager that Samsung’s own design team would agree. Rumor has it the company wanted to embed the fingerprint reader in the display itself, like Apple is rumored to be doing, but Samsung and its parts suppliers couldn’t find a way to make it work in time for mass production. If fumbling around for a fingerprint scanner doesn’t sound appealing, there are plenty of other ways to unlock your Galaxy S8. Beyond PINs, patterns, and passcodes, the S8 and S8+ also support iris scanning and facial recognition. The latter isn’t terribly secure since it has already been discovered that it can be fooled with a photo. The iris scanner is a bit more secure, but it can also be inconvenient since you have to swipe over from the lock screen by default before the phone will scan your eyes. This was done to avoid accidental unlocks when the user is trying to read notifications or check other lock screen content, which certainly makes sense. If you don’t can about seeing lock screen content, you can configure the phone so that you don’t need to swipe to scan your irises. But you obviously still have to hold the phone out in front of you and position it so that your eyes are in the alignment circles that appear at the top of the screen. It’ll never be as quick as a fingerprint scan. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Moving inside the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, you’ll find a newly refined software experience. As is the case with the Galaxy S8 hardware, the company’s “Samsung Experience” software in 2017 is its best yet. Each year, Samsung continues to strip away more and more clutter, moving ever closer to a stock Android experience. Closer, yes, but make no mistake — there’s nothing stock about the Android build on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+. The first thing you’ll notice about Samsung’s software on the Galaxy S8 is that it’s fast. Very, very fast. Hardcore Android fans were upset when they found out that a special upgraded Galaxy S8 with 6GB of RAM would be made available in some Eastern markets and not in the US, but I can assure you that the Snapdragon 835 and 4GB of RAM provide more than enough oomph and memory to keep things humming along. From news readers, Twitter and email apps to media streaming apps, 3D games and more, the Galaxy S8+ powered through all my tests without a hiccup. Long story short, it can handle anything a user might throw its way. I had videos streaming in half of Samsung’s multi-window layout while I was loading large web pages in the other half, and again, not a single stutter or stammer to speak of. Apart from a few Android oddities here and there — seriously, is Google EVER going to get scroll physics right?! — the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ offer the smoothest experience you’ll find on a Google-powered smartphone. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR While some other manufacturers have moved away from developing their own apps when Google already offers, Samsung still insists on holding onto a few dupes. For example, you’ll find Samsung’s Gallery app in addition to the preinstalled Google Photos app, which is clearly superior. Samsung also includes its own web browser in addition to Chrome. While moves like these made precious little sense on older phones, there’s a method to the madness on the Galaxy S8. Using a device that Samsung calls DeX, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ can connect to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to power a desktop computing experience. Samsung’s apps are optimized for this experience, while third-party apps might not always perform as well in desktop mode. The DeX solution looked impressive when Samsung demoed it briefly for me last month before the Galaxy S8 was announced, but the company didn’t supply a DeX dock with my review phone so I haven’t yet been able to test it myself. Beyond Samsung’s apps, the TouchWiz experience — sorry, Samsung Experience — has been tweaked in a number of areas on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Some changes are minor, such as the option to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the app drawer. Other changes are more significant, like Samsung’s move to on-screen home, back, and app switcher buttons, an obvious necessity since the physical home button was scrapped. Samsung staples like the Always On Display feature and Samsung’s customization options are all still present on the S8. There’s also an “Advanced features” section in the settings app that provides access to several Samsung-only features. Here are some examples: Smart stay: Eye detection keeps the screen on as long as you’re looking at it Game Launcher: A special launcher that can hold all your games instead of mixing them with apps in the drawer One-handed mode: Swipe up from a corner to shrink the size of the screen so everything can be reached with one hand Finger sensor gestures: Open and close the notification panel by swiping up or down on the fingerprint sensor Quick launch camera: Double-tap the power button to launch the camera Multi window: Open two apps on the screen at the same time Smart alert: This feature makes your phone vibrate when you pick it up and have missed notifications Video enhancer: This setting automatically upscales videos to enhance picture quality There are a bunch of other ones in there, and they vary in their usefulness. Another new addition to the Samsung Experience on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is Bixby. As many people might have already read, however, Bixby is a huge letdown for the time being in the US market. In a nutshell, Samsung’s voice-controlled virtual assistant can’t yet be controlled using one’s voice. The weirdest part about is that there’s a dedicated Bixby button that is supposed to offer two functions. Pressing and holding the Bixby button is supposed to launch the Bixby voice assistant, which is like Siri or Amazon Alexa. At launch, this core Bixby feature won’t actually exist; Samsung has delayed the voice portion of Bixby in the United States. Tapping the button launches the Bixby Home page, which is a collection of cards similar to Google Now. At least, it’s supposed to — the alternate method of accessing Bixby Home (swiping right on the first home screen) is the only method of accessing Bixby Home that actually works on my review unit. So, right now on my review unit, the Bixby button does nothing at all. As it stands now, Bixby Home is Samsung’s answer to Google Now. The interface is the same cascade of cards, and the content therein is similar as well, offering time, location, and context-aware content. One nifty feature that Google doesn’t yet have, however, is Bixby Vision. This is similar to the Firefly feature Amazon introduced on the ill-fated Fire phone. Point the camera at an object and Bixby will offer information and context, if it recognizes the object. Bixby Vision can also offer information about points of interest using the camera and your location, and it can translate printed text in real-time in more than 50 different languages. Bixby could grow into a very useful feature on Samsung phones, but right now it’s painfully incomplete. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ run Android 7.0 Nougat, however, so they also include the much more complete Google Assistant solution. I certainly plan to revisit Bixby once it’s a more complete product, but Google Assistant is clearly the way to go for the time being. Remember, Siri was a mess as well when it first launched, and now it has evolved into a fantastic tool that millions of iPhone owners use all the time. Give Samsung a while to work through Bixby’s initial growing pains before you dismiss Bixby completely. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Nearly everything about Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ leaked long before the company actually unveiled its new flagship phones last month. We thought there was no way there would be any surprises left. While all the phones’ new features were indeed covered by the leaks and rumors that led up to the unveiling, we were still entirely unprepared for the devices Samsung showed off that day. The fact that Samsung has managed to out-design Apple is nothing short of shocking. The South Korean company has been chasing Apple ever since it first entered the smartphone market, but matching the iPhone in terms of design and build is something I never thought I would see Samsung manage. The company hasn’t just matched Apple’s iPhone design with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, it has surpassed Apple’s iPhone design. Like anyone else who has been keeping an eye on iPhone 8 rumors, I fully expect Apple to make a strong showing later this year when it unveils its redesigned tenth-anniversary iPhone. There’s a lot of time between now and September, however, and I have a feeling many Apple fans will have some soul-searching to do when they finally get the chance to check out Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ following their release this Friday, April 21st. For Android fans, meanwhile, the Galaxy S8 is a no-brainer unless you absolutely must have stock Android. There are a number of good reasons to stick with stock Android, and the timeliness of operating system updates is at the top of the list. It’s a big tradeoff though, when you consider the power, performance, and beautiful design of the Galaxy S8.

Regulators Approve Apple Self-Driving Permit 16 hours 43 min ago Comments by Andy Szal Design & Development More than two years after speculation about an "Apple Car" first surfaced, the tech giant received a permit from California regulators to begin testing an autonomous driving system. The Associated Press reports that the California Department of Motor Vehicles approved a permit for six individuals to sit behind the wheel of three self-driving 2015 Lexus RX 450h hybrid SUVs. The company did not comment beyond confirming the permit. Reports of a secretive vehicle project at Apple first came to light in early 2015. That initiative, known as "Project Titan," was likely halted after a series of technical problems and leadership changes. Apple's efforts instead turned to autonomous driving software, and the company provided the clearest indicator of its automotive ambitions late last year when it weighed in on federal efforts to regulate testing. The maker of the iPad and iPhone is reportedly the 30th company to receive an autonomous driving permit in California — a list that includes tech industry rivals, conventional automakers and ambitious startups. Google and its spin-off company Waymo tested a self-driving system in the state for years, but the AP noted that Apple could catch up quickly if it chooses to utilize some of its $246 billion in cash reserves.

Joe Mullin - Apr 18, 2017 2:56 pm UTC reader comments 38 Share this story A large patent-holding company called Unwired Planet reached a settlement with Apple at 1:00am on Monday, just hours before a jury trial was set to start in San Francisco. A jury had already been selected but was dismissed on Monday morning after the parties' lawyers told US District Judge Vincent Chhabria about their settlement. Further ReadingEricsson gives 2,500 patents to maker of ancient wireless browserUnwired Planet is the patent-holding remains of early mobile company Openwave, which acquired several hundred US patents from Ericsson in early 2013, with Ericsson getting 20 percent of any patent settlements. Later that year, Unwired Planet sued Apple. In 2015, Judge Chhabria ruled that Apple didn't infringe the four patents at issue in the case. Chhabria's ruling was mostly overturned on appeal (PDF) last July, leading to the jury trial that was set to start yesterday. In addition to suing Apple, Unwired Planet also sued Google, Microsoft, and Square in the US. The company also took the unusual step of suing Google, Samsung, and Huawei in London, a nontraditional venue for non-practicing entity lawsuits. Unwired Planet's stock jumped 20 percent after it beat Samsung and Huawei in the UK. Further ReadingMajor US patent troll sues Google and Samsung in a surprising venue: LondonOpenwave was a key player in creating early mobile browsers. By 2001, it dominated the market, with 97 percent of US mobile phones using some type of Openwave browser, a success recounted in Unwired Planet's original complaint (PDF) against Apple. "By July 2001 Openwave had increased in size to approximately 2,200 employees worldwide, and the company earned revenues of over $465 million for fiscal year 2001," Unwired's lawyers note. After the London lawsuit was filed, Unwired Planet's general counsel Noah Mesel disputed the idea his company was a "patent troll" in an interview with Bloomberg. "You can call us anything you like," Mesel said. "We happen to be at the point in our business cycle where what’s left is a patent portfolio." Law360, which first reported the settlement, said that Unwired Planet was seeking $33 million in royalties. Unwired Planet, which was publicly traded, spun off its patent business last year and changed its name to Great Elm Capital Group. The company's SEC filings show that Microsoft settled Unwired's claims for a one-time payment $8.75 million in October.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Martin Hajek Supplying screens for the iPhone 8 is an offer LG and Samsung just can’t refuse Chris Smith @chris_writes April 17th, 2017 at 7:12 PM Share Tweet Reports last week said that Google wants to invest almost $1 billion in LG Display’s OLED manufacturing plants to secure OLED displays for the Pixel 2 series, although the two parties did not sign an agreement. New reports from Korea claim that LG is eyeing a bigger opportunity for next year: Apple’s iPhone 8. The company is expected to confirm during a board meeting in June that it’ll provide OLED displays for the iPhone 8 next year. That doesn’t mean the Pixel 2 deal isn’t on the table, just that the iPhone seems to be the kind of opportunity LG can’t refuse. Don't Miss: These are the Netflix originals generating the most buzz online According to Business Korea , LG Display “virtually decided” to supply small and medium panels for Apple’s iPhone 8. Apparently, Apple asked LG directly to submit bids. “We received a request to take part in a bid for receiving an order for small and medium-sized OLEDs from Apple,” a senior LG Display official said. “At the end of June, we will make a decision based on OLED production technology, capacity and the accompanying investment volume in an extraordinary board meeting.” LG Display needs to make huge investments to manufacture OLED displays for smartphones, but the company doesn’t want to miss out on the current display trend. Smartphone makers are moving from LCD to OLED screens, with Apple leading the charge. “The annual sales volume of the iPhone 8 with OLEDs is estimated at 40 million units,” representative of the display industry said. “Although LG Display was a few months behind Samsung, its E5’s annual production volume reached 5.5 million units, bringing LG Display enough volume to supply OLEDs not only to Apple but to Chinese smartphone makers.” Samsung will be the big initial winner of Apple’s move to OLED, as LG’s biggest rival owns 95% of the smartphone OLED display market. Reports claimed that Apple inked OLED deals with Samsung worth over $9 billion. Samsung is also rapidly expanding its OLED factories to meet increasing OLED display demand. A report from The Investor says that Apple’s iPhone 8 will secure parts from Korean suppliers, including Samsung Display for OLED screens. Because Apple is less experienced in OLED, Samsung Display is expected to play a key role in the overall supply chain management for OLED screens, which means it’ll use its own key component suppliers. Samsung’s System LSI will supply the display driver chip for the OLED screen, a contract worth some $422 million. Because one unit costs $5, the report notes that Apple is expected to make some 80 million iPhone 8 units this year alone.

(Samsung) Share Written by Mike Murphy April 18, 2017 Last summer, Samsung released a really excellent phablet. I said it was the best large phone on the market, and recommended it to anyone looking for a bigger smartphone. It was a great device that could likely have tipped the high-end smartphone wars in Samsung’s favor over Apple, which has fallen into a rut in recent years. But then it started blowing up. The Samsung Note 7 was probably the biggest PR gaffe the company had faced (at least for another few months), recalling millions of phones across the world, pausing sales, and damaging consumer confidence in the electronics powerhouse. Samsung likely needed its next phones to be flawless, or at least very, very good. Those phones, announced in March, are the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+. They both feature massive screens that consume almost the entirety of the front of the phones, but are their dazzling displays enough to counter the stigma of the Note 7, or even be better than Samsung’s previous Galaxy phone, the S7? Quartz spent the last few days testing out the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to find out if they are worthy successors to the S7: What’s good The screen is brilliant. Both literally and figuratively. The S8+ features a 6.2-inch HD screen that Samsung is calling an “Infinity Display,” as it takes up over 80% of the front of the phone. The edges of the display almost feel as if they’re blending into the body of the phone itself, as the sides of the device are curved (much like the Note 7 and the Galaxy S7 edge before it), and the display actually features rounded corners at the top and the bottom. When you first see this phone with the display on, it almost looks like those poor photoshops that have circulated for years of phones where a massive screen was added onto a phone it clearly don’t belong on. It’s the closest I’ve seen to a phone looking as if it’s been forged out of a single piece of glass. The iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s record-breaking smartphone, looks surprisingly dated next to the Galaxy S8. Adding to the screen’s size is the fact that there’s no traditional home button on the phone. There’s a pressure-sensitive area built into the device, below the screen, that allows users to press down as if there was a button there. This means there’s more real estate for a screen, which is great when watching a full-screen movie, although the digital buttons tend to hang around on a black bar at the bottom of the screen when using most apps, making the screen feel smaller than it actually is. They look good. While there’s not too much that you can do with the design of a candy bar-shaped smartphone to make it really stand out anymore, the giant curved screen is pretty attractive. The phone will be released in three colors in the US: black, grey and silver. Battery life. The S8+ boasts a large 3,500 milliamp-hour battery, and I could easily use the phone for two days straight without charging it. It also charged quite rapidly, and there’s the added option of buying a wireless-charging dock, if plugging in your phone when it’s low on battery is too much of a hassle. Water resistant. Much like its predecessors, the S8 and S8+ can handle a dip in the pool, and unlike the iPhone 7, they still have regular headphone jacks. Expandable memory. The phones have a slot for a MicroSD slot (up to 256 GB) right next to where the SIM card is inserted. It’s not particularly accessible, but it’s there if it’s needed. Using the S8+ in split-screen mode was actually enjoyable. (Screenshot) Split-screen apps. This isn’t a new feature—some of Samsung’s phones have been able to run two apps for years—but the massive screen of the S8+ really does make using two apps at once something that doesn’t feel too fiddly on a smartphone. I watched YouTube clips while checking Twitter; I checked in on Slack, while checking Twitter; I checked my mail, while checking Twitter. (Disclaimer: I am on Twitter a lot.) This was probably the first phone (other than the ill-fated Note 7) where split-screen apps didn’t feel awkward. Bundled-in headphones sound good. Samsung bought the audio firm Harman back in November, and the S8 comes bundled with a pair of the company’s AKG earphones. The sound quality on $100 headphones is decent (you can hear actual bass on songs!), and a world better than most other bundled-in earphones. Samsung’s new phones also have the ability to pair with two different sets of Bluetooth headphones at the same time, meaning no more sharing headphones. A Snapchat built-in clone. The camera has all sorts of Instagram-worthy filters that users can apply to photos, but it seems Samsung has also taken a page out of Snapchat’s book: There are live filters that detect faces and add dog ears, teddy-bear costumes and other zany situations, exactly like on Snapchat. The built-in filters are… interesting. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) Other fun camera features. The S8 features pretty much the same resolution camera as the S7 did, but through a host of software wizardry, the new phone can produce a range of photo modes, with more clarity than previous models. There’s a “selective focus” mode that can take some pretty extreme selfies (that you can later refocus to the background if you’d prefer), a selfie mode that can slim down your face, a “food” mode for taking the prefect photo of your brunch, the ability to take wide-angle selfies, slow motion video, panoramas, manual-focus shots, and everything else you’d expect from the company that made one of the best smartphone cameras last year. You can also download other modes from the app store, such as one that lets you take a photo using both the front and rear cameras at the same time, and one called “Beauty face” that I’m assuming is supposed to make you look prettier, but did nothing to my face. Make of that what you will. Futuristic case. I don’t tend to use cases, but the one Samsung sent through looks great. It’s made of a translucent, metallic-looking material, so the lock screen shines through, giving the phone a retro-futuristic feel that wouldn’t look out of place in the film Blade Runner. The case also doubles as a stand, and given the S8+ has such a massive screen, it can easily be the only device you need to take with you on the plane—it’s definitely larger than some of the screens on the older-model planes out there. Welcome to the future… of plastic phone cases. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) It didn’t explode. This is probably the most important thing. After spending multiple nights using and charging the phone, I am still here. (Then again, neither did the Note 7 when I tested it.) Samsung has a new eight-point check process that all its phone batteries now undergo before being released to the world. The phone did get warm a few times when charging and using it for extended periods of time, though. What’s not so good The camera. The 12-megapixel camera is by no means bad, but it doesn’t feel markedly better than the one on the S7 from a year ago—which was, however, was the best available at the time. But in the intervening time, Apple released the iPhone 7 Plus, which has two rear-facing cameras, that allow the phone to receive depth, and have a 2x manual focus, and Google released the Pixel, which also has a very strong camera. The S8+ has just one rear camera, with no manual focus, and any focusing the phone’s camera can do is done digitally, which never looks quite as sharp as when it can be done mechanically. The menus for all the modes on the camera are also exceedingly confusing. Samsung has a history of jamming as many features as it can possibly think of into its phones (and then stripping away the stuff that no one uses), and all of the camera modes are quite difficult to access from tiny icons in the camera app. I also had the phone for three days before I figured out you could swipe left below the camera to reveal all the additional functions I outlined above—the signposting for finding all of the different modes is almost nonexistent. The cost. The S8 costs $750 in the US, and the S8+ costs $850—that’s about $100 more than both the iPhone 7 and Google Pixel. (That being said, both phones come with 64 GB of storage, whereas Apple and Google’s phones both start at 32 GB.) Opening the phone is awkward. It took some getting used to pressing down hard on the area of the screen where a home button used to be, especially when my stubby fingers make reaching the power button on the side to turn on the screen a little too difficult to do every time. Also by removing the physical home button, the fingerprint scanner that can open the phone has had to move to the back of the phone, again slightly out of reach of my fingers. The S8 in “Orchid Gray.” (Samsung) My pockets confused the phone. The pressure-sensitive area at the bottom of the phone seems to be triggered by any warm body part—even though fabric. I walked with the phone in my pocket, and I’d often pull it out and dozens of characters has been pressed, the phone thinking I’d been trying to enter my PIN code, or I’d find Samsung’s digital assistant Bixby had been activated. In both situations the phone was still locked, but it could definitely drain the battery if happened all the time. The biometric security isn’t perfect. The S8 has three different ways to secure itself, beyond traditional PIN numbers and passwords. There’s a built-in iris scanner, facial detection, and a fingerprint scanner. But the scanner struggled to find my irises consistently when I held up the phone to my face, and the facial detection software seemed to be completely fooled by my face when I put a hat on. The fingerprint scanner usually worked (though it’s a bit slower than the iPhone 7’s), but its placement up near the top of the phone is difficult to reach with one hand. The camera app also repeatedly scolded me for having a smudged lens, presumably because I kept poking it instead of the fingerprint scanner button, which is next to it on the back of the phone. Bixby isn’t useful yet. Samsung heralded the launch of the S8 as the first step into a world of voice-activated, internet-connected devices, hinting at a future where you could talk to your fridge through your phone, or your TV through your washing machine, all through one voice assistant, called Bixby. But on launch day, the S8 will not have access to the voice assistant function of Bixby. There are other aspects of the AI-like features of Bixby that are available now, including a screen called “Hello Bixby,” which acts as a repository for random information, like the weather, upcoming reminders, and what’s trending on social networks—a lot like Google has built into its own search app, which is also on the phone. Hello Bixby also kept trying to tell me the weather in London, which is not particularly helpful, seeing as I’ve not been there since December. There’s also a function called “Bixby Vision,” which uses AI to discern what’s going on in photos and tell you more information about them. But the data repositories it uses to figure out photos are not particularly helpful yet. Bixby could tell me that the bottle of wine I had on my counter paired well with beef and lamb, and that 2015 was a decent vintage (because it partnered with Vivino, a wine-comparison company). But the phone was equally sure that a can of Coke was either Coke, or a jar of Trader Joe’s red peppers, because this information was being fed through data from Pinterest, and seemed to be based entirely off of what colors and patterns were in the image. If Samsung can partner with more useful services with informative datasets, perhaps this will be a useful feature in the future. But as it stands, it’s no more useful than doing a Google image search. Both phones also feature an additional physical button on the left-hand side of the phone that’s supposed to activate Bixby, but seeing as the voice assistant isn’t ready yet, it just opens the Hello Bixby page (which can also be accessed by swiping left on the home screen). Samsung is reportedly disallowing people from changing what that button can be used to do, meaning it’s relatively useless right now. Who needs in-seat entertainment? (Quartz/Mike Murphy) Should you buy it? Samsung needed an excellent phone to get consumers to forget about the Note 7 debacle, and if you care about screen size, then this will be that phone for you. It feels like a lot of the DNA of the Note 7—barring its styluses, and hopefully, its batteries—has made it into the Galaxy S8+. I really liked the Note 7 when it was released, and I think Samsung’s latest offering is a good phone for similar reasons. The form factor of the device, and how so much of it is a screen, will likely define what competitors’ smartphones look like for the next few years. It’s possible that the next iPhone, also lacking a physical home button and featuring curved edges, will look a lot like the Galaxy S8. And if Apple’s top-of-the-line iPhone 8 does indeed cost $1,000, as some analysts are speculating, it seems feasible that there will be an exodus of iPhone owners to Samsung come September. But right now, with the two phones on the market, there probably isn’t enough to get users to shift from Apple’s platform to Samsung’s. If you’re in the market for a high-powered Android phone, this is probably the phone to choose, but it’s a pretty close two-horse race between the S8 and the Google Pixel. If you can put up with Samsung’s foibles (like the messy rollout of Bixby, and the unnecessary Samsung versions of apps for things like email and web browsing), the screen size of this phone just slightly tips the scale in its favor. But there really isn’t too much that the S8 has that can’t be found on any high-end smartphone that’s decently built. So if you’re at the end of a contract and looking for a new phone, this is a great pickup. But if you still have six months to go, you probably shouldn’t feel overly concerned waiting to see what, if anything, Google, Apple, and others release.

Only 13% of iPhone users have ever used the mobile wallet, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal citing research by Loup Ventures. With those low numbers, many might wonder why Western Union would go through the trouble of adding Apple Pay to its digital channels (Western Union has supported Apple Pay at its agent locations for some time). As it turns out, there is some decent overlap of Apple Pay users and Western Union customers. According to Tim Sloane, vice president of payments innovation at Mercator Advisory Group, 29% of Apple Pay users aged 18 and up also utilize Western Union. IMAGE: Bloomberg News “While initially I thought that the overlap between [Western Union] customers and Apple Pay customers would be relatively small, our Customer Monitor Survey Series … indicates my assumption is incorrect,” said Sloane. This finding puts Western Union in line with the roughly one-third of US merchants accepting Apple's mobile payment scheme. iPhone users typically have higher incomes and higher average ticket prices when they shop, and they shop more often than groups with other handsets, said Sloane. “So that should make Western Union happy,” he said. For Western Union, the decision was all about pleasing that portion of the market, which tend to be very loyal customers, said Khalid Fellahi, senior vice president and senior manager of Western Union digital. “If we can eliminate a couple steps in the registration process or the transaction for our customers or allow them to manage more easily their cards in one place without having to change that within our app, this brings customers a lot more convenience and doesn’t change anything in the economics of the transaction for us,” Fellahi said. “And we estimated that this population was big and important enough to provide them with this convenience.” As with other Apple Pay integrations, Western Union allows the mobile wallet to stand in for the manual entry of payment card information, as well as supporting Touch ID fingerprint authentication. Even if Apple Pay usage for remittances is still lower than other funding methods, according to Fellahi, Western Union wants to stay “ahead of the pack in testing new payment methods because you never know when things are going to take off and have much bigger adoption.” Talie Baker, an analyst with Aite Group’s retail banking and payments practice, acknowledges that this is probably Western Union’s main reason for supporting Apple Pay. “Western Union invests a lot in innovation to keep up with the smaller startup disruptors in the space, and they do some really cool stuff technology wise that help them remain a market leader,” Baker said. “Although Apple Pay has been slow gaining momentum in the U.S., as consumers become more familiar with digital payments there will be greater adoption of the technology.” And it looks as if Western Union’s audience is becoming more tech-savvy. According to Western Union's internal research, its web and mobile business is the fastest-growing segment. Transactions on WU.com grew 28% from the third to fourth quarter of 2016 and its consumer-to-consumer revenue increased 27% on WU.com over the same period. While Fellahi wouldn’t share specific numbers on in-app Apple Pay adoption, he said customers are using it and satisfied. The initial patterns show the user demographic skewing towards millennials that already use their mobile device to initiate payments elsewhere, he said. The company plans to roll out the in-app Apple Pay service in the U.K. soon, and also has a strategy for supporting other mobile wallets including Android Pay and Samsung Pay.

The report points to troubles building a fingerprint reader into the display as part of the problem. Typically, Apple has a standalone area for the fingerprint reader below the screen, but moving it into the display would allow Apple to create a much larger surface for the screen, allowing it to take up much of the front face of the phone. "Checks with suppliers suggest Apple is struggling with optical fingerprint functionality, which could lead to delays in supply of the coming OLED iPhone or elimination of fingerprint sensing in the OLED iPhone in favor of a biometric login that relies exclusively on 3D sensing," Hargreaves said in his note to investors. "While this creates some risk of production delays, at this point we do not believe it materially threatens volume through the coming iPhone cycle." Several reports have suggested that Apple's high-end iPhone may face delays, but this is the first that suggests it may actually eliminate a fingerprint sensor altogether. The 3D sensor mentioned in the report could refer to new iris or face scanning biometrics, which have been rumored for Apple's iPhone 8. "We believe Apple continues to work on solving its optical fingerprint issues," Hargreaves continued. "If it is able to solve the problems in the next month or so, it would likely place volume orders at that point. This would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone launch, but we would not expect it to meaningfully affect volume for the cycle." A separate report from Bloomberg this morning said Apple is planning to release three new iPhones this fall but that the high-end model may not launch until one or two months after the others. It's also supposed to feature a new OLED panel from Samsung and a steel frame. Todd HaseltonTechnology Product Editor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AAPL ---

Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, talks about the iPhone 7 in a Sept. 7 file photo. The company will launch an overhauled version of the phone for its tenth anniversary, people close to the matter said.   (Marcio Jose Sanchez / The Associated Press file photo)   By Mark Gurman Min Jeong LeeBloomberg Tues., April 18, 2017 Ten years after Steve Jobs held up the original iPhone to a gushing San Francisco crowd, Apple is planning its most extensive iPhone lineup to date. Apple is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this fall, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look, according to people familiar with the matter. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the people said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait because supply constraints could mean the device isn’t readily available until one or two months after the typical fall introduction.  The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, representing about two-thirds of sales. It also leads customers to buy other Apple devices like the iPad and Apple Watch, and serves as a home for lucrative services like the App Store. This year’s new iPhone lineup comes at a critical time. Last year, Apple broke its typical upgrade cycle by retaining the same iPhone shape for a third year in a row and endured a rare sales slide. Samsung Electronics Co.’s new S8 lineup has also been thus far well received after last year’s Note 7 battery debacle.  For the premium model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device, according to people familiar with the matter. That results in a display slightly larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, the people said. Apple is also aiming to reduce the overall size of the handset by integrating the home button into the screen itself via software in a similar manner to Samsung’s S8, the people said. Read more: Article Continued Below Apple launches cheaper iPad Samsung predicts huge profit jump despite scandal Samsung unveils Galaxy S8: wider screen, new voice assistant and more The overhauled iPhone will use an organic light-emitting diode display that more accurately shows colours, while the other two phones will continue to use liquid crystal display technology and come in the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as last year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple’s iPhone feature and design plans are still in flux and can change, they added. The people asked not to be identified discussing Apple’s private testing and design plans.  For its redesigned phone, Apple has tested multiple prototypes with manufacturing partners in Asia, including some versions that use curved glass and stainless steel, according to one of the people.  One of the latest prototype designs includes symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back. The curves are similar in shape to those on the front of the iPhone 7. The new OLED screen itself is flat, while the cover glass curves into a steel frame. The design is similar conceptually to the iPhone 4 from 2010. An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides.  Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007, one of the people said.  Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves, the person added. The company is also testing a simpler design that has an aluminum back, rather than a glass one, and slightly larger dimensions, one of the people said. Because of its early lead in the mobile OLED display space, Samsung will enjoy a rare upper hand in this year’s high-end smartphone contest. At launch, Apple will exclusively use Samsung Display Co. OLED panels for the redesigned iPhone, as other suppliers won’t be ready to supply mass quantities until later, Bloomberg reported last year. Apple has ordered around 100 million panels from Samsung, the people said.  “This fall, it would be three years since we had a remarkable shift in iPhone hardware. This raises expectations for this year’s phone having a material change in functionality and look,” said Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a veteran Apple analyst. “The Samsung Galaxy S8 raises the bar for Apple to hit a home run.”  Spokespeople for Apple and Samsung declined to comment.  Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone’s fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version, which would be technically challenging, the people said. It’s currently unclear if that feature will make it into the final product. Samsung also tried this approach for the S8, but ended up installing a more standard fingerprint reader on the back of its phone due to the challenges, another person said.  Significant camera changes are also in testing for Apple’s overhauled iPhone. For the back of the phone, Apple is testing versions of the phone with the dual-camera system positioned vertically, instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which could result in improved photos, according to people familiar with the matter. Some prototypes in testing continue to include the slight camera bump found on current iPhones, rather than having them flush with the back surface, the people said.  For the front-camera, Apple is testing dual-lenses, one of the people said. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have single front cameras. As it has done in the past, Apple is using camera components from Sony Corp., the person added. Apple has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its iPhone camera system, Bloomberg reported earlier this year. Company engineers in the past have also experimented with integrating cameras into screens, another person said. All the new iPhones will run iOS 11, a mobile operating system that will include a refreshed user-interface and will be announced in June at the company’s annual conference for developers, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple has been testing using faster processors based on a smaller 10-nanometer production process for all three new models, a person familiar with Apple’s chip plans said. That’s down from 16 nanometres for existing iPhones. The smaller processors are more efficient, allowing Apple to retain its battery life standards while adding more advanced features.  Read more about: Apple Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

"We believe it stays this year but goes away at some point, potentially in the 2018 model," said Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis, and his associates, in a research note distributed today. Cirrus Logic would remain the primary beneficiary within Apple's supply chain, as it's believed to provide some of the tiny audio-related components inside of the adapter. Barclays contradicts Japanese blog Mac Otakara, which said Apple will no longer include the adapter in the box with the so-called iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Edition. Apple eliminating the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 was a controversial decision, so it's easy to see why it might want to include the adapter in the box for at least another year. But, unlike when that iPhone launched last year, Apple's wireless AirPods and BeatsX earphones are now available. Apple sells the Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter for $9 as a standalone accessory, which is cheap by its standards, so customers that still prefer to use wired headphones won't be forced to pay too much extra whether the adapter is removed from the iPhone box this year or later.

I prefer wired headphones because they have better price/performance and reliability. You don’t have to worry if your wired headphones need to be charged or how long their batteries will last. Apple’s AirPods are nice, but are overpriced for how they sound; they sound the same as $30 EarPods, while costing $160 - a 530% markup just for wireless!

Rating: 12 Votes HobeSoundDarryl 16 hours ago at 08:10 am Having said that, it seems this hasn't been anywhere near the life ending issue that MacRumors and readers made it out to be, before the release of the iPhone 7. It's still the best selling iPhone ever and people seem to be coping with loss of the headphone jack without issue. No there's issues... but people just roll with it because "the rest" keeps them clinging to iPhone instead of rejecting the entire product because the hassles of a decision regarding this one part. Of course, it's not "life ending"- just an added nuisance ... for no significant tangible gain for us consumers. Apple got something(s) out of it- internal space or perhaps lower unit costs & a high-profit accessory to sell. What did we consumers get out of it? Another piece of hardware to have to keep in the bag just in case we need it. I don't know about everyone else but being an Apple consumer seems to now mean needing more and more accessories in the bag. I don't think "thinner & lighter" makes sense if one pretty much needs to carry some other stuff to make the latest "just work" as readily as it used to work when such functionality was built inside. For all the pro-Bluetooth or even pro-Lightning connection arguments, all iPhones ALREADY offered BOTH of those options. If they were more appealing to those who will argue so hard for them, all such people could readily go that way without any hinderance. If they were genuinely better than 3.5mm, the masses would migrate for genuinely better too (contrary to popular spin, people don't have to be forced to embrace genuinely better if they can see (or hear) that it is genuinely better). What this did do is remove something useful and thoroughly ubiquitous that "just works" with pretty much anything & everything and shift to a fragmented mix of options involving adapters or trying to embrace either alternative but make that work everywhere else one wants to use such alternatives or just carry along adapters plus TWO sets of headphones/buds everywhere one goes to be ready for any scenario. Even the ready ability to use any type of phones/buds between iPhone and Apple's own Macs is complicated unless one chooses the Bluetooth option, which then fails when trying to enjoy the easy connections to all kinds of other audio stuff without Bluetooth. We Apple people used to ridicule competitors on their forced fragmentation decisions, but now that Apple has made choices to do it, we spin it as positively as we can... every chance we get. And "best selling" arguments don't really prove such points. It just proves that consumers want "the rest" enough to put up with such aggravations. That works just fine... until it doesn't. Should Apple decide to eject the camera or battery out to an accessory, they might be able to get away with that too. But eventually, there is the proverbial straw that makes people give up. Look through most threads here- especially Mac threads- and you see admissions of "always Apple until..." people who reached their brand loyalty breaking point because Apple did or didn't do something to meet such users wants or needs. Apple is not forever immune to such brand defections... no matter how much some of us will spin that any such decision that disappoints chunks of the Apple consumer base proved inconsequential because Apple keeps rolling in the dollars. Sony, Palm, Blackberry and countless others used to have best-sellers beating their best-sellers year after year. And then their customers tired of seemingly out-of-touch or losing-touch corporate decisions and migrated to something more connected to their wants & needs. Record revenues & profits are not automatic and guaranteed but earned... and part of earning them is not losing too much touch with the source of the money. Blackberry once had such a passionate following, their product was referred to as crackberry. Where did all of those crack-heads go and why? Rating: 11 Votes dragicon 16 hours ago at 07:53 am I still wish the 7 had a standard headphone jack. It's happened many times where I have to choose between listening to something on my phone and charging it. I end up just draining that battery down to the bottom before plugging it in. What makes it worse are those fake speaker holes that replaced it, staring me in the eyes when I plug it in to charge it. Rating: 10 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming iPad Pro Early 2017?

Apple’s iPhone 8 Leaks & Update: Tech Analysts Predicts That Apple May Eliminate Fingerprint Sensing Staff WriterApr 18, 2017 09:58 AM EDT Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google+ Print Email Apple may be forced to eliminate Touch ID from the iPhone 8 altogether due to issues embedding sensors into the device's display. Unfortunately, several reports indicate that the Apple Company may not be able to do so this year. According to Andy Hargreaves, a research analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, the company may be forced to eliminate Touch ID from the upcoming iPhone 8; if ever the company can't resolve issues with integrating the fingerprint sensor underneath that smartphone's display within the next month. Touch ID is located at the core of Apple Pay which appears much more likely that 3D facial or iris recognition would complement rather than replace the fingerprint sensing. Like Us on Facebook As noted by Ubergizmo, Apple can face a delay of production or even elimination of fingerprint sensing for the upcoming OLED iPhone 8. The company continues to work hard on solving its optical fingerprint issues which would likely lead to a delay of the OLED iPhone 8 launch; if they can't fix according to their standard time frame, Apple may be forced to eliminate fingerprint sensing. Recently, Apple's optical fingerprint module provider has received firm orders for production which suggests that the company does not have the functionality of the optical fingerprint sensor ready. Another analyst named Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company claimed that Apple is now facing hard time yield issues with its AuthenTec-based under-display fingerprint sensor solution, in which he speculated that the company could remove Touch ID; believing that Apple will put Touch ID on the back of the iPhone 8 or delay production. The Apple Post noted that if Touch ID were to be removed, it will place significant pressure on unproven 3D sensing to replace verification functionality that fingerprints currently provide; Apple's 3D sensing production appears on track and could be a viable alternative to fingerprints. Some suppliers suggest that the solution must be fast and highly reliable even from odd angles.

Share on Facebook Are you an influencer? ﻿ Advertisements #Apple has always been ambitious when it comes to their approach to incorporating new technologies into their products. More often than not, the company seems always to be the first one to pull off featuring a new technology in one of its products. However, new reports are revealing that Apple may be having problems integrating one particular technology that Samsung has apparently also been having problems with. Advertisements Latest findings from analysts In a report from the Pacific Crest Securities to its investors over the weekend, analysts revealed that Apple is currently experiencing some problems with their suppliers for a brand new type of #Touch Id sensor. Apple apparently wants a sensor that can actually be hidden underneath the smartphone's display and still functions like the Touch ID sensor found on previous iPhones. Not quite there yet The report from the analysts further explained that Apple's "fingerprint module provider" hasn't received the go signal from the company to start production. While it wasn't revealed if they had a working system that could be embedded into the display, Apple likely hasn't made a decision yet if it is ready to incorporate the new technology into the upcoming #iPhone 8. Taking a page from Samsung Samsung was previously reported to have encountered the same problem as Apple before the launch of their latest flagships, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. The company was previously reported to have been working on the same technology, but suppliers were unable to develop it in time for launch fully. Samsung then decided to scrap the entire idea and instead placed the sensor on the back portion of the device right beside the camera. Samsung had completely ditched the physical home button on their flagship, which likely indicates that they were indeed planning to incorporate the sensor into the display. Apple's alternative plan of action If Apple's suppliers are not able to finish developing the technology in time, Apple may be forced to look for other options. Newly leaked schematics for the upcoming iPhone has suggested that Apple may be going with a new 3D facial recognition system that will be far more superior than that found on the Galaxy S8. The system would incorporate a 3D sensor that can map out a user's face in three-dimensions, essentially making it immune to photos being used to fool it. As of the moment, it isn't quite clear just yet what direction Apple will be going to if the embedded Touch ID sensor is not finished in time. The upcoming new iPhones are expected to be launched in September. The company is rumored to launch three distinct variants including a 4.7-inch iPhone, a 5.5-inch model, and a 5.8-inch OLED display option called the iPhone Edition.

Besides OLED Screen, Samsung To Supply Apple Display Drive Chip For iPhone 8 Vittorio HernandezApr 18, 2017 08:51 AM EDT Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google+ Print Email Apple and Samsung remain bitter rivals when it comes to patents and market leadership, but their years-long business relationship continues despite about 40 lawsuits between the two tech giants since 2011. From supplying A9 chipsets for Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S Plus, Samsung would now supply not only OLED screens but also display drive chips for the iPhone 8.

The two other Korean firms are BH and Interflex. To meet the high demand for the OLED screens, since Apple plans to have 60 million iPhone 8 with the organic light-emitting diode screens in 2017, Samsung would expand its Electro-Mechanic plant in Vietnam. Beyond China With these developments, the iPhone 8 would no longer be made in Apple’s facility in China, particularly in Foxconn. Besides the addition of South Korea, Vietnam would also be included in the list. Other than the screen, Samsung Display and other suppliers under Samsung System LSI – which makes application processors and camera sensors – would also manufacture the iPhone 8’s display driver chip, Phone Arena reports. The chip on film that connects it to a flexible printed circuit board would be made by Korean firms LG Innotek and STEMCO. The printed circuit board, in turn, would come from Interflex, BH, and Electro-Mechanic. Other made-in-Korea parts to be used on iPhone 8 are the camera modules from LG Innotek and memory chips from Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Google Wants A Cut From Apple Pie Since Samsung controls 95 percent of the OLED screen market, BGR reports that Google wants to break the near-monopoly by investing almost $1 billion in OLED facilities of LG Display in a bid to have a larger slice of the Apple iPhone 8 pie as the Cupertino-based tech giant shifts to OLED for all its iPhones by 2019. LG confirms it has received a request to participate in bidding to supply Apple small- and medium-sized OLEDs. Samsung, however, remains the bulk supplier since Apple, which acquired 14 percent of the total global OLED panel production in 2017, reportedly entered into a $2.6-billion three-year supply deal with Samsung for 70 million OLED displays, 9TO5Mac reports.

The talk of the town is the shift to an OLED screen display, bidding adieu to the iconic TFT-LCD niche. Advertisements Take note, the iPhone 8 is the only one reportedly coming out with an #Oled Display. The other two (believed to be the iPhone 7s/ 7s Plus) will still continue to use the TFT-LCD screen. The availability of the OLED display is believed to be one of the reasons. However, the decision to address the 3D Touch fingerprint sensor could be another. Where will the Touch ID be placed? With the OLED display for the iPhone 8 imminent, the conflict right now is where to situate it. Apple could follow the lead of Samsung and place it on the rear though it needs to make sure that such does not obstruct the main camera. Placing it up front could still be possible. But with the iPhone 8 sporting a new bezel-less display, the need for some new technology to keep the feature up front may be needed. If so, the next thing to be asked is if Apple has the luxury of time. Critics beg to differ, believing that Apple would need to delay the release of the iPhone 8 to make it happen. But the delay period could be just a month or two, with the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus buying the redesigned flagship some time. Copy Samsung to deliver as scheduled Apple has seen its products copied (in a sense) time and again. CEO Tim Cook could opt to follow that route with some minor changes. In all, this is with reference to relocating the fingerprint sensor to the back portion of the iPhone 8. If Apple stands firm and keeps its phone design intact, the worst case is seeing no fingerprint sensing feature for the iPhone 8. From the theories coming out, this could be the last resort if Apple wants to stick to its release date schedule. Lucky for Apple, there is still time to come up with alternative solutions. Ditching the fingerprint sensing module will draw criticism, seeing how it is the advanced biometric solution being used on most smartphones in the market to date. Apple needs to do everything in its power to make sure the redesigned iPhone will stand out and create an impact. The new features such as the OLED display screen and the dual camera setup should be something to look forward to. However, eliminating some of the common features (i.e. fingerprint sensing security) may hold dire consequences. Right now, the last thing that Apple may want is giving rival brands an advantage over them in the mobile phone segment. #Touch Id Microsoft Surface Phone not part of May event, possible features revealed Liez Carlisle Is the 'Assassin's Creed Empire' release date coming soon?

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ For iPhone's 10th anniversary, Apple is preparing three new iPhones, two upgraded models and a premium new one Apple is preparing for one of the biggest upgrades in iPhone history: the company is testing a new, premium edition of the iPhone with a completely new design and improvements all around that is expected to launch alongside upgrades to the current models for a total of three new iPhones later this year. We've heard similar reports from various sketchy sources from China and elsewhere, but this particular one is a comprehensive overview of the iPhone 8 based on inside sources speaking for Bloomberg. And one thing is clear from this report: Apple has not yet settled on a particular design for this premium new iPhone. The company is testing various models, some with a curved glass back and some with a more conservative, metal back, but what both have in common is a bezel-less, full-screen design similar to that of the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. The signature new feature of this premium new iPhone 8 will certainly be its full-screen design. Prototypes of this phone feature a screen size close to that of the iPhone 7 Plus, but a physical device size closer to that of the iPhone 7. This will also be the first iPhone with an OLED display and since other manufacturers are not yet ready to ship in large quantities, Apple has partnered exclusively with Samsung Display, placing an order for 100 million panels. To further save space and make this truly an 'all-screen' iPhone, Apple is said to be doing a few things. First, it's looking into replacing the physical home button with a capacitive one on the screen, and secondly, it is looking at ways to build a fingerprint scanner inside the display. Samsung has also attempted to use a fingerprint scanner built in the display for the Galaxy S8, but has encountered difficulties with the technology and has finally settled on a fingerprint scanner located on the back of the phone. It is not clear whether Apple will succeed in this endeavor, and if it does not, it's possible that the iPhone 8 will also have a rear positioned finger scanner. Last but not least, Apple engineers have looked for ways to build the front cameras inside the display, which could allow further space savings for an 'full-screen' design. We are saying cameras because Apple is also considering equipping the iPhone 8 with two front cameras that will allow for better-looking selfie images. The premium new iPhone might look a lot like... the Galaxy S8 As far as design goes, Apple is currently testing various prototypes, with the latest one featuring curved glass on both the front and the back. The glass is curved slightly, in a way similar to the curve on the screen of the iPhone 7 family. Apple has also tested design with larger curves, but suppliers are allegedly not able to produce such curved glass reliable in large quantities. There is also a third design undergoing testing, one with a metal back rather than glass, and looks reminiscent of that of the original iPhone. That last metal iPhone 8 design is also slightly larger in physical proportion than the glass prototypes. Apple is also planning to improve the camera on the iPhone 8 with a vertically positioned dual-camera system that will bulge out slightly. As in other iPhones, the new iPhone 8 is likely to use Sony camera sensors. The two key new additions that are likely to come in the iPhone 8 camera are reality-based driven and some depth-of-field improvements. Apple will ship this premium new iPhone 8, but also the upgraded current models with its new iOS 11 that it will first show to the world in June. iOS 11 will feature a refreshed user interface. The new phones will also ship with a brand new Apple system chip built on the 10nm manufacturing process. This 10nm manufacturing is more power efficient than current 16nm chips and will allow Apple to maintain its battery standard despite the more advanced feature that it is adding to the phones. There are no news, however, about any sort of radical improvement in battery life, if that's what you are looking for. If you are already saving for the upcoming premium (and likely pricier) new iPhone 8, one last thing to keep in mind is that it is possible that all the new technology required for it will be supply constrained and the phone may ship one or two months after the typical late September iPhone release date.

An all screen monster without accidental touches with revolutionary front and back cameras capable of 3d sensing and AR capabilities. Couple that with the underglass fps, stereo speakers, 3d touch, oled, dual cameras, wireless charging, steel and glass, and then you get a recipe for an ultimate show stopper. Meanwhile samsumg is making android proud on one end with their infinity screen, dex, and wireless charging. Now other oems should step up their game otherwise it will be only Apple and Samsung playing this game in the future. posted on yesterday, 08:23 12 Reply 20. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 12849; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) None of the Samsung phones have accidental touch issues. Not knowing how to use a phone is your fault. millions of people have bought edge screens and never had an issue with the edge glass. Samsung is the true leader with phones that have had advanced features since 2011. Everyone else is playing catchup or falling to the bottom. Samsung in 2017 could get very close to selling nearly 400M phones...AGAIN. With all the issues with the iPhone 6 and 6S, I am sure people will be rushing to get the newer models. The iPhone 6 family was a disgrace. Plagued with more issues than all previous iPhone combine. The single model which holds the world record in failure rate. Apple needs to do more than just spend money to catch up. Metal back? WOuld mean another year with no wireless charging. We don't need wireless charging. But the iPhone does need quick-charge of some kind. An iPhone taking 3:30 to charge from 0% with a 27XXbattery is lame. I took my iPhone 7 Plus out for its first bike ride. I use MapMyRide and I was recording the ride to Six Flags near me which is about 48 miles from door to door. I used the front facing cameta to record the ride. Even though the air was cold around the phone due to me riding, the front facing camera kept overheating and casuing the phone to stop recording. My ex-Note 7 recorded the full ride at 1440p with no issue and never stopped. Outside of the iPhone normal background services, all apps were closed except the cameta and the GPS tracking my route. Same apps I used on my Note 7. My Note 7 would still have just over 50% of its battery left after 2.5hours of riding. This time I took a slightly different route and it took me 3:00. The iPhone battery was down to 40%, and dropped to 5% while standing in line for 3 hours to pickup my Seasons Passes. That is terrible battery life for a phone with no advanced features and only dual cores. My ex-Note 7 would also last the full ride back, though the camera is off and using only GPS route tracking with the same app. When I finally get home, the battery is brought at 20%. Riding back usually takes about an hour longer do to fatigue. But my Note 7 has never died. My iPhone didn't die, but the battery was at 2%. I didnt complete the ride. I was to tired after 30miles on the return do to 40+MPH winds in my face. I am disappointed in how the phone performed. I didnt even play music like I usually do. posted on yesterday, 08:29 6 in response to #20 in response to #20 Hide Reply 21. adi90 (Posts: 329; Member since: 21 Dec 2015) So once again owner of 9.5M business has written an essay about how apple is a piece of s**t compared to Samsung. posted on yesterday, 08:42 4 in response to #20 in response to #20 Hide Reply 22.

Just because I;m not blind to my issues, doesn't make them less important. I could care less what brand it is. When I frikkin pay $800+ for a device,m I expect it to last a reasonable amount of time, based on what I do with it. The iPhone has terrible battery-life. I am comparing how I use my phones based on iOS and Samsung/Android. I am comparing how I use the phones identical and dont get similar results. I should get better results from the iPhoen because of its lack luster hardware. Lackluster in having lesser battery draining features. Yet it acts worse than a phone that actually has battery draining features. It is a fair comparison. a 3 hour bike ride with only the camera on, screen is on and the GPS tracking is on A iPhone front camera set to 1080p vs my ex-Note 7 which was set at 1440p. iPhone camera kept overheating, Note 7 camera never did. Outside temperature was 60-65. I've used my Note on 90+ degree days. I have high expectations based on what products I use an buy. The one that gets the most bragging, is certainly not the best.

We recently saw the 3D design drawing of the 10th anniversary iPhone based on details provided by a Foxconn insider. Now Chinese publication iFanr.com has come up with new iPhone 8 design sketches, though some of the details seem questionable. Notably, iFanr is the same publication that leaked the iPhone 6 screen design in 2014 and posted images of the 12-inch MacBook in 2015. Image Source: Moe Slah / Concepts iPhone / YouTube video (screenshot) Schematics suggest iPhone 8 won’t have edge-to-edge display According to the sketches, the OLED screen will dominate the face of the iPhone 8. Its display measures 5.768 inches diagonally, covering almost the entire front panel. The report claims the entire display will be usable. It contradicts a previous report from reputed KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said the usable display area would be only 5.2-inches. The remaining space would house a new “function area,” added Kuo. The schematics show a 4mm bezel on all sides, which consists of 2.5mm 2.5D curved glass and 1.5mm of the stainless steel casing. It means, unlike the Galaxy S8, the iPhone 8 screen would not be edge-to-edge. The device is 137.54mm tall and measures 67.54mm in width. By comparison, the current flagship iPhone 7 Plus stands 158.22mm tall and has bezels of 5.1mm. Here we go #iphone8 #iphonex or #iphoneedition pic.twitter.com/kxDDOKZ6XM — KK Sneak Leaks (@kksneakleaks) April 17, 2017 According to the sketches, the iPhone 8 would be nearly as tall as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, but slightly wider than the iPhone 7. What seems hard to believe about the iFanr’s schematics is that it claims the front-facing sensors would sit underneath the OLED display. You can see a cutout at the top of the phone’s front panel for sensors such as the infrared transmitter and receiver, 3D sensor, a laser sensor, FaceTime camera, and speaker. The publication claims the speaker would be cut through both the glass and the screen material. That would be difficult to implement, especially considering Apple is yet to figure out a way to successfully implement the fingerprint sensor in the display. The site presumes that the fingerprint sensor would be embedded in the display. But other reports claim it could be relocated to the rear panel. Vertically arranged dual-camera system iFanr says the front sensors would force Apple to change the rear camera positioning. The dual-camera system on the iPhone 8 would be placed vertically. The flash would sit between the two lenses, allowing each lens to support optical image stabilization. In contrast, only the wide angle lens on the iPhone 7 Plus has the OIS. Also, placing the rear camera lenses farther apart would help with 3D imaging and augmented reality features, says Ben Bajarin. This looks a bit more reasonable than the last one. Also camera lenses getting farther apart is a signal in the direction of 3D and AR. https://t.co/cIJGTm9V3X — Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) April 17, 2017 The schematics suggest that the iPhone 8 power button on the side would be longer than on previous iPhones. The publication also claims the volume rockers could be powered by the Taptic Engine that we have seen on the iPhone 7 home button. Technical issues with fingerprint scanner, 3D sensing Meanwhile, analysts at Pacific Crest Securities said in a research note that some Apple suppliers might be in trouble as the Cupertino company is still struggling to implement the fingerprint sensor in the OLED display. Since the iPhone 8 will have a full-screen OLED panel, Apple has to eliminate the physical home button and embed the fingerprint scanner in the display. Sources told Pacific Crest that Apple’s optical fingerprint module supplier hasn’t yet received firm orders for production. It indicates that the company is still facing issues in implementing the optical fingerprint scanner. The iPhone maker has already evaluated Synaptics’ optical fingerprint sensor, but has decided not to use it. If the optical fingerprint solution fails to meet Apple’s expectations, it may have to move the Touch ID sensor to the rear panel, as some previous leaks have suggested. However, the analysts are confident that the issue would not threaten volume through the coming iPhone cycle, even though it may cause production delays. Earlier this month, Cowen & Company analyst Tim Arcuri told investors that Apple was facing bottlenecks with the implementation of the fingerprint sensor. Sources told Arcuri that yield rates for Apple’s AuthenTec solution were much lower than the company expected. And Apple was not interested in sourcing the parts from other vendors. Arcuri said Apple would finalize the fingerprint scanner specs by the end of May. If the yield issues are not resolved by the end of May, Apple will have three options. One is to ditch the Touch ID and rely solely on the facial recognition technology. But Apple might not want to depend on facial recognition entirely because it’s a new technology that still needs to be refined. Arcuri said the second option was to relocate the Touch ID sensor to the back panel, which might not be user-friendly. The third option is to push back the iPhone 8 release. Apple is also facing difficulties with the implementation of the 3D sensing module on the iPhone 8. Needham & Co. analyst Rajvindra Gill reports that Apple might not use the 3D sensor in the 10th anniversary iPhone. The analyst believes the feature would be introduced with the 2018 iPhone 8S rather than this year’s iPhone 8. The 3D sensor is needed for features like facial recognition and augmented reality. Rajvindra Gill believes the Chinese Android vendors could bring the 3D sensor to their phones even before Apple. The iPhone 8S wouldn’t arrive until late 2018, but Chinese companies could bring the technology to the market by early next year. Apple is also facing technical problems related to the lamination process of the curved OLED screens. It may cause Apple to push back the iPhone 8 release by one or two months. The Cupertino company is sourcing 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung Display this year. iPhone 8 design to remind you of the iPhone 4 Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara has learned from its sources that the iPhone 8 would borrow some design elements from the iPhone 4. The iPhone 4 and 4S had a glass front and back supported by a stainless steel band. The 10th anniversary iPhone would also feature a glass sandwich design with a stainless steel frame. Confirming iFanr’s claim, Mac Otakara reported that the iPhone 8’s dual-camera system will be arranged vertically rather than horizontally. Sources told the Japanese publication that this design layout recently moved from engineering to design validation test (DVT) phase. Mac Otakara added that the new camera setup could be used for virtual reality features. The publication noted that the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus could be thicker than the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus due to a slight reworking. The tech giant had previously increased the thickness of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus compared to their predecessors to accommodate the new 3D Touch pressure sensitive display technology. Unlike the iPhone 8, the iterative upgrades iPhone 7S and 7S Plus would continue to use the LCD panels. iPhone 8 to have 2700mAh battery, 3GB RAM Apple is said to be eliminating the bezels and re-arranging the internal component layouts to pack a bigger battery in the iPhone 8. The 10th anniversary iPhone would pack a 2700mAh battery in an iPhone 7-sized form factor. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus feature a 1950mAh and 2900mAh battery, respectively. Cowen & Company believes that all the three smartphones coming this year would sport 3GB RAM. The 10th anniversary iPhone is rumored to be priced above $1,000. But recent reports claim only the most expensive 256GB version would cost between $950 and $1,000. All other storage variants would cost less than $950.

By Deepak Gupta | Updated: April 18, 2017 7:16 PM IST Email comments Tags: Apple Apple iPhone 8 google google pixel 2 LG Samsung News Apple iPhone 8 and Google’s upcoming Pixel 2 smartphones are virtually in competition even before both the devices go into production. Both Google and Apple are reportedly eyeing at securing OLED displays for their next flagship smartphones and subsequently planning to invest hugely in LG Display’s OLED manufacturing units. Earlier this month, reports suggested that Google aims to invest around $1 billion in LG Display to secure OLED displays for the Pixel 2 series smartphones. While nothing seems confirmed on papers from both the parties, LG seems to have its hands dipped in an apparently bigger opportunity as Apple competes for the same. LG Display is expected to confirm supplying OLED displays for the iPhone 8 during a board meeting in June, later this year. “We received a request to take part in a bid for receiving an order for small and medium-sized OLEDs from Apple,” a senior official at LG Display was quoted saying on Business Korea. The official further added saying “At the end of June, we will make a decision based on OLED production technology, capacity and the accompanying investment volume in an extraordinary board meeting.” LG’s biggest competitor in the smartphone OLED display market is Samsung, which presently owns 95 percent of the market share. The rest 5 percent remains with LG and other Korean suppliers. Also, earlier reports suggest that Apple has already inked a deal with Samsung worth over $9 billion for its OLED display. With smartphone manufacturers shifting their focus LCD display panels to OLED panels, LG is expected to make huge investments in its OLED manufacturing units to meet required demands. Apple is believed to import OLED displays from Korean suppliers including Samsung Display. As Apple is new in OLED space, Samsung is said to dominate the supply chain for a while.

Notably, one unit of display driver chip costs Apple about 5$. This leads to a speculation that the Cupertino giant could possibly manufacture over 80 million units of iPhone 8 with OLED display panel this year itself.
