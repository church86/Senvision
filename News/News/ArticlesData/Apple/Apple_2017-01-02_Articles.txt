This means it is also pretty dangerous, trying to figure out just which particular accessory is worth your time. Well, with Kanex, they have been known to churn out quality accessories over the years, and this time around for CES 2017, things are no different. Kanex has announced the Magnetic Charging Stand and Portable Keychain Battery which will target Apple Watch owners at this year’s edition of CES. Kanex intends to expand their range of GoPower Apple Watch accessories with a couple more additions. These two devices happen to be the GoPower Watch Stand which is a magnetic charging stand, while the other would be the GoPower Watch Mini, which is a portable keychain battery. Not only that, the company will also showcase its recently introduced GoPower Watch, which is first cordless portable charger from the company for the Apple Watch at this year’s CES. All of the Kanex GoPower Apple Watch accessories are Apple MFi Certified, so you should have no worries about them running right out of the box. First of all, the GoPower Watch Stand is a magnetic charging stand, while the GoPower Watch Mini is a portable keychain battery. Each GoPower device will come with similar magnetic inductive charging connector that is used in the Apple Watch, allowing users to leave their other charger at the office, in the car, or packed for traveling. Capable of displaying both 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch models, it will also come with an additional USB port that is located on the back that will simultaneously charge an iPhone, iPad, or any other device, and yet doing so while looking sleek and minimalist in its styling which will definitely complement the different kinds of Apple devices that it plays nice with. As for the GoPower Watch Mini, this device will charge up an Apple Watch on-the-go and is totally cord free. Being an ultra-portable magnetic charging disc, it will begin to charge at first contact, making it a convenient little backup battery which is there as and when required. Carrying up to 1,000 mAh of power, it has a lightweight battery that is capable of delivering one full extra charge to the Apple Watch. There is also a LED indicator that shows the current battery level and charge status.

The region and its 500 million consumers represent one of the companies’ most important overseas markets. And in cities like Lisbon, Portugal, and Ljubljana, Slovenia, people often can’t get enough YouTube videos, Amazon purchases and Twitter messages. Yet policymakers in the 28-member European Union have also become some of the most ardent critics of how Silicon Valley companies dominate much of the digital world. The criticisms include the companies’ perceived failure to pay local taxes and their collection of reams of personal information. These tensions took center stage in 2016: Apple was ordered to pay about $13.7 billion in back taxes to the Irish government; Google was accused of unfairly favoring some of its digital services over those of rivals; and Uber was prohibited from operating some of its ride-booking services in the region. The companies deny wrongdoing. The next 12 months are shaping up to be potentially even more painful. Many of the investigations that started in 2016 will be decided in the coming year. If Silicon Valley companies lose the battles, they could be forced to change how they operate not only in Europe, but also farther afield. Here is what awaits in 2017. Google: The Mountain View company is facing three sets of antitrust charges in Europe related to some of its search services and Android, its popular smartphone operating system. The first set of charges — linked to accusations that Google unfairly promoted its shopping product over those of rivals — could be decided by early spring and might lead to a fine of up to 10 percent of the company’s global revenue, or about $7.5 billion (though most penalties are significantly less). The company has repeatedly denied that it favors its own services over those of others, and it is spending close to a half-billion dollars across Europe to endear itself to locals. Any appeal of the decision would take years. Google’s European woes also extend to taxes, and French officials will most likely decide this year if the company must pay more than $1 billion in back taxes on its operations there. It also has appealed a decision by France’s data protection regulator that it must apply the Right to be Forgotten rule across its global domains, including those in the United States. That allows people with connections to Europe to ask search engines to remove links to online content about themselves, under certain circumstances. The appeal will be heard in this year. Apple: On the top of Apple’s agenda in 2017 will be its appeal of the $13.7 billion tax bill. Lawmakers in Ireland are also appealing the decision, claiming that the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, overstepped its jurisdiction and that the Cupertino company did not receive preferential tax treatment. Both appeals are expected to be heard by Europe’s top courts in late 2017, at the earliest. The cases will most likely take on an increasingly political angle. President-elect Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies with significant cash held overseas might be able to repatriate these nest eggs at a reduced tax rate. If Trump goes ahead with this plan, expect a standoff between American and European lawmakers over where such money — including from Apple — should be taxed. Facebook: The social media giant is becoming an increasing target for European officials because of its ever-expanding role in the region’s economy. In 2017, Facebook will face the outcomes of investigations in France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands about how it tracks both members and nonmembers who use the company’s services and visit third-party websites with embedded Facebook “like” buttons. The Menlo Park company won a similar case on appeal in Belgium. Facebook also has until the end of January to respond to European charges that it misled regulators when it sought approval for its $19 billion takeover of WhatsApp, the Internet messenger it now owns. Amid concerns that Facebook did not sufficiently clamp down on fake news during the U.S. presidential election, the company has faced similar worries in Europe, where some officials have called for it to be held responsible for such content, and for hate speech. In March, a German task force will report on how Facebook and other social media companies have responded to these issues. Legislation could follow if lawmakers believe the companies have not done enough. Uber: The San Francisco ride-hailing company has been locked in a years-long struggle to operate freely across Europe after some taxi associations and policymakers accused it of flouting local rules and promoting unfair competition. In April, the European Court of Justice, the region’s highest court, is expected to rule on whether Uber is a transportation service or a digital platform — a decision that will have far-reaching consequences. If Uber is deemed a transportation service, it will have to comply with Europe’s tough taxi rules and would not be able to offer some of its low-cost services. If the court rules Uber is a digital platform, the company will have greater ability to expand aggressively in the region, one of its more important international markets. Amazon: The Seattle e-commerce giant is awaiting the results of a lengthy investigation into whether it received unfair tax treatment from authorities in Luxembourg, where it has its European headquarters. Amazon denies the charges and says it complies with the tax rules where it operates. An outcome is expected by early summer at the earliest and follows similar tax cases against U.S. companies like McDonald’s and Starbucks. In a sign that it was trying to get ahead of the issue, Amazon announced in 2015 that it would start paying taxes in a number of European countries where it has large operations, instead of funneling nearly all of its sales through Luxembourg.

James Modisette was driving in the car with daughter Moriah on Christmas Eve in 2014 when driver Garrett Wilhelm rammed into their vehicle going around 65 mph, according to ABC News. Authorities say that Wilhelm was using the FaceTime app while operating his vehicle, which caused him to miss the brake lights ahead. (RELATED: Distracted Driving Is A Huge Problem, And Autonomous Cars Could Help) Wilhelm “struck the Modisette family car from behind, causing it to be propelled forward, rotate and come to a final rest at an angle facing the wrong direction in the right lane of traffic,” the lawsuit, which was obtained by Ars Technica, reads. Moriah, who was in a booster seat before the crash, was ultimately killed after being airlifted to a hospital; James remained in critical condition for some time. The mother and the other daughter also suffered serious, but non-fatal injuries. James and Moriah had to be physically extricated from the car. The Modisettes want Apple to pay for the damages incurred from the accident because they believe the tech company could and should have created features that lock people out of FaceTime. (RELATED: Apple Has Been Hit With Several Obstacles Over Past Few Months) “At the time of the collision in question, the iPhone utilized by Wilhelm contained the necessary hardware (to be configured with software) to automatically disable or ‘lock out’ the ability to use [FaceTime] … However, Apple failed to configure the iPhone to automatically ‘lock out’ the ability to utilize FaceTime while driving at highway speeds, despite having the technical capability to do so,” reads the lawsuit, which also references the patent Apple originally filed for iPhones. The patent is designed in a way to provide a “lock-out mechanism” so drivers cannot use it while in motion, but such lock-out services are not always fully utilized due to limits of its detection capacity. “The motion analyzer can detect whether the handheld computing device is in motion beyond a predetermined threshold level,” the patent reads. While Wilhelm has been charged with manslaughter, the Modisettes also want Apple to be held liable for Wilhelm using its technology. Suing tech companies for people acting irresponsibly has become a common practice. (RELATED: 2016’s Assault On The Internet Was Brutal. Will 2017 Be Worse?) Victims of the Orlando Night club shooting, the Paris attacks, and Palestinian bombings have all sued tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter in the past year. The plaintiffs in these cases argue that these businesses are complicit with terrorists because they use the platforms for their nefarious activities.

It’s something that I’ve been talking about on the Apple Core podcast for some time. When they originally came out I expressed that I didn’t care for them whatsoever. Several months later, and several delays later the hype got to me. Something clicked. I’m not sure what it was but here I am, right? I am now writing a review for the AirPods, something I wrote off as soon as they came out. So let’s start with why I bought them in the first place. Well, to be fair, I got them because it was an Apple product and it’s my job to review these things. Admittedly, I had some interest in them. In terms of sound quality, I set the bar super low. While I didn’t write a review specifically for them, I absolutely hated the EarPods (both the 3.5mm and Lightning kind). Everything from the sound signature down to the fact that the cable kept forcing them out of my ear. For the last several years, I’ve given up on the EarPods as a whole. I’ve been using over-ear headphones ranging from the worst of the worst (the Audio-Technica ATH-M50), to some of my favorites (the Oppo PM-3). Again, here I am, writing an AirPods review. I also wrote an initial impressions of the AirPods a few weeks ago. Sound Quality If you’re looking to purchase AirPods to be blown away by sound quality, these are not for you. They’re bass heavy and that bass extension bleeds into the mids quite a bit. Treble is better than the EarPods, but they’re a bit recessed. For music, I’d highly recommend looking elsewhere. Though, Bluetooth and sound quality never mix. Personally, I would never use the AirPods intentionally for music, but they’ll get you by in a pinch. Point blank, don’t expect these to replace your high-end audio equipment anytime soon. For low-bitrate audio such as phone calls, audiobooks, podcasts, and things of that nature, AirPods are amazing. Don’t even bother trying to EQ these because it’s not worth it, seriously. AirPods are decent at any genre that has tons of bass and is dominated by bass. But try anything else, the bass will feel overpowering and overwhelming to most who care about sound quality. The other issue is that with tracks with little to no low end, the AirPods will sound abnormally tinny to the trained ear and the treble will then overtake the mid-range. It’s been a while since I’ve actually tried EarPods, but AirPods aren’t terrible. Obviously, sound will vary greatly depending on how well they fit in your ear. Soundstage is similar to the ATH-M50s in the sense that everything sounds very boxed in and lacks any sort of instrument separation whatsoever, though that’s expected from a set of earbuds with no real seal. Function The AirPods are amazing functionality wise. Everything from taking out one ear and having your audio automatically pause, to them automatically pairing when you put them in your ears. They’re awesome. The problem here is that they’re not 100% reliable. I’d say that these functions work 95% of the time, which may be good enough for most. When you take one out of your ear, there’s a noticeable half-second delay, and it sometimes doesn’t pair automatically when you take them out of the case and put them in your ear. It’s obvious that AirPods were built around the iPhone. When you open the lid, a card shows up on your iPhone telling you the battery life of the case and your AirPods. If you have one earbud in, it’ll show you the battery life of each individual AirPod. This automatic card is only available on the iPhone, and not on the iPad, (maybe the iPod touch, but who owns one of those?). On the Apple Watch, you can pull up Control Center, tap the battery icon, and it’ll show you the same information, but that’s not automatic. On the Mac is where it’s clear that AirPods weren’t designed for the platform. To view battery life on the Mac, you have to tap into the Sound menu bar icon and you see a battery indicator without the percentage. And lastly, on the Apple TV. While being a counterpart to iOS, tvOS doesn’t automatically pair like the rest of your devices. You have to go into Settings > Remotes and Devices > Bluetooth to pair these. Not the greatest. It’s also the only Apple platform that doesn’t have easy access to AirPods. On iOS and the Apple Watch, you can swipe up on Control Center, get to the media controls/AirPlay button and pair from there. On the Mac, you can go to the Sound menu bar icon and pair there, on tvOS you have to dig into Settings to do so. Unfortunately, I’ve found battery life indication to be extremely unreliable. It’s not that the percentages it gives out is inaccurate, that’s not the issue. The issue is trying to get the interface to show up at all. On the iPhone and iPad you can view the battery indicator in the Battery widget in iOS 10. However, I’ve found that it isn’t always there. Ideally, it’s supposed to show up if it’s paired to the device, but that’s not always the case. Most of the time, I have to put them back in its case and take them out a second time in order for it to show up. Same goes for the Apple Watch. The case that the AirPods come in are pretty great as well. It’s always charging the AirPods while in the case, and the case gives up to 24 hours of additional battery life for the AirPods. Remember, “up to.” In my personal experience, I’ve gotten around 15-20 hours of additional battery life which is fine. I have to charge the case every 2-3 days. Albeit, feels like the case takes forever to charge in comparison to the AirPods. The AirPods can charge from dead to 60% in about 15 minutes, that’s pretty awesome. But the case? It takes around 2-3 hours to fully charge and unless you’re charging the case overnight, this could feel like forever. Speaking of charging, it’s flat out annoying that the AirPods shipped with a Lightning to USB-A cable. Apple claims that USB-C is the future yet no Apple mobile device has shipped with a proper Lightning to USB-C cable in the box. Apple’s claim of 5 hours of battery life is pretty accurate as well. I’ve gotten anywhere between 4-4.5 hours which is right on the ball with Apple’s estimate. The microphones that are built into the AirPods are on a whole other level in terms of microphones on mobile devices. I was walking down a busy Seattle street the other day with tons of people walking by and engine-based cars stuck in traffic, yet, the person on the other end of the phone call could hear me just fine. That’s impressive. Using the microphones for Siri also works surprisingly well when Siri wants to work. And that brings me to my final point, the double tap gesture for Siri is awful. Maybe I’m not doing it right, but I’ve found that the gesture works about 40% of the time. I’ll keep it on versus changing it to Play/Pause (own an Apple Watch) or having it do flat out nothing. I originally thought, “Why not map out the gestures from the EarPods to the AirPods?” I now understand Apple’s decision. The gesture simply doesn’t work reliably enough to add any additional gesture. However, requiring an internet connection to do simple things such as adjusting the volume, is flat out insane. How well do they stay in the ear? For whatever reason this is the most asked question when people see me with AirPods. This isn’t an easy question to answer as everyone has different ear shapes. But for me, EarPods fit just fine and AirPods are the same. If anything the AirPods stay better in my ears due to the lack of wire. Initially, I was paranoid about them falling out of my ear and I kept pushing them back in every time I felt like they’d fall out of my ear. Though, that’s starting to slowly fade as I get more comfortable with them. I have yet to have them fall out of my ear at all. Conclusion While it may seem like I absolutely hate the AirPods, they’re by far my favorite Apple product of the year. They work reliably enough that it’s not super annoying. Sound quality will be adequate for any non-audiophile person. I’ll primarily use the AirPods for podcasts, audiobooks, phone calls, movies, and other non-music audio. While pairing with Apple TV is supper annoying, I primarily use it there because the Siri remote is able to adjust the volume of my AirPods. While it won’t be replacing my audiophile grade headphones, it’ll now have a place in my pocket on me at all times for when I need them. If you’re looking for a set of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, AirPods are the only ones I can recommend. While no promises can be made about Apple improving its software quality anytime soon, AirPods and the experience you get from them (that’s mostly due to the Apple designed W1 chip) cannot be matched. In the end, it’s silly to disregard sound quality in a set of headphones, especially from an audiophile. However, functionality wise, AirPods set a high bar for wireless headphones and is a truly innovative headphone, even though sound quality isn’t there yet.

So here’s my review: they sound the exact same (if not worse) than the $25 earpods. Is it worth $150 extra for a cool battery widget? jleetj What’s the point of having an audiophile’s perspective if sound quality is going to be ignored? All that was discussed in the review has already been mentioned in other reviews by non-audiophiles. s fr Ghey.

Photograph: PSL Images/Alamy Olivia Solon in San Francisco Tuesday 3 January 2017 17.34 EST Last modified on Tuesday 3 January 2017 18.16 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close A couple whose five-year-old daughter was killed after a distracted driver drove into their car is suing Apple for failing to introduce an iPhone safety feature it patented in 2014 to discourage people from using FaceTime while driving. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara superior county court, relates to an incident that took place on Christmas Eve 2014, when a driver allegedly using the FaceTime video chat application on his iPhone 6 Plus drove into the car of Bethany and James Modisette. The couple, along with their daughters Isabella and Moriah, were injured in the accident, and Moriah later died in the hospital from her injuries. In their complaint, highlighted by Courthouse News, the Modisettes claim that Apple should be held accountable for the accident because the smartphone manufacturer had a patent for a safer version of FaceTime designed to prevent people from using the video and voice call application while driving. Despite filing the patent, Apple chose not to introduce the technology to its iPhones. The patent in question, granted in April 2014, describes a lock-out mechanism that disables the mobile device from performing certain functions, such as texting, while driving. The Modisettes allege that Apple’s failure to introduce the patented feature, or warn users that using FaceTime while driving could be dangerous, was a “substantial factor” in causing their injuries and Moriah’s death. The case is not the first of its kind. Earlier this year, while checking her iPhone for messages, Ashley Kubiak crashed her truck into another vehicle in Texas, killing its driver and leaving a child paralyzed. The families of the victims also filed a case against Apple, contending the company knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. “Plaintiffs are saying to manufacturers: if your product unnecessarily diverts the driver’s attention away from the road in the moment before a collision, you may be on the hook,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford law professor. “If the plaintiffs were to prevail, the case could have sweeping implications, not just for handheld devices, but for navigation systems, car radios – potentially even fast food purchased at drive-through windows.” However, it will be difficult for the plaintiffs to show that it was the iPhone that caused the accident when there is another actor – the distracted driver – who could be labelled as a “superseding cause”. “A superseding cause breaks the causal chain, and here would relieve the iPhone manufacturer of liability,” Engstrom said. A complicating factor in both of these cases is that the accidents took place in Texas, where it’s mostly legal for drivers to make phone calls while driving and there’s no state-wide ban on texting while driving, although many cities have outlawed the practice. “Ordinarily if a manufacturer is being sued for an illegal use of their product, they shouldn’t be liable,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University school of law. However, if the company knew that its devices could be used illegally and had a way to prevent it, there may be grounds for liability – although such liability would hinge on whether the technical solution (in this case, the patented lock-out feature) was feasible. “There’s currently no way to determine whether or not the person using the phone is driving. They could be the passenger,” said patent lawyer Mark Terry. “I don’t think they have a sound legal premise. “A tragedy has happened and they are looking for a deep pocket. Apple has a deep pocket so if anyone can find a reason to hit them at all, they will,” he added. Goldman agrees. “This is what personal injury lawyers do,” he said. “They sue not only the person who caused the harm – the driver – and then everyone else they can think of who might have contributed to the accident.” That’s not to say that cases like these won’t cause problems for device manufacturers in the future. “The patent proves that Apple knows, and has long known, that phone use and driving is widespread and is dangerous,” Engstrom said. “Apple’s inaction in the face of that knowledge may not trigger liability here. But it may well expose Apple to liability down the road.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Rumours, UK release date, price and features Apple's next offering is expected to boast some incredible new tech but ditch some familiar features By NEAL BAKER and JASPER HAMILL 11th January 2017, 3:57 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments EXCITING new details of the iPhone 8 including dazzling high-tech features and the all-important UK release date have been reportedly revealed. Leaked information gives Apple fans much to look forward to with the tech giant’s new flagship gadget — but what rumours have got people excited the most? Getty Images 2 When will the iPhone 8 be released? Apple is expected to release the iPhone 8 in September 2017, in keeping with its annual autumn launch of major new products. In 2016 the iPhone 7 was launched on 16 September, so a similar mid-September date seems most likely. Nothing has been confirmed, but Apple tends to stick to the same schedule every year. The iPhone 5, 5S, 6, 6S and 7 were all launched in September of consecutive years. What new features will the iPhone 8 have? Screen and camera The iPhone 8 is rumoured to have a stunning edge-to-edge OLED display taking up the length and breadth of the device. It could also feature an all-glass design, according to a recently filed patent. The patent awarded to Apple describes a device with a display that “may occupy the entire front face”. The screen will have the Home Button  — complete with super-sensitive Touch ID technology — and its front-facing camera built in, according to leaked reports from Apple’s Cupertino HQ. It is even thought the screen could be curved, just like the latest high-tech TVs. Depending on the model (iPhone 8 is expected to come in three versions, see below) there will also be improved Optical Image Stabilisation technology. ConceptsiPhone 2 Rumours are the iPhone 8 (artist’s impression) could be full-screen and feature wireless charging technology It will allow for even clearer ultra-HD photographs using two cameras: a 12 megapixel wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens. This OIS technology already features on the iPhone 7 Plus’s wide-angle lens, but NOT the telephoto lens. The telephoto lens is expected to be improved in time for the iPhone 8 launch, meaning even pictures taken from far away will be clearer and more stabilised. It has also been reported that Apple is working with LG on a camera for the iPhone 8 that would allow 3D photographs. However, it is unclear exactly how these could be put to use. Wireless charging Taiwanese tech manufacturer Foxconn is making wireless charging modules for the iPhone 8, according to reports. It means the iPhone 8 will reportedly be able to be charged from 15 FEET away. It will use a built-in wireless receiver to receive power from a transmitter plugged into a socket. A company called Energous is said to be supplying the technology it called ‘WattUp’. The firm has previously boasted WattUp technology can allow devices to be charged from the impressive distance. iPhone 8 'will have wireless charging using WattUp technology' Will iPhone 8 have a headphone jack? It doesn't look like the new iPhone will have a headphone jack, and the physical home button is expected to disappear as the whole face will be a screen. The new phone will instead have a virtual home button. Samsung is expected to follow suit, ditching its headphone jack and home button on its new Galaxy S8, according to gadgets.ndtv.com How many models of iPhone 8 will there be? There will be three different versions of the iPhone 8, according to a market analysis note seen by MacRumors. The premium version will be a 5.8 inch model with the OLED screen, while there will be two TFT-LCD screen models — a 4.7 inch version and a 5.5 inch version. The smallest 4.7 inch model will not have the dual camera Optical Image Stabalisation Technology, while the larger and more expensive models will, according to the note. What will the iPhone 8 be called? If Apple follows its recent naming scheme, The iPhone 8 may be called the iPhone 7S. But that seems unlikely when it's such a big release. It may even just be called iPhone after Apple called its third tablet "The New iPad" to simplify its name. Apple unveils waterproof and wireless iPhone 7 with no headphone jack How much will it cost? It is expected to be roughly the same cost as the iPhone 7. That would be about £599 for the basic model and around £719 for the larger models. Can't stop constantly checking your phone?

The Selfridges retail store listing, which previously showed the Selfridges store front along with store hours and location, has been removed from Apple's website and now redirects to a list of UK stores. Apple's Selfridges pop up shop was first introduced in 2015 alongside the launch of the Apple Watch. It was located in the iconic Wonder Room, which is a 19,000 square-foot hall that houses a number of luxury jewelry and watch brands. There was no warning that the Selfridges pop up shop would be shut down, but rumors have suggested Apple is planning to close the Galeries Lafayette Apple Watch pop up shop this month due to poor sales. At this time, the Galeries Lafayette Apple Watch page is still intact, as is the Isetan listing for Apple's luxury pop up shop at the Isetan department store in Tokyo, Japan. There's no word on whether the Isetan shop is shutting down, but Apple has reportedly been reducing the number of employees at Galeries Lafayette ahead of its closure. If poor sales are the reason behind the end of the Galeries Lafayette pop up shop, it's likely the Selfridges store suffered from similar problems. Both stores were originally set up to sell the high-end Apple Watch Edition made from 18-karat gold and priced up to $17,000, but Apple discontinued that model in September of 2016, replacing it with the lower-priced ceramic Edition models.

Rating: 21 Votes WarDialer 2 weeks ago The biggest problem with Apple today is that they have a fundamental misunderstanding of their customers. Not Apple, but Tim Cook. I am amazed the Board has confidence in him at this point. I guess a high stock price is all it takes to keep his job at this point (even tho the stock under performed compared to the overall stock market itself in 2016). Apple is now a consumer electronics company and that's all. Sad really to see this new downturn. Apple lacks clear vision towards the future and I doubt anyone in the SVP level has it either (look at how bad the App store in general and review process specifically was until Phil "The Shill" took over). The Bean Counters are running Apple again. And this time there is no Steve Jobs to come in at the 11th hour to turn things around. Rating: 21 Votes MH01 2 weeks ago I like my Apple Watch, though happy that reality is setting in, in regards to apple thinking they were a fashion brand and not an electronic consumer company. Wish they were still a computer company though. Rating: 13 Votes a.gomez 2 weeks ago because a gadget made in Taiwan that lose half its value in a year is not a high end item. Especially not a High-End watch :rolleyes: Rating: 13 Votes gugy 2 weeks ago The biggest problem with Apple today is that they have a fundamental misunderstanding of their customers. Especially the pro crowd. What Apple is doing to the Mac and the professionals that depend on it is criminal. Lack of updates to the desktop line, weak MBP update and moving away from Airport/displays are really bad moves.

I tend to get around myself but just about never seen almost any of that kind of thing "in the wild" (including the relatively, "well-to-do" wilds). And yet year after year, it keeps parading down runways and apparently somebody buys enough of it to keep the whole cycle going. Wow. Are you seriously that provincial? Fashion shows aren't all about presenting clothes meant to be worn. It's a form of art. Just like prototype cars are totally wild and unfeasible. Nobody expects those cars to be sold. There's no connection whatsoever to the AppleWatch which was designed and built to be sold, worn and used in the real world. Rating: 7 Votes Naraxus 2 weeks ago Doubtful it's poor sales. More likely it's due to Apple now focusing the Watch as a "Fitness" gadget as opposed to a "Fashion" gadget which is something they should have done in the first place Rating: 7 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming iMac Early 2017 Updated models with AMD graphics options expected in early 2017. iPad Pro Early 2017?

Tuesday, January 3, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple’s 2016 in Review Chuq Von Rospach (Hacker News): Apple’s model of who its users are and what they want seems to be different than what happens out in the real world among its real users. And that to me indicates potential problems of all sorts, since that misjudgment affects not only forecasting, but product design, feature choice and performance specifications all tie back into this. And given the criticism of the MacBook Pros by many long-time Mac users, that’s a worry. […] Apple’s always been a data driven company, but I think they’ve gotten overly reliant on data to drive business decisions. Spreadsheets can tell you where the sweet spots in the market are and how to hit them, but they struggle at finding and bringing forward strategic areas that also need coverage. That was, actually, one thing that Steve excelled at. It means you need people in leadership who understand their user base and which bits are strategic and need to have product coverage. […] There are far too many details of bugs slipping into releases, weird design choices (the chaos of trying to use stickers in messages, for instance), usability problems and general “lack of polish” and the trend line on the quality of OS and app releases is headed in the wrong direction. […] My worry is that Apple isn’t seeing this, because it’s looking at the sales numbers and they look fine, with many products under backlog and strong demand (including the new MacBook Pros). If you just look at the numbers, things are okay. But what Apple’s always been good at is looking beyond the numbers to the things they don’t say — and I worry they’ve lost that. Previously: How Apple Alienated Mac Loyalists, New MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac. Update (2017-01-03): Gus Mueller: I really miss the previous generation of Mac Pros. Andrew Abernathy: I personally wish Apple would stay in the wifi game, and improve their products, if for no other reason than I trust them most on security. John Gruber (tweet): Something is clearly wrong with the AirPort line. Either it should have been updated long to remain state-of-the-art, or it should have been discontinued. […] “What the hell happened with the Mac Pro?” is the most interesting question about Apple today. Because something clearly went way wrong with this product. I’m not convinced the basic idea for the design is unsound — the idea is that expansion would come in the form of external peripherals, rather than things you install inside the box. I’m not sure that makes sense given the price of RAM and the improvements in SSDs and GPUs. If I’m going to keep the CPU for a long time, which given its slower rate of improvement is likely, it would be really nice to be able to upgrade the stuff inside the box. I’d rather not have appendages. Updates to the same basic design would make sense. An all-new design would make sense. Getting out of the Mac Pro game would make sense. Selling 1000-day old pro workstations at the same prices as in 2013 makes no sense. Whatever the explanation is, this situation is an unmitigated disaster. Update (2017-01-05): Philip Elmer-DeWitt (via Chuq Von Rospach): The must-read Apple rant of the week is Chuq Von Rospach’s Apple’s 2016 in review. The veteran of a dozen Silicon Valley firms—including 17 years at Apple—Von Rospach has written a critique of Apple’s annus horribilis so sharp and on-the-mark that even die-hard Apple apologists are recommending it. Nick Heer: Forgive me for pointing out the obvious here, but Apple, unlike its peers, is the only company that makes hardware that can officially run MacOS and iOS. Google and Microsoft may now have their own integrated hardware and software products — in the form of the Pixel and Surface, respectively — but other companies make hardware that runs Android and Windows. This puts Apple in a position of incredible power and responsibility. Their platforms are exceptional. Even as I complain at length about the myriad bugs and quality issues in MacOS, I’ve also used Windows recently and I can assure you that there’s a gigantic gap. Yet this responsibility, I feel, is something that they haven’t always treated with the respect it deserves. Rene Ritchie: Fixing it, of course, is non-trivial. Should Apple go back to doing less but doing it better? Yes.

Nuheara, a San Francisco, California-based startup, has revealed that its IQBuds will begin shipping immediately to any customers who placed orders for the wireless headphones in 2016. The company plans to ship the headphones to stores in March, 2017, though Canadian retail partners have not been revealed yet. Similar to Apple’s AirPods and Samsung’s Gear IconX headphones, Nuheara’s Bluetooth IQBuds are wireless earbud headphones with the ability to connect to any device that supports the wireless protocol. “Our IQbuds have been tested on thousands of consumers who are delighted they can finally have solutions to hear what they want to hear — from great quality music to ‘pub deafness.’  We are extremely proud that we’re shipping on-time, as promised and less than twelve months after our first prototype and seven months from the conclusion of our initial crowdfunding campaign,” said Justin Miller, CEO and co-founder of Nuheara. According to Nuheara, the company’s earbud headphones feature technology it’s calling SINC (Super Intelligent Noise Cancellation), which enhances users ability to hear speech in noisy environments, tap controls (something Apple’s AirPods sorely lack) and blended hearing, allowing a mix of sound from the headphones and the outside world, a feature Samsung heavily touted with its IconX headphones. The most interesting thing about about the IQBuds, however, is the fact that the company claims they’re able to last a 16 hours on a single charge, with 32 hours of on-the-go ‘hearing augmentation,’ a feature that makes the headphones work similar to a hearing aid. If the company’s claims about the headphones are accurate, Nuheara’s wireless earbuds could be significantly better than Apple and Samsung’s offerings. The headphones also feature a customizable iOS and Android app. The IQbuds earbuds are priced at $299 USD, which comes to approximately $401 CAD, an expensive price tag for earbud headphones, even if they are wireless. Nuheara’s IQbuds have also been selected as a 2017 honouree for CES 2017’s innovation award.

I’m more than a little doubtful about the battery life claims with that size of earbud, especially if they’re using ANC and decent drivers or balanced armatures. Cowpoke It’s great that so many products like this are coming to market; should drive up quality and useability and drive down prices.. jay that price you may buy two pair AirPods and that makes double battery Sweet A far better design than the AirPods. Expensive, but at least they’re practical and stylish. A few years ago there was a Swedish company that started a Kickstarter project for wireless earbuds that came with a little cylindrical container that you could use as a keychain. I don’t know if they were ever released. Brandon considering the functions of the IQbuds, the fact their wireless, and the customizable app that come with it they seem to be the best in their class, especially considering if you’ve lost any hearing. For flying they’d definitely be my choice due to being able to block out the very annoying cabin noise, also great for crowded areas, pubs, restaurants, etc. Their design is stylish and a lot more practical for listening to MP3’s on the go compared to the huge headphones many seem to walk around with that almost require another backpack to carry them in or the current featureless airpods or equivalents Categories News Reviews Features Resources Business Syrup Community Contact us About Us Contests Social Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Google+ Reddit Newsletter Signup Thank you for your subscription © 2017 mobilesyrup.com Privacy.

TECHNOLOGY Apple Sued Over Lethal Car Crash In 2014, a child died because a distracted driver was using the company's FaceTime app behind the wheel. The suit alleges Apple could have done more to prevent the wreck. By Rob Price Business Insider WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Apple is being sued over a fatal car crash in which a driver was distracted by FaceTime. The plaintiffs allege it failed to introduce technology it had a patent for that could potentially have prevented the driver from using the app. The case, filed in a Californian court in early December, relates to a road accident in Texas that happened on Christmas Eve, 2014. The driver, "distracted while using the 'FaceTime' application on an iPhone 6 Plus during the operation of his motor vehicle," crashed at 65 mph into the back of a vehicle that was stationary due to traffic, the court documents say. (We first saw the case over on Apple Insider, and you can read the full filing below.) Inside the car were Bethany and James Modisette, and their two children--Isabella and Moriah. The family sustained serious injuries, and Moriah died of her injuries in hospital. She was five years old at the time. It's a tragic case--but why is Apple involved? The company is being sued because, the Modisette's lawyers claim, it has technology that could have prevented it but failed to implement it. The court filings point to a patent that Apple applied for in 2008 (and was granted in 2014) that would "lock out the ability of drivers to use the 'FaceTime' application on the Apple iPhone while using a motor vehicle." The case alleges that by failing to incorporate this patent, Apple contributed to the death of Moriah and the injuries of the rest of the family. The company's "failure to design, manufacture, and sell the iPhone 6 Plus with the patented, safer, alternative design technology already available to it ... and failure to warn users that the product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner ... rendered the Apple iPhone 6 defective when it left defendant APPLE INC.'s possession, and were therefore a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs' injuries and the decedent's death," the Modisettes' lawyers allege. An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This post originally appeared on Business Insider. Published on: Jan 3, 2017 Advertisement

Now a third party is offering the functionality Apple has resisted, and is making it possible for just $99. AirBar commits to adding the full touchscreen experience that Apple half-heartedly applied in the form of the Touch Bar—a thin, touch-enabled screen laid atop the keyboard of the new MacBook Pro models. With nothing more than a thin, magnetic sensor that sits at the bottom of the display on a MacBook Air, the AirBar adds full touchscreen support to the Apple-made laptop.  Neonode, the manufacturer behind the AirBar, claims the device uses a patented technology that projects an invisible light field over the standard MacBook Air display. That light field is able to discern user inputs from fingers, gloves or accessories like a stylus or paintbrush—and no direct contact with the screen is necessary.  The AirBar processes touches and gestures and translates them into actions performed on the MacBook—a process that requires no additional software. All a user has to do is connect the sensor to their laptop via USB and start interacting with it. Related Stories Apple iPad Rumors 2017: The Next Tablet Might Not Have A Home Button Microsoft Surface Pro Series Beat iPad Pro In UK Enterprise Sales In Q1 2016 While the bar can remain plugged in during standard laptop usage—typing on the keyboard, scrolling with the touchpad, etc.—the device does have to be removed when the laptop is closed, making it a bit less convenient than the built-in touchscreen functionality of, say, the Microsoft Surface. Microsoft has slowly been eating into Apple's share of the laptop and tablet market with its Surface devices, which have been stealing back some of the loyal customers who previously jumped ship to the MacBook line. A recent report from the computing giant claims its sales of Surface devices are higher than ever before, while Apple has seen its iPad sales slide to new lows. Poor reviews for the new MacBook Pro with its touchscreen keyboard bar—including a damaging report from Consumer Reports that advised consumers to stay away from the laptop due to battery issues— could further hurt Apple's standing. While it doesn't come from Apple, the AirBar might be the solution that spices up the MacBook and adds the functionality that is otherwise missing. The AirBar for MacBook Air is available for pre-order now for $99 and are expected to arrive in late August according to the company's site.

I personally enjoyed 2016. It had its ups and downs like when I had to move thrice in a span of 8 months. But any other year has them. Life isn't perfect. I don't celebrate New Year's Eve anymore because I don't really look at my life with bookmarks. Forget resolutions when those can happen at any day you want to try for them. Just enjoy living. No need to label them. But I know 2016 wasn't really a great year for many. I liked 2013 and 2015 better but 2016 was pretty good too for me. I liked every single year I lived in as each year I can remember had its share of highlights and disappointments. As long as you are breathing, take the good and bad times with you and keep moving forward.

It’s only January 3rd, but it looks like 2017 is going to be another boring year full of innovation per usual. Apple chip manufacturer TSMC is reportedly on schedule to deliver prototype chips using its new 7nm process by the summer of this year. Provided everything else runs on schedule, that should mean the extra-tiny chips will be ready for mass production in 2018, just in time for the iPhone 8s… and the start of President Trump’s re-election campaign. Don't Miss: CNN uses screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’ to show how Russians hack things The report, which comes from sometimes-reputable analytics firm DigiTimes, says that TSMC will be ready for customer “tape-out” (basically, final design approval) sometime in Q2 2017. The firm reportedly has more than 15 customers, including Apple and Nvidia, lined up to use the chip technology. The current generation of Apple devices use the A10 family of chips, which are manufactured by TSMC on a 16nm process. This year’s iPhone, whether it’s the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s (or both!) will reportedly be manufactured using a 10nm TSMC chip. So, it would be no surprise that the iPhone 8s/9 planned for 2018 is slated to use a 7nm chip. Smaller circuits are the key to adhering to Moore’s Law and producing faster processors every year. For a given processor design, making it on a smaller process (7nm vs 10nm, for example) makes the processor more energy-efficient and faster. Apple has long used a variety of processor fabricators for the iPhone’s chips, but has switched to TSMC in recent years as the Taiwan company has emerged as the stand-out leader in mobile chip manufacturing. Apple’s close collaboration with TSMC every year helps keep the iPhone at the top of the pack in efficiency and performance, even as Qualcomm keeps making Android smartphones even faster every year. From the reports coming out of the supply chain, it seems like it will be business as usual for Apple and the iPhone 8s. Current rumors suggest that this year’s iPhone refresh will see Apple skip its normal ticktock upgrade cycle and release the iPhone 8 to celebrate the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. The new model might have a curved bezel-free display with no home button, dual cameras, and still no headphone jack.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | January 3, 2017 -- 14:45 GMT (06:45 PST) | Topic: iOS Uncover some of the cool new features hidden in iOS 10.2. Here is a quick rundown of some of the new features contained in the latest iOS 10.2 update that you might have missed. While most of these features should be available on all devices that support iOS 10, some will only be available on newer devices. Allow selected contacts to bypass Do Not Disturb What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft rolls out second Windows 10 Creators Update test build in a week House bill aims to block tech giants from building "Muslim registry" With the rise of global instability, can ceramic storage save our digital culture? CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech The VIP system for allowing selected contacts to still call you has been improved dramatically in iOS 10. Now you can pick out contacts that can make your phone ring individually. Go into Contacts, select a contact, and click Edit. From there, you can set the ringtone and text tone to Emergency Bypass On. Dude, where's my car? Fire up Apple Maps to find where you parked your car. If it's not immediately obvious from the little car icon on the map, you can search for Parked car. Send smaller photos in iMessage Go to Settings > Messages and enable Low Quality Image Mode. If you send a lot of photos and you're either having poor signal or you're not on an unlimited data plan, this can be really helpful. iOS 10.2: 'Power User' tips and tricks SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 12 NEXT PREV Time for bed This is a weird feature that people will either love or hate. If you're the sort of person who likes to have a certain number of hours of sleep before your alarm goes off, you can now have your iPhone remind you when to go to bed. (I know, how did we manage before such things?) To enable this feature, open the Clock app and tap Bedtime. Convert text to emojis The Messages app will highlight the words you can swap out for an emoji in orange, and you can emojify a message by simply tapping on the words. Prioritize app installations If you're recovering your iPhone or installing multiple apps, you can control which apps are installed first by doing a long press on any app waiting to be downloaded on the home screen and then tapping the Prioritize Download option. This requires a device with 3D Touch. Better iMessage read receipts Now you can set your read receipt preferences by clicking on the "I" icon found at the top-right of iMessage window, then turn read receipts on or off. This setting syncs across all your devices. Jazz up your messages If you're sending a message to other iPhone or iPad users using iMessage then you can animate the message to give it a bit more impact. Just press and hold the send message blue arrow to uncover Bubble and Screen options. Draw your message Again in iMessage, rotate your device by 90 degrees to get access to an option that allows you to draw your message and send it to other iMessage users. Find your Apple Watch I know a lot of people requested this feature, and now it's present as part of Find My iPhone. Make Unlock work the way it used to Apple tweaked the way you unlock your iPhone with the Touch ID sensor, but if this new feature annoys you there is a way to make it work like it did in iOS 9. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button and enable Rest Finger to Open. Delete those undeletable apps Apple's own apps used to be a fixed feature, and the best you could do was hide them from view. But now you can delete apps such as Main, Stocks, and Weather just like you'd delete any other app (and if you change your mind, they're in the App Store). Best iPhone or iPad apps for 2017 SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 24 NEXT PREV Bright lights! You can now alter the brightness of the flashlight by using a long press on the flashlight icon in Control Center to choose between Bright Light, Medium Light, and Low Light. This requires a device with 3D Touch. Get to the camera -- fast! The icon might be gone, but you can still get to the camera from the lock screen. All you need to do is swipe left. Search your photos From Memories in the Photos app you can search for photos containing particular objects. This is also quite spookily accurate. Easy unsubscribe Mail automatically floats unsubscribe links from mailing list emails to the top, so you can find them easily. Avoid toll roads If you're a heavy user of Apple Maps and want to save yourself a few bucks then you might want to go into Settings > Maps > Driving & Navigation to turn off the tolls. Save on storage space If you're low on space you can get iOS 10 to remove music you've not listened to in a while by going to Settings > Music > Optimize Storage and enabling Optimize Storage. From here you can pick how much free space you want to try to keep on your iPhone or iPad. Cool, new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus acc...

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming MWC 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: CES 2017 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Fitness News / Apple Watch 3 release date tipped, battery life boost the top priority Apple Watch 3 release date tipped, battery life boost the top priority by Chris Smith 03 January 2017 0 shares Read Comments The Apple Watch is about to join the cycle of annual product refreshes with a Series 3 release coming in the second half of 2016, according to reports on Tuesday. The Economic Daily News in China (via MacRumors) claims Apple is targeting the 3rd quarter for the third generation wearable, which sources say will be manufactured by Quanta, the company behind Series 1 and Series 2. According to the report, the key aim will be to boost the Apple Watch’s battery life, something that went undressed by the launch of Series 2 last September. However beyond the battery boost, the report says hardware improvements will be few and far between. If the report is of substance, it would appear to lessen the chances Apple would fit a third-gen device with cellular capabilities, or more advanced sensors that could increase its reach as a health monitor. Related: Apple Watch Series 2 review Several reports have also suggested Apple will switch to a Micro-LED display that would be thinner and lighter than the original. For what it's worth, Quanta has declined to comment on the report. If Apple does launch in the 3rd quarter it would likely be at or shortly after the iPhone 8 announcement in September. Of course, today’s report can be taken with a pinch of salt, but this is the first indication we’ve received on when Apple may next refresh its smartwatch. There was almost two years between the announcements of Series 1 and 2. Will that gap shorten to one year in 2017? Should I Buy the Apple Watch Series 2? Head-to-Head Are you waiting for the Apple Watch 3 before slapping Cupertino's smartwatch on your wrist?

Amid reports that the California-based firm is in advanced stages of talks with the government for setting up a manufacturing facility in India, a senior commerce ministry source said on Tuesday that Apple’s “growing demand for concessions” could be a dampener.  “Apple is apparently demanding concessions that no other company is asking for,” the source said. While not specifying the latest demands made by the company, the source said these included its earlier demand of exemption from a local sourcing of products. The other demands include concessions on tax and the “creation of a suitable ecosystem”, the source added. While the finance ministry is looking at the tax demand, the local sourcing norms as well as other things the firm has asked for will be examined by an inter-governmental panel comprising senior officials of the departments of industrial policy and promotion, revenue and electronics and information technology at a meeting slated to take place later this week. According to the current foreign direct investment(FDI) norms notified by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) in June 2016, 100%  FDI is allowed in single-brand retail although foreign retailers must obtain the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) if the FDI limit exceeds 49%. Also, foreign entities that have “state-of-the-art” and “cutting-edge” technology will get an exemption from the annual mandatory 30%  sourcing rule for the initial three years.  Thereafter, in the next five years, the company will have to meet the domestic sourcing norm at an annualised average rate of 30%. While Apple had been identified as such a company, it wants an indefinite exemption from domestic sourcing, as was the case under the earlier norm, a senior DIPP official said.  Last year, the finance ministry had rejected its proposal to set up wholly-owned outlets in the country under such conditions. The company had earlier stated its difficulties in sourcing locally, saying it did not have any manufacturing units in India and its products had sophisticated parts not easily available.   It had earlier been reported that Apple had asked the government to relax its mandatory rules regarding labelling on products, saying it would go against the minimalist look of the devices. However, while the earlier focus of negotiations was the opening of retail stores in the country, other issues had now taken hold, the source added. Apple has also been keen on getting permission to import and sell refurbished phones in India. On this, Apple CEO Tim Cook had also visited India and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. The proposal was rejected by the environment ministry in 2015 with and telecommunications ministries also reportedly having some reservations about it. Apple currently sells its products in India through arrangements with local retail outlets. Among the six countries where it manufactures products, most of the company’s items are assembled in China, usually by Foxconn Technology. The value of its sales in India crossed $1 billion for the first time last year, according to filings with the registrar of companies.

Here are some reasons why people aren’t willing to spend $159 on Apple’s newest accessory and some affordable alternatives… Even though AirPods are priced well relative to the other fully wireless options and have a good set of features, the $159 still sets you back 17-29% of the cost of your iPhone (depending on your model). When you think about the purchase from that perspective, I can see why 36%, the largest portion of readers who responded, said they weren’t buying because of price. Of course another big price relativity factor is that many people will look not only at fully wireless alternatives, but also much more affordable wireless or even wired earphones. Our own Zac Hall mentioned he keeps a pair of $25 lower quality bluetooth earphones around for bad weather in his AirPods versus Powerbeats3 review. However, there are also some highly rated options that aren’t much more expensive. Anker’s SoundBuds Wireless Headphones are a great option for $30. They feature 8-hour playtime, splash-proof design and they’re rated almost 4/5 stars with over 2,000 reviews on Amazon. Another highly rated choice if you like the neckband style are Mpow’s Jaws Bluetooth Headphones for $24. They have 4.2/5 stars with almost 3,000 reviews and feature 13 hour battery life. If you don’t mind or even prefer wired earphones, the top selling Amazon option, Panasonic’s In-Ear Headphones can be had for $8 (roughly 5% of the AirPods’ price). Even though there’s a trade-off for wires, you don’t have to worry about charging them, which almost 5% of readers shared as their reason. Don’t forget you’ll need to use your lightning to 3.5mm adapter with your iPhone 7/7 Plus or use can use this slick Griffin accessory to make any wired pair of headphones you love bluetooth enabled. Other motivations to pass on AirPods besides the reasons you can see below included wanting noise isolation or noise cancelling, planning on waiting for BeatsX or other headphones, and waiting for the 2nd generation. Here are the full results: If you haven’t taken the poll already you can do so here. As always, please share your thoughts below, even if in contrast to the folks who took the poll you have AirPods and were happy to pay the $159.

"No other company has made these demands which Apple is making, so why should they be given special treatment?" a high-ranking government source said. Apple has sought concessions related to taxation, local procurement and labelling requirements, officials have told ET. During his visit to the country last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said India was the next big market for the company. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged Cook to set up factories in India when they met during that trip. The government currently provides subsidies for investments in special economic zones in order to woo investors. Apple had earlier sought permission to set up fully owned retail outlets by forgoing the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm on the grounds that it was bringing cutting-edge technology to India. The finance ministry didn't allow the exemption. Since then the company has drawn up plans for factories in India as it looks to shift some of its manufacturing from China, sources said. It manufactures products in six countries, with most of them being made in China. The company is said to be planning to assemble phones in Bengaluru for the local market through a contract maker. Some reports said the company may also be considering plants in Ahmedabad and Gurgaon. Apple has refused to comment on such reports. Rivals such as Samsung have started sourcing parts from within the country while exporting products made at plants in Noida and Sriperumbudur. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has forwarded the iPhonemaker's request to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY). A group of senior officials from these departments will deliberate over Apple's demands. The government provides benefits under Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) to boost electronic manufacturing in the country as it looks to reduce the import bill.

The Cupertino, California-based company, whose markets in the West and in China are getting saturated, has been keenly looking toward India, the world’s fastest growing smartphone geography, to grow sales of its devices where it currently has about 2 percent market share.

Posted on Tuesday, January 3rd, 2017 by Peter Sciretta A new leak seems to suggest that the next update to iPhone’s iOS operating system may introduce a new movie theater mode which should make use of the iPhone less distracting in the cinema environment. Hit the jump for more details on the iPhone theater mode. The rumor comes thanks to notable Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who says that the upcoming iOS 10.3 update will feature a “new Theatre Mode” which will add popcorn-shaped icon to the control center. Details are pretty thin right now, but according to Dickson, the mode could essentially be a dark mode. The iOS 10.3 beta one is scheduled to seed on January 10th 2017 and is code named “Erie.” Many are speculating that the new mode will both turn off notifications and dim the screen brightness to the lowest setting. The iPhone already has a “Do Not Disturb” function in the Control Center that that shuts off notification sounds, so you would think this new theater mode would do more than to dim your screen’s brightness. So maybe there is something more to this. Some tech sites are already writing this off as the end of times like Apple is going to be encouraging people to text and use their phone while they are in the movie theater. Wake up call, that is already happening. I can’t remember a public movie screening I’ve been to in the last few years where I didn’t at one point spot someone on their phone. And honestly, this usually is an issue of brightness. People who use their phone in the movie theater almost never lower their brightness or try to conceal their usage under their jacket or whatever. These are people who generally don’t care about the people around them. The question is: will a new popcorn icon convince some of those people to turn their phone to “Theatre mode” before a movie begins? Heck, if it convinces a few people it’s probably worth it right? I’ve theorized for years now that movie theaters and Apple should collaborate on a new technology that would prevent phone distractions during movie screenings (and other performance-like events). In June 2011, I wrote a post titled What If Your Cellphone Wouldn’t Allow You to Use It During a Movie Screening?. In the post, I proposed the idea that Apple should build a system which would not allow people to pick up a phone call or respond to a text message while inside a movie theater. The phone would be in lock mode while in the theater, from the time the trailers start until the end credits hit. And better yet, the technology would put all iPhones on minimum brightness, which would be less of a disturbance. So even if someone turns on their phone to check the time, it will not distract as many people from the film. Don’t get me wrong, I understand that some people need the ability to receive urgent calls/txts — doctors, parents…etc. I’m not saying that the ability to check one’s phone should be completely disabled — for example, you would still be able to see someone is calling, just not able to pick up or return the call until he leaves the theater. You would be able to read the txt message, just not be able to respond. The response to that idea was very mixed. It turns out people don’t want private companies to have control of their technology, even if they aren’t the rude one texting and looking at Facebook during Rogue One: A Star Wars Story on opening night. Also blocking phones in the movie theaters in this manner would probably be illegal, as there are probably FCC laws that would prevent a company like Apple from releasing a system like that. Apple has more recently patented a way for concert venues to prevent iPhone users from recording performances that artists want to protect, done through an infrared beam that would prevent the operating system camera functions. This new Popcorn mode could be a step in the right direction, however. If the leak turns out to be true, I just wonder what it might actually entail.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Web Culture Video shows what happens when an iPhone meets molten aluminum Yoni Heisler @edibleapple December 31st, 2016 at 9:30 AM Share Tweet Whenever Apple releases a new iPhone, folks with money to burn waste no time subjecting Apple’s next-gen device to any number of drop tests and torture tests. If you’re at all curious about whether or not your new iPhone can withstand machine gun fire or a free-fall drop from 1,000 feet in the air, rest assured that someone on YouTube has already filmed and uploaded such an experiment. Don't Miss: Google’s Pixel copied more than just the iPhone’s design That said, we can always appreciate when someone comes up with an original and fresh way to put the iPhone’s famed build quality to the test. And right before the new year, we stumbled across a video from the appropriately named YouTube channel TheBackyardScientist that shows us what happens when you drop a perfectly fine iPhone into molten aluminum. Right from the get-go, things take an interesting turn as the iPhone immediately bursts into flames. And while the iPhone is clearly toast, there is something curiously mesmerizing about this particular method of destruction.

MenuHome Cars Games Tech Home Cars Games Tech Tech Apple iPad Pro 2: More Signs Pointing To Physical Keyboards By Eddy E | January 3, 2017 Share Tweet Share Share 0 comments Keyboards and mouse are not supported by the Apple iPad Pro but even without them, many are pleased with the productivity aspect of the tablet. Apple acknowledges this fact when they started teasing on the development of the iPad Pro 2 but they never confirmed anything yet. Even without a statement from Apple, we can start looking forward to seeing the iPad Pro 2 having support for keyboards and mouse. This is because a leak photo of a casing that is quoted to be for the iPad Pro 2 was seen having a keyboard drawer with USB slots. If the leak is to mean anything, we could be seeing a more laptop-like approach with the iPad Pro 2 and this will allow the slate to give the Microsoft Surface Pro a fight like no other. The iPad Pro 2 is expected to get announced somewhere in March this year and we can expect Apple to address the leak then. Would you like to see mouse and keyboard support on the iPad Pro 2?

Google Wants to Help (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Shared Top Open Source Software Challenges for 2017 by Christopher Tozzi  on January 3, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet By The VAR Guy It’s a new year, and open source software is more popular than ever. But the open source community is also confronting a new set of challenges. Here’s what open source programmers and companies will need to do to keep thriving in 2017. There is no denying that open source has come a very long way in a relatively short time. In January 2007, only a handful of major companies were invested heavily in open source. Closed-source software vendors like Microsoft and VMware dominated the enterprise computing market. On the desktop Linux front, you were lucky if you could get your Linux PC to connect to a wireless network, let alone actually use it do work. Fast forward to January 2017, however, and open source software is everywhere. More than two-thirds of companies are contributing to open source. Open source technologies like OpenStack, Docker and KVM are being used to build the next generation of infrastructure. And it has been years since I have had to fight with Xorg.conf or ndiswrapper in order to make Linux work on my PC. Open Source’s Top Challenges Yet for all that the open source community has achieved, a new set of challenges has arisen. It includes: Cloud computing. Virtually everything is migrating to the cloud, and cloud computing is projected to continue growing at a compound annual growth rate of 19.4 percent for the next several years. That’s good news for open source technologies that power the cloud, like OpenStack. But it’s bad news for people who believe that the primary purpose of open source (or free software) should be to free users. Even when clouds are powered by open source code, cloud computing’s architecture denies users many of the freedoms they would otherwise gain by using open source software (as Richard Stallman keenly points out). The Internet of Things (IoT). IoT presents challenges for open source that are similar to the cloud. Many IoT devices, like smart thermostats, are powered in part by open source technologies. But that doesn’t mean much to users, who usually have little ability to modify the code running on the devices — which tend to be undocumented, to lack interfaces that facilitate modification and to depend on proprietary components. Apple. The open source community has won its long war against Microsoft. Redmond declared its “love” for Linux and made many open source-friendly moves in recent years. But that other major consumer computing company — Apple — remains considerably less in love with open source (which is ironic, given that macOS is built in part on open code derived from BSD). Sure, Apple publishes some open source code. But most of Apple’s products and platforms are super-proprietary and closed. (Case in point: Facetime, which is so proprietary you can’t talk to people with non-Apple devices.) As long as Apple looms as a highly successful closed-source software company, open source will face stiff competition in the consumer market. Docker. Docker containers, which provide an innovative way to isolate applications and build next-generation infrastructure, are the hottest open source story of the moment. But Docker comes with a downside for the open source community. Concern about open standards for containers helped to drive talk of forking Docker several months ago. That never officially happened, but Red Hat launched a competing container framework called OCID. Red Hat swears OCID is not a Docker fork, but it kind of looks like one. All of this competition in the container ecosystem suggests that the spirit of collaboration that has traditionally undergirded open source projects is breaking down in the container world — and that forks and rumors of forks could damage Docker’s momentum. Corporate control. In elder days, most open source code was written by volunteers. Today, the vast majority of code contributions to projects like Linux and OpenStack come from programmers paid by companies like Red Hat and Intel. There’s nothing wrong with this; the fact that companies are investing so much money in open source development is a good thing. But this change does reflect a much higher degree of corporate control over open source code. That leads to tensions that the open source community must contend with — such as the kerfuffle last January about the Linux Foundation’s board of directors giving too much control to companies at the expense of individuals. There is no doubt that open source software will continue to thrive in this new year. But as open source reaches new frontiers, the open source landscape is changing. The open source community must adapt with it. This article first appeared here, on TheVARGuy. Previous Article Issues for 2017: Has the Enterprise Data Center Stopped Disappearing?

As reported by ABC News, the family argues that Apple should have done more to prevent drivers from accessing FaceTime while behind the wheel. Distracted Driving The tragic incident occurred on December 24, 2014 near Dallas, Texas when the Modisette family was traveling in their Toyota Camry. Police activity ahead of the family caused them to slow and then stop their vehicle as traffic backed up. The vehicle behind them, a Toyota 4Runner driven by Garrett Wilhelm, unfortunately failed to stop and slammed into the rear of the Modisette family’s car, severely injuring all members of the family and killing five-year-old Moriah in the process. The Modisette’s lawsuit alleges that Mr. Wilhelm was using FaceTime at the time of the collision, which contributed to his failure to notice the traffic stopped in front of him. Because the use of FaceTime requires “cognitive, manual, audio, and visual efforts to operate, any and all of which distract the attention of a driver,” the suit claims, Apple should have implement safety precautions to prevent drivers from using the app. The suit goes on to state that Apple “expressly knew and/or should have known of the risks to human life and safety associated with…the misuse of certain functions available on the iPhone, such as texting, while operating a motor vehicle,” and cites a 2008 Apple patent application describing a “driver handheld computing device lock-out” feature. While the family acknowledges Mr. Wilhelm’s role and responsibility in the crash — he will face manslaughter charges in Denton County, Texas next month — they argue that Apple shares some of the responsibility for failing to do all it could to address a problem it should have known about: At the time of the collision in question, the iPhone utilized by Wilhelm contained the necessary hardware (to be configured with software) to automatically disable or ‘lock out’ the ability to use [FaceTime] … However, Apple failed to configure the iPhone to automatically ‘lock out’ the ability to utilize FaceTime while driving at highway speeds, despite having the technical capability to do so. Duty of Care While preventing apps like FaceTime from being used at highway speeds is a flawed solution that would prevent passengers from using the device as well, the Modisette family’s attorney explained to ABC News that Apple should have at least prompted users to identify themselves as a passenger or driver, and locked out access in the case of the latter. This approach is frequently used by many in-car entertainment and navigation systems and certain third party apps like Waze. While such an approach is trivial to defeat for those intent on unsafe driving, the lawsuit claims that Apple had a duty to do all that it could to ensure the safe use of its products. As for Mr. Wilhelm, his attorney disputes the facts alleged in the lawsuit, and argues that “the use of a cellular device did not contribute [to the incident]” and that “it was simply an accident.” Apple, as is standard procedure for the company when it comes to pending litigation, declined to comment on the situation.

January 3, 2017 at 2:51 EST PM Robert Latterman January 3, 2017 Next all they will want all phone manufacturers to have means to shut off ALL phones from being used at highway speeds. I think it is certainly tragic that this accident happened but I can’t see how Apple can be blamed for a persons stupidity in how they conduct themselves while driving. January 3, 2017 at 3:58 EST PM brilor January 3, 2017 Clearly the other driver is/was at fault and bears all responsibility for crashing and responsibility to not drive distracted. Sounds like the plaintiff’s attorney searching for deeper pockets and a bigger paycheck. January 3, 2017 at 4:02 EST PM Tiger January 3, 2017 Please tell me they’ll be suing every food vendor, makeup vendor, and maker of shavers, electric and manual toothbrushes, and such for the same thing because I see drivers using those EVERY SINGLE WEEK behind the wheel of a moving car. January 3, 2017 at 4:26 EST PM masterconductor January 3, 2017 Totally BS. Did Apple force you to use FaceTime at gunpoint? Frivolous lawsuit. January 3, 2017 at 6:32 EST PM CudaBoy January 3, 2017 Makes sense to me. People have no right to be stupid if it can harm others, and if you drive distracted you are stupid, it’s that simple. If Apple (& the Others) can control stupidity, it is their obligation but of course the Apple clone boys will argue like babies about “rights” or other fallacies (driving is a privilege, not a right) but I can’t recall ANY U.S. profit driven company ever VOLUNTARILY giving a toss about safety over profits. How many generations did it take for seat belts to be Law? Now it’s ABS,ASC,Adaptive Cruise, Lane Avoidance and Car mfgs HATE that it is mandatory of course. Tough Crap, time to pay the piper as allowing it to happen. There is only one thing you should be doing in a car and that is driving. All phones should be bricked until the Cops enforce the laws already out there re: hands free telephony. Apple should be taken to the cleaners as a bow-shot to the industry wise-up. If Mickey D’s paid millions for serving coffee HOT (!!!!) 100 million or so to the family of a dead guy courtesy of an iPhone would be fair and would mean zero to AAPL. Also, might as well look at the Cops ahead on the road that caused this thing to happen – were they liable because they could’ve taken their problem off the road?? January 3, 2017 at 7:00 EST PM Jamie January 3, 2017 Actually, cuda, people do indeed have a protected right to be ‘stupid’ whether you or I like it or not. They don’t have a protected right to automatic recompense in whatever form. I highly doubt anything will come of this case pragmatically speaking, though as noted by others, it’ll probably be a huge payday for the skeezy lawyer.

David Kravets - Jan 3, 2017 6:55 pm UTC Barry Davis reader comments 333 Share this story According to the latest figures available, US highway deaths increased by more than 10 percent year-over-year during the first half of 2016. One big reason? Distracted driving with mobile phones. It's a reality that now has one phone-maker in some unusual legal crosshairs. Further ReadingThe state(s) of texting and driving in the US Apple, maker of the ever-popular iPhone, is being sued on allegations that its FaceTime app contributed to the highway death of a 5-year-old girl named Moriah Modisette. In Denton County, Texas, on Christmas Eve 2014, a man smashed into the Modisette family's Toyota Camry as it stopped in traffic on southbound Interstate 35W. Police say that the driver was using the FaceTime application and never saw the brake lights ahead of him. In addition to the tragedy, father James, mother Bethany, and daughter Isabella all suffered non-fatal injuries during the crash two years ago. The Modisette family now wants Apple to pay damages for the mishap. The family alleges the Cupertino, California-based technology company had a duty to warn motorists against using the app and that it could have used patented technology to prohibit drivers from utilizing the app. According to the suit (PDF) filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court: Plaintiffs allege APPLE, INC.'s failure to design, manufacture, and sell the Apple iPhone 6 Plus with the patented, safer alternative design technology already available to it that would automatically lock-out or block users from utilizing APPLE, INC.'s 'FaceTime' application while driving a motor vehicle at highway speed, and failure to warn users that the product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner and/or instruct on the safe usage of this and similar applications, rendered the Apple iPhone 6 defective when it left defendant APPLE, INC's possession, and were a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs' injuries and decedent's death. The patent referenced, issued by the US patent office in April 2014, is designed to provide a "lock-out mechanism" to prevent iPhone use by drivers. The patent claims a "motion analyzer" and a "scenery analyzer" help prevent phone use. The reliability of such lock-out services, however, has come into question. "The motion analyzer can detect whether the handheld computing device is in motion beyond a predetermined threshold level. The scenery analyzer can determine whether a holder of handheld computing device is located within a safe operating area of a vehicle. And the lock-out mechanism can disable one or more functions of the handheld computing device based on output of the motion analyzer, and enable the one or more functions based on output of the scenery analyzer," according to the patent. Apple has not commented on the lawsuit, but it has said that drivers are responsible for their behavior. "For those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Airplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features," Apple said in a statement. The suit comes amid mounting reports of motorists crashing while being distracted with their phones. Such accidents take place as drivers engage in everything from playing Pokémon Go to texting. In the US, proposed solutions have popped up from the mundane (more officers watching for phone usage) to the unorthodox (Textalyzers that prevent cars from functioning; alarms that go off if a driver's hands leave the wheel for three seconds). Elsewhere, British officials are to meet with phone makers in a push for a "drive safe" phone mode in the UK. Garrett Wilhelm, the accused driver of the car that smashed into the Modisette vehicle, has been charged with manslaughter. David Kravets The senior editor for Ars Technica.

While so far, only rumors and speculations suggested the company?s Apple Watch Series 3 plans, latest reports confirm the release window. Apple Watch series 3 launch The Apple Watch series 3 will be unveiled in the third quarter of the upcoming year according to 9to5Mac.com. The website cited a report out of China Economic Daily News that Apple has chosen a manufacturer for Apple Watch 3. The report claimed Quanta Computer, the manufacturer of Apple Watch series 1 and 2, will make the Watch 3 as well. It stated the smartwatch will possibly be unveiled with iPhone 8 during Apple?s September event. Quanta, however, declined to comment on the report calling it ?market speculation.? Related:?HTC to Beat Apple in Virtual Home Button with HTC Ocean The report also narrowed down Apple?s ambitions for the Watch 3. The paper said improving the battery life is the main target of the manufacturer. This could pose problems for Apple as this means they wouldn?t be able to add more features without sacrificing battery life. Related:?Apple iPhone 8 Production to Start in March for September Release Apple Watch 3 Features The third-gen smartwatch will be the first to include major design changes after Apple failed to introduce the same in Watch series 2. Though nothing is set in stone, rumors and speculations have indicated Apple will include cellular connectivity in Watch 3. Previous patents have showed addition of eSim in the future Watch series. The Apple Watch series 3 will also get thinner and slimmer than previous iterations. An Apple patent leaked in December showed a plan to move the Watch?s vibration producing haptic motor from watch into the strap. This will free space in the body to include other sensors such cellular, heart rate, GPS etc. In addition, third-gen Apple Watch is said to switch to Micro LED displays. This will make the device even thinner while offering improved color gamut and brightness. The Apple Watch 3 is said to include camera enhancements as well as allow FaceTime calls. Of course there is need to take such reports with a grain?of salt. Apple could choose to unveil its new Watch series well before September.

Shartia Brantley reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Apple says sales of its new iPhone are on pace to beat the ten million units it sold during the first weekend of sales last year. But the company did not disclose the exact number of pre-orders it has received. Consumers in China are being credited with the positive pace of sales. This was the first time they were able to pre-order. Apple derives the bulk of its revenue from its smartphones. There is concern that increased competition may impact those sales. Reuters' Johnathan Weber. (SOUNDBITE) JOHNATHAN WEBER, REUTERS CORRESPONDENT (ENGLISH) SAYING: "You know, the big question though is whether this will be the first quarter where they might actually have lower sales than in the year prior, and, so, that's kind of the benchmark that a lot people are watching. I think, it's clear these products are going to be a success, but whether they are as successful as the last release is not clear." However, Weber says since the iPhone is so profitable, Apple can afford some margin compression from increased competition. Shares of Apple rose more than one percent. The phones will begin shipping on September 25th.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Monday January, 16, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us China Shanghai Macau Hong Kong Beijing Local News National News Business CEO Talks Profit growth key for Huawei By Ma Si | China Daily January 4, 2017, 12:05 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet Firm seeking to get bigger slice of the action from Apple in premium handset market Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's renewed focus on profits in 2017 signals a shift in its smartphone business, as the Chinese tech group seeks to outcompete Apple Inc in the premium handset sector, analysts said on Monday. The world's third-largest smartphone vendor said it will focus on boosting profits this year, as it deals with greater global economic uncertainty. "Despite our robust revenue growth, marketing costs and retail channel investments are rising too quickly," said Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei's consumers business. The consumer unit, which mainly includes smartphones, saw its sales increase 42 percent to 178 billion yuan ($25.6 billion) in 2016, Yu said. Roger Sheng, a senior hardware analyst at Gartner Inc, said the announcement indicates Huawei is no longer content with a rapid rise in smartphone shipments. "It realized there is an urgent need to prioritize profits, especially as the global smartphone market reaches saturation point and competition heats up," he added. Huawei shipped 139 million handsets in 2016, up 29 percent year-on-year. In comparison, the global smartphone market grew by just 1 percent, research firm International Data Corp estimated. According to Sheng, the Shenzhen-based company has done a good job in cracking the high-end segment. Shipments of its premium handset P9 series exceeded 10 million units within eight months. "But the costs have outpaced its revenue and gross margin growth after Huawei wrote big checks on marketing," he added. Huawei has signed Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi and US actress Scarlett Johansson as global ambassadors to promote its consumer electronics. Last year, Huawei grew rapidly in overseas markets but lost its home crown to domestic rival Oppo Electronics Corp. The firm said it would streamline its smartphone product lineup and improve supply chain management. Nicole Peng, research director at Shanghai-based consultancy Canalys, said it is difficult for Huawei to balance its revenue growth and profit growth rate in the short term, as it still needs to rely on large-scale marketing to shape its brand in foreign countries. "Our research shows that if a firm's smartphone sales exceed 10 percent share in a single market, it will have bigger say in its ties with retailers and handset parts makers. Huawei needs to work in this direction," she added.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Super Mario Run is still exclusive to the iOS platform. Nintendo has said they elected to hit Apple first thanks to piracy concerns. That will change soon, as Super Mario Run is slated to hit Android this year. When? We’re not sure. At least now we can register to be notified about its future availability. Much like what Nintendo and Apple did on iOS, Google Play is now offering a “Pre-register” button on Super Mario Run‘s official store page. Once the game drops, users who pre-register will be notified. This is a good way to set it and forget it if you plan on checking out Super Mario Run once it hits Android. Nintendo should have launched on Android on day one Maybe Apple paid to have that early exclusivity. If they did, that makes sense. If they didn’t? The piracy argument is bogus. Say Super Mario Run hits in March or April of this year. Will Android’s piracy problem magically be solved between now and then? No. Nintendo will simply continue to lose hype over time. Especially since Super Mario Run still carries a 3-star rating on the App Store. That negative word of mouth about the free-to-start then $10 charge has been a huge sticking point for detractors, and I’m not sure Nintendo will find the same initial success on Android now that the word is out. We’ll see. When Super Mario Run gets an Android release date, we’ll let you know.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Can the iPhone 8 compete with a Galaxy S8 that looks like this? Zach Epstein BGR NewsJanuary 3, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share All of our focus should be on CES 2017 this week, but a new round of reports has shifted our attention to two devices that will end up being far more popular than anything unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show, and likely more exciting as well: the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8. Apple and Samsung both have big plans for their flagship smartphones in 2017, but Apple’s plans won’t be realized for another eight months. Samsung, on the other hand, is just a few months away from debuting the next-generation flagship Galaxy phone the company hopes will make everyone forget about the Note 7 disaster — and from everything we’ve heard so far, it’s shaping up to be an impressive device, to say the least. Earlier on Tuesday, we published an extensive roundup of every solid Galaxy S8 rumor we’ve heard so far. But seeing is believing, and now it’s time to check out what Samsung’s next-generation Galaxy S handset might actually look like. Don't Miss: This rumored Galaxy S8 feature would be like nothing you’ve ever seen on an iPhone In an interesting turn of events, a number of reports suggest that this year’s huge tenth-anniversary iPhone refresh will adopt a new design similar to the one Samsung has been using for the past couple of years on its flagship smartphones. Why is that an interesting turn of events? For years, Samsung was the company that was known for ripping off anything and everything Apple did. Remember when Samsung created a step-by-step guide to show its Android engineers how to copy the iPhone pixel by pixel? Companies get inspiration from each other all the time — wink, wink — but Samsung took things to a whole new level. Fast-forward to 2017, and now rumors suggest that Apple plans to steal a signature feature from Samsung’s recent Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lineup: the iconic dual-curved edges. Samsung’s displays have outclassed Apple for years in terms of quality and technology, and the curved edges added some additional flair that couldn’t be found on any iPhone. It’s unclear at this point how accurate these reports are. If you’ll recall, rumors ahead of the iPhone 6 launch suggested the phone would sport a curved glass face, but those reports ended up referring to the barely perceptible curve of Corning’s 2.5D Gorilla Glass. Are Apple fans in store for something subtle like that from the new OLED display on the iPhone 8, or does Apple really plan to ape Samsung’s signature screen design? Whatever the case, Apple has its work cut out for it if Samsung’s Galaxy S8 ends up looking like these new concept renders. Graphic designer Veniamin Geskin has cooked up several smartphone concepts that we’ve drawn your attention to in the past. Now, he has set his sights on the Galaxy S8 once again. Using information from a number of leaks from reliable sources, Geskin has mocked up a device that could very well end up bearing a striking resemblance to the two Galaxy S8 devices Samsung unveils this coming March. Seen at the top of this post and below, Geskin’s Galaxy S8 features a screen that occupies far more of the phone’s face than Samsung has managed in the past. This is achieved in part by improving AMOLED display tech, and in part by the removal of the physical home button beneath the screen. According to recent reports, Samsung will either embed the home button’s fingerprint scanner into the Galaxy S8 display itself, as Apple is rumored to be doing on the iPhone 8, or it will move the scanner to the back of the phone. There’s no telling how accurate these mockups are, but one thing is certain: If Samsung manages to pull off this design, Apple’s iPhone 7 (and iPhone 8) will have some seriously stiff competition this year. More of Geskin’s Galaxy S8 renders can be seen below.

By Mary-Ann Russon January 3, 2017 17:34 GMT A family that lost a child in a car crash is suing Apple for failing to implement a patented feature that would have prevented drivers from being able to use the FaceTime app while at the wheeliStock A family is suing Apple for not implementing a patent that would have made it impossible for drivers to use the FaceTime app after a child was killed in a car crash in Texas. James and Bethany Modisette and their two daughters were driving along the Interstate I-35 motorway on Christmas Eve in 2014. James had slowed down due to slow-moving traffic from an earlier accident, when another car driven by Garrett Wilhelm slammed into their car at 65mph. James and his younger daughter Moriah, 5, were severely injured and had to be airlifted to hospital after emergency workers managed to extract them from the car with great difficulty, and Moriah later died from her injuries. An investigation later found that Willhelm had been speaking to someone on his iPhone 6 Plus using the pre-bundled iOS video chat app FaceTime at the time of the crash, and that the app was still running even as emergency workers struggled to remove the child and her father from their car. It might seem a bit broad to blame the iPhone maker for the accident, but in their lawsuit, the family argues that Apple is responsible because it sought a patent in December 2008 that would make it possible to "lock out" any drivers who tried to use FaceTime on an iPhone while driving an automobile. Apple patented a way to stop people using the iPhone while driving According to Courthouse News, the patent was granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office in April 2014 but it was never implemented in the app. The family argues that the injuries were sustained due to Apple's "failure to install and implement the safer, alternative design". The lawsuit explains that the patent filed by Apple described, among other things, a lock-out mechanism configured to disable one or more iPhone functions when the motion analyser picks up that the iPhone user is travelling at a speed over a set predetermined limit. The family argues that Apple provided facts relating to the risks of car accidents happening due to distracted drivers as part of supporting evidence in order to encourage the US Patent and Trademark Office to grant the patent. The facts listed in the Apple patent application, reported at the time by IBTimes UK, included statistics about the number of drivers who died from text-driving accidents, and the fact that texting while driving reduces a driver's reaction time by about 35%. The lawsuit claims that statistics like this, showed that Apple understood the risks, however it still did not implement the feature when it launched the iPhone 6 Plus in September 2014. "Plaintiffs allege that even though Apple has recognised for years prior to the accident at issue the compulsory, addictive and dangerous nature of iPhone usage by drivers, it has nevertheless voluntarily and intentionally failed to implement this technology," the lawsuit states. "At the time of the collision in question, the iPhone utilised by Wilhelm contained the necessary hardware (to be configured with software) to automatically disable or 'lock out' the ability to utilise Apple's 'FaceTime' application. However, Apple failed to configure the iPhone to automatically 'lock out' the ability to utilise 'FaceTime' while driving at highway speeds, despite having the technical capability to do so, and the knowledge that the use of the iPhone while driving at highway speeds created and unreasonable risk of harm to users and innocent bystanders." Plaintiffs claim Apple is just as responsible as the other driver The lawsuit argues that since Apple knew that there was a risk that a driver would one day use the iPhone while driving and that there was a danger of a car accident, that Apple breached its duty of care to the plaintiffs by not designing the iPhone 6 Plus' operating system to be safe, meaning that it is just as liable for the accident as Wilhelm. And even more damning, the Modisettes point out that the iPhone 6 Plus is still on sale and the same feature preventing use of the iPhone while driving still hasn't been implemented in any version of iOS despite their car accident in 2014. The family is suing Apple for general negligence, gross negligence as well as product liability. They are seeking economic damages relating to James' medical expenses as well as his and his wife's past and future loss of income due to the physical pain and mental anguish caused by Moriah's death and the accident. The Modisettes are also seeking damages for the wrongful death of Moriah and their legal costs. In November, the US road safety administration issued guidelines to smartphone manufacturers dictating that they must develop a software feature that prevents their smartphones being used while driving, after lorry driver Tomasz Kroker was found guilty of killing a woman and three children in a UK crash caused by him looking at his mobile phone.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Stop the music: Apple says 6.5 million people are now paying for its streaming music service. Speaking at a tech conference organized by the Wall Street Journal, Apple CEO Tim Cook said an additional 8.5 million people are participating in a free trial of Apple Music. Apple launched the service in June with a free three-month trial period. After that period, users pay $9.99 a month for individual subscriptions. FBR analyst Daniel Ives: SOUNDBITE: DANIEL IVES, ANALYST, FBR (ENGLISH) SPEAKING: "We view the 6.5 out of the gate as a home run number. We were expecting 5 million. There's a lot of skeptics out there who thought Apple wouldn't be able to do more than 4. This shows they can definitely become a legitimate competitor to Spotify and definitely looks like good news out of the gates for Cook and company." Apple Music is a Johnny-come-lately in the streaming music world. What sets it apart: Apple's big brand name and its music lists that are curated by humans, not computer algorithms. Analysts predicted Apple Music would have a strong following with its built-in base of iTunes users. It got a lot of users to pay up for it in a short period of time, but it still falls far shy of rival Spotify's 20 million paid subscribers.

A report from Chinese Economic Daily News via Digitimes says that Quanta will be manufacturing the ‘Apple Watch Series 3’ with a release scheduled for Fall 2017. However, the report says that Apple will solely be focusing on battery improvements rather than packing the device with any new features. This is one of the first reports so obviously it holds very little value. The Apple Watch, unlike iPhones, is manufactured in lower quantities and have less supply hurdles to jump through. The report does suggest though, that the design will resemble the original Apple Watch released in 2015, which will be a major disappointment to many. But also consider that the Apple Watch Series 2 also looked identical to its first-generation counterpart, but added new features such as GPS, a brighter display, and better waterproofing. Perhaps the Apple Watch will follow the iPad in the sense that it has a ‘timeless design.’ Aside from the original iPad, and the iPad mini/Air revamp, the iPad has largely looked the same over the years. Tags: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Series 3 About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand.

Anorak Anorak | A Chinese clickfarmer at work on her apple iPhones Menu Home News Politics Madeleine McCann Strange But True Celebs Film Music TV & Radio Fashion Tech Cars Money The Consumer Sport Flashback Photos About Home News Politics Madeleine McCann Strange But True Entertainment Celebs Film Music TV & Radio Life Fashion Tech Cars Money The Consumer Sport Flashback Photos About A Chinese clickfarmer at work on her apple iPhones by Karen Strike | 3rd, January 2017   If you’re too busy to tweet yourself, you can outsource the task and others to the woman above. She’s a clickfamer installing apps on a screen of Apple iphones. The more installs an app has the higher it ranks on Apple’s marketplace. For a $11,000 one-off payment – plus  $65,000-a-week for upkeep – you too can ensure your crappy appy hits the Top 10 of free apps. You can hire a cheat / marketeer to game the system on China’s Taobao. The original photo was tweeted on Weibo with the caption, “Hard-working App Store ranking manipulation employee.” Apple tries to prevent PC-based iPhone emulation programs (bots) made for this purpose and bans apps that use them, so manual labor is the best way to ensure the closest simulation of actual users. A search for “app store ranking manipulation” (刷榜 app store) on Taobao, China’s most popular C2C ecommerce site, reveals dozens upon dozens of vendors selling similar services. Their prices are listed as one yuan, but it’s more likely that the real negotiations take place through direct chat. Can you hire out your iPhone for the day to do this? Asking for a friend.

AP More On: apple Notorious iPhone hackers get hacked Apple Music to push into original shows and movies Tesla snags Apple exec to help run autopilot software team Apple's iPhone celebrates its 10th birthday on a low note Frustration over the minimalist design of Apple’s new MacBook Pro just got a few numbers attached to it. More than 11,000 customers have now shelled out more than $1 million on Kickstarter to buy a $69 gadget that makes Apple’s pricey flagship laptop compatible with a slew of basic accessories like TV monitors and external hard drives. That’s because the latest MacBook Pro only comes with one kind of port — the USB-C connector — versus previous models that were equipped with ports for HDMI cables, SD cards and old-school USB connectors. Apple’s obsession with making its products as thin and sleek-looking as possible — an obsession that came from founder Steve Jobs — has run into resistance in the case of the recently-released MacBook Pro. On top of its lack of useful ports, some reviewers have dismissed a new “touch bar” screen that replaces the row of function keys at the top of the keyboard as gimmicky and only semi-useful. Another complaint is that the new MacBook Pro’s battery life only clocks in at around six hours, versus eight hours for the 2015 models. The sleek-looking — yet still somewhat bulky — “Hyperdrive” adapter is the “one 2016 MacBook Pro accessory that will save you from dongle hell,” according to tech site BGR. The new gadget, whose machined-aluminum-slab body matches that of the MacBook Pro, is slated for delivery in March.

Citing market watchers, the Chinese outlet says the new wearable will feature better performance and longer battery life. The Watch is expected to be manufactured by Quanta Computer, who was responsible for building the first and second-gen models, and their focus will be improving the battery. The hardware will not likely see much change, the report added. That last detail will disappoint customers who are not happy with the current Apple Watch hardware. Since the device was first unveiled in 2014, it’s maintained the same thick, square design through what has [effectively] been 3 different models. Previous reports have suggested Apple has higher ambitions for its smartwatch. Rumors have included a  FaceTime camera, new types of health and fitness sensors, and the moving of components like the haptic feedback engine to the Watch band. Source: Economic Daily News via DigiTimes Would you be satisfied with a new Apple Watch this year that is faster and has better battery life, but looks the same? Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Everything we expect from Apple’s ‘Let us loop you in’ event on Monday Report: next iPhone to feature Tap to Wake and fast charging Twelve South’s new ActionSleeve for Apple Watch is designed for the active lifestyle Rumor: Apple seeding first iOS 10.3 beta on January 10 with new ‘Theatre’ mode Related Topics Accessories, Apple, Apple Watch, News, Report, Rumors Agneev Mukherjee Then the Apple Watch will be updated annually like the iPhone… edwilk55 Battery life lis the sole reason I’ve not bought one and will never buy one until resolved. Terrible battery life prevents them from implementing sleep tracking since it has to be charged while sleeping. That’s pathetic! Once it can go three days (or at least 2 full solid days) on a charge and if it has fast charging, I might partake. Not until. And I truly hate not having one. Newgunnerr You want to sleep with a smartwatch on? Also: my apple watch 2 EASILY goes on 2 full days 48 hours without charge edwilk55 I hear those that say it’ll go 2 days, but seems 18 hours give or take is the prevailing norm. If I’m wrong, that’s awesome. Yes, I only take my Pebble off to shower, and actually don’t have to since it’s water proof…I just don’t like drying it off. 🙂 But the watch is much smaller and thinner, so having the larger heavier Apple might not make it comfortable to wear at night. That’s a good point. Sleep tracking is important to me as it is one of the most important factors in a long healthy life as more and more studies are showing. Newgunnerr What exactly does the pebble track for sleeping? Has it improved your sleep? Because thats great. I must say I never use the apps on the smartwatch and receive like 20 notifications a day, most are off. In my case yes it easily makes it 48 hours. I wear it all day but dont use it much askep3 The Apple Watch isn’t heavy just get a light band and you’re set therealjjohnson I get 18-20 hours. I sleep in mine. I charge for about an hour or so on my desk at work or with my portable charger. I love mine honestly. Still have the first gen. If I do buy another I will opt for the stainless steel vs the sport. Elias Chao I like to track my sleeping patterns with my watch. I normally charge it when I get ready for work and when I have dinner. Dennis Von Dutch At least, sometimes more. (Watch activation: on touch or crown) 5723alex . My Apple Watch original goes for full 3 days. Battery loses 1% for 1 hour of use. JZ What exactly do you use the watch for then? There’s no way it’ll last 3 FULL days with notifications and just plain using your watch. nova12 My Nike+ battery life is great. Been up and active 6.5 hours today and it’s at 91%. burge You are aware that fast charging kills battery’s. The slower the charge the long the battery last before the next charge and the longer it’s lasts before it needs replacing. Rowan09 Exactly. Tony I’m not seeing a reason for an extremely minor update like this. Unless they release new colorways or something to go with a battery update this won’t do much in the market place. Battery life on the Apple Watch isn’t as bad as reviewers make it to be. I can go 3 days with no charge and that includes having it on overnight. Granted I don’t use my Apple Watch to play games on and I make sure from midnight till 6am that I receive zero notifications on the device. No reason to get any at that time as I should be sleeping. Lots of good tracking applications are available and I’m sure at some point Apple will make one themselves that can track sleeping habits. nova12 Definitely and update I’ll skip. Love my Nike+ model — it’s fast and the battery life is great. Diego Milano One watch every year? Ha, another reason why I’m not buying this. george My gear s2 classic goes 2 days with always on display and 3.5 without. I never got full 48 hours on an apple watch. n0ahcruz3 I would love an apple watch but 24hrs just wont cut it for me atleast 3 days for me to get me to buy 1. I opted for a charge 2 which last me 1 week battery life. It’s enough for my wearable needs mainly track workouts, steps, HR, text/call notifications and of course tell time and date lol. I hate charging multiple devices every night. Rowan09 Even the first Apple Watch lasted more than 24hrs and the new one is much better on battery life. n0ahcruz3 More than 24hrs still wont cut it for me, atleast 3 days minimum of heavy usage will get me to buy one. A price tag of $249 and 3 days battery life and im totally in. If apple decide on that price and able to achieve that battery life, Apple watch sales will sky rocket. Rowan09 Sorry but no smart watch with these type of features will last that long with heavy usage. That price tag is way too low for this type of watch I mean a Garmin GPS watch with just color display cost $249. Apple would have to sell 2 times as much at that price point. n0ahcruz3 Samsung’s latest smartwatch able to achieve 4 days usage according to their website how come apple cant or wont achieve that? I run workout alot i dont play games(who even plays games on their smart watches lol Rowan09 I use it all day and run 4 times a week and when I’m not running I use it for my workouts. I don’t own the Samsung new watch so I can’t speak for it, but the one my wife has doesn’t last more than 1 and a half days. I’m on day 2 my Apple Watch without a charge and it’s on 74% and I went out for a run today and had it on the whole day. Apple gives a number for usage with playing games (I agree who plays games on a watch but hey), just like they under rate the water resistance ability of the IPhone 7/7+ Rowan09 My Apple Watch Nike + lasts 3 days easy without a charge. I don’t play games on my watch like some others may do. Shlomy Malka Yep battery is the main issue but I saw that apple will come with wireless charge and that will be the game changer.

I recently got mine and I love it. For me the killer feature would be ultra fast charging.

As we do not provide these concessions to other companies in the sector, there is no question of extending it to them,” the official told reporters on Tuesday. Apple’s application for exemption from domestic sourcing norms was rejected by the Finance Ministry last year. However, after the government tweaked FDI rules, the company has applied afresh seeking concessions. “Apple’s application for exemption from domestic sourcing norms was rejected under the earlier FDI rules which were more relaxed than the revised rules. The company is being too optimistic to imagine that it would get greater concessions this time round,” another official said. While earlier, companies that qualified as manufacturing products with “cutting-edge’’ technology qualified for a blanket exemption from the compulsory 30 per cent domestic sourcing rule, under the revised rules the relaxation is available for three years. Officials from the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), commerce, revenue, environment and forest and electronics and information technology (DeitY) are expected to formally examine Apple’s fresh proposal later this month.

Rob Pegoraro, Special for USA TODAY 10:55 a.m. ET Jan. 3, 2017 The basic bargain of so-called freemium pricing: The money a minority of avid users pay for extra features underwrites a limited, free version of the service for everybody else. (Photo: iStockphoto) Many of the free apps you’re setting up on new gadgets will soon ask for your money. That’s the basic bargain of so-called freemium pricing: The money a minority of avid users pay for extra features underwrites a limited, free version of the service for everybody else. Getting a useful service without paying is great, but not if thumb wrestling with its free tier’s limits becomes a burden. Here’s how to consider the freemium propositions of two popular services: Evernote: The obvious hangup with this note-taking app’s free offering is a two-device limit. The $34.99/year Plus plan abolishes that and ups your monthly data-transfer quota to 1 GB, but you can get free multi-device note-taking with Microsoft’s OneNote or Google Keep. Apple’s Notes is an option too -- but you’d better be married to Apple’s hardware to rely on it. If you’ve spent years in Evernote, bringing over those notes may constrain your choice. I, however, still use the even-pricier Evernote Premium. That $69.99/year version’s ability to scan somebody’s business card and fill in blanks from their LinkedIn profile has yet to be matched by OneNote, even though Microsoft now owns LinkedIn. iCloud: Apple’s cloud-storage service is easy to start using and easy to outgrow -- iPhone or iPad backups can fill up 5 GB quickly. Extra storage costs less than before, starting at 50 GB for $11.88 a year, but you can also give iCloud a break by letting another service backup photos. Google Photos offers unlimited storage of slightly-compressed images and impressively smart automatic categorization of them, while Yahoo’s Flickr gives one terabyte of free, uncompressed storage. Both work on Android devices too; USA TODAY’s Jefferson Graham found Google the best photo-backup option last year.(Disclosure: I write for Yahoo Finance but have no say in Flickr.)  For moving files between computers, Microsoft’s OneDrive (5 GB free) and Google Drive (15 GB free) can both relieve iCloud while also allowing Web access to your documents; Dropbox’s 2 GB of free storage is feeble in comparison. Still bothered by paying for a once-free app? If you haven’t already, treat this as an invitation to chip away at telecom costs by buying a cable modem instead of renting it, then replacing a rented cable box on a secondary TV with an antenna or streaming-media player.

According to the file, the accident happened on Christmas eve in 2014, when James and Bethany Modisette were driving on a highway in Texas with their two daughters Moriah and Isabella. Meanwhile, Garrett Wilhelm was driving behind the Modisettes, failed to stop his car, ramming into the family's vehicle at 105 km/h. Everyone but Moriah survived the crash. Furthermore, Wilhelm reportedly told the police that he was indeed using FaceTime while he was on the road, and that the app was still running when the incident finally happened. The issue at hand concerns Apple's patent filed back in 2008, which proposed to lock users out of the app while they are driving. It was later issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office in April 2014. However, it has not been integrated into the app up to this day. With this in consideration, the Modisettes are now seeking damages from Apple for its "wrongful failure" to install and implement the feature which could possibly make driving safer. Wilhelm is now facing a jury trial regarding manslaughter charges, which is due this February. Apple has not yet given out any official statement regarding the incident. Back in April 2016, a similar car accident was recorded, this time involving the app Snapchat. A "speed filter" was used by one of the involved people while driving at 107 miles per hour, which caused her to ram right through another vehicle, causing brain injuries for the victim.

While the risk of Sierra PDF data loss later turned out to be more limited than initially feared, Fujitsu’s compatibility warning was just the beginning of PDF-related issues for Apple’s latest Mac operating system, issues that actually seem to be getting worse with the recent macOS Sierra 10.12.2 update. Sierra PDF Bugs: Blame It On iOS As noted by TidBITS publisher Adam Engst, Apple’s attempts to create a common foundation for PDF viewing and editing between macOS and iOS have resulted in a number of problems in Sierra, to the point that developers of third party software now recommend users avoid Apple’s own Preview app in order to minimize the risk of data loss. According to Christian Grunenberg, lead developer of veteran Mac app DEVONthink, the problem stems from Apple’s premature release of its rewritten PDFKit API, a release which both eliminated some existing features and broke compatibility on others, causing issues for a range of third party apps. Apple wants to use a common foundation for both iOS and macOS. However, it was released way too early, and for the first time (at least in my experience) Apple deprecated several features without caring about compatibility. And to make things worse, lots of former features are now broken or not implemented at all, meaning that we had to add lots of workarounds or implement stuff on our own. And there’s still work left to be done. “Sloppy Code and Indifference” While Sierra PDF woes have existed since the operating system’s initial launch, the most troubling aspect for both users and developers is that the situation seems to be getting worse. Jon Ashwell, developer of the Bookends bibliography app, reports that macOS Sierra 10.12.2 is “a disaster” in terms of PDF compatibility, causing crashes whenever a user opens a PDF containing annotations. Mr. Ashwell and other developers have attempted to resolve the issue with Apple by submitting bug reports and other information, but claim that the company has remained mostly silent. “I’ve never seen such a sorry case of sloppy code and indifference from Apple,” Mr. Ashwell told TidBITS. The relatively good news for some Sierra users is that the issues appear to be limited to apps relying on PDFKit; apps using other PDF libraries, such as Smile Software’s PDFPen, seem to be unaffected at this time. But this apparent immunity only applies if the user steers completely clear of Preview and other PDFKit-reliant apps. If the user, or anyone the user shares their PDFs with, edits the documents in Preview or other PDFKit apps, issues like the loss of an OCR layer or corruption of the document itself may occur. As a safeguard against these problems, users should create copies of their PDFs to ensure that the original document is preserved in the event that the document is inadvertently edited in an app like Preview. The next Sierra update, 10.12.3, is currently being tested, but there is as yet no confirmation that Apple has corrected these issues.

What FUD artist wrote this headline? Is this CNET or Mac Observer? January 3, 2017 at 10:23 EST AM Jim Tanous January 3, 2017 “Rotting Apples”? What FUD artist wrote this headline? Is this CNET or Mac Observer? This is a major, data loss-causing bug that has not only persisted in Sierra for over 3 months, but is actually getting worse. Something sure is rotten, and it’s stinking up the place. January 3, 2017 at 10:26 EST AM d'monder January 3, 2017 “I’ve never seen such a sorry case of sloppy code and indifference from Apple” “We Don’t Care. We Don’t Have to. We’re the Phone Company.” Hopefully that kind of rot isn’t spreading across the company. Apple, you HAVE GOT to get PDFs right. Mission critical, especially within your own apps and system APIs. January 3, 2017 at 11:30 EST AM FCompton January 3, 2017 My experience with Preview has been somewhat spotty; it seems to have problems with a number of pdfs that pass through my system. I general find an alternate PDF view to read them because of this; and I’m not even on Sierra yet. “We Don’t Care. We Don’t Have to. We’re the Phone Company.” Scary how similar Apple is becoming to the old phone company. It is beginning to disturb me that they are having to verbally reassure people that they are not ignoring the Mac and their core software (sort of like listening to a politician), but I’m more interested in seeing results that than receiving their sincere reassurances. Oh, and Phil, you want to revisit that statement about innovation at Apple, yet? Apparently all Apple has any competence for these days are useless social media features on phones and watches. Sorry about the negativity; I’m grumpy this morning. January 3, 2017 at 11:58 EST AM Kira Kinski January 3, 2017 This cannot be true. Apple states that it has great desktops in its roadmap; thus, that sentiment should extend to the OS that runs its Macs as well. Ergo, and I repeat, this cannot be true. /sarcasm intended/ All I have to say about Apple today and its love affair with iOS and the consumer space is Fsck You. I’m really jaded with Apple’s indifference to the needs and wants of prosumers, power users, and professionals who champion the Mac platform. I supported Apple from its inception, even through lean times when it was unfashionable to work with the Mac. And this is what Apple gives its most influential and fervent supporters in return for decades of staunch loyalty? Each generation of software and hardware for the Mac platform gets less flexible, dumbed down, and worse. Apple should spin off the Mac platform to those who understand what a PERSONAL computer is, and wants to create the very best user experience in that space. You know, like Apple did under Steve Jobs. Though Jobs also liked a closed box, he still catered to those who wanted the greatest power and flexibility, and were willing to pay a premium for hardware that was upgradeable and expandable. He got it. And he drove the personal computer revolution. Trucks and all. Also, I must apologize for my negativity. I’m getting to the point of no return with Apple. And my anger is driven by extreme disappointment and sorrow. January 3, 2017 at 1:59 EST PM Rick Hyman January 3, 2017 Jonn Ashwell developer of Bookends said,”I’ve never seen such a sorry case of sloppy code and indifference from Apple” Unfortunately, we *do* have a history of this in the past few years. I think specifically of the terrible TextKit Apple introduced with iOS 7. In prior versions, TextKit was built on top of WebKit, which draws web content. Yes, logic says it should have been the other way around. The first iteration of TextKit in iOS 7 did not cause data loss, but severe text display issues. Various discussion lists are full of developer comments indicating all sorts of work-arounds to text that would disappear or not wrap correctly, and so on, and on. Developers spent weeks on their apps just trying to figure out what little bits of code to add to minimize problems for their users. Code often had lines like “If iOS >= 7 then do these stupid things that shouldn’t be necessary.” iOS 8 fixed some trivial issues, and broke others. iOS 9 began to fix the worst issues, and by iOS 10 many major issues were fixed. But, not all. Developers found that their fixes for iOS 7, 8 caused problems in iOS 10 if not 9. So, they again scrambled to take out the code that sorta fixed the issues in 7 with statements, such as “If iOS >= 7 and iOS < 9, then do these stupid things that shouldn't be necessary." It looks like Apple has performed the same poor coding in Sierra with respect to PDFKit. As with the TextKit problems, developers submit bugs, and Apple refuses to admit there are any issues. And, I expect a few years could pass before issues are resolved. January 3, 2017 at 2:59 EST PM pnielan January 4, 2017 PDFs are often archival documents resulting from scans of paper documents. They are as irreplaceable as photos in many cases. Applications (PREVIEW) and code that CORRUPT PDF documents are not acceptable. The fixes should be the highest priority at Apple and take weeks, not years. January 4, 2017 at 3:37 EST AM TheMikester January 4, 2017 Kira, I too feel quite negative about Apple’s direction. So I understand and I don’t think any apology on your part is warranted. If Apple thinks that the iPhone community of users would be anywhere near as loyal as us long time Mac customers then I think they are in for a rude awakening some day. The sad thing is that Apple is a publicly traded company and will continue to focus on the high profit areas until profits dip enough to warrant a change in direction. My point is with all of the money Apple has they should not relegate the Mac to second class citizen. They have enough resources to make both the iPhone and the Mac first class. If Apple can spend that much money building a building (aka spaceship) like they are then they have enough to keep both platform advocates happy. I like both platforms but I must agree that the Mac platform has been dumbed down and continues to be and the quality of software is just subpar. Even little things are being taken away such as the ability to format text in Messages (formerly iChat) such as bolding. Why? Was it causing a problem? I think it was just easier for them — what the customer wants didn’t matter. Maybe few used it — the truth is I rarely used it but it was very useful when I wanted to use it. Would it really have cost Apple a lot to leave that ability there? If (and that’s a big if) the discussion ever came up about removing it some person probably just said that’s what emoji’s are for and then dropped it because it was easy for them. The Mac and the iPhone are different platforms with different strengths and forcing them to have the exact same features limits one or both platforms. Different platforms will always have different strengths why remove those strengths in an effort to make it more like a different platform? If Apple is successful in making them identical then I will only buy one not both — have they ever thought about that? Not only will I only buy one but I will buy a competing brand of the other platform so that I regain the strengths that Apple removed. Once I switch one of the platforms I’m using switching the other one becomes much more likely at some future point.

Its so slow and taking up a lot of memory, freezing up my laptop and system has run out of application memory. I’ve freed up some space and deleted some files but no luck. Apple is really good at messing things up when they do a software upgrade. January 5, 2017 at 1:39 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

According to the news agency, supplier data suggests that Apple will cut iPhone production by about 10 percent in the January through March quarter this year. While this announcement led to idiotic headlines from the likes of sites like Engadget, the alleged production cut may be relatively good news compared to reductions for the iPhone 6s the company made in the same quarter last year. The Nikkei report cites “sluggish sales” as the primary reason for the cut in iPhone production, but Patently Apple points out that the timing of the cuts is logical given the typical lull in consumer spending following the holiday quarter. More significant, however, is that Apple was forced to make a much larger 30 percent cut in iPhone production during the first quarter of 2016. While the company responded to that steep cut by carefully limiting initial iPhone 7 production out of the gate, the alleged 10 percent reduction this quarter is not terrible in comparison. Gag Order Apple, as expected, declined to comment on the reports, but with good reason. Rather than keeping silent to avoid the harsh truth, Apple is currently in the SEC mandated “quiet period” — the period of time from when a company files a statement with the SEC until the agency declares the statement effective — which greatly limits what Apple can say about sales figures and financial performance. For a clearer picture of iPhone sales, we’ll have to wait until Apple’s Q1 earnings call, which is typically held near the end of this month. There’s no doubt that the days of explosive iPhone growth are gone, and that Apple is increasingly reliant on upgraders rather than the acquisition of new customers in order to maintain momentum, but a 10 percent post-holiday production cut is far from the death knell that many are suggesting.

Never put reasoning or facts behind anything they see. Only that it must be an Apple crash or explosion and the death of Apple. Record quarter is probably what will be announced by Apple because they adjust manufacturing all the time. And typically after the holidays is a slow period for everyone not just Apple. But like I said before, facts and reasoning are not what investors and anal-ists look at first. January 3, 2017 at 12:35 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Citing the Economic Daily News, DigiTimes claims that Quanta Computer, the Taiwanese firm currently manufacturing the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watch models, will again receive the contract for the presumed “Series 3” iteration of the device. The Apple Watch 3 is expected to keep the same design without the addition of new sensors or major features. Instead, Apple will focus on battery life which, while better in the Series 2, still has room for improvement. The inclusion of other features, such as cellular connectivity which could potentially eliminate the requirement of a paired iPhone, is unknown. Should Apple release a third-gen Apple Watch without design changes, the move would mirror the company’s approach to the iPhone, which also appears to now be on a three-year design cycle rather than the two-year pattern which persisted until the iPhone 6. Maintaining the same design would also allow existing Apple Watch owners to easily migrate their bands, some of which cost more than the Watch itself, to the new model. Quanta declined to comment on the rumor, calling it simply “market speculation.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple Watch One Comment Add a comment Lee Dronick January 3, 2017 Maintaining the same design would also allow existing Apple Watch owners to easily migrate their bands, some of which cost more than the Watch itself, to the new model.

View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When I decided the time had come to spend a lot of money on a shiny new MacBook Pro, I was tempted to get all the expense out of the way at once and upgrade displays at the same time. The problem is finding someone to take my money … I currently use an Apple Thunderbolt Display in my home office, and with the simple addition of a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter was able to continue doing so. It’s a great display for its time, but is showing its age a little. The screen is non-Retina and doesn’t compete with the brightness and color range of the 2016 MacBook Pro. The bezels also look rather large by today’s standards. The display Apple would like me to buy as a replacement is the LG 5K UltraFine, but I have to say that it’s not really grabbing me … Sure, it’s a great display in some ways. First, it’s 5K. It would normally be used in 2560×1440 mode – offering a Retina version of my existing Thunderbolt display – but is capable of 5120×2880, meaning you could potentially edit a 4K video while viewing it at full resolution. Second, it offers a single-cable connection to the 2016 MacBook Pro, carrying power, display, sound and USB connectivity. That makes for an extremely neat setup that is particularly appealing to someone who hates visible cables. Third, the display quality is close to – if not actually matching – that of the new MacBook Pro. As my colleague Jeff Benjamin said in his hands-on video review: The most compelling thing about this display, of course, is its screen […] It’s capable of delivering the same amount of on-screen real estate as the Thunderbolt Display, but it’s Retina-enabled, which makes it a whole lot easier on the eyes […] The 27-inch glossy IPS display provides wide viewing angles and supports P3 wide color support just like the new MacBook Pro, along with panels that feature 500 nits of brightness. Unlike its smaller 4K brethren, the 5K display is also 10-bit, which will be great for serious video editing, photo editing, and color grading. However, he did say that the display quality wasn’t quite up there with that of the MacBook Pro itself, and his review definitely qualifies as mixed. For my own part, the LG display disappoints me in several ways … First, and this may be shallow, but it isn’t going to win any design awards. I’m quite unashamed to say that one of the reasons I buy Apple kit is that I like visually pleasing designs. That was part of why I bought Apple’s own Thunderbolt Display last time around. There were cheaper alternatives – including models using the same display panel – but I was going to be spending many hours a day staring at it, and I wanted something pleasing to the eye. LG’s 5K UltraFine display isn’t exactly ugly, but nobody is going to think Jony Ive had anything to do with designing it. There’s no anodised aluminum or glass surround in sight; what we get instead is black plastic. Decent-quality plastic, admittedly, but plastic all the same. Second, and related to this, the build quality appears notably inferior to the monitor I already own. Jeff found that the display wobbled on its stand, and the angle adjustments ‘aren’t as smooth as they were on the Thunderbolt Display.’ Sorry, Apple and LG, but if you are jointly launching a brand new monitor in 2016, you could at least make the build quality as good as the one you launched back in 2011. Third, if I’m paying for more pixels, I’d like to be able to use them. Making the monitor a Retina-standard display improves the look, sure, but I’d honestly rather have a larger display with a somewhat lower pixel density. In an age where TVs are all 40-50 inches and up, a 27-inch display is starting to feel a little on the small size. A 5K display – or a 4K one, for that matter, ought to still look stunningly good in a 32-inch or 34-inch size. Even at Apple’s introductory pricing, I’d still be laying out almost a thousand bucks to get a display that’s the same size as the one I have, and with the same apparent resolution. I’m pretty loathe to do that. Not do I want two smaller displays, with bezels breaking up the center of the screen, so a pair of the 4K models wouldn’t do it for me either. Finally, screen quality aside, the tech isn’t spectacularly good. Again from Jeff’s review: Unfortunately, the display is quite anemic when it comes to additional ports, and this is where it fails to live up to the comparatively generous Thunderbolt Display. Outside of the one Thunderbolt port, which is used to connect your 2016 MacBook Pro, LG only provides three downstream USB-C ports, and these ports are USB 3.1 (gen 1) only, which means a maximum bandwidth of 5Gbps. That’s right, there are no USB-A ports, no SD Card slot, and the USB-C ports are glorified USB 3.0 ports. Now, as Jeff notes, there may be good reason for this. To get from 4K to 5K, it seems LG had to employ some technical trickery which saturated most of the available bandwidth. But I’d far rather have a 4K display with downstream Thunderbolt 3 ports than a 5K display without them. It seems LG and Apple may have been prioritising that impressive-sounding 5K number over the actual usability of the display. So for all these reasons, slightly tempted as I am by the quality of the display panel itself, I don’t think I’ll be buying one. At the very least, I’ll be giving it until close to the introductory pricing deadline at the end of March to see what else comes along. So what would I ideally like? Here’s my wishlist: Apple-standard aesthetics, which ideally means anodized aluminum Probably 4K rather than 5K, to leave more available bandwidth for connectivity Either 32- or 34-inch size, ideally curved Bezels as thin as possible, consistent with an HD webcam Single-cable connection to my 15-inch MacBook Pro, including 85W power delivery At least one Thunderbolt 3 port for downstream connectivity One item on that list might appear gimmicky: the ‘ideally curved’ display. But I don’t think it is. I’m on record as describing curved TVs as a pointless gimmick. They theoretically deliver a perfect image to just one person, and that one person would need to be sitting way closer to the screen than would ever be the case in reality – while everyone else gets a compromised view. But curved, large-screen monitors make sense to me. Unlike a TV, there is just one person viewing, and they are sitting close to it. By gently curving the monitor, you can deliver a more consistent image across the full width of the screen, rather than the (admittedly small) drop-offs in quality you get while viewing the edges of a large monitor from a central position. I’m not insistent on the curved part: it’s a nice-to-have rather than an essential criteria, but as I’m composing a wishlist for a product that doesn’t yet appear to exist, I may as well throw it in there. We should see quite a few new displays launched at CES, and maybe one of them will be the one I’m seeking. I’ll be keeping my eyes open, but if you spot one which seems to fit the bill, do let me know in the comments. Bear in mind the 4K requirement, though: there are a lot of lower-resolution monitors out there, and I now view 4K as an entry requirement.

Communication, information, gaming, productivity, entertainment, you name it, and computing devices take care of pretty much every need seamlessly. As we embark on a new journey in 2017, some existing trends will evolve to keep up with natural progression, while some new products will attempt to redefine evolution. We take a look at some developments that are expected to stand out this year.  Nintendo’s forthcoming game console, called the Switch, has a hybrid design—essentially a tablet with two detachable controllers that can be docked on either side. These can be used individually too. In addition, the Switch can be docked to your TV, for the big-screen gaming experience. It is expected to be launched in some countries by March; there is no word on when it will arrive here. Tesla model 3 and affordable green cars Elon Musk’s plan of dominating the global mobility circuit rely on the Tesla Model 3. Priced at $35,000 (around Rs37 lakh), this all-electric sedan has a driving range of 215 miles (around 346km) on battery. Production will start in mid-2017. In India, the Union government’s National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (Nemm) offers benefits on green cars, to make them more affordable. Carmakers such as Maruti and Toyota will enhance their range of hybrid cars banking on Nemm, while manufacturers such as Hyundai are expected to use hybrid technology in launches in 2017.  Apple iPad Vs Windows convertibles Apple is expected to add a third iPad Pro to the line-up, which means we will now have three options: 9.7 inches, 12.9 inches, and the new 10.9 inches. There will be more powerful hardware, assisted by new software. This will put it in a good position against rivals such as Microsoft Surface, which is also expected to get a refresh this year, and the plethora of other Windows 10 convertibles. This ties in with Apple’s focus on pushing the iPad Pro as a productivity device that will also be relevant for the enterprise market.  A real Facebook Facebook is a virtual home for 1.8 billion people globally. In 2016, its news feed faced allegations about bias, and sometimes fake news would trend ahead of real news. Now, Facebook has announced that it is working with third-party fact-checking agencies, operating under Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Code of Principles. Genuinely smart Android watch Google will be releasing an update for the wearable platform, Android Wear, this year. And it couldn’t come any sooner. The new software will hopefully streamline the Android Wear platform, apps and options, and make the entire package more intuitive. Android Wear seemed dated once Apple released the new watchOS in 2016. Many a capable smartwatch, such as the Fossil Q Marshal and the Asus ZenWatch 2, suffered because of the poor software. Cord cutting to your new TV Netflix, Hotstar, Voot and, now, Amazon Prime Video—these are just some examples of how the way we look at TV is going to change in 2017. With faster 3G and 4G mobile data connections, and improved wired broadband connections for homes, India will finally be coming to terms with a world beyond cable and DTH connections. The advantage is that you will get the content you want, and when you want. No delays, no schedules, and no missed episodes. Personal assistants, at your service Personalized assistants such as Haptik (available for Android and iOS) will do pretty much everything for you—set reminders, make dinner reservations, recharge your phone, book a cab, even call repair services. Another example, Wishup (available for Android and iOS), is a premium personal assistant and has different subscription packages (starting from Rs10,500 per month). Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2019, 20% of all user interactions with their smartphones will be conducted via virtual personal assistants. Digital economy, on our phones The demonetization move has forced a shift towards digital transactions. Overnight, mobile wallets such as Paytm, MobiKwik and Freecharge have gained traction. These allow users to link their credit and debit cards or bank accounts to the mobile wallet, and pay bills digitally. This year, thanks to government policies, “your phone as your wallet” will be more real than ever before.  Vishal Mathur Topics: Nintendo Switch Game Console Tesla Green Cars Apple iPad More From Livemint READ MORE Why the rhetoric of caste vs development in UP polls rings hollow Nintendo takes big gamble with Switch’s split personality Believing in India’s solar mission takes a leap of faith First Published: Tue, Jan 03 2017. 08 24 PM IST Editor's Picks Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?

Photo: Bloomberg Apple Inc. is unlikely to receive any special concession from the Indian government to manufacture its iPhones in the country. Offering the Cupertino, US-based company the tax incentives it has sought would mean discriminating against other phone manufacturers that have already set up plants in India, a commerce ministry official said on condition of anonymity. “Apple is asking for concessions that others are not asking. We have to follow the rule book. Otherwise, anybody can stand up and say why only Apple and why not others,” the official added. An Apple spokesperson did not respond to emailed queries. ALSO READ | Apple seeks lower taxes for making iPhones in India The official said Apple has sought tax concessions, a conducive ecosystem and exemption from local procurement norms. The Times of India reported on 30 December that Apple plans to make iPhones for the Indian market in Bengaluru through Wistron, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer that is setting up a facility in Peenya, the city’s industrial hub. The official cited above said Apple was looking for an exit from China and should set up manufacturing units in India without seeking concessions in return. This is Apple’s second bid to enter India after failing to get a waiver in local sourcing norms for opening branded stores in India. ALSO READ | Apple partner Wistron seeks to expand India smartphone parts plant: official Last year, the government relaxed rules governing foreign investment in so-called single brand retail for companies bringing what it called “state-of-the-art and cutting-edge” technology. After initially signalling that it had agreed to Apple’s proposal, it changed its mind, saying what constitutes state-of-the-art needs to be defined first. The official cited above said there has not been any progress on that front so far. India is becoming important to Apple. Its sales in the country crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2015, according to results filed with the registrar of companies. Apple currently sells its products in India through exclusive reselling arrangements with chains such as Imagine and iStore (owned by Reliance Digital). In 2012, Apple India changed its sales model by appointing retail distributors and began advertising. Since then, its sales have been rising at double-digit rates and the top management of Apple has acknowledged the importance of Indian operations several times during analyst calls. Still, Apple has a minuscule market share of under 2% in India’s smartphone market compared with South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, the leader in India’s smartphone market, which has a share of 21%. In the last two years, many electronic manufacturers have establishing units in India. In August 2015, China’s Lenovo Group Ltd started assembling smartphones at its facility in Chennai run by Singapore-based contract manufacturer Flextronics International. In July 2015, Karbonn Mobile India Pvt. Ltd set up a 150,000 sq. ft plant in Noida in partnership with Water World Technology Co. Ltd. In the first half of 2015 Xiaomi Corp. and InFocus partnered Foxconn Technology Group and started manufacturing devices at the latter’s Andhra Pradesh facility. In September 2015, Chinese smartphone vendor Gionee tied up with Foxconn and Dixon Technologies (India) Pvt. Ltd to manufacture mobile devices.

But delivering more hours could be tricky. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | January 3, 2017 -- 15:47 GMT (07:47 PST) | Topic: Apple Apple Watch Series 2 According to a report in a Chinese newspaper, the contract for manufacturing the third-generation Apple Watch has gone to Quanta Computer, and the focus will be on the device's biggest weakness -- its battery life. Must read: 2016 -- Apple's year of ups and downs CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage According to a report by Chinese-language Economic Daily News, as reported by DigiTimes, the next-generation Apple Watch will feature better performance and longer battery life. According to Apple, the current crop of Apple Watches offer around 18 hours of battery life, which means a nightly recharge. But a nightly recharge not only limits the use of the device as a sleep monitor, but it also increases the risk that it's forgotten one morning, ending up in a drawer. But battery life is always a juggling act for any manufacturer. Consumers want more and more features -- for the Apple Watch the list would be topped by a FaceTime camera and standalone cellular capability -- but every new feature puts additional pressure on battery life. But regardless of whether or not Apple is working on improving battery life for the Apple Watch, it could be a while before we see an updated version of the device. The original Apple Watch was released in April of 2015, but the Series 2 units debuted September 2016. This means that we're looking at the third quarter of 2017 at the earliest, but that could stretch out to the first half of 2018. Which means it could be a long time before we see any potential Apple Watch battery improvements become reality. Turn your Apple Watch or iPod touch into...

Stock Gained 11% in 2016 Here's what happened -- and why the stock price has a good chance of rising further in 2017. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 3, 2017 at 10:26AM What happened Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finished 2016 strong, gaining about 5.8%. The nice increase toward the end of the year helped the stock clock a 10.9% rise during the year, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. While the increase is notable, investors should put the move into perspective by considering that the S&P 500 increased by about the same amount during this period. Image source: Apple. So what Apple's gain for the year didn't come without some volatility. In May, the stock had fallen about 12.5% as investors considered the implications of the company's falling revenue and earnings per share. Concern particularly mounted after Apple reported its fiscal second-quarter results in April, highlighting a 13% year-over-year decline in revenue and an 18% year-over-year decline in earnings per share. Investors also questioned the company's ability to grow revenue and EPS from current levels. But as the year went on, signs that Apple's iPhone 7 launch may be faring well, optimism about the company's 2017 iPhone launch, and Samsung's Note 7 recall all gave investors reasons to be more optimistic -- not to mention Apple's conservative stock price, which arguably already prices in business growth headwinds. Now what Going into 2017, the best thing Apple stock has going for it is its valuation. The stock trades with a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14. This compares to the average 25 P/E of stocks in the S&P 500. While it's impossible to speculate where the stock will go in 2017, Apple stock looks compelling with a valuation like this.

 Apple could build iPhones in India by end of 2017 BI Intelligence Jan. 3, 2017, 10:45 AM 1,978 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Samsung’s share of the high-end smartphone market may be starting to slip Emerging markets are finally catching up on 4G smartphones MESSAGING APPS FOR PUBLISHERS REPORT: Why chat apps are now crucial for publishers This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Apple could begin making iPhones in India as soon as the end of 2017, according to Ubergizmo. The speculation is based on reports that Apple supplier Wistron is preparing an iPhone assembly line in Bengaluru. Making phones in India could drastically reduce the cost of iPhones for consumers in the country, which, due to a 12.5% import tax, has some of the highest markups on the devices in the world. This could help boost sales of the iPhone in India, the second-largest smartphone market in the world.  This strategy is likely partly driven by the fact that Apple’s growth in developed markets has flatlined. Apple reported declining iPhone sales year-over-year (YoY) in the US and Greater China during Q3 2016, driving overall iPhone sales to decline 5%. However, iPhone sales saw YoY growth in Latin America, India, and South Asia in the quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook swore a return to growth in 2017, and may be focusing on that latter set of markets to do so. And while there’s potential to capture new audiences in emerging markets like India, Apple's sky-high iPhone prices don’t align with cost-conscious consumers who make up the large majority of the population in these regions. About 80% of smartphones sold in India cost less than $150, according to Bloomberg, and half cost less than $120. Meanwhile, the average selling price (ASP) of an iPhone in Q3 was $618. Even Apple’s lowest-cost phones are too expensive for most consumers in markets like India and Indonesia. Apple may be attempting to establish a presence and build name recognition in these markets early, before the middle class sees a surge in growth. A similar shift is what enabled Apple to succeed in China, which has added over 43 million citizens to the middle class from 2000 to 2015, to total 109 million. India had about 23 million adults in its middle class in 2015, out of a total population of 1.25 billion. The global smartphone market is expected to slow considerably over the next few years. Despite a record-setting holiday quarter, 2015 was likely the last year of double-digit growth for smartphone shipments. Mature markets were at the heart of this year’s deceleration. Adoption has reached new highs in key markets in the United States, Europe, and China. The pool of first-time buyers in these countries is shrinking rapidly, and sales are now primarily coming from phone upgrades. Meanwhile, emerging markets will continue to see robust shipment growth. India and Indonesia, in particular, will help fuel a large share of the shipments growth within the global smartphone market over the next few years. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on smartphones by country that forecasts the market through 2021 to reflect slower, stabilizing growth in the long term. Here are some key points from the report: The global smartphone market is still growing at a steady pace due to more widespread adoption in emerging markets. We estimate the global market will hit about 2.1 billion units shipped in 2021. Shipments growth over the past few years has been driven by the falling price of smartphones, which has made handsets more accessible in emerging markets. The average selling price of a smartphone in India nearly halved between 2010 and 2015. With relatively low smartphone penetration, we forecast Indian smartphone shipments to grow rapidly over the next five years. Nevertheless, India has a long way to go before it surpasses China as the world’s leading market for smart handsets. India is estimated to account for roughly 10% of the global smartphone market in 2016, considerably less than China’s 30% share. The global platform wars are over, even as smartphone adoption continues to rise across various markets worldwide. Android and iOS are estimated to account for 97.3% of global platform market share in 2015, compared to 96.3% last year. Apple closed the year with another strong quarter on the back of its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus launches. Still, the vendor saw a slight decline in YoY growth of its share of the market in the face of stiff competition from Samsung and Chinese vendors such as Huawei.

Apple Apple to give free Beats Solo3 headphones with Macs and iPhones in select markets By Sohil Nikam - Jan 3, 2017 People from a select list of Asian countries will soon be able to benefit from a promotion under which Apple will be offering free Beats Solo3 wireless headphones with Mac or iPhone purchases for one day. This is apparently a celebration of the Chinese New Year, and the offer will only be valid on January 6. Countries eligible for this freebie are China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. It will be given to anyone who buys an iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s or an iPhone 6s Plus. As for Macs, the offer extends to all models of the iMac, the MacBook, the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air and the Mac Pro. For some reason though, the 2016 MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar is not eligible. This is a pretty big deal because the Apple Beats Solo3 wireless headphones cost around $300 normally. Equipped with Class 1 Bluetooth technology, these can stay connected to your Apple Watch, iPad and Mac at the same time. They moreover, boast of more than 40 hours of battery life, while they also feature a fast charging technology that helps them gain 3 hours of juice in just 5 minutes. Also Read: Apple partner Wistron seeks India plant expansion for iPhone manufacture The Beats Solo3 also come with on-ear controls and dual beam-forming mics that allow you to take your calls without touching your iPhone. Thanks to this, you can even activate Siri with the ‘Hey Siri’ command. To refresh, January 6 is the date on which the Beats Solo3 promotion for Mac and iPhone purchases will take place in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan.

Investors also questioned the company's ability to grow revenue and EPS from current levels. But as the year went on, signs that Apple's iPhone 7 launch may be faring well, optimism about the company's 2017 iPhone launch, and Samsung's Note 7 recall all gave investors reasons to be more optimistic -- not to mention Apple's conservative stock price, which arguably already prices in business growth headwinds. Now what Going into 2017, the best thing Apple stock has going for it is its valuation. The stock trades with a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14. This compares to the average 25 P/E of stocks in the S&P 500. While it's impossible to speculate where the stock will go in 2017, Apple stock looks compelling with a valuation like this.

The image comes from an anonymous source via All About Windows Phone. The lone image shows a Galaxy S8 connected to a monitor with an Android symbol hovering between the two. The smartphone screen is mirrored in a tab on the monitor, and there is even an app launcher similar to Windows. There is also a wireless keyboard and mouse. The slide has an accompanying text ?Samsung Desktop Experience,? which is what the company will call this feature. The leaked details are similar to Microsoft?s Windows Continuum which scales the mobile OS on Windows phone to a PC like when connected to a monitor.

Following the Note 7 debacle, such productivity oriented features turn the tables in the company?s favor. Of course, this leak needs to be taken with a grain?of salt as nothing is official so far. Galaxy S8 follows Apple iPhone Samsung is planning to wow consumers with their 2017 flagship and will follow some of Apple?s moves. Samsung blog SamMobile reported that its upcoming device will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack for a thinner design. In addition, the report says the Galaxy S8 will feature a USB Type-C port.

The latest jailbreaking tool dubbed Yalu iOS 10.1.1 debuted last week during Christmas. It is, however, still in beta mode and riddled with several problems. Todesco?s half baked tool has several users waiting to unlock the full potential of their Apple devices. iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak Update The infamous Italian hacker promised to release iOS 10.1.1 jailbreak update following several complaints. Several users experienced problems with their Safari and other Apple apps. Others were unable to jailbreak their devices at all. As promised, Todesco is back with iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak Beta 4 update. The Yalu Beta 4 JB tool comes with Substrate and stability fixes according to TravelersToday.com. Still in beta mode, the jailbreak is riddled with several unknown bugs and problems. However, compared to the first version, this one has lesser issues and better stability. Related:?Apple iOS 10.3 Developers Beta Releasing This Month; Users to Finally Get ‘Dark Mode’ In addtion, iOS 10.1.1. jailbreak beta 4 version doesn?t support any new device yet and is only limited to 64-bit devices. Similar to the first version of the jailbreak, it is semi-tethered. It means the users need to jailbreak their device every time the iOS reboots. Todesco has even issued a fair warning to iOS Jailbreak enthusiasts. He said the Yalu iOS 10 Jailbreak is really designed for developers and prone to setback and mistakes. This can result in the iOS being restored to the original thereby?making the jailbreak tool useless. Related:?HTC to Beat Apple in Virtual Home Button with HTC Ocean iOS 10.2 Jailbreak Meanwhile, the larger jailbreak community is waiting for a fully tethered iOS 10.2 Jailbreak. Since Apple rolled out iOS 10.2 many are already on the latest iOS and unable to rollback to take advantage of the Yalu Jailbreak. With iOS 10.3 about to drop as beta a few days from now on January 10, many feel this is the?perfect window for a 10.2 Jailbreak. German security researcher, Stefan Esser, recently teased on Twitter that the iOS 10.2 jaibreak tool will roll out soon. He stated users unable to access Tedesco’s Yalu jailbreak need not worry because?he will release the iOS 10.2 Jailbreak tool. If this proves true, it will be the first time that two jailbreaks will roll out side by side. Critics, however, aren?t impressed yet. They say Esser is simply stirring the jailbreak community given the jailbreak being not compatible with older versions of iPhone. In addition, there are also no updates of iOS 10.2 jailbreak from Team Pangu.

 11,000 people bought an adapter to give the new MacBook Pro the same features as the last one Kif Leswing Jan. 3, 2017, 9:50 AM 28,059 facebook linkedin twitter email print An add-on adapter on Kickstarter is promising to fix the new MacBook's biggest problem. Apple's latest MacBook Pro has only one kind of port, which uses the new USB-C connector, as opposed to older MacBook Pros, which had options to plug in HDMI cables, SD cards, and other useful attachments. Now companies are selling adapters that add back all the ports that some Apple users think the company should've included in the first place. Some are really popular — a Kickstarter advertising a MacBook Pro adapter has sold over 11,000 adapters, raising more than $1 million. HyperDrive backers will receive their dongle, which starts at $69, in March. Here it is: 2015 MacBook Pro and 2016 MacBook Pro with HyperDrive. "Regain virtually all ports from the previous MacBook Pro model," the advertisement promises. HyperDrive HyperDrive isn't the only company making an adapter or dock to add ports to the MacBook Pro. People who received a new Apple laptop for the holidays have several various USB-C dock options, some as inexpensive as $25 and some selling for over $200. But HyperDrive has some nice touches that could make it a good choice — it uses both USB-C ports for more bandwidth, includes an HDMI port to make it easy to hook your laptop up to a TV, and uses an aluminum finish that matches your new MacBook. The premium laptop accessory even fits in your pocket: HyperDrive And it seems like thousands of new MacBook owners believe it's a necessary accessory.

Windows 7 and Lion on Sierra Parallels Desktop. (Daniel Rasmus Image) For many years, Apple’s OS X (now macOS) met Windows in various dual-boot options that usually swapped out the Apple OS by running or sharing the Intel chip at the heart of the Mac. The root-level support for running Windows or other operating systems atop Apple’s hardware isn’t always convenient. Sometimes it would be nice to just run Windows, Linux or Chrome OS inside the macOS environment. The best way to quell that desire comes from Bellevue, Wash.-based Parallels, which, in its tenth year in the Seattle region, shipped Parallels Desktop 12 this fall. Parallels Desktop 12 supports several use cases, most notably that of legacy application support and multi-platform development. While these two very different scenarios describe the edges of Parallels Desktop 12’s intended use, it also just runs Windows apps with considerable elegance and good performance. Initiating the ‘Unvirtualized’ Windows 10 on a Mac. (Daniel Rasmus Image) For those not familiar with Parallels Desktop, running Windows on Mac represents the product’s most prevalent use case. People working outside of large corporations may be surprised by how much of the world continues to run on old software — some supported, some not. If a financial application relies on an old Windows NT or other legacy framework that doesn’t run on Windows 10, let alone on macOS, the choice comes down to investing in new software and the associated implementation costs, or keeping old hardware in play, or using a virtualization solution. Parallels is also a great alternative to a second machine for those who need a Windows app to complement their normally Macintosh-centric work experience. But Parallels goes well beyond Windows 10 cozying up to macOS. It also allows people to run a number of other operating systems, for a variety of reasons. Parallels virtual machines can run almost any operating system, even those that are no longer supported (as long as you have a CD and license key). Running mission-critical apps doesn’t provide value if you can’t count on them to be there when needed. Parallels works closely with Apple, Microsoft and the open source community to ensure that Parallels Desktop will not only run their operating systems, but that they run relatively fast in a very stable environment. On of Parallels 12’s best new features is the tight integration with operating system images, and access to trials. While Microsoft has ceased support for Windows 7 and Windows 8, that doesn’t mean people have stopped using them. Parallels offers a Microsoft-authorized wizard for downloading developer-specific images. Parallels should be thought of as the virtual machine that makes running most operating systems possible within Apple’s Macintosh platform. For most developers, virtualizing target platforms might just be their dream environment. A developer’s dream In an era of multiple browsers and emergent operating systems, developers need banks of machines, or hordes of USB sticks, so they can boot into an environment and ensure that their latest web wonder performs as well on Ubuntu Firefox as it does on Windows 7 with IE or Windows 10 with Edge. And then there’s the maintenance of those machines. With Parallels the disk images don’t experience memory glitches, hard drive failures or coffee in the keyboard beyond the main machine. The real jewel here comes in the form of near-epic flexibility. Pre-configured virtual machines can be instantly downloaded. These include Chromium OS, Ubuntu, Fedora Linux, CentOS Linux, Debian GNU/Linux and a macOS VM using the recovery partition. And then there is Windows. Parallels has worked closely with neighbor Microsoft to offer 60-day evaluations of virtual machines that include the Universal Windows Platform tools. This includes: Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation Visual Studio 2015 Community Update 2 Windows developer SDK and tools Windows IoT Core SDK and Raspberry Pi 2 Windows IoT Core project templates Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET Widows Bridge for iOS Windows UWP samples Widows Bridget for iOS samples Of course, installing older versions of Windows also works, which provides the ability to test for legacy environments like IE across several versions, including IE 6 on Windows XP. Parallels even includes a network conditioner with settings for various network types, including Wi-Fi, 3G, and even a bad network. Developers can run as many virtual machines as they have memory to hold, and can store as many types of virtual machines as they have disk. Virtual machines work just fine from external drives which means a 6TB USB 3.0 drive can hold a wide variety of OS types, all quickly available through the Parallels Control Center. Forgetting About Windows Anybody more interested in running Windows apps than in running Windows itself should consider turning on Coherence. This feature completely blends Windows with the macOS. Seamlessly and seemingly magically, Windows apps run in their own windows, without the Windows desktop. Clipboard data flows from macOS apps to Windows apps. A well-configured Parallels setup also shares peripherals and Bluetooth devices. With Parallels Desktop 12, new icons join the menu bar, including network configurations, sound, battery and notifications. And apps installed on Windows can be added to the launcher, the desktop or launched from a function-click on the virtual machine’s image in the dock, which brings up the full Windows Start menu. And in Coherence mode, Cortana will respond just as on Windows. If Siri can’t provide the right answer in macOS Sierra, then just ask Cortana. This configuration, and its smooth operation, demonstrates the detail with which Parallels approaches their work. No other application demonstrates such an intricate internal knowledge of the two operating systems. It’s the kind of work computer owners deserve — the kind of work that can’t be delivered by the OS makers based on their heady competition, not to mention antitrust laws. Parallels delivers the best of all worlds on any well-outfitted Mac. Performance Speaking of configuration, don’t expect Quad Core i7 performance, but don’t expect performance to be sluggish just because you’re running a virtual machine. You can’t run many high-end games, but some will run just fine in Parallels Desktop, like Overwatch from Blizzard. As with most apps, the performance experience relates to the hardware configuration of the host machine. A fast disk (such as SSD) and more memory make for better performance, from app launching to app response. Playing Overwatch in Windows 10 with Parallels Desktop 12. (Daniel Rasmus Image) Parallels has learned from its years in the market, including its learning in automation, such as the “one-click” tuning that optimizes a virtual machine based on its use, such as gaming, design or development. The hidden surprise for Mac aficionados Parallels did their developers a solid. Instead of insisting on just developing the company’s core platform, they asked their team what kind of Mac utilities they would like to see, and then challenged them to build those utilities. The result arrived as the delightful Parallels Toolbox that covers, with a click or two, many functions that take a few too many clicks or keyboard taps even in Apple’s UI. Mini apps include ejecting volumes, hiding the desktop and downloading a video from almost any site without streaming protected content. I just recently rebuilt my Mac after a hard drive crash (nope, fully backed up, just wanted a fresh install). Parallels Toolbox helped me avoid looking for many old utilities by wrapping key features into a neat and accessible package. Parallels Desktop also comes with a Parallels Access license that allows mobile devices to run Windows or Mac apps on tablets and mobile phones. Unlike tools that simply bring a Mac or Windows display into the mobile environment, Parallels delivers app-like interfaces to common tools like Word or Excel, creating very pleasant writing or analysis environments that don’t require squinting or squeezing in order to see sentences or cells. The Parallels Access UIs for desktop apps offer a great alternative to the not so-full-featured iOS versions. What to buy Parallels Desktop comes in three editions: Desktop 12 for Mac, Pro and Business.  Pro increases virtual RAM support up to 64GB, and Business adds on centralized administration and management, along with a unified volume license key. Pro and Business both include a Visual Studio plug-in. For limited personal use, the basic Desktop 12 will likely suffice. Developers will need Pro, and as implied by the name, if the tools are to be deployed in an enterprise setting, Business should be considered. A full comparison of features can be found here. Pricing varies from a one-time fee of $79.99 for Parallels Desktop 12 download and perpetual use license for that version, or a $79 subscription that must be renewed annually. Subscriptions include the remote access component. $99.99 a year subscriptions are available for Pro and Business Editions. Volume licenses, as well as student editions are also available. Bottom line Parallels Desktop for Mac offers two very different value propositions. On one hand, the application offers support for legacy apps that just can’t, won’t or simply don’t migrate to a modern operating environment. A wide variety of these apps still exist in enterprises around the world, and in boxes and drawers in individual homes. But the real power of Parallels Desktop isn’t looking backward at legacy applications, it is looking forward to tomorrow’s cross platform applications that require an array of hardware for testing and development. With Parallels and a big and beefy Mac, developers need only one box to develop and test across various versions of Windows, MacOS (and previous OS X versions) and the plethora of Linux implementations. At $99.99 a year for business and pro users, the service is reasonably priced, especially when the bundled Access and Toolbox features are considered. The $79.99 version for individuals is an even better deal. Daniel W. Rasmus is the founder and principal analyst at Serious Insights.

The good news is that a new report suggests Apple’s next-generation Apple Watch, presumably called the Apple Watch Series 3, is on track for a release at some point in the third quarter this year. Better yet, the new Apple Watch model will feature big improvements in two key areas that are still pain points for some users. The bad news, however, is that it looks like you’re out of luck if you were hoping to see a big hardware redesign this year, or even any exciting new hardware features. Don't Miss: This rumored Galaxy S8 feature would be like nothing you’ve ever seen on an iPhone Citing a report in the print edition of Chinese-language trade publication Economic Daily News, Digitimes reports that Apple’s upcoming new Apple Watch Series 3 model is on track to be released in the third quarter. It’s unclear exactly when Apple plans to unveil the next-generation Watch model, or exactly when it will launch. If Apple stays true to form and mirrors the past, however, we can likely expect the third-generation Apple Watch to be released in mid-September alongside the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 7s. Where design and features are concerned, that’s when the good news and the bad news comes into play. Apple is reportedly focusing on improving the Apple Watch in two key areas that users will certainly appreciate: performance and battery life. Performance can always be improved on any device, but the Apple Watch is in particular need of a speed boost. Despite the huge improvements between the original Watch and the Series 2 model, many apps are still slow to launch and even slower to refresh. Battery life is an interesting area for Apple to focus on. As it stands now, the Apple Watch Series 2 can easily last for two to three days of typical usage before needing to be recharged. For a device that is designed to be charged overnight while you sleep, some would argue that battery life is already more than adequate. A focus on Apple Watch Series 3 battery life, as the report suggests, may indicate that some new features are in the works that could be a bigger drain on the device’s battery. Will that be enough to offset any potential disappointment if the Apple Watch Series 3 reuses the same overall design? That remains to be seen.

Apple Inc. succeeded to deliver luxury products and especially lead the market of smartphones. This is why it comes as a surprise for its fans the fact that iPhone production will face a reduction plan at the beginning of 2017. The news was delivered by a Nikkei report. According to their conclusions based on this year’s performance of their suppliers, this decision comes naturally given the circumstances. Apple headquarters from Cupertino has gathered too many goods during the last part of 2015. This situation led to a product surplus. There were many iPhone 6S models lying around in their warehouses. As a consequence, the tech giant had to cut the output by 30%. This operation unraveled between January and March in 2016. Moreover, Apple applied the same procedure for their iPhone 7. The cutout this time only amounted to 20%. Even though iPhone 7 was introduced in the market as early as the month of September, the sales were still weak. As a comparison, during last year  in the fourth fiscal quarter, the company managed to sell 48.01 million units. However, this year there were 45.51 million sold copies of iPhones. The difference was noticeable scoring a rate of 5%. This situation urged the Nikkei report to give no other conclusion than there should be an imminent downsize of production of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models with the effective date at the beginning of the year. However, this piece of news was no wonder for the company. The new 2017 measures were within expectations. Ming-Chi Kuo was one of the analysts who already suspected a reduction of iPhone production back in November. Moreover, he also identified some of the causes that triggered this situation. First of all, the Chinese demand was already showing signs of heading down. Moreover, the 4.7 inches iPhones could only facilitate a slow volume of shipment while Apple will not launch a new product in 2Q17. To make up for the reduction of iPhone production, Apple redirects its attention towards India. The company already opened new headquarters in Hyderabad and facilitated the Indian economy with around 640,000 jobs. The tech giant will negotiate with the Industry Ministry to decrease the import and manufacturing duties. This way, Apple will find in India better conditions for iPhone manufacturing.

And 2017 figures to introduce us to even more advances, as smartphone makers jockey to position their phone as the must-have handset of the year. But which phones figure to grab headlines with impressive new features, bold new looks and other innovations that have us rethinking what we can do with our mobile devices? We'll have to wait until we get our hands on these new — and in many cases, rumored — handsets to be sure, but for now, here are the smartphones that have us looking forward to 2017. (Credit: iPhone 8 concept video by iPhoneConcepts/YouTube) iPhone 8 (Fall 2017) Picture 2 of 13 The iPhone 7 had barely hit retail shelves before people started talking about what Apple might have in store for its next iPhone. And it's no wonder: while we were impressed by the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, they still looked an awful lot like the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus that preceded them. And 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, suggesting Apple might be working on something big for its next smartphone. But what exactly could that be? The most popular rumors focus on the iPhone's display. Apple could replace the LCD screen with an OLED panel that provides more saturated colors and better contrast. The screen could also stretch from edge to edge (just like the Xiaomi Mi Mix) with the fingerprint sensor going under the phone's glass. Shortages in OLED screens may force Apple to introduce just one phone with these high-end features, though, while rolling out more modest upgrades to its 4.7- and 5.5-inch phones. (Image Credit: iPhone 8 Concept by Venjamin Geskin/YouTube) MORE: iPhone 8 Rumor Round-Up Samsung Galaxy S8 (April 2017) Picture 3 of 13 After releasing, recalling, re-releasing and finally removing the Note 7 from the market last year, Samsung is understandably cautious about its next major phone release. Instead of a launch at Mobile World Congress in late February, Samsung will reportedly push the Galaxy S8's debut back to April. When it does arrive, expect a digital assistant to be one of the major additions to the latest Galaxy phone. Last year, Samsung bought Viv Labs, which was cofounded by one of Siri's creators, and Samsung has all but confirmed that AI-enabled features will figure into its next major phone. The latest rumor suggests that this digital assistant, which will reportedly be called Bixby, will integrate with nearly every built-in app on the Galaxy S8, in a way that Samsung's S Voice voice control feature never really did. Some bad news, though: the Galaxy S8 may follow the iPhone 7's lead and drop its headphone jack. (Image Credit: Mobile Fun's Olixar Ultra-Thin Samsung Galaxy S8 Edge Case) MORE: Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumors: What Features to Expect LG G6 (February 2017) Picture 4 of 13 It looks like LG is leaving behind the modular design it introduced with 2016's LG G5 (pictured here with its camera add-on), at least if a Wall Street Journal report is accurate. LG has confirmed one thing about its next phone: it will feature almost bezel-less 5.7-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio and 2880 x 1440 resolution. That will maximize the amount of screen space featured on the front of the phone, making it easier to pull off dual-screen multitasking. LG may be trying to get the jump on Samsung by having the G6 hit the market in late February or early March, ahead of the Galaxy S8's rumored April launch. MORE: LG G6 Rumors Galaxy Note 8 (August 2017) Picture 5 of 13 It apparently will take more than a product recall and halted sales to put a stop to the Galaxy Note lineup. A report out of Korea says that Samsung plans to come out with a new version of its big-screen phone since the Note has proven too popular even after battery troubles caused last year's Note 7 to overheat and explode in some cases. Details about the Note's return to the market are scarce at the moment, but BusinessKorea says the revived phablet could feature a 4K display, compatibility with Samsung's GearVR headset and the same digital assistant features rumored for the Galaxy S8. That same report suggests the Note 8 will arrive in August, which is the same time frame when Samsung has released its phablet in recent years. (Image: The Galaxy Note 7 in happier times) HTC U Ultra (March 2017) Picture 6 of 13 With Siri on the iPhone and Bixby reportedly slated for the Galaxy S8, on-board digital assistants figure to be the must-have smartphone feature in 2017. Add HTC's U Ultra and its Sense Companion feature to that mix. HTC says the AI-powered assistant will offer personalized recommendations that help you manage your life — alerting you about changing weather conditions when you're about to take a trip, for example, or noting traffic jams when you're going to leave the house. Sense Companion may be the marquee feature on the $749 U Ultra, but it's not the only noteworthy thing about the phone, which sports a curved glass back and is missing a headphone jack. The 5.7-inch phone offers 2560 x 1440 resolution, features a 12-megapixel rear camera, and runs on a Snapdragon 821 processor. MORE: More on HTC U Ultra Specs and Availability Microsoft Surface Phone (Unknown) Picture 7 of 13 Talk about your phone of mystery. We don't have a release date, spec sheet or even official confirmation that Microsoft is working on a new device — just some comments from Microsoft executives in recent years, including CEO Satya Nadella, that the company was working on the "ultimate mobile device." But the news that ARM support is coming to Windows 10 this year has some Microsoft watchers hoping for Snapdragon-powered phones that run Windows and make use of Microsoft's Continuum feature that let phones act as PC replacements. Rumored release dates for the mythical Microsoft phone range from April 2017 to later this fall. (Credit: Surface Phone Concepts tweeted by Evan Blass/@EvLeaks) MORE: Microsoft Surface Phone Rumors: What You Can Expect Honor 6X (Available for order now) Picture 8 of 13 It's not every day a $249 phone finds itself in the company of the next iPhone and Galaxy handsets. But consider some of the standout features found in the budget-friendly Honor 6X. It includes a dual rear camera that lets you adjust the focus on the shots you take with the 12- and 2-megapixel shooters on the back of Huawei's latest low-priced smartphone. The phone also sports a fingerprint sensor and a 3340 mAh battery, which Huawei says will give you two days of battery life. All told, the Honor 6X looks like a pretty compelling budget buy and is another instance where high-end features are finding their way to lower-priced phones. MORE: Hands-on with the Honor 6X ZTE Blade V8 Pro (Available for order now) Picture 9 of 13 We could be in for quite the fight on the mid-tier phone front, as ZTE is countering Huawei's $249 Honor X smartphone with a low-price dual rear camera phone of its own — and for $20 less. The $229 ZTE Blade V8 Pro features a pair of 13-megapixel camers, one an RGB lens and the other a monochrome one. That lets you apply a number of cool effects to your photos. The Blade V8 Pro offers some other specs you don't typically see in midrange phones such as a programmable fingerprint sensor and a 3140 mAh that promises to give you enough juice to make it through the day without needing a recharge. The 5.5-inch full HD display includes a 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3 screen as well. MORE: ZTE Blade V8 Pro Hands-on ZenFone AR (Second Quarter, 2017) Picture 10 of 13 Get ready for a completely new reality. Not only will the ZenFone AR support Google's Daydream platform for virtual reality, it will also tap into Project Tango. That's another Google platform, this one for augmented reality, that uses onboard sensors and cameras to determine your position in a room and project virtual images into the real world. ZenFone AR will be the first phone to support those technologies at the same time. As you might imagine, some serious horsepower will be needed to blend VR and AR on this 5.7-inch phone. The ZenFone AR will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 CPU with 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU. Asus hasn't set a price yet. MORE: Zenfone AR Hands-on ZenFone 3 Zoom (February 2017) Picture 11 of 13 The phone hits keep on coming from Asus with this photographically-focused smartphone. The ZenFone 3 Zoom (no price announced yet) offers dual rear cameras — a 12-megapixel, f/1.7 aperture 25mm wide-angle lens, complemented by a 12-megapixel 56mm shooter that offers 2.3x optical zoom. Asus says you should get fast, crisp shots in low light, thanks to the phone's SuperPixel technology. The Zoom should also be able to take photos of fast-moving objects with its TriTech+ autofocus system. If you're more of a selfie fan, the 13-megapixel camera up front should take crystal clear self portraits. And a staggering 5000 mAh battery means you could capture 4K video for more than four days before you run out juice. Unnamed Blackberry Phone (Spring 2017) Picture 12 of 13 We don't know much about the specs of the next BlackBerry phone to be built by TCL Communication, which bought the global rights to the BlackBerry brand last year. But we certainly know what the phone looks like after TCL showed off the design at CES this year. It's a look that recalls the glory days of the BlackBerry lineup, right down to the QWERTY keyboard. That spacebar doubles as a finger printer sensor and the keys double as a capacitive touchpad, meaning you can scroll just by dragging your finger across the keys. TCL says it will reveal more details about the phone at Mobile World Congress in late February.

Here Are 3 Opportunities For You. By the end of 2016, all major players jumped on the home-control voice AI bandwagon. Will controlling the car be the next front? Here are the hurdles, and the opportunities. By Yoram Solomon Dr. Yoram Solomon is a creativity and innovation speaker and the author of Un-Kill Creativity: How Corporate America Can Out-Innovate Startups. Solomon has published five books and many articles, and was named one of the top 40 innovation bloggers for 2015 (No. 12). He is a former professor of technology and industry forecasting at the University of Texas at Dallas, and a National Speakers Association member. He holds nine patents and many innovation awards, and was named “TI’s great innovator.” In 2015, he was elected to the Plano Independent School District board. @yoram Founder, Large Scale Creativity@yoram WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It seems that the voice-operated home automation became the new front that all major players had to play in. Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and even Facebook have all introduced their respective products without delay. When I worked on my MBA program in 1999, I tried using Nuance's Dragon Naturally Speaking voice-to-text software. For its current products, the company claims 99% accuracy. At the time, they claimed approximately 90%. While 90% reliability seems high, ask yourself this: would it be OK if one in ten commercial flights crashes? Obviously, not. Neither was 90% accuracy in understanding what I said back in 1999. It was a pain to dictate to my computer, using a somewhat not so natural voice and cadence, and then manually correct what the system understood. So I abandoned it. Voice recognition and voice-to-text systems are much more difficult to implement for many reasons, but the main one remains that the mechanism in our brain that understands speech is very complex, and uses very complicated context (not just the sentence, but a familiarity with the speaker, as well). Bottom line, it takes a lot of processing power, storage capacity, and fast storage access to come anywhere near the human ability to understand speech. Apple's Siri was perhaps the biggest leap in that direction, with a system that was so much more natural and accurate than anything available for a personal computer, and on an even smaller platform--your mobile phone! How can your mobile phone all of a sudden have the processing power, storage capacity, and storage access speed to perform that well? It's simple--it doesn't. Siri "resides" in a massive computing center at Apple's facilities. That's where the processing is done. So when you "talk" to Siri, your voice is minimally analyzed, and then sent to the Apple servers in the cloud, who perform the "heavy lifting" of understanding what you want, and send the response back to you via your phone. It gets better in your home. Through local connectivity such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or ZigBee (or even IoT connectivity through the cloud) your Siri-like device (Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa, and now Facebook's Jarvis) can communicate with other devices at your home and control them. So what about your car? Somehow, my 2010 BMW understood me better than my 2015 Jeep. Maybe it liked me more... Both cars came equipped with voice recognition. Somehow, in 4-out-of-5 attempts, whenever I said "call home" to my Jeep, it tried doing something else, from editing my phonebook, to calling towing assistance, to calling "David" (for the life of me, I could never understand how "David" sounds like "Home"). It frustrated me so much that I had to cancel my home phone line. OK, that wasn't the reason, but still... The problem. One problem with speech recognition in the car as it is implemented today is that the processing power available for Siri through the cloud is not available to the car, which has to rely on local processing resources, which are orders of magnitude more limited, because they are not equipped with a high-speed, low-latency data connection like phones do, unless it is actually through the phone (hint...). Another problem is that the microphone in the car doesn't hear what we hear. Unfortunately, sometimes it hears more. Much more... It hears the driving sounds more than we do. If the A/C fan happens to blow in the microphone's general direction, it will almost hear nothing else, while we hardly hear that fan at all. The Solutions (and the opportunities). One obvious solution is to use what's already built into your phone. The phone already has the wireless link to the powerful voice-processing center in the cloud. It can understand you better than any car can with its limited local processing resources. However, the location of the microphone is going to be critical. You may leave the phone in your pocket, and it will "hear" nothing. You can put it on the dashboard, and it will "hear" the A/C fan, or other noises. Opportunity 1: embedded car microphones that can filter noise, and communicate to your phone (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB, or any other method). Another problem is in controlling the car from your phone. This problem is two-fold. There must be a standard protocol that allows controlling elements of the car (such as climate, seats, radio, navigation, etc.) from your phone. Any phone. Opportunity 2: develop such a standard. You would likely have to do it through a standard-developing organization. The other issue is that car (and car electronics) manufacturers may become more "commoditized" while the main stage is taken by the phone. This reduces some of the differentiation that car manufacturers enjoy today with their unique control systems. That's a business issue. Not a technical one. Another solution is to create a dedicated, high-speed, low-latency wireless network especially for cars. I will not even entertain this option as an opportunity, as never have I seen evidence where building a new infrastructure, especially alongside an existing one that can serve similar requirements, was successful. Opportunity 3: embed cellular data access in the car as a standard, and then allow you to choose which speech-recognition cloud server you want to connect to (Siri, Google, Jarvis, Alexa, etc.), who would offer car-control applications, running in your car (and the cloud), rather than your phone. While easier to implement, this would hurt car manufacturer differentiation the same way as interfacing the phone to control the car. Which brings Opportunity 4: The car manufacturers developing their own cloud-based voice recognition and car control centers. This leaves only one question--with the growing use of autonomous cars, at what point will we trust voice AI to take driving instructions? After all, if I say "Drive Home," I really don't want my car to take me to "David." Any David... Like this column? Sign up to subscribe to email alerts and you'll never miss a post.

The problem was later identified as a bug in the PDFKit framework in macOS 10.12. Take Control of Preview co-author Adam Engst (via Daring Fireball), says that although Apple applied fixes in 10.12.1, it has reintroduced bugs in 10.12.2 – to the extent that he now advises against using Preview for PDF editing at all for now … It pains me to say this, speaking as the co-author of Take Control of Preview, but I have to recommend that Sierra users avoid using Preview to edit PDF documents until Apple fixes these bugs. If editing a PDF in Preview in unavoidable, be sure to work only on a copy of the file and retain the original in case editing introduces corruption of any sort. Smile’s PDFpen is the obvious alternative for PDF manipulation of all sorts (and for documentation, we have Take Control of PDFpen 8 too), although Adobe’s Acrobat DC is also an option, albeit an expensive one. The problem, claims developer Christian Grunenberg, is that Apple rushed things in its desire to more closely integrate iOS and macOS. Apple wants to use a common foundation for both iOS and macOS. However, it was released way too early, and for the first time (at least in my experience) Apple deprecated several features without caring about compatibility. And to make things worse, lots of former features are now broken or not implemented at all, meaning that we had to add lots of workarounds or implement stuff on our own. And there’s still work left to be done. In particular, 10.12.2 appears to kill the optical character recognition layer in PDFs – so if you are scanning PDFs with OCR to make them searchable, editing a document deletes the text. Posts on the Apple Developer Forums are also complaining of other bugs in PDF handling.

The Cupertino-based company debuted the app in 2010, when the iPhone 4 was reigning supreme. Now, however, we turn our attention to FaceTime for a sensible matter: distracted driving. On Christmas Eve of 2014, the Modisette family were driving a Toyota Camry on a highway near Dallas when police activity prompted them to slow down. According to a suit filed on December 23, 2016, another driver struck the Modisette’s family car at full highway speed (65 mph) from behind, causing extensive damage to the Toyota sedan. It should be noted that the distracted driver who crashed his 4Runner SUV into the rear of the Camry sedan was using FaceTime at the time the crash occurred. And a crash that led to the death of a 5-year-old child is no laughing matter. Having lost their daughter on that damned Christmas Eve, what remains of the Modisette family wants justice to be served in court. James and Bethany Modisette want Apple to be held accountable for encouraging distracted driving. From the lawsuit attached below as a PDF, the Modisette family highlights that Apple had filed a patent for “lock-out” feature for FaceTime in instances such as when driving. It should be underlined that smartphone apps such as Waze ship with this kind of feature. The patent was granted in 2014 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, yet the Cupertino stronghold did not update the app with the lock-out feature for devices such as the iPhone 6 Plus the distracted driver was using. According to Courthouse News, “Apple’s failure to either program a shutoff into the FaceTime program or give strong warning about using the app while driving is particularly egregious given the app fully engages visual components rather than audio ones as with regular cellphone usage.” Fair enough, if I may say. Represented by Jeffrey Simon of Simon Greenstone Panatier Bartlett, the Modisettes seek economic damages and punitive damages from Apple.  Download attachment: Modisette vs. Apple lawsuit over FaceTime "Lock-Out" Feature (PDF) Apple FaceTime crash Texas Toyota Camry toyota 4runner Toyota   Why “Special Edition” Cars Aren't Usually Worth Your Money Your Guide To Tires: What Kind Should You Get For Your Car autoevolution Visits the 2016 Ocean Reef Vintage Weekend A Story about Expensive Car Warranties and Respect How to Buy a Used Car Online If You Live In The USA In Six Steps Best Five Automobiles For Winter Camping Trips in the U.S. This Winter Was 2016 The Year of Electric Cars or Autonomous Ones?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Internet Reddit Enhancement Suite has had enough of Safari! Here's why they might pull the plug Reddit developer trashes Apple for its arduous review process for extensions Sami Khan   January 3, 2017 18:51 IST apple macbook, res for safari, res for safari shutdown,Reuters Apple's exacting review process for listing apps and extensions in its app store has been criticised by developers in the past. In a blog published on Medium, Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES) developer has expressed his first-hand experience with Apple and its sapping review process for extensions. RES developer is strongly considering to pull the plug on its extension for Safari. Browser extensions are tools that simplify user's browsing experience by adding a button to the toolbar. RES is available on all major browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge. Due to the tedious process involved in reviewing RES extension for Safari, users might see the end of it on Apple's browser. The developer points out that listing the RES extension on Safari's gallery costs $100 a year, while other browsers charge nothing. In addition to the fee, RES developer says Apple's review process is "disorganised, arduous and quite frankly insulting." Developer @stevewsop noted that RES was rejected multiple times for unsound reasons. According to a detailed blog on Medium, which talks about everything that's wrong with Apple's review process and the high maintenance for Safari, he says it isn't worth the effort, time and money to list RES on Apple's Mac App Store. "To develop a Safari extension may eventually require Xcode, rather than whatever editor a developer prefers to use. Furthermore, it will no longer just be Javascript, CSS and HTML — it'll require the use of either Objective C or Swift for at least part of the application," Steve noted in his blog. With such challenges, RES team is left with two options: discontinue RES support for Safari or keep working on it and charge it on app store to make up for the costs involved. Steve noted that a decision hasn't been made yet, but the team is keeping an ear to the ground. The decision comes at a point where the RES team must renew its $100 license to continue support for Safari.  Related Some popular Windows OSes will not support Mozilla Firefox web browser in 2017 Vivaldi founder Jon von Tetzchner on why Vivaldi is your next browser UCWeb launches revamped UC Browser with focus on entertainment and news Also read This startup wants you to excel at the latest technology, in your leisure time: Interview The gadget that lets you kiss your long-distance lover, but not the way you'd imagine Post Comment IBT TV Close Vodafone Foundation helps save mothers’ and children’s lives in one of the world’s worst HIV hotspots Why advertise with us?

Credit: CES More like this CES 2017: The PCs, gadgets, and gear we can't wait to see What to expect from Apple in 2017 How Apple will make you really, really want an Apple TV Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! While Apple won’t be at CES this year it will be watching news from the event. That's because this year's show is shaping up to be a testing ground for a range of new technologies just about emerging into Gartner's 'Plateau of Productivity'. Smartphones have shown what can be done with an intelligent mobile processor inside of a truly mobile device, so you can also expect an array of add-on devices for iPhones, including camera lenses and cases, including the mJoose signal boosting case. 4K tunes in 4K television will be one of the leading new technologies. That’s good news for Apple watchers, given the company is known to be developing its own VR/AR solutions, and even better news for Apple. You see, we expect to see 4K televisions to be announced at the show at much more affordable prices, and that’s a pretty big deal. Why? Because as the hardware reaches people’s homes, broadcasters and content providers will become more motivated to offer decent quality content in UHD. You know this is coming as big players, including the BBC, Sky and others, have begun testing 4K broadcasts. Over the next few months as 4K ready televisions reach people’s homes en masse you can expect the trickle of content in that standard to become a flood. Once it does, it makes sense to think about 4K streaming devices, and makes it far more likely Apple will introduce a 4K version of Apple TV – particularly as broadcasters and the content provision industry coagulates around a more limited number of 4K standards. Fragmentation of the 4K standard is a problem right now. VR, AR and more As televisions become computers we expect much more from them. The evolution of consumer VR (which has its own hall at CES) and professional AR systems is speeding up. Oculus, HTC Vive, Microsoft Hololens and others are already racing to build this market segment. We know for sure that Apple is looking into this sector too – because Apple CEO Tim Cook told us. CES will give us the best insight yet into the potential of these solutions, particularly in terms of user interfaces. Why should Apple users be interested in this? Seems to me there is big potential for the evolution of gesture-based user interfaces, inside out tracking and experiences beyond immersive gaming. I’m particularly interested in the potential for medical tech in the connected health sector, while iOS users may be interested in new video glasses from SunnyCam. Wireless Not only should we see a plethora of high-end wireless speakers and headphones at CES, but you can anticipate a proliferation of voice assistant support across these systems. After all, if you use a streaming music service like Apple’s, Amazon’s, or Spotify, why wouldn’t you want to be able to demand whatever track you wanted to hear using your voice and a connected speaker system? That’s the real promise of systems like Alexa, at least when it comes to audio. Microsoft is working with Samsung’s newly acquired Harmon Kardon on premium audio speakers, for example. Apple has allegedly been exploring similar technologies, so it will be interesting to see what its closer partners have to share at the show. Wearables and smarthomes Apple Watch now dominates the smartwatch sector, but you can anticipate connected wearable devices beyond the wrist at CES. Think shoes that track your exercise, Bodytrak clothing, and more. You should also look forward to more connected smarthome devices at the event (take a look at WooHoo), many with HomeKit support.  A focus on assistive home services and digital health all herald the moment for “ambient technologies”, when tech is so deeply wrapped inside the way we live our lives that it almost becomes invisible. You’ll also see third party vendors including Kanex sharing their next-generation Apple Watch accessories.  Look around and you may even find a celebrity chef cooking up a storm in a connected smart kitchen from Gourmia, and a smart bed that intelligently adjusts itself to your sleep patterns, Sleep Number. Robotics and AI Connected listening stations demand a connected machine intelligence for best effect, and you can look forward to a range of Amazon Echo competitors. Amazon will need to innovate as the devices it competes with become much smarter, take Olly, a desktop-based smart assistant that adapts its personality to suit each member of the household. As machine intelligence becomes more sophisticated, smart home listening devices will become increasingly sophisticated to match. This evolution of AI is inevitable and necessary as we see the framework laid down for robots in tomorrow’s home. You’ll see some of these on show at the show, mostly task-focused bots, including a clothes-folding machine, Laundroid. Smart cars Apple and Google may be focused on creating the OS for the future autonomous automobile, but existing vehicle brands are ready to share their wares at CES. Chrysler, Toyota, Faraday Future are all on the exhibitor list, so you can expect interesting news around augmented driving systems and technological innovations such as these. BMW plans to demonstrate HoloActive Touch Technology, a new take on dashboard design, Mercedes Benz is already flagging up its own series of YouTube announcements from the event and Autoliv, Clarion, Delphi, IAV, Navya, NVIDIA, NXP, Renesas and Valeo will all exhibit in the self-driving tech marketplace at the show. Fintech Apple Pay is a shadow of what is to come. Global fintech funding hit $36 billion in 2016 and 40 percent of that huge investment went to payment companies. It won’t stop there, expect first signs of data analytics innovation in financial industries, lots of conversation about blockchain and the threat it represents to traditional payment providers, and the impact of connected technology on the insurance industry. Apple products and Apple Pay have potential implications across all of these new financial services. To get a sense of the potential in this sector, take a look at Atom and Mondo, new digital-only banks. Think about how personalization of fintech services could impact this sector, and then pay a visit to the Digital Money Forum at the show. There will be much more at CES this year – what makes CES 2017 stand out in comparison to some previous years is that we appear to be at a true inflection point for a plethora of new connected smart devices, and that’s breathing new vigor into the industry and its trade show.

The recommendation comes from TidBITS publisher Adam Engst. Writing on the online Apple newsletter website, Engst backs up fellow developer Craig Landrup's claim that Apple's decision to rewrite the PDFKit framework for macOS 10.12 has broken basic functionality that PDF-related developers rely on, such as compatibility with ScanSnap and Doxie scanners. It pains me to say this, speaking as the co-author of "Take Control of Preview," but I have to recommend that Sierra users avoid using Preview to edit PDF documents until Apple fixes these bugs. If editing a PDF in Preview in unavoidable, be sure to work only on a copy of the file and retain the original in case editing introduces corruption of any sort. As to why issues have arisen in Apple's native Preview application, Engst quotes approvingly the DEVONthink developer Christian Grunenberg, who characterizes the rewritten version of PDFKit in Sierra as a "work in progress": Apple wants to use a common foundation for both iOS and macOS. However, it was released way too early, and for the first time (at least in my experience) Apple deprecated several features without caring about compatibility. And to make things worse, lots of former features are now broken or not implemented at all, meaning that we had to add lots of workarounds or implement stuff on our own. And there’s still work left to be done. 10.12.2 introduces new issues (it seems that Apple wants to fix at least the broken compatibility now) and of course fixed almost none of the other issues. It’s not only DEVONthink — a lot of other applications (such as EndNote, Skim, Bookends, and EagleFiler) are also affected.Apple previously removed functionality in its iWork suite for Mac to conform with iOS, but re-introduced most of the missing features in a later version. Whether Apple plans to do the same with an update to Preview is still unclear. Meanwhile, until Apple fixes the issues with the native Mac app, Engst recommends Smile's PDFpen as an alternative for PDF manipulation of all sorts, with Adobe’s Acrobat DC being a more expensive option.

Rating: 17 Votes trifid 2 weeks ago This is a very minor issue and will be fixed as has been said elsewhere. There is nothing to worry about here. Corrupt PDF forms filled out in an education or business environment doesn't seem minor to me, actually seems catastrophic. Rating: 15 Votes Sandstorm 2 weeks ago As a previous 10 year Mac user I'm more and more happy every day that I recently ditched Mac and switched to Windows 10. Not everything is perfect (of course), but many things are really awesome and I definitely don't get the constant feeling of being on a dying, neglected platform. My shiny new iPhone 7+ is probably my last Apple product. Because Mac was THE central Apple product for me. Without it I have no reason to sick with the pathetic, greedy and lazy Apple anymore. I might stick with iPhone, but because I'm definitely dumping all Apple apps/services - I'll stick around ONLY if iOS 11 allows to choose default apps from other superior companies. If not - good bye. Yes, I know, I won't let the door hit me. Rating: 14 Votes Applebot1 2 weeks ago Really is looking like Apple want to go all in for iOS. OS X days are numbered imo.

Did they not learn from the whole discoveryd/mDNSResponder fiasco? Apple doesn't learn anymore under Tim Cook :/ sad truth Rating: 12 Votes peter2 2 weeks ago Well, typical Apple way... at least since some time: Release half-baked software, screwing up things that worked just fine for ages, and then debug "live" during very long periods of time. More and more, MacOS cannot be trusted as a production system, nor can anyone count/base his business on "reasonable" continuity assumptions :-((( Rating: 12 Votes freediverx 2 weeks ago This is a very minor issue and will be fixed as has been said elsewhere. There is nothing to worry about here. An operating system bug that can permanently corrupt PDFs is a minor issue? One which was identified over two months go while the OS was sill in beta?

One of the most obtrusive elements is the construction of seven lodges, a kitchen, toilets and lounge on the Diamantina Spur adjacent to Mount Feathertop. This spur is a magnificent, narrow alpine ridge with no intrusion other than a foot-track. The proposed development conflicts with the plan's stated accommodation principles including: "Avoid ecologically sensitive areas and do not build facilities in remote and natural areas." These buildings, to be at about 1600 metres, will always be visible as they are above the snow line. It is unacceptable to service this development with "helicopter or transport drones". Those seeking the comforts of a hotel, such as linen service, chef-prepared meals and hot showers, have plenty of options. They are in the two nearby alpine resorts of Falls Creek and Mount Hotham or alpine valley towns. Hands off Diamantina Spur.

Is it new money, or will it further diminish the funding available for maintenance of all our parks? Much hiking track maintenance is done by volunteer "Friends" groups. The one I belong to has increasingly less access to the park ranger for assistance and support. There is no funding to replace the chainsaws and brushcutters that enable us to keep tracks open (we bring our own shovels, secateurs and hammers); and there is no funding to control feral animals. This is quite strenuous work, and most of our members are over 60. Furthermore, we volunteers who maintain the track will no longer be able to camp at the best places.

It increases appreciation of our landscapes, which provides a stronger foundation for appropriate political and social environmental management. Limiting access to the hardy few will not promote greater environmental awareness and appreciation. Parks Victoria has limited funds to manage the threats to our alpine area biodiversity. Options to increase funding include raising taxes, re-introducing park entry fees or generating income from the parks. Raising tax is not sustainable and unlikely to win an election, while charging blanket entry fees impedes access. Generating income from user-pays activity is the only sustainable method of ensuring our parks have the financial resources to manage contemporary threats. Advertisement The booking and permit system has been successful globally, including in Tasmania and New Zealand, which compete for our tourism dollar. I've lived and worked in our alpine landscape for 20 years and would love to see more people appreciating this unique landscape. Ben Derrick, Tawonga South Draft plan reads as if it's fait accompli The process surrounding the development of the plan has been poor. Where was the public discussion paper that canvassed different routes and options? Two drop-in sessions and a short submission process over Christmas is not consultation. The draft plan glosses over, or ignores, basic issues such as: where existing users will actually go, where will the waste shower water be discharged, daily helicopter traffic, detailed environmental impacts and vegetation clearance for fire safety. The document reads more like a conceptual justification for a fait accompli than a genuine planning document. Linda Hinton, Tyntynder South THE FORUM Withdraw protection It is interesting that multinationals such as Apple, BHP and Microsoft will not pay for the government services they use. No doubt they expect the police to investigate a theft from an Apple store or the brigade to attend a fire at a Microsoft office. They use public roads to make deliveries and expect publicly funded courts and law makers to protect their intellectual property. They see these as a right for which they should not pay proper tax. Strangely, they do not take the same approach with their services; if I refuse to pay for an iPhone or a copy of Windows, it is not provided; they call it "user pays". Perhaps Australia should take a leaf from their book? I suspect it would take only a few days of withdrawal of protection of IP, a fire or two and prioritising a call by a tax-paying citizen over a smashed Apple store window to help them understand the reason they should pay tax. Peter Hawkins, Kew Jobs shipped offshore In 30 years Australia's coastal shipping, which also carried some exports, has dropped from 95 to 12 vessels. Foreign shipping has been allowed to take over most of our coastal transport. Further, some of those 12 Australian-registered ships still operating on our coast are crewed and commanded by Chinese and foreign officers on 457 visas. This is at a time when Australian-qualified crew can't find jobs. The US understands the importance of a national merchant marine for defence and emergencies. It only allows US-owned and registered ships to operate on its coast. John McNally, Kew Let's import everything Let's enjoy the continuing demise of Australia with the closure of Holden, Ford and Toyota plus some 50 component manufacturers. We don't need them. We can import everything we want, paid for by dirty brown coal and live cattle exports. And with the rising unemployment there will be less demand for imported products. None of our politicians are concerned about "free trade" fundamentalism, and welcome foreign investors driving up property values. Some 40 years ago my house cost $44,000. Now I could sell it for about a million. But I may have a problem finding a bridge to sleep under. Geoff Fortune, Nunawading Losing track of rorters Yet another business found exploiting workers and a new business to boycott. It would be so much easier if we had an ethical and responsible body that could provide a form of "worker approved" accreditation sticker that a business could display on its shopfront. Keeping up with rorters is a full-time job. Graeme Henchel, Yarra Glen Dedicated union official April Baragwanath (Letters, 3/1), where do you think the "amazing journalists" get the stories exposing scandals? In the case of "chuggers" (people on the streets collecting for charities but working for a third party under exploitative conditions) and the closely related stories about charities who turn a blind eye to the exploitation of those collecting on their behalf, the origin of the stories was the diligent work of a union official, even though none of the "chuggers" were members of his (or any other) union. How can I be so certain of this? The union official concerned is one of my sons, Tim. Richard Gunstone, Elsternwick Paradox of disaffected Simon Castles (Comment, 3/1) excellently traces the continuity of social dispossession from Thatcherism to the rise of Trump. Underlying his argument is the larger influence of neoliberalism as a cultural system, not just an economic theory. As a cultural system it requires the propagation of individualism, consumerism, narcissism, competition, the dominance of appearance over substance, and a considerable diminution of compassion. One can see all these qualities in many contemporary First World societies, as local and US politics illustrates only too well. What is paradoxical, but not surprising, is that the response of the genuinely disaffected is to vote for somebody (Trump, Turnbull) who will only give more of the same. A real shift in attitudes for the good of society will require a complete reworking of the cultural aspects of neoliberalism, not just its economic manifestations. Greg Bailey, St Andrews No mileage for Greens Geoff Parkes (Letters, 2/1), far from the Greens "trying to make political mileage out of" opposition to the changes to the age pension, they actually supported them. In doing so they might well have lost the vote of this pension recipient whose already modest income has been reduced by more than 15 per cent. Tim Thorne, Launceston, Tas Safe car call falls flat Transport Minister Darren Chester's safe car message rings flat for the thousands of young, unemployed people in his electorate of Gippsland. Buying a car, let alone a safe car, isn't on their radar. Immobility, particularly for young rural people, is an important contributing factor in their unemployment. I look forward to hearing Mr Chester's policy initiatives designed to alleviate this issue among Australia's young unemployed people. Cheryl Wragg, Moe Another killer looms When I was a child, about 1000 Victorians were killed on the roads annually, spurring government into action. Decades of safety initiatives have led to the road toll being cut by about a factor of four. It has been costly and required strong laws to regulate behaviour. But few complain, because most agree road safety is vital. The reported increase in 2016 is an important reminder to never be complacent. Now another killer looms. Heat waves are already our No.1 natural killer. As temperatures rise due to climate change, the heat wave death toll could increase fourfold in the coming decades. This should spur us into action, not only to slash carbon emissions, but to make homes more resilient to climate impacts. Sadly government action is too little, too slow. What will it take to shake us out of our complacency? Andrea Bunting, Brunswick Listen, don't speak Davis Redfearn (Letters, 3/1) asks whether Pauline Hanson has spoken to the experts about the Barrier Reef. Perhaps the word "listened" should be substituted for "spoken". Peter Carlin, Frankston South   Traumatic experience Anyone learning basic risk management would know that the "confluence of events" at Lorne's Falls Festival was highly predictable. The hazards were easily identifiable with the consequences possibly catastrophic (The Age, 1/1). A squashed and excited crowd in a hurry to get to the next gig, minuscule exits with sloping wet gravel and far too few security staff. Miraculously there were no deaths. The video on musicfeeds.com is horrific to watch and listen to and raises further questions about deficiencies in managing the crush once it started. A family friend volunteered for Falls; she's strong, competent, experienced and resourceful. Luckily she fell on her back, so her spine wasn't trodden on and her face wasn't pushed into the mud. With seven people piled on top of her she thought she was going to die. She later saw numbers of people being resuscitated/defibrillated, and is now in hospital with broken ribs, a broken leg, a broken ankle and a lacerated foot. She's severely traumatised and is facing a long rehabilitation. Others are worse off. Despite its previous good safety record, Falls failed everyone this time, and badly. Meredith Bubner, Eltham Rewarding donation I was emotional when reading about Bryson Miles, 3, and his mum's plea for blood donors ("Mother pleads for gift of life", 26/12). Bryson has needed regular transfusions to fight a brain tumour and sometimes the hospital has run out of blood. I have donated blood regularly for a number of years but this article made it personal as my blood type is O-negative, the same as Bryson's. I live 65 kilometres from the nearest donor centre and in the busy lead-up to Christmas I kept my appointment to donate and after reading the article I am very glad I did. I will do my best to continue to donate every three months and encourage others to do the same. Carol Bredden, Creightons Creek Call for belly brassiere I'm fascinated by the magnificent bellies I see these days, but also feel concern for their owners. The men and women with enormous bellies hanging over their belts or waistbands cannot be comfortable. The solution is surely a belly brassiere. While the engineering of such a garment is beyond me, an enterprising corsetiere could grab the opportunity. Albert Riley, Mornington AND ANOTHER THING...

Not much was changed in terms of design, and pretty much all of the upgrades were made under the hood. So does this mean that the Apple Watch Series 3 will sport a new design as well? According to the latest rumors, the answer is no. According to a report from the Economic Daily News (via DigiTimes), it seems that 2017’s Apple Watch is expected to maintain the same design as its predecessors. However the focus will be on improving the battery life and overall performance, something that we’re sure many Apple Watch users can appreciate. In a way keeping the same design isn’t that surprising. After all this is a watch and even amongst traditional watchmakers, they tend to maintain the same design with minor changes for the same model over the years, so for Apple to keep changing the design of the Apple Watch every couple of years could have some customers feeling left out if they own the older device. At the same time we guess some users might find it “boring”, but we guess that’s a debate for another day. The report is also claiming that the Apple Watch 3 will be launched in the fall of 2017, but until we see it for ourselves, take it with a grain of salt. Filed in Apple >Gadgets >Rumors.

Our Paper Paper Archive Our Apps Daily Horoscope Home News Sport Showbiz & TV Life & Style Travel Tech Pics Casino Gaming Reviews Tech News Home Tech Tech News Your iPhone is about to add a MAJOR new feature with this iOS 10.3 update Your iPhone is about to add a MAJOR new feature with this iOS 10.3 update WHEN you next go to the cinema, you're going to hope that Apple's upcoming iOS 10.3 update has dropped as a 'Theatre mode' is reportedly inbound. By Luke Johnson / Published 3rd January 2017 GETTY/APPLE UPDATE: The first iOS 10.3 beta release is set to drop on January 10 It could soon be time to get your head around a cool new iPhone feature, with Apple reportedly readying its next major iOS update for release. According to new reports, the first iOS 10.3 Beta release will drop before next week, with the software patch to bring at least one exciting new feature to your existing iPhone. So, what's in store, a revamped design? New fitness app? Well, no. Instead, however, Apple could be able to make you phone cinema-friendly with a 'Theatre mode'. iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theatre mode - will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 According to reputed Apple tipster, Sonny Dickson, the new Theatre mode will be accessible via a popcorn-styled icon added to the iOS Control Centre. Exactly what this new mode will entail is still slightly unclear, but Dickson, speaking with tech blog 9to5Mac has suggested it "very well might be [an] enhanced version of Dark Mode." Already available on existing macOS and tvOS devices, Dark Mode alters the software's colour balance and reduces the overall light output of devices to be less distracting to those around you in dark settings. Such an addition to iPhones and iPads would allow you to check you incoming messages in the cinema without feeling the wrath of those sat next to you. Revealing the addition on Twitter, Dickson stated: "iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theatre mode - will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Centre icon." In a separate tweet he added: "iOS 10.3 beta 1 is scheduled to seed on January 10th." Although an exact iOS 10.3 release date has yet to be confirmed, if Dickson's beta release predictions run true, we wouldn't expect to see a full release until mid-February at the earliest. Marking the mid-cycle update for the company's iOS 10 software, the mooted iOS 10.3 patch will follow the recent iOS 10.2 update which added 72 new emoji for Apple users. iPhone 7 Plus review camera test - how good is the Apple's new dual-lens snapper Tuesday, 13th September 2016 DAILY STAR ONLINE has got our hands on Apple's latest iPhone 7 Plus and here's how the new dual-lens performs. 1 / 9 DAILY STAR ONLINE Apple iPhone 7 Plus review camera test As well as clown, cowboy, gorilla and avocado emoji, to name just a few, the iOS 10.2 update brought a number of bug fixes and new features to users. Joining a patch for the iPhone 7 Plus camera complaints, the software refresh introduced Apple Music updates, better Apple Maps support and a variety of new wallpapers.

Apple to Launch Watch Series 3 with Improved Battery Life This Fall GO The smartwatch will be manufactured by Quanta Jan 3, 2017 12:07 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple might unveil its third-generation Apple Watch in the third quarter of this year, according to a recent report by Digitimes. Apparently, Apple Watch 3 will be focusing on improved battery life and overall performance. The report mentions that the next generation of wearable devices by Apple will be manufactured by Quanta, a company based in Taiwan. This isn’t the first time Apple contracts Quanta for producing wearable devices, as the first and second generation of Apple watches were made by the same manufacturer. The report claims that the manufacturer’s main task will be to improve battery life, as well as enhance the device’s general performance. Apparently, other hardware components in the next Apple Watch won’t see any major changes. Quanta representatives have declined to comment on the report, calling it “market speculation.” Apple Watch 3 could be unveiled alongside the iPhone 8 The wearable device could see the light of day this fall, and reports say that the watch might be launched alongside the new iPhone 8. Some rumors have stated that Apple might introduce a significant design change with the upcoming Apple Watch 3, but it seems that this report contradicts them. However, Apple might still include some more advanced sensors that weren’t featured in previous models, like the Apple Watch Series 2. Moreover, previous rumors have stated that the new wearable device might incorporate cellular connectivity and micro-LED displays, which are lighter than current screens and offer improved brightness. Apple might also include new technology spotted in recent patent applications, like a feature for authenticating the user using their heart rate and cardio rhythms. Upcoming devices might also include haptic feedback into Apple Watch bands and an even thinner body design. It remains to be seen which of these features will be included in the next Apple Watch device, considering that it won’t be long until Apple unveils the next-generation this fall. #Apple#Apple Watch 3#Quanta#Apple Watch Series 2#iPhone 8 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Still Planning to Bring the Watch Digital Crown on iPhones The Jet White iPhone 7 Looks Stunning in This Mockup - Video Apple AirPods Can Survive Drops and Full Washing Machine Cycles Samsung Gear Manager for iOS Leaked, Lets You Use Gear S2/S3 with iPhones It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    Apple Watch Series 2 New Mac Apps Google Play Music Desktop Player: Desktop client for the Google Music service that offers you the possibility to listen to music without taking a serious strain on your system Squirrel: A simple yet very efficient finances management application that can record transactions, generate reports, create budgets and more. iCaching: An easy-to-use manager for GPX files that enables users to manage their collection of geocaches by simply dragging and dropping folders RemotePC: Access and control computers from a remote location, transfer files between the devices, and effortlessly record the connection sessions Swift: Open Source programming language developed and maintained by Apple that aims to provide a cleaner syntax that is easier write and read HandBrake: A free and easy to use application designed to help you quickly convert your DVD and CD media content into MP4 or MKV video files G-Force: A full-featured music visualization plug-in (with hundreds of visual effects) for iTunes which can also visualize auxiliary audio Reader comments Early Competing iPhone Prototypes Shown in Video more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

In fact, the next version of iOS, 10.3, is expected to be heading to Apple’s current lineup of devices very soon. So whether you own a current generation iPhone, last year’s iPhone 6S or even one of Apple’s iPad tablets, this article will explore what to expect in iOS version 10.3. When will iOS 10.3 be released? Users running Apple’s iOS operating system might not have to wait all that long for their devices to be updated. According to the Express, renowned Apple leaker Sonny Dickson has taken to Twitter to reveal that he has knowledge Apple plans to release iOS 10.3 on January 10. He also claims that Apple’s first iOS update of 2017 is codenamed Erie and marks Apple’s midcycle update of iOS 10, which typically tends to see Apple push forward a big new headline feature in a bid to keep their operating system fresh. For example, when Apple released iOS 9.3 back in March 2016, it introduced the new Night Shift feature – which modifies the amount of harsh, blue light emitted from your screen throughout the day – arguably the biggest update of that cycle. Whilst this year’s 10.3 update is expected a little sooner, it should include a similar headline feature. .@Apple rumoured to release iOS 10.3 with new 'Theatre' mode. https://t.co/2FGYKnEhA9 pic.twitter.com/ROhYYfXYhn — HYPEBEAST (@HYPEBEAST) January 1, 2017 New features in iOS 10.3 As aforementioned, Apple’s midcycle iOS updates tend to include a big standout feature. According to BGR, in iOS 10.3 there’s likely to be a new “Theatre Mode,” however, exactly what that mode will entail is anybody’s guess. That being said, many fans are speculating that Theatre Mode could finally see Apple introduce a long rumored system-wide dark mode, similar to that seen in some iterations of rival platform Android. Apple was originally set to introduce the mode in iOS 10 and after they didn’t, speculation has only grown wilder. That being said, users of iOS are being warned not to get too excited about a potential dark mode just yet. iPhone in Theatre mode might be similar to the Do Not Disturb feature already present in iOS and could essentially offer an enhanced method of muting notifications and alerts.

Apple Engineers Are Losing Interest In iPhones Apple’s iPad Mini 4 Successor: iPad Mini 5 Price, Release Date And Everything We Know So Far So what do we know about that new Theatre Mode? Well, whatever it offers, it’s expected to be a pretty big addition to iOS. Sources close to Apple are claiming that the Cupertino-based company plans to provide the new Theatre Mode with a dedicated icon in the Control Center. Dickson confirmed to a number of news outlets that the new mode will be represented by a popcorn icon in the Control Center. With that in mind, it could very well be the case that the new mode simply offers a way to enjoy video and other media without being disturbed. However, with iOS 10.3 expected to be little over a week away, users of the iPhone 7, iPad Pro and various other Apple devices might not have to wait all that long to find out what Apple is planning to offer with their new Theatre Mode.

Here, we hear from contributors across the industry about the trends and technologies they believe will be important in the year ahead. Rupal Karia, managing director of Retail and Hospitality, UK and Ireland at Fujitsu, puts the emphasis on personalisation and on working together. Continued focus on personalisation 2017 will be the year where the shopping experience comes full circle to the days where retailers knew their customers on a personal basis. The online experience has mastered this already, and now it is the physical stores turn. With loyalty amongst customers being so poor in today’s retail landscape, retailers need to be thinking about the personalised experience they bring in store and the value that face to face adds to a customer journey. What needs to happen is a true integration between instore and online to create a truly personalised experience. An example of a company that is providing this new heightened level of personalisation is McDonalds as they now through their in-store devices permit customers to customise their orders to the last detail transforming the way people purchase fast-food. Co-creation for a collaborative nation In 2016 collaboration between retailers grew as we saw the likes of the Post Office and WH Smith team up, Tesco and Arcadia do more together, as well as the major acquisition of Argos by Sainsbury’s. In the next year this collaboration will continue, as retailers find ways to maximise the in-store footprint, and see consolidation as an effective way of doing this. Collaboration also works in reverse, with physical retailers teaming up with online only players to widen their reach as we saw with Ocado and Morrison’s. Through collaboration, whichever way retailers choose to do it, it allows them to maximise their offering to customers and ensure that they are making themselves available at every channel. By teaming up with retailers that already do in-store or online well, they are able to provide a better service offering and focus on delivering that customer experience, rather than starting from scratch. The days of tilling are numbered Tilling as we know it needs to have a change. In most cases, shop processes have been the same for decades; and with the recent launch of Amazon Go, we have seen how retailers can again push and innovate a physical store. The instore model where customers load their shopping baskets to then unload, scan, repack, and pay all of their items as they would have done fifty years ago are limited. Amazon Go is an example of how retailers can harness technology and embrace innovation in their physical stores to create that invaluable seamless customer journey. Now that the level of customers’ expectations is at an all-time high, retailers need to find ways to match it and ensure they are differentiating themselves from their competitors. Shopping instore is now very much experiential. By bringing innovative new ways to shop, retailers can enhance the shopping experience to make it more interactive, and digitally enabled. Those that do will be the retailers that stand out in a noisy retail landscape. Lucie Greene, director of JWT Innovation, puts the emphasis on Brexit and new retail concepts. Brexterity First it was the Marmite scare. A price dispute between Tesco and Unilever over the polarizing breakfast spread grabbed viral headlines in October 2016, worrying devoted fans that it might disappear from British supermarket shelves. Ultimately, Marmite remained in stock, but in the long term, consumer prices in a Britain with a weakened pound suggest future declines in buying power. Unilever’s chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly told investors on an earnings call that “prices should start to increase to cover the cost of imported goods due to weaker sterling.” In November 2016, Toblerone began shrinking the size of its famous triangular chocolate bars in the UK to cover lost revenue caused by higher prices of imported chocolate. The cost to print books jumped from £1.50 ($1.86) per unit to over £3 ($3.72) per unit between June and November, Sam Jordison, codirector of Norwich-based publishing company Galley Beggar Press, told CNBC, adding that the company had been in danger of folding as a result. Apple raised UK retail prices 20% at the end of October 2016, making MacBooks in the United Kingdom about $275 more expensive than in the United States. Microsoft has announced a similar plan to “harmonize prices” with the EU. The likely implication is that, absent salary increases, British consumers’ buying power will decline next year and onwards, especially as talk of a “hard Brexit” continues to spook traders. Why it’s interesting: Globalisation has delivered small but incremental increases in buying power to consumers across the board in recent decades. Watch to see whether this trend is fully reversed along with the rising tide of economic nationalism. And double down on delivering more value for less. Retail naturalism Technology brands are evolving retail concepts away from cold and minimal shops toward something friendlier and more natural. Apple’s store on central London’s Regent Street received a major facelift in fall 2016 that features the company’s new “town square” layout, with a central space, the Forum, that hosts daily entertainment. The store showcases the brand’s new design philosophy, which is interactive and community-oriented. A central hall lined with trees, an open layout flooded with daylight, and other natural touches like wooden fixtures and plant walls mark a departure from Apple’s classic, bordering on clinical, aesthetic. Google’s Manhattan pop-up store, which also opened in October, features similar touches. A massive wooden “fountain of light” takes center stage in the store, anchoring it in a unique architectural feature. There’s also a whimsical play area to experiment with Google’s Daydream View virtual reality headset, and a homey kitchen setup to try Google’s Home line in action. Increasingly, Apple is working to preserve the architecture of historical buildings, rather than impose contemporary layouts. In February 2016, the New York Landmarks Conservancy gave the company an award for its work protecting New York’s rich architectural history at its locations, including Grand Central Terminal and a Beaux Arts bank on the Upper East Side, where architects preserved the vault. Why it’s interesting: Consumers expect more out of bricks-and-mortar retail—whether it’s an experience, or a space worth visiting even when they’re not in the market for a specific product. Apple and Google are admitting that varying their well-honed aesthetic can keep retail spaces fresh. Bhavesh Unadkat, management consultant in retail customer engagement design at Capgemini [IRDX VCPG], says it’s all about loyalty and new technologies. The ‘rebirth of loyalty’ There are many loyalty schemes in the market and customers are enrolled in multiple schemes – but how many of them do they actually use and how many influence purchase decisions? Even the extent to which they drive any kind of advocacy to the brand is to be questioned. The reason for this is loyalty schemes as a whole are very similar and are based largely on financial rewards – spend £1 and I’ll give you 1p back. Retailers more than ever are now thinking about how their schemes can be more sustainable and be built on a reciprocal value exchange with their customers that provides a differentiation and more reasons to be loyal. The ‘rebirth of loyalty’ will be about the ability for retailers to craft propositions which create and use a deeper understanding of customers, to engage and reward them at a more meaningful level. Loyalty isn’t built in a moment, but instead over time, and it needs to be considered as a more holistic outcome, achieved through supporting, inspiring and engaging the segment of one customer. The Internet of Things (IOT) will expand its reach in the retail sector By the end of the decade we can expect to see the number of internet-connected objects increase significantly, and its impact on retail will be dramatic. The number of wearable devices purchased doubled in 2016 and with technology like Amazon Echo facilitating a connected experience for the customer the opportunities for retailers playing in this space become substantial. As well as customer facing opportunities there are a number of supply chain benefits that IOT can help unlock. For example, the ability to more accurately measure supply and demand in a near-real-time way will allow businesses to better ensure things do not run out based on a surge of demand, or that stores are not overstocked. Retailers will spend 2017 experimenting further to strike the right balance between making the experience a better one for customers and at the same time unlocking business value through a more connected shopping experience. Augmented and virtual reality Augmented and virtual reality are two technologies that have been well embraced already by retailers and these will continue to become mainstream in the customers shopping experience. Mothercare is a great example. It introduced an innovative twist to its catalogue this year by allowing those customers with its app to scan the page and watch models showcase the products on their screens. Virtual reality eliminates the limitations of space and time, so that retailers can dream of whatever experience or design they choose. As the technology evolves and costs lower (look at Google Cardboard as a headset for example), we can expect this to be more of a common site, with virtual showrooms and virtual fitting rooms becoming the norm. Jon Copestake, retail and consumer goods analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, says many emerging markets will rebound after a poor 2016, but uncertainty in Western Europe and slower growth in China will peg back sales. China Fears of a debt bubble in China are unlikely to result in an economic crisis but the economy is expected to experience a slowdown in growth which will sharpen in 2018. As a result 2017 will see Chinese consumers becoming increasingly bearish with luxury goods firms continuing to bear the brunt. Despite slowing growth, China will still be among the five fastest-growing retail markets in the world, with e-commerce continuing to thrive. Brexit and Western Europe A greater worry for retailers will come from Western Europe. Fallout from the Brexit vote, and potential for further political upheaval in European elections will weigh on consumer confidence in 2017 leading to virtual stagnation in regional sales volumes. The UK could be hit particularly hard as the decision to leave the EU sinks in and a weak pound pushes up prices. An expected decline in sales volumes will put the UK among the five worst performing retail markets in the world in 2017. Emerging markets There will be bright spots however. India and Iran will be the world’s fastest growing retail markets, with India liberalising its retail sector further and with the Iranian economy finally beginning to open up to foreign investment. Innovations like AR, VR and AI are also set to be hot topics in the coming year and will drive product innovation. Meanwhile, retailers will experiment more with cross-channel investment with the likes of WalMart betting heavily on e-commerce even as Alibaba and Amazon look more towards bricks and mortar investment. One unknown will remain: the election of Donald Trump as US President could bolster domestic demand through lower tax rates and infrastructure spending, but also weigh on various international trade agreements, causing considerable uncertainty beyond US borders.

On Christmas eve, 2014, James and Bethany Modisette were driving on the highway in Texas with their two daughters when they were forced to stop their Camry ahead of a blockage caused by police activity. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The family allege the driver at fault was using FaceTime on his iPhone 6 Plus at the time of the crash.  Driving behind them, Garrett Wilhelm failed to stop and his SUV slammed into the car at 105km/h, tearing it apart and riding up over the top. Bethany and the older daughter, Isabella, were injured but managed to escape the car, while James and the younger daughter, Moriah, had to be extracted by rescue workers. Moriah Modisette, who was strapped into a booster seat at the time of the crash, was flown to a nearby hospital but died. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Moriah Modisette died after the crash. Photo: GoFundMe Wilhelm — whose iPhone, the family allege, was still running FaceTime when the police recovered it after the crash — was charged with manslaughter in the case, but the Modisettes also hold Apple partly responsible. At issue is the fact that the company has a patented method of preventing the potentially distracting app from being used in a vehicle, but has failed to implement it. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Garrett Wilhelm was 20 at the time of the incident. Photo: Police handout Damages are sought against Apple for its "wrongful failure to install and implement the safer, alternative design for which it sought a patent in December 2008 ... to lock out the ability of drivers to utilise the FaceTime application on the Apple iPhone while driving a motor vehicle", says the complaint as reproduced by Courthouse News. Apple's possession of a patented technology that would lock FaceTime when the phone was inside a vehicle moving at speed shows the company was aware that the application was likely to be dangerous, the lawsuit alleges, and the failure to implement that technology was "a substantial factor in causing" the family's injuries and Moriah's death. The complaint was filed on December 23. Apple was yet to respond to the lawsuit as of Saturday December 31, according to the Associated Press. 68 comments Log in to comment New User?

By: Tech Desk | Published:January 3, 2017 4:42 pm Clicking on the Apple iPhone bug, which is basically a large vcf file, will cause your iMessage app to freeze. A new bug has been revealed for Apple iMessage that causes the app to freeze. YouTube user vincedes3 posted a video on his channel demonstrating how a vcf attachment sent on iPhone running on iOS 8 to 10.2.1 makes your iMessage vulnerable to the bug. Clicking on the malicious message, which is basically a large vcf file, will cause iMessage app to freeze. You can dismiss iMessage from recently used apps on your iPhone, but reopening will cause it to crash. “When you click, iOS want to read the text, the text in the file is very complicated for the system and cause a CPU average: the app freeze. You close the app, want to reopen but iOS want to reload the previous message but can’t because it’s the vcf file,” vincedes3 explains on his site. However, he has provided a ‘magical link’ on the site, which he claims will make the bug go away, restoring iMessage app to normal. However, he has warned the fix (link) doesn’t work for some iPad devices. Users will need to open the given link on Safari browser. The link then starts to fix your app and you receive a message in the end that says, “‘I have just save you’re iPhone bro ;-)” This is not the first bug facing iOS devices in recent times. A five-second video was shared by YouTube channel EverythingApplePro, and viewing it on Safari caused iOS to crash. However, the bug wasn’t limited to one iOS build. In May last year there was a bug which caused iPhones running iOS 8.3 to crash when a message containing a specific string of text was received. Apple had later issued a software fix for the bug. The Cupertino giant is likely to do the same this time around as well. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Best of Express Meghalaya sex scam: Guest-house run by Home Minister’s son under probe EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party EntertainmentHappy Birthday Sidharth Malhotra: As Sidharth Malhotra turns 32, here are facts about him we bet you didn't know.

On Tuesday, the Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) claimed the next iteration of the wearable device will be manufactured by Taiwan-based Quanta, which was also responsible for the production of Apple's first and second-generation smartwatch. Citing market watchers with knowledge of Quanta's plans, the paper said improving battery life is the manufacturer's "main task", but beside general performance improvements, the device's other hardware would not see much change. Quanta declined to comment on the report, calling it "market speculation". The claims represent the first tentative indication of Apple's launch timeline for its third-generation Apple Watch, pointing to a possible fall unveiling of the new wearable alongside this year's iPhone 8. The report also narrows down Apple's rumored ambitions for the third-generation device, with previous reports suggesting it could introduce the first significant design changes for the timepiece, such as more advanced sensors that Apple was not able to include in the first and second-generation models. Other previous rumors have claimed Apple plans to add cellular connectivity to the next Apple Watch, after battery life concerns prevented the feature from being included in the Series 2 device. Also suggested is a potential switch to micro-LED displays, which are thinner and lighter than current screens and offer improved color gamut and brightness. Filed patents by Apple show other possibilities for future versions of Apple Watch, including the ability to determine a user's identity through their heart rate and unique cardio rhythms. Future models could also potentially integrate haptic feedback into Apple Watch bands, freeing up internal space for other components and allowing for a thinner body design. (Via DigiTimes.)

My sport edition of the Gear S2 runs two full days on a charge with 3G. My husband's Frontier Gear S3 runs a full day and has LTE as well as a large rugged looking real watch appearance a lot of men on this forum say they miss on an Apple Watch. But where they are missing out on is watch faces. The Samsung store has a wide variety of interesting and useful watch faces ranging from free to $1.99 for a "variety pack" with one basic face that can be recolored. Some watch faces do drain the battery faster but most developers as well as reviewers will warn about that. The customer can then decide if they still want the face or not, like the adults we are. Anyway, in addition to making money on bands, they could be making some money on watch faces like they do for iMessage sticker packs. It would certainly make the Apple Watch more interesting.

In the U.S., mega-mergers are likely to face tough scrutiny in 2017, and the industry is bracing for another round in the fight over encryption. At home, President-elect Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump to continue using @realDonaldTrump account as president Trump’s healthcare plan will offer ‘insurance for everybody’: report Trump on outgoing CIA director: ‘Was this the leaker of Fake News?’ MORE is vowing to roll back many Obama administration regulations. But overseas, the European Union is pressing ahead with a number of high-profile cases against some of Silicon Valley's giants. Here are five regulatory fights the tech world will be watching closely in the new year.   Apple's record tax penalty in Europe In August, the European Union’s Commission on Competition handed a record judgment against Apple, ordering the company to pay over $13 billion in back taxes to Ireland. Margrethe Vestager, the EU Commissioner on Competition, said Apple had broken the rules by receiving unfair state aid from Ireland. The battle is just heating up. Earlier in December, Apple formally appealed the ruling. In a statement, Apple claimed "the Commission took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules, disregarding decades of Irish tax law, US tax law, as well as global consensus on tax policy, that everyone has relied on."   The Obama administration stood by Apple, questioning the EU's order. A Treasury spokesperson said the EU decision “threatens to undermine the overall business climate in Europe‎.” Treasury Secretary Jack LewJack LewObama faults corrosive political rhetoric in farewell address Lew: Eliminate the 'dangerous' debt limit Five regulatory fights facing tech in 2017 MORE and lawmakers have raised questions over what they see as the unfair targeting of U.S. businesses by European regulators. In recent years, the European Commission has handed down orders to pay back taxes or antitrust rulings against other U.S. companies, including Starbucks and McDonalds. In addition to the Apple fight, the Commission is also investigating Google and Amazon in other cases. Trump could also provide a boost to Apple and other companies in the long run. He's floated a one-time repatriation of offshore corporate profits that could help Apple. But for now, Apple and European regulators are gearing up for the next round in their fight. The European Commission says it will defend its decision on Apple in the courts, dragging it into 2017.   The fight over encryption Apple also took center stage in the national debate over encryption. After the Dec. 2015 San Bernardino shooting, the FBI asked Apple to help crack an encrypted iPhone. Apple declined to provide a so-called backdoor and the FBI eventually was able to access the phone through other means. Apple's stance had support from Google and Microsoft and lawmakers like Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) who have been strong advocates for privacy rights. But Apple's stance also angered Trump, who called for a boycott of the company. Trump had said little on encryption since, but his election has privacy advocates worried about new efforts to force tech companies to help law enforcement break encryption. Downloads of encrypted messaging apps spiked after Trump's victory. The debate shows no signs of fading. Those who support encryption backdoors also got a boost in November, when Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard BurrRichard BurrSenate Intel panel to probe Trump team's ties to Russia Trump's CIA nominee seeks to calm nerves The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (R-N.C.) survived a tough reelection fight. But Sen. Ron WydenRon WydenSchumer puts GOP on notice over ObamaCare repeal Lawmakers condemn Trump for attack on John Lewis 1 million signatures collected in support of Snowden pardon MORE (D-Ore.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, is vowing to counter any attempt to weaken encryption. Wyden told Vice News after the election that he would filibuster any legislation on those lines.   AT&T-Time Warner merger AT&T's plans to merge with Time Warner will be under heavy scrutiny. The plans to join the telecom giant with one of the nation's biggest entertainment providers has sparked a heated debate and will face an antitrust review from the Justice Department (DOJ) and potentially the Federal Communications Commission as well. The FCC would review the merger if the companies decide to keep some of Time Warner's television broadcasting licenses. The deal has drawn critics from both sides of the aisle, including Trump and Sen. Bernie SandersBernie SandersSanders, Dems defend ObamaCare at Michigan rally Sanders: Not a 'bad thing' if Comey resigns Sanders: Trump should tweet support for Medicare, Social Security MORE (I-Vt.) Most notably, during the campaign, Trump blasted the deal, claiming it would put too much power in the hands of "too few" and saying he would reject it if he was in office. Since then, Trump hasn't spoken about the proposed merger, but many of those on his transition team would appear to be friendly to the deal. Three of Trump's appointees on this FCC landing team are former researchers at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and have written in support of similar mergers in the past. Sanders, though, has called on the DOJ to reject the deal. Lawmakers, including Sen. Al FrankenAl FrankenWHIP LIST: How many Dems will back Sessions? Franken to oppose Sessions FCC takes aim at AT&T, Verizon over 'zero-rating' services MORE (D-Minn.), grilled Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson during a recent hearing on the deal, raising concerns about higher costs for consumers and decreased competition. The deal is valued at $85 billion.   Google's antitrust fight Google has its own fight with the European Commission. The Mountain View, Calif., based is facing EU antitrust allegations over its mobile search service, shopping comparison tool and online advertising service. The commission alleges that Google used its dominant position in these areas to unfairly push its own products and services and quash competitors. Google has dismissed these charges, arguing back that customers just prefer their products and that the European Union's definition of monopoly is wrong. In the case of its comparison shopping tool, the search giant says the EU is mistakenly excluding Amazon and eBay from the market. The case has high stakes for Google. If they don't beat back the charges, they could be hit with a fine equal to 10 percent of their global turnover in a year. Google is mounting a fierce defense, keeping the fight in the spotlight in 2017.   Amazon's EU tax case Amazon is also awaiting a key tax ruling form the European Union. The decision was expected in 2016 but will be coming in the new year. At issue is Amazon's 2003 tax arrangement with Luxembourg, which regulators believe allowed the company to lock in a low tax rate with the country – a move the European Commission believes violates EU rules. Sources told Reuters that Amazon could be ordered to pay over $400 million in back taxes — paltry compared to Apple's tax penalty, but still a significant sum. If the fine comes down and Amazon chooses to fight, the battle could drag out well beyond 2017. The company is also trying to settle a separate dispute with the Commission over antitrust charges against its e-book sales, reports Reuters.

Here’s how to cope, for the least amount of money. By Emily Bary Dec. 27, 2016 10:56 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Pixabay Did you get a new MacBook Pro for the holidays? If so, you might be surprised by how few of your Apple accessories actually fit into the new computer. Get ready to embrace dongles, the term for those converter plugs that bridge the gap between old and new devices. For Apple devotees, the dongle talk brings back memories of 2012. That’s when Apple changed over to the Lightning cable for iPhones and iPads, sending us scrambling for new charging cords and adapters that would prevent our old docks from becoming obsolete. This year, folks who got latest Apple products are in for a double whammy -- iPhone and laptop changes. The new MacBook Pro – launched in November -- dumped all the ports you actually use (USB, HDMI, and SD card) in favor of fancy new “Thunderbolt/USB-C” ports. Your old charger won’t work, but that’s not such a big deal. The real problem is that absolutely no cord you use right now connects via USB-C, even your trusty iPhone cable. More Barron’s Next Technology Stories Apple Accessories: When to Save, When to Splurge The Only Two Streaming TV Options You Need 6 Tips to Save Your Holiday Deliveries The latest move extends the cord confusion surrounding the iPhone 7, which famously launched in September without a headphone jack. So now you can’t charge and listen to music at the same time. Plus your old headphones aren’t directly compatible. Apple seems to be feeling a little guilty about all the changes because it’s temporarily cut the prices on many of its dongles. To make your new laptop compatible with older devices, you’ll still have to fork over $9 to Apple to get its USB-C to USB adapter (discounted at $9 “for a limited time”) or its “multiport” adapter that converts one USB-C port into an HDMI, USB, and USB-C port all at the same time ($49, also on sale). Since Apple’s standard Lightning cables don’t have USB-C connection, you can buy one that does for $19. But we’re all about saving money on Apple accessories. For example, you can get two USB-C to USB adapters for the price of one Apple one ($9) from Aukey through Amazon. CableCreation’s USB-C to HDMI adapter, sold through Amazon, will set you back $14. If you use SD cards often, RicoRich makes a USB-C to SD slot adapter for $11. Combined, this’ll cost you less than Apple’s own “discounted” multiport adapter, even with the SD slot, which isn’t part of Apple’s model. To help you get over the loss of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple gave you headphones that connect through the Lightning port, as well as a dongle that makes your existing headphones Lightning compatible. If you want duplicates, you’ll have to shell out $29 for the headphones themselves and $9 for the “dongle.” You can do a little better than that. Save a buck with Wopow’s Lightning headphone adapter ($8) or pay 60 more cents than what Apple’s charging and get an adapter that lets you charge and listen to music at the same time. How novel.

For a while now the Tame Apple Press has been telling the world+dog that the iPhone 7 has been heading for a recording breaking year. This is even though it shipped with wireless headphones, which no-one wanted, and no real noticeable difference from the iPhone 6S. Apple had already ordered less of the iPhone 7 from its Asian partners than the iPhone 6, but increased its orders when its main rival the Galaxy Note 7 started melting. Word on the street is that most Galaxy Note 7 owners remained brand loyal and refused to buy an iPhone and left Apple with rather a lot of stock on hand. The Nikkei financial daily said Apple has trimmed production of iPhones by about 10 percent in the January-March quarter of 2017citing calculations based on data from suppliers. This is on top of its original 30 percent cut in January-March this year due to accumulated inventory. This means that the iPhone seven production is down 40 per cent in total and Apple can’t shift the phones it has in stock. Apple is saying nothing because it means that the iPhone 7 is to Apple what Vista was to Microsoft.

James and Bethany Modisette are suing the toy-maker after a car crash two years ago that killed one of their daughters and injured the rest of the family. The driver of the car who hit them was using Apple’s FaceTime video chat. The plaintiffs claim that if Apple had implemented technology it received a patent for in 2008 which was “a lock-out mechanism to prevent operation of one or more functions of handheld computing devices by drivers when operating vehicles,” such as texting or video chatting the accident would not have happened. The complaint cites Apple’s “failure to design, manufacture, and sell the Apple iPhone 6 Plus with the patented, safer, alternative design technology” — in other words, lack of the programme’s inclusion — as a “substantial factor” in the crash. It is a bold move taking this argument into a court and while we think it is unlikely to that it will go anywhere it does highlight a point. Tech companies patent shedloads of things and then never produce a product with them.  In this case it was a fairly obvious piece of tech which would have saved a life. Apple could easily have incorporated it into the iPhone 6 but it didn’t.

Apple's iPhone 8 will be its 10th anniversary iPhone - so, expect big things, naturally. It was on June 29, 2007, that the legendary Steve Jobs presented the first iPhone to the world.   And while Apple has since moved the annual iPhone launch month to September, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that Tim Cook would want Apple's latest iPhone to blow everyone's mind off.   The Cupertino-based tech giant is known to be secretive about its upcoming devices, and it'll surely be extra cautious about its anniversary edition iPhone.   But social media is a great grapevine peddler, and things can only remain so much under wraps when it comes to Apple and its iPhone.   Rumour has it that Apple is testing no less than 10 prototypes for the 10th anniversary edition - so anything that we know (or we think we know) may not see the light of the day, at least with iPhone 8.   That said, here's what we know so far - or we think we know so far:   Radical redesign According to MacRumours, "Apple has a major iPhone redesign planned for 2017, with a glass body and edge-to-edge OLED display that includes an integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor and front-facing camera." The new iPhone, it speculates, may be sold alongside upgraded (but standard) 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhones.   More importantly, the iPhone 8 may do away with Apple's iconic Home button. And, this gets interesting, Apple is also considering a flexible OLED display. Will that mean an iPhone you can fold and put in your pocket? Well, we think not, but. we might get a curved display if we're lucky. Or even one similar to Samsung's 'edge' display.   Apple is also prototyping an all-glass design. No bezels. All display. And guess who's helping Apple build such a display? Samsung!   Stronger inside In its belly, the iPhone 8 will host the 10-nanometer A11 chip that will help enable "long-range wireless charging", allowing the device to charge via a charger kept up to 15ft away. Nifty.   The same A11 will also be able to deal with an iris scanner in the iPhone 8. Apple is also rumoured to be unveiling the 10.3 Theater Mode iOS within the first couple of weeks this year - and that's an OS exclusive to iPhone 8, or so it's been said.   What about a foldable iPhone 8? Okay since you're so hung up on the 'foldable' bit, here's some bit of juicy rumour for you. Apple may actually be considering a special variant of the iPhone 8 - codenamed Ferrari - that will "fold" into two separate displays, like with the portable gaming consoles.   It's got a patent on just such a display, says Patently Apple, and we found it extremely interesting.   If this has to happen, then it'll surely befit the 10th anniversary edition, considering that Apple got the patent in 2014 but managed to keep it under wraps until November 2016.   What about the price? Apple seems to like the price-point it is at right now ($649; Dh2,599 and going all the way up to Dh3,899 for the 256GB 7 Plus model) although the 'Ferrari' is likely to set you back by much more.

That is why fans of the ultra light tablet are now craving for a new one. And, it looks like the iPad Air 3 could be coming soon along with the iPad Mini 5. Rumors have it that Apple will be unveiling a range of iPads this coming March. In the said rumors, this may include the upcoming iPad Air 3 along with the smaller iPad Mini.

However, to date, thereare no mentions of the said release other than the initial reports made earlier. iPad Air 2 (via apple.com) It could be that Apple is actually considering getting rid of the iPad Mini line and repackage it as an ?iPad Pro. This could be due to the ever increasing threat that Microsoft is posing to Apple?s iPad line of products. READ ALSO: Apple iOS 10.3 Developers Beta Releasing This Month; Users to Finally Get ?Dark Mode? There have been reports that many Apple users are switching to Microsoft especially after the MacBook Pro 2016 release. As of late, there has been an influx of consumers opting for Microsoft?s exchange program, according to a Microsoft blog. This could potentially hurt Apple?s revenue as well as the iPad product line. For many years, Apple dominates the majority of tablet share. However, with the recent arrival of other worthy competitors like the Surface Pro, Apple?s crown is now for the taking. READ ALSO: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Set for Q1 2017 Release; Possibly at MWC 2017 There is a chance that instead of the iPad Air 3, consumers will see only the iPad Pro.

Nevertheless, these reports are, in the end, nothing but rumors. Although, in retrospect, some of these rumors can be true as many have seen in the past.

James and Bethany Modisette were driving on the highway with their two daughters on Christmas eve in 2014 when they were forced to stop their Camry ahead of a blockage caused by police activity.  Driving behind them, Garrett Wilhelm failed to stop and his SUV rammed into the car at 105km/h, tearing it apart and riding up over the top. Bethany and the older daughter, Isabella, were injured but managed to escape the car, while James and the younger daughter, Moriah, had to be extracted by rescue workers. Moriah, who was strapped into a booster seat at the time of the crash, was flown to a nearby hospital but died. The lawsuit filed by the couple in California Superior Court in Santa Clara County claims that Apple failed “to warn users that the product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused” or to instruct on its safe usage. They are suing Apple for damages on the basis that the electronics giant failed to install and implement a “safer, alternative design” for FaceTime that would have helped to prevent a driver from using the app while travelling at highway speed, ABC News reported. “As a result of that distraction, his Toyota 4Runner, while travelling at full highway speed (65 mph), struck the Modisette family car from behind, causing it to be propelled forward, rotate, and come to a final rest at an angle facing the wrong direction in the right lane of traffic,” the suit says. “Wilhelm told police at the scene that he was using FaceTime on his iPhone at the time of the crash, and the police located his iPhone at the crash scene with the FaceTime application still active,” the suit claims. The Modisettes contend in their suit that, “At the time of the collision in question, the iPhone utilised by Wilhelm contained the necessary hardware (to be configured with software) to automatically disable or ‘lock-out’ the ability to use [FaceTime] … However, Apple failed to configure the iPhone to automatically ‘lock-out ‘ the ability to utilise ‘FaceTime’ while driving at highway speeds, despite having the technical capability to do so.” Recommended for you Tonto Dikeh Unimpressed By Husband’s SUV Gift To Their Son Peace Corps To Recruit 2,000 Youths From Lagos 7 Tips To Keep Your Penis Clean And Healthy Troops Kill 13 Boko Haram Terrorists In Borno Clearance Operations American Pastor Gifts Muyiwa Ademola Brand New Car Wilhelm was indicted on manslaughter charges by a grand jury in Denton County, Texas, according to the Denton Record-Chronicle.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Will Spotify save the music business? 2017-01-03 11:09 - Leila Abboud Post a comment 0 share: RELATED ARTICLES Apple to launch streaming music service? MTN unveils streaming music service E-cigarettes, Spotify enter UK inflation basket Paris - Outside Sweden, Daniel Ek isn't a household name. That will probably change this year when the 33-year-old seeks to turn Spotify, the music streaming business he founded a decade ago in Stockholm, into a publicly traded company that could be worth $8 bn. The success of the initial public offering will hinge on whether investors believe Ek can turn rapid revenue growth into sustainable profit at some point in the not-so-distant future. The soft-spoken, shaven-headed Swede must overcome concerns that Spotify is a mere distribution channel, beholden to the big three music labels whose pricey licensing fees are a serious constraint. READ: Spotify plans to enter web video business - report He also needs to convince the market that Spotify won't wither under competition with wealthy rivals like Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., who happily subsidize music services to sell more stuff. So far, Ek has managed the challenges well. Spotify's business model is based on selling $10 a month subscriptions, although it does have a free service on which it sells advertising. He's become adept at delicate negotiations with music labels that would’ve put off someone less determined. Ek has also overcome early errors in the shift to mobile and ensured that Apple’s streaming service didn’t derail growth. Along the way, he's realized too that running a company with more than 1,500 employees often means doing boring stuff that doesn't come naturally. Wearing a black t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan Suits Suck, Ek recently told a tech conference audience that he'd learned to love human resources and good enterprise software. Spotify does have a few crowd-pleasers for its IPO: a popular brand, strong revenue growth and more than 40 million paid subscribers (double the number at Apple). Sales rose almost 80% to $2.03bn in 2015, according to accounts published in Luxembourg. They're expected to have risen another 50% in 2016, according to a July Bloomberg News report. It's still making losses, though. READ: Spotify rockets to 15 million paying users Spotify’s biggest weakness is paying out most of its revenue to labels and publishers for the right to play their music. Its cost of revenue has hovered between 81 and 83 percent in the past three years mostly because of those royalties.   That means its gross margin of 17-19% is miles below the norm for a zippy tech company and more akin to an old-school retailer.   Spotify fans say it can be profitable once the subscriber base is big enough to absorb the royalties and other expenses such as R&D and marketing. But reaching profit will need big improvements, some of which are not totally in Ek's control such as maintaining pricing power. Either Spotify cuts licensing costs by wrangling better terms from the labels or it will have to spend less on other things. By way of comparison, Netflix - the most successful subscription-based digital content business in terms of its 92 million customers - is on course to have brought in $8.8bn of revenue and $348m in operating profit in 2016, according to Bloomberg data. It has a 32% gross margin, earns $108 a year per user in the US and $97 overseas. According to Gadfly calculations, for Spotify to get to $300m in operating profit, it will need to increase its paid subscriber base to 60 million, lift the gross margin to 30 percent, and boost average revenue per user to $100 annually from about $72 last year. So still a lot of work to do. And if Netflix-like valuations are driving Ek, he has a long way to go. Netflix trades at about 5 times forward revenue. A similar multiple would imply a $15bn valuation for Spotify's IPO. That seems about as likely as a reconciliation tour between pop music's arch-enemies Kanye West and Taylor Swift. Ek has people rooting for him, though. The future of the music business may hang on Spotify. It already brings in some 10% of all revenue for the labels, and is large enough to help offset the power of the tech giants. That's a lot of weight on Ek's young shoulders.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Made in India iPhone: Apple partner Wistron seeks to expand Bengaluru smartphone plant Made in India iPhone: Apple partner Wistron seeks to expand Bengaluru smartphone plant Apple setting up production in India would be a significant win for the government, and its #MakeinIndia campaign By: Reuters | Published:January 3, 2017 2:32 pm Made in India iPhones: Wistron Corp, which counts Apple Inc among its customers, has applied for permission to expand its plant in the Indian city of Bengaluru, Smartphone component maker Wistron Corp, which counts Apple Inc among its customers, has applied for permission to expand its plant in the Indian city of Bengaluru, a high-ranking regional government official said on Monday. The Taiwanese contract manufacturer has also requested that its application be fast-tracked, the official at the state government of Karnataka in southern India told Reuters. The move comes less than two weeks after the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was in talks with India’s federal government about the possibility of assembling products in one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets, where the US tech firm controls less than 2 percent. Apple setting up production in India would be a significant win for the government which has embarked on a major campaign to attract global manufacturers under the slogan “Make in India”. “Wistron has approached us to expedite certain clearances with regards to the augmentation and expansion of its existing unit,” said the official, who was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified. Whether Apple will begin manufacturing in India is unknown, but Wistron’s desire to expand “pretty quickly” could represent “several steps in that direction,” the official said.

The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields. At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle. The site will be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 per cent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails. Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees. The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness centre, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities. Parking garages above and belowground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor centre offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be US$5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 per cent of the company’s US$215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld. The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Samsung will confirm battery was main cause of Note 7 fires, source claims Samsung to disclose Note 7 probe results on Jan 23 E-waste rising dangerously in Asia, UN study shows Facebook announces 'fake news' offensive in Germany Nintendo takes big gamble with Switch’s split personality (VIDEO) As labour force shrinks, China turns to robots WhatsApp vulnerable to snooping, report says Nintendo’s Switch to go on sale March 3 for US$300 (VIDEO) Bionic woman: Chinese robot turns on the charm Get the pink coins!

By Leila Abboud. Added by Agency Staff on 3 January 2017. Saved under Editor's pick Tags: Amazon, Apple, Daniel Ek, Spotify Tweet Spotify on an iPhone Outside Sweden, Daniel Ek isn’t a household name. That will probably change this year when the 33-year-old seeks to turn Spotify, the music streaming business he founded a decade ago in Stockholm, into a publicly traded company that could be worth US$8bn. The success of the initial public offering will hinge on whether investors believe Ek can turn rapid revenue growth into sustainable profit at some point in the not-so-distant future. The soft-spoken, shaven-headed Swede must overcome concerns that Spotify is a mere distribution channel, beholden to the big three music labels whose pricey licensing fees are a serious constraint. He also needs to convince the market that Spotify won’t wither under competition with wealthy rivals like Apple and Amazon.com, which happily subsidise music services to sell more stuff. So far, Ek has managed the challenges well. Spotify’s business model is based on selling $10/month subscriptions, although it does have a free service on which it sells advertising. He’s become adept at delicate negotiations with music labels that would’ve put off someone less determined. Ek has also overcome early errors in the shift to mobile and ensured that Apple’s streaming service didn’t derail growth. Along the way, he’s realised, too, that running a company with more than 1 500 employees often means doing boring stuff that doesn’t come naturally. Wearing a black t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan Suits Suck, Ek recently told a tech conference audience that he’d learned to love human resources and good enterprise software. Spotify does have a few crowd-pleasers for its IPO: a popular brand, strong revenue growth and more than 40m paid subscribers (double the number at Apple). Sales rose almost 80% to almost €2bn in 2015, according to accounts published in Luxembourg. They’re expected to have risen another 50% in 2016, according to a July Bloomberg News report. It’s still making losses, though. Spotify’s biggest weakness is paying out most of its revenue to labels and publishers for the right to play their music. Its cost of revenue has hovered between 81% and 83% in the past three years mostly because of those royalties. That means its gross margin of 17-19% is miles below the norm for a zippy tech company and more akin to an old-school retailer. Daniel Ek Spotify fans say it can be profitable once the subscriber base is big enough to absorb the royalties and other expenses such as R&D and marketing. But reaching profit will need big improvements, some of which are not totally in Ek’s control such as maintaining pricing power. Either Spotify cuts licensing costs by wrangling better terms from the labels or it will have to spend less on other things. By way of comparison, Netflix — the most successful subscription-based digital content business in terms of its 92m customers — is on course to have brought in $8,8bn of revenue and $348m in operating profit in 2016, according to Bloomberg data. It has a 32% gross margin, earns $108/year per user in the US and $97 overseas. For Spotify to get to $300m in operating profit, it will need to increase its paid subscriber base to 60m, lift the gross margin to 30% and boost average revenue per user to $100 annually from about $72 last year. So, still a lot of work to do. And if Netflix-like valuations are driving Ek, he has a long way to go. Netflix trades at about 5x forward revenue. A similar multiple would imply a $15bn valuation for Spotify’s IPO. That seems about as likely as a reconciliation tour between pop music’s arch-enemies Kanye West and Taylor Swift. Ek has people rooting for him, though. The future of the music business may hang on Spotify. It already brings in some 10% of all revenue for the labels, and is large enough to help offset the power of the tech giants. That’s a lot of weight on Ek’s young shoulders.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 24Big price hikes at Cell C 12WhatsApp has ‘security backdoor’ 10Cell C blames rand for price hikes 6CSIR, Eskom at odds over renewables 6Backspace: ‘Women in tech’ Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Apple Engineers Are Losing Interest In iPhones Technology 42 0 0 January 3, 2017 The Spirit Of Steve Jobs Continues But Is The New Apple A Pearl? Apple Engineers Are Losing Interest In iPhones Kim McLendon Steve Jobs, the late CEO of Apple was a free thinker and indisputably a genius. Known for his Zen Buddhist spirituality and his eye for design, Jobs believed that form should follow function. Apple has changed quite a lot since Steve Jobs formed the ideals that influenced the company’s beginnings. The Balance shares a Steve Jobs quote from before iPhones or iPads. “Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It’s not about money. It’s about the people you have, how you’re led, and how much you get it.” iPhone and iPad now dominate the thoughts of Apple engineers, but in the beginning, Apple/Mac was about all sorts of proprietary innovations that were not compatible with IBM PCs. Macintosh had its own separate operating system for PCs. This evolved into the current iOS for iPhone 7. Steve Jobs was always on the cutting edge of technology and design. In those days, Apple was carving new frontiers and everything was about innovation by design. Slideshare quotes Steve Jobs. “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Father of the iPhone and iPad, Steve Jobs founded Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976, according to Bio. Jobs took a decade-long hiatus from the company in 1985 but later returned to head Apple and create iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Until his death in 2011, Steve Jobs led a cutting-edge technology company, founded on Steve Job’s vision. Steve Jobs, father of the iPhone, iPad, iPod and the Apple Mac. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] The iPhone has dominated Apple technology since Steve Jobs death. Various upgrades to Steve Jobs’ iPhone and iPad innovations have not been the product of group thought, but rather solitary workers, busy with different aspects of the project, feeding their results into a central management. iPhones, though, have gotten boring, according to Steve Jobs’ proteges. Scores of top Apple engineers grew tired of secrecy and a lack of team efforts. Apple kept secrets even among their own staff. iPhone engineers, though working on related iPhone projects, could not exchange ideas or even discuss their own projects with one another. This led to discontent. Seven-year Apple iPhone veteran Rishabh Bhargava, who used to work on various iPhone projects but left Apple Corporation for Pearl, explained his dissatisfaction with the iPhone makers to the New York Times. “At Apple, there are a few people in the company that decide what needs to be done, and everyone else is executing. Rarely do you get the chance to be the people that decide the problems that need to be solved.” Apple is losing talent to a new company called Pearl, who work with technological upgrades for cars. More than 50 former iPhone, iPad and iPod engineers now work for the 80-employee Pearl company. Former Apple engineer Bryson Gardner, who spent seven years developing iPod and iPhone, explains what he likes about Pearl. “We are looking to decentralize the decision-making. We want to grow a bunch of leaders in our company.” Steve Jobs holds an iPad. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Perhaps Apple engineers, tired of endlessly tweaking iPhone technology, are truly representative of Steve Jobs’ free and innovative spirit. Jobs dropped out of college to follow his heart and forge his own path. Later, Steve Jobs left the country to explore spirituality in India as explained in the Inquisitr. Steve even left Apple for over 10 years, though some say he was pushed out. Today former Apple engineers embark on a new project. Pearl is creating electronic safety features for existing vehicles. While Tesla works to create the cars of the future, Pearl works to give existing cars some of the same advantages. The former Apple engineers working for Pearl are trying to make life better and safer for ordinary people. Their work for Pearl is far different than simply tweaking iPhones. They are inventing. The current Pearl projects include rear view backup cameras called rear vision that hide away under the license plate and self-parking features. Initially Apple Corp. wanted to create a car called Titan to compete with Tesla, but opted out in the end. Then Pearl took on a life of its own apparently as the Steve Jobs fledglings left the nest to form a new automotive tech company.

Problem Solving | 02 Jan 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (43) Sierra PDF Problems Get Worse in 10.12.2 by Adam C. Engst One of the first problems with macOS 10.12 Sierra revolved around PDFs created by Fujitsu’s ScanSnap scanners (see “ScanSnap Users Should Delay Sierra Upgrades,” 20 September 2016). Those problems turned out to be less severe than initially feared (see “ScanSnap Conflicts with Sierra Easily Avoided,” 3 October 2016), and Apple resolved them in macOS 10.12.1 (see “macOS 10.12.1 Sierra, watchOS 3.1, and tvOS 10.0.1 Mostly Fix Bugs,” 24 October 2016). Now, however, it seems Sierra’s PDF-related problems go deeper, and you should exercise caution when editing PDFs with Preview. The first I heard that Sierra’s PDF-related problems might affect more than ScanSnap scanners came in a comment left on one of those articles on 26 October 2016. Developer Craig Landrum, who founded the document management system company Mindwrap, said: The primary problem with Sierra with respect to PDFs is that Apple chose to rewrite the PDFKit framework in macOS 10.12 and it broke a number of things that PDF-related developers relied upon (I write scan-to-PDF software and know other developers who were impacted). Software that uses third-party PDF libraries probably runs fine, but those of us in the development community who relied upon Apple’s PDFKit library were really slammed — and we have no way to fix the problems ourselves. There have been numerous bug reports sent to Apple on the several serious issues found with PDFKit and we hope Apple addresses them in an upcoming point release. Since Craig Landrum’s comment came after the release of 10.12.1 and the fixes for ScanSnap, I filed his criticism of PDFKit away as something that likely had been true but was no longer. However, throughout the next few months, additional complaints kept surfacing. Eric Bönisch-Volkmann, head of DEVONtechnologies, told me that they’ve spent a significant amount of development time working around Sierra’s PDF-related bugs in DEVONthink. Christian Grunenberg, DEVONthink’s lead developer, characterized the rewritten version of PDFKit in Sierra as “a work in progress,” saying: Apple wants to use a common foundation for both iOS and macOS. However, it was released way too early, and for the first time (at least in my experience) Apple deprecated several features without caring about compatibility. And to make things worse, lots of former features are now broken or not implemented at all, meaning that we had to add lots of workarounds or implement stuff on our own. And there’s still work left to be done. 10.12.2 introduces new issues (it seems that Apple wants to fix at least the broken compatibility now) and of course fixed almost none of the other issues. It’s not only DEVONthink — a lot of other applications (such as EndNote, Skim, Bookends, and EagleFiler) are also affected. In fact, Michael Tsai, developer of EagleFiler, just published a blog post confirming his problems with PDFKit: I ran into a lot of PDF bugs in macOS 10.12.0. None have been fixed, as far as I can tell, and I’ve already filed two Radars for new issues in 10.12.2. It’s sad that basic functionality remains broken for so long — especially given that PDF was an area where Apple used to excel. More concerning, and this is what finally pushed me to track down all these reports and write this article, is that the recently released macOS 10.12.2 has introduced a serious new bug related to PDFKit. Brooks Duncan of the DocumentSnap site published a note from one of his readers that warns that the OCR text layer added to scanned PDFs by Fujitsu’s ScanSnap software will be deleted if you edit the PDF in Preview. Eric Bönisch-Volkmann confirmed this, saying ruefully: 10.12.2 fixes a few bugs but kills the OCR text layer in PDFs. We worked around the earlier bugs in DEVONthink 2.9.8 and will address 10.12.2’s new problems in the upcoming 2.9.9. But yes, as soon as you edit a PDF in Preview the text layer is gone. Our customers are delighted. Although the DocumentSnap reader said that the problem didn’t affect PDFs scanned and OCRed with other solutions, Brooks Duncan was able to reproduce the problem with scans made from both ScanSnap and Doxie scanners; he noted that both rely on the ABBYY FineReader engine. Sonny Software’s Jon Ashwell, developer of the Bookends bibliography app, expressed significant frustration as well, saying: We’ve been trying very hard to work around perfectly good code that was broken in Sierra. Versions 10.12.0 and 10.12.1 were bad, but 10.12.2 was a disaster for us, causing Bookends to crash when displaying PDFs with annotations. We’ve worked around that, but in the process had to shut down PDF annotations while we look for workarounds. I’ve filed a number of radars with Apple, two of which were closed as duplicates. In another case, I was asked to provide our app, but after doing so there has been only silence. I’ve never seen such a sorry case of sloppy code and indifference from Apple. Problems with PDF annotations have plagued other developers as well, to judge from irate posts in Apple’s developer forums. Christian Grunenberg laid the blame for the problems at Apple’s feet: Apple supports only a subset of the PDF specification, and that support has always been buggy. For instance, PDF documents containing Eastern European characters created by the older ABBYY FineReader 8 engine are corrupted by PDFKit after editing. And issues reported by Peter Steinberger (author of the PDF framework PSPDFKit) were simply closed with the response that Apple didn’t intend to fix them. Apps that don’t use PDFKit are immune from these problems, of course, but only to the extent that their PDFs aren’t shared more widely and edited in Preview. Greg Scown of Smile told me that PDFpen operates independently of PDFKit, but bugs in Preview impact PDFpen customers whose document recipients use Preview rather than PDFpen to view or edit them. We have not had reports of PDFpen causing data loss of documents’ OCR layers. Interestingly, Preview itself may suffer less from bugs in PDFKit than third-party apps. Michael Tsai said that some of the bugs he has seen don’t manifest themselves in Preview, suggesting that Apple’s Preview team is aware of the problems and is choosing to work around them rather than getting them fixed in PDFKit itself. It pains me to say this, speaking as the co-author of “Take Control of Preview,” but I have to recommend that Sierra users avoid using Preview to edit PDF documents until Apple fixes these bugs. If editing a PDF in Preview is unavoidable, be sure to work only on a copy of the file and retain the original in case editing introduces corruption of any sort. Smile’s PDFpen is the obvious alternative for PDF manipulation of all sorts (and for documentation, we have “Take Control of PDFpen 8” too), although Adobe’s Acrobat DC is also an option, albeit an expensive one. In the meantime, we’ll be watching closely to see which of these PDF-related bugs Apple fixes in 10.12.3, which is currently in beta testing. Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Take Control of PDFpen 8 Polish your PDFs with Smile's PDFpen, for a fraction of what Adobe Acrobat costs! Michael E. Cohen explains how you can create, combine, edit, annotate, and protect PDFs. Also learn how to perform and edit OCR, fill out forms, sign forms digitally, make interactive forms, and much more. Covers Mac and iOS versions! Take Control of Preview Apple’s Preview app is bundled with every Mac and yet many Mac users have only a shallow understanding of what it’s capable of. Mac experts Adam Engst and Josh Centers have plumbed Preview’s depths to create a cheerful, colorful book that explains dozens of techniques for importing, viewing, editing, and converting images in Preview. It also puts you in control of reading, annotating, manipulating, and encrypting PDFs.   PDFpen is your Swiss Army knife for PDFs. Slice and dice with tools for reviewing, editing, signing, redacting, and exporting to Word. With v.8 use digital signatures, and view file & audio attachments.

It turns out that Apple rewrote the underlying PDFKit in Sierra and introduced numerous bugs that are bedeviling Mac developers and users alike. The quick takeaway? Don’t edit PDFs in Sierra’s Preview for now! Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Jonathan  2017-01-02 12:51 PDF Expert is the best PDF reader/annotations tool I have. PDFPen is good for OCR though. Reply Dave Kitabjian  2017-01-02 23:26 Actually, you heard at least the speculation from me before you heard it from Craig Landrum, when I posted: "We don't know if ScanSnap used OS X system libraries and APIs to perform their PDF rendering or if they used their own or those of a 3rd party. If the former, it's possible that this problem is not limited to ScanSnap generated PDFs, but will also affect other PDFs created on the Mac (eg, MS Office). But if ScanSnap "rolled their own" PDFs, then the problem may be limited to ScanSnap." http://tidbits.com/article/16810br/> ;-) I had a "bad feeling about this". And Michael Tsai is absolutely right that this is particularly painful because native PDF support was one of the foundational hallmarks of OS X and for the Sierra team to so royally screw this up is very "Apple Maps" of them. Truly unsettling. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-02 22:19 You were right on, as it turns out! Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-01-03 00:14 Sounds like another bit of evidence that Apple no longer cares about Mac users. No updates for desktop Macs, mediocre to dismal updates for MacBooks, increasingly buggy Mac OS software, etc. Reply Eddie  2017-01-03 01:39 Preview is a HORRIBLE application. It has never, in all my years of using Macs, NOT ruined a PDF by making it unsearchable. Also, large documents tend to cause frequent beachballs and crashing. I highly encourage users to NEVER use preview for documents they care about and need to search regularly. (I.e. User guides, technical documents, etc.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 09:57 Preview is far from perfect, but you're overstating the criticisms against it. We pay a LOT of attention to Preview because of our Take Control books (which are long, complex documents where searching is key), and it is generally fine. Long ago, using the Reduce Size Quartz filter would delete bookmarks, but that was fixed. For most people, most of the time, Preview is just a PDF viewer, and for that, it's usually fine. I'm sure there are PDFs out there that it can't handle, but that's not common. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-01-07 02:32 Adobe Reader will spin beachballs with even moderately sized documents. With large documents you might as well go brew yourself a cup of coffee while you wait. That said, I prefer Adobe Reader to Preview for reading PDFs because it retains my view preferences. And, of course, with it PDFs are readily searchable. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-01-07 09:41 What do you mean? Preview can also search PDFs. Reply Glenn Marston  2017-01-03 07:17 I wonder if the new PDFKit explains why the ability to fax was removed in Sierra. Some scoff at faxing. However, for many firms in the medical and legal fields, fax is the only electronic transmission accepted. The US Robotics Model 5630 USB fax modem works great through El Capitan. In Sierra, it and other fax modems are unsupported. The menu selection for faxing is "Fax PDF." Is PDFKit the cause for loss of faxing in Sierra? Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 09:59 No, I don't think so. We covered that in: http://tidbits.com/article/16826 And several readers dove in even more deeply in the comments. The removal of faxing was related to the removal of other low-level software. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-01-07 02:36 Perhaps, but it's of a piece with the dumbing down of PDFKit. Apple has a long tradition of crippling or deleting useful features and software (Aperture). But I'm trying not to rant on TidBITS since I wrote a long e-mail to Tim Cook. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 10:30 There's a telling thread about this problem as it relates to the app Skim. https://sourceforge.net/p/skim-app/bugs/1109/ Reply Chris  2017-01-03 11:46 Preview and PDF viewing in general has been a mess since around 10.10, possibly 10.9. Somebody at Apple screwed up on the math that resizes the PDF content in the window in Preview, which made it blurry for 2 years before finally semi-fixing it in 10.12. Notice the blurry text and weird hairline border around the page: https://puu.sh/ktaeN.png It's semi-fixed in 10.12, but it still happens sometimes in places like Quick Look and Safari especially when you try to zoom in: https://puu.sh/ktayf.png I tried filling a PDF form the other day, then Preview crashed and corrupted the PDF with it. Luckily file revisions still work and I was able to use that. It seems Apple keeps wanting to rewrite perfectly functioning code, and they end up introducing bugs in everything they touch. Mail.app, discoveryd, Preview and PDF, various bugs in the Finder and Safari... It's starting to get pretty annoying dealing with new bugs popping up in every release and almost never getting fixed properly. Reply Damon  2017-01-05 06:00 yes has hallmarks of the discoveryd fiasco, doesn't it? Reply Tom Jordahl  2017-01-03 12:32 Tidbits continually ignores the very fine, FREE, Adobe software that is *the* gold standard for viewing PDFs - Acrobat Reader. And for anyone that is editing PDFs for any serious purpose, Acrobat Pro is the clear choice. As the creator of PDFs, Adobe doesn't just throw compatibility to the wind like Apple does. I know Adobe isn't a Tidbits sponsor and other companies are, but IMHO discussions about PDF should not routinely dismiss the Adobe tools (especially the free ones) as too expensive to consider. Full disclosure, I work for Adobe, but not on Acrobat, so I am slightly more than just an Adobe fan. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-01-03 14:03 I gave up on Adobe Acrobat Reader years ago because it was a slow, bloated pig with new security vulnerabilities regularly discovered. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 17:16 The context of noting that Acrobat DC is expensive was in relation to editing PDFs, which Acrobat Reader won't do. And Acrobat DC is in a completely different price ballpark than PDFpen. We do use Acrobat Pro XI for Take Control work, but we need Creative Cloud for InDesign as well. Newer versions of Acrobat won't work for us because essential plugins like Aerialist aren't compatible with Acrobat DC on the Mac, forcing us to stay with the old version. And, I have to say, I find even XI to be a UI step backward from earlier versions, since most of the controls are hidden and have to brought out manually and added to a custom sidebar. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-01-07 03:02 I agree. I don't like the UI in the newer versions of Adobe Reader (it hasn't been Acrobat Reader for many years now, guys, but I guess old habits die hard). I try to avoid the Adobe Reader DC versions. For one thing their version numbers are a mess, with DC this and DC that. It's apparently up to version 15 now. I'm using Adobe Reader 11.0.18, which I think is the last pre-DC version. It seems to work find in Sierra. That said, Reader has always required at least a little tinkering in the toolbar, depending on what features you like to use. Compared to you guys, though, my needs are pretty basic, like reading Take Control e-books. TidBITS is good enough to make them available in other formats, ePub for iBooks and Mobi for Kindle. But, like I said, old habits die hard. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, which is sadly not part of either Adobe's or Apple's philosophical tool kit. It seems to me that the DC versions of Reader try too hard to get you to use Adobe's cloud services. But, since I'm not using Creative Cloud, I haven't yet been drawn into their airy-fairy ecosystem. The CS 6 apps work OK in Sierra. Again I'm no longer into fancy document production, which means I can avoid both Adobe's and Apple's cloud briar patches. For now, anyway. Reply Michael  2017-01-03 12:37 PDF Expert has been mentioned in this thread; it's been my default PDF reader on OS X since its release (because of my experience with the iOS version), and I can confirm that editing/annotating and highlighting does not remove the text layer and keeps the PDF file searchable. Reply Vaclav Slavik  2017-01-03 13:24 Rendering of signatures is similarly broken since 10.12.2. Filing radars with Apple has no observable effect. Reply Pavel Sakhatskyi  2017-01-03 14:10 Hi guys, I'm Paul from PDF Expert team. Thanks for mentioning our app. Since I see numerous concerns arising around this issue, I’d love to assure you that there’s nothing to worry about if you use PDF Expert. We don't rely on PDF Kit and have our own file saving mechanics. Your PDFs are in good hands :) Cheers Reply PT  2017-01-03 14:25 Since East European characters are mentioned, I'll jump in by saying that East Asian characters are also not searchable in a pdf if exported in Safari. Selecting them in Preview and you'll only see a series of blocks, rather than the characters themselves. I first notice this problem in Mavericks and Apple never got around to fixing it. Reply John Baxter   2017-01-03 15:29 My Macs are too old for Sierra so I'm still on El Capitan. The Preview I have is version 8.1 (877.7). 1. What Preview version is on up-to-date Sierra machines? 2. Am I worried about PDFs being corrupted? 3. Things like this PDFKit problem will drive me to Windows. (I like Windows 10, so that isn't a problem for me.) I won't make that call until we see what's happening with desktop Macs, but PDFKit makes it more likely. (My Apple ][ serial 537 is in the attic crying at this moment.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-03 16:43 Sierra's Preview is 9.0. If you're not using Sierra, there's no need to worry, since you're not using the rewritten PDFKit. Reply Paul Clark  2017-01-03 18:16 the only workaround currently is using the adobe app to view / edit Reply Mike C  2017-01-03 21:07 Is it possible to replace the new Sierra PDFKit with an earlier version from El Cap? Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-04 10:26 Technically, yes, but then Sierra's Preview may not work properly. There was discussion of doing this in https://sourceforge.net/p/skim-app/bugs/1109/ Reply mnott  2017-01-04 14:27 Actually I documented this - see my link below - and really, the issues you get appear to be much less than the issues you solve. It is not that "Sierra" isn't working properly, the only thing I did observe is that sometimes Preview may refuse to launch. But then I've also included a little script which you can call at runtime to just switch to the newer version of PDFKit. I considered the problems gone after a hot fix, and hence no longer recommended doing that, but apparently they came back. The only "real" drawback is that if you want to keep switching, you need to keep rootless disabled. Well, we didn't have that one for years, so I don't really care. Reply Simon   2017-01-04 01:07 It's not just Sierra Preview that's buggy. I have issues in El Cap Preview as well. For example, in PDF forms for some reason Preview will not display checked boxes. Open the same PDF in Adobe Reader and the checkboxes are checked. But you'd never know judging from Preview. There checkboxes just appear empty. I would have switched to Adobe Reader if it weren't such a pig. A real shame Apple can't get its act together with Preview. Superior PDF handling used to be one of the major OS X advantages. /sigh Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-04 10:29 This isn't generally true of Preview; when Josh and I wrote "Take Control of Preview," we had no trouble with checkboxes being checked. Try the IRS form 1040, for instance. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf That said, PDF is a rather complex format, and it's entirely possible that some apps (including Preview) get it wrong, either in writing it out or reading it in. So I'm not surprised that Preview might have trouble with some PDFs. Acrobat Reader will be the gold standard for interpreting PDF. Reply Simon   2017-01-04 10:54 Ironically I was having a lot of trouble with checkboxes with a US Government form. I-864 actually. Reply mnott  2017-01-04 14:20 This so seriously sucks, as shown on the Skim forum. Apple is pushing back their most competent developers - perhaps because they're called variants of Christia(a)n? Anyway. Preview already got so much worse in like Yosemite when annotating became a multi click adventure. Now it sometimes just OOMs. And PDFKit breaks about everywhere. Apple appears to get really everything seriously wrong these days. Laptops that for no reason drop ports and battery life, an OS that sucks each version more, etc. - and nobody from Apple seems to care as long as IPhones sell like sliced bread. I've created not really a solution for the PDFKit problem, essentially documenting every single step you need to take if you want to restore an older version. Maybe this helps someone: http://www.mnott.de/how-to-workaround-the-fucked-up-pdfkit-in-sierra/ HTH, M Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-04 14:41 Thanks for the link to the instructions! Reply Damon  2017-01-05 06:03 Excellent tech journalism, thanks :-) Reply Stussy  2017-01-05 18:57 10.12.3 Beta 2 FIXES all the issues, well the ones that I've tested! I can now view all my exiting PDFs, scan new ones and save them as encrypted and re-open them AND scanning with OCR the invisible text layer is preserved!! Install it now!!! :) Reply Stefan  2017-01-06 08:00 I still can reproduce at least one issue: Open PDF file generated by the ScanSnap software, edit&save it – OCR text is gone. Apple needs to do some more homework. Reply Deanna  2017-01-05 20:37 All of a sudden I can't view real estate documents as pdf. Half the data of the page is missing. I've downloaded Adobe Reader as a partial workaround but this update is a mess! Electronic signing doesn't work, docs can't be viewed...I am hoping for an update soon. From what I read here this is exactly the problem. Reply strumsky  2017-01-09 23:11 I haven't seen anyone here commenting about Safari crashing when using Print function to create/save as a pdf file (rather than printing a document). This has happened ever since Sierra for me and others in our company. Perhaps it's related? Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-10 10:55 Seems to work OK here... Reply Tom Robinson   2017-01-10 16:37 10.12.2 broke the display of the table of contents in Preview for me, but only for some PDFs: instead of chapter, etc., titles it now displays strings of garbage. Reply Stussy  2017-01-14 16:15 Beta 3 seems to have fixed ALL the issues! And heck, Beta 4 just came out! Reply Stussy  2017-01-14 17:23 Beta 4 seems fine too Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-14 17:45 The word I heard from a developer was that Beta 3 fixed the problem with Preview deleting the OCR text layer when editing a PDF, but none of the other issues with PDF handling in Sierra. We'll see what happens when 10.12.3 actually ships. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed). Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. The initial problems ScanSnap had in Sierra were just the beginning. It turns out that Apple rewrote the underlying PDFKit in Sierra and introduced numerous bugs that are bedeviling Mac developers and users alike. The quick takeaway? Don’t edit PDFs in Sierra’s Preview for now! Add a comment  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Adam C. Engst TidBITS is copyright © 2017 TidBITS Publishing Inc.

You know, those messages that pop up alerting you to things like email, Facebook friend requests, text messages, or a Twitter response. Lots of applications use these push notifications and with the release of iOS 5, Apple has included something called Notification Center, a centralized hub for your notifications. Advertisement You can access it by swiping down from the top of the screen although you probably knew that already. Well, for some of you, these notifications might be more annoying then useful and if that’s the case, we’re here to help you get rid of them once and for all, if that’s really what you want to do. We must warn you, the process is a bit tedious as Apple now requires you to disable push notifications for each individual application. But luckily, you’ll only have to do it once. Advertisement 1) Open up Settings on your iPhone. Advertisement 2) Head to Notifications. 3) If  you’re able to scroll down for what seems like an eternity, you’re on the right page. Apple has grouped this page into two categories. The first is In Notification Center. These are, as you may have surmised, the applications that currently pop up in your Notification Center. There are a bunch of them included in there by default. Advertisement If you want to disable them from popping up in the Notification Center, you’ll want to go into each one and flip the Notification Center toggle to Off. 4) The second is Not In Notification Center. This is where the apps that you disable will go. By the end, every single app you have on your iPhone should show up in this section. 5) Now here is the terrible part. You’re going to have to go app by app to ensure that push notifications are turned off. Some, like Facebook, appear within your Settings. Advertisement Go in, scroll down to Push Notifications, and flick them all to off. That’s just one example. Other applications will require you to open them, and then head to the Settings within the app. Advertisement If you have a lot of apps, this could take awhile. 6) Four and a half weeks later, after you’ve gone into each individual apps Settings, your iPhone should be void of any notifications popping up and disrupting things. It might sound kind of scary but after awhile, you’ll enjoy the tranquility. 7) You’re close, but you’re not done yet. You’ll also want to disable Wi-Fi network notifications. You can find out how to do that by heading here. 8) Also, quick side note. Often times, after installing them, apps will prompt you and ask if you want to enable Push Notifications. You’ll want to say no. This will help keep your notifications silenced going forward. 14 Responses 07/13/2012 Kit Reply Thank you! 10/08/2012 CREED Reply Thanks u but how can turn the update notification on the settings app 11/14/2012 FalconFlyer Reply thanks some of my apps kept getting daily notifications and would go off at like 2:am, hopefully they wont now. 07/22/2013 asdf Reply unfortunately every time you update apps (and most apps update at least once a week) the notification setting is reverted to ON. so you’ll have to do this every week. horrible design imo. 08/23/2013 Doug Hansen Reply What asdf said and, i have apps that reside in my “Not in notification center” that still give me pops. I have just resigned myself to it. 11/11/2013 bwilkie74 Reply The notification that pops up when you add iMessage to all apple devices. How do you stop that 07/14/2015 Teresa Wood Reply Please help I haven’t got Facebook on my iPhone but I got it on my iPad every time I get a notification on my pad my iPhone goes off…..

James and Bethany Modisette were driving on the highway in Texas with their two daughters on Christmas eve in 2014 when they were forced to stop their Camry ahead of a blockage caused by police activity. Driving behind them, Garrett Wilhelm failed to stop and his SUV slammed into the car at 105km/h, tearing it apart and riding up over the top. Bethany and the older daughter, Isabella, were injured but managed to escape the car, while James and the younger daughter, Moriah, had to be extracted by rescue workers. Moriah, who was strapped into a booster seat at the time of the crash, was flown to a nearby hospital but died. The lawsuit filed by the Texas couple in California Superior Court in Santa Clara County claims that Apple failed "to warn users that the product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused" or to instruct on its safe usage. They are suing Apple for damages on the basis that the electronics giant failed to install and implement a "safer, alternative design" for FaceTime that would have helped to prevent a driver from using the app while travelling at highway speed, ABC News reported. "As a result of that distraction, his Toyota 4Runner, while travelling at full highway speed (65 mph), struck the Modisette family car from behind, causing it to be propelled forward, rotate, and come to a final rest at an angle facing the wrong direction in the right lane of traffic," the suit says. "Wilhelm told police at the scene that he was using FaceTime on his iPhone at the time of the crash, and the police located his iPhone at the crash scene with the FaceTime application still active," the suit claims. The Modisettes contend in their suit that, "At the time of the collision in question, the iPhone utilised by Wilhelm contained the necessary hardware (to be configured with software) to automatically disable or 'lock-out' the ability to use [FaceTime] ... However, Apple failed to configure the iPhone to automatically 'lock-out ' the ability to utilise 'FaceTime' while driving at highway speeds, despite having the technical capability to do so." Wilhelm was indicted on manslaughter charges by a grand jury in Denton County, Texas, according to the Denton Record-Chronicle. He has been out of jail on bail since August, and a jury trial in the case is scheduled for February 27.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 12:37 PM Apple misses a Beat with its Chinese New Year promotion by tan kit hoong Missing a Beat: Unfortunately the Apple Chinese New Year promotion of a free Beats headphone when you purchase selected products is not available in Malaysia. Apple sent out an e-mail to customers who previously purchased products on its online store today and as expected it's related to the upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations coming at the end of the month. The most notable of the promotions is that anyone who's purchasing an iMac, pre-2016 (that's the older, non-Touch Bar) MacBook Pro models, MacBook Air, Mac Pro, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus will receive a free pair of the Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones in red. Before you whip out your wallet and wait with bated breath for Jan 6 when the offer is supposed to happen, after a bit of digging and checking on the Apple Malaysia site ourselves, we found out that the promotion is only for selected countries – Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Singapore – and Malaysia is glaringly missing from the list. What a downer. Just to give you an idea, the Beats Solo3 Wireless is actually worth more than Apple's own AirPods and retails in Singapore for SG$398 (about RM1,235). The Beats Solo3 Wireless is also the first of the wireless headphones to go on sale with the integrated Apple W1 chip, which amongst other things, offers much improved battery efficiency – the Solo3 Wireless lasts up to 40 hours on a single charge. However, to be honest, we're not too surprised that the Chinese New Year promotion is not being offered here – Beats products are sold in the Apple online stores in Singapore, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, but not in Malaysia so it stands to reason that the promotion is not being extended here simply because the online store just doesn't sell these products here. So what do Malaysians get for the Chinese New Year promotion then?  Well nothing much really apart from the usual red-coloured covers for the iPad and iPad Pro models and watchbands for the Apple Watch.

The Packers may not recognize a few young Giants players who did not play much of a role in the visitors’ 23-16 loss at Lambeau Field on Oct. 9, players who likely will be relied on heavily by the Giants in Sunday’s NFC Wild Card playoff game in Green Bay. Pardon the Packers for not knowing a whole heck of a lot about running back Paul Perkins and cornerback Eli Apple, rookies who hardly played in the first meeting. Apple came back too soon from a hamstring injury and lasted only seven snaps before leaving with a strained groin. Perkins had yet to earn the trust of the coaching staff and was on the field for only 14 snaps on offense and carried the just ball twice for 9 yards, even though Rashad Jennings missed the game with a thumb injury. Bobby Rainey (now a seldom-used reserve) and Orleans Darkwa (on injured reserve) got the bulk of the rushing attempts in a game in which the Giants ran it only 15 times, with no success (43 yards). The Packers will see plenty of Perkins in the high-stakes rematch. He is coming off a career-high 21 rushing attempts for 102 yards in the 19-10 victory over the Redskins in the regular-season finale. Jennings, unlike the first game with the Packers, is healthy now, and it will be a 1-2 punch of Perkins and Jennings, most likely in that order. “If I perform well enough, everything will fall into line,’’ Perkins said. Eli Apple covers the Lions’ Marvin Jones in Week 15.Getty Images Apple is a big part of the Giants’ formidable secondary. He rarely comes off the field — he was in for all 55 defensive snaps at Washington — and allows Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie to display his skills as a slot corner. In the first game with the Packers, Rodgers-Cromartie played 61 snaps, but he was clearly hampered by a groin injury. At times in the first meeting, Aaron Rodgers was throwing against Leon Hall, a veteran who has played more safety late in the season; Trevin Wade, a reserve corner; and Michael Hunter, an undrafted rookie who is currently on the practice squad. The last time he tangled with the Giants, Rodgers did not perform like the MVP candidate he most assuredly is. He nearly threw as many incomplete passes (22) as he did completions (23) and, shockingly, he threw two interceptions, both picked off by Janoris Jenkins. That is wholly un-Rodgers like, considering in the Packers’ season-ending six-game winning streak Rodgers has 15 touchdown passes and no interceptions. Jason Pierre-Paul played 71 of the 80 defensive snaps in the Lambeau loss, but he will not play in this game coming off sports hernia surgery. The more some things change, the more others stay the same. Left tackle Ereck Flowers had a night to forget earlier this season in Green Bay, allowing two sacks and getting called for one holding penalty. In the first meeting, Eddie Lacy was the Packers’ leading ball-carrier with 81 yards. Lacy was placed on injured reserve Oct. 20, leaving Ty Montgomery to handle the running back chores, with some Christine Michael and fullback Aaron Ripkowski mixed in. “They had a couple of big backs last time we faced then and they ran the ball well with Eddie and with [James] Starks and Ripkowski was in the mix there, too,’’ Ben McAdoo said. “They’ve changed things up in the backfield a little bit because of health, because they had to.’’ Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under dominique rodgers-cromartie ,  eli apple ,  eli manning ,  ereck flowers ,  green bay packers ,  jason pierre-paul ,  new york giants ,  rashad jennings Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Christian Hackenberg 'has to show some progress' Read Next Christian Hackenberg 'has to show some progress' Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure Share Selection Columnists Mark Cannizzaro Why this brutally ugly Patriots win was perfection for Belichick Bart Hubbuch Can 99 be a magic number for the Falcons like it was for Giants?

When to upgrade your cable modem Kim Komando, On Technology 12:06 a.m. ET Jan. 3, 2017 Is your modem struggling to keep up with your Internet speeds? It might be time to upgrade. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) QUESTION: My cable modem is a few years old. Do the manufacturers ever update these gadgets? ANSWER: Good question, because many people forget their modem even exists, unless there’s a power outage and they have to reboot. The short answer is yes; companies often upgrade their hardware every few years. As download speeds increase, companies have to provide more sophisticated modems. What you want to know is whether your modem is keeping up with the demands of your service. You can contact your cable company, of course, but you may be able to skip the phone call if you know what you’re looking for. Q: I just switched from Windows to Mac after using Windows for 20 years. Do you have any pointers for this new Apple user? A: Switching to Apple does take some adjustment. You’ll find a lot of things are similar, including many of the programs, but the layout and appearance can be dizzyingly different. You’re so accustomed to the “Start” icon and the “Insert” key that you wonder what you’ll do without them. Don’t worry: Apple is famous for its intuitive design, and you’ll figure everything out in no time. But there are certain tricks to help you through those first few days.

What can I do to fix it? A: When a smart TV has problems, it feels like a betrayal. Didn’t you buy this particular device so you wouldn’t have to think about it? How smart can it be if the TV has issues? But problems with the TV’s screen resolution should be easy to sort out, and you fix a smart TV much the same way you fix a regular TV, through its picture settings. Many people assume that a television is a static machine, but you can modify almost every aspect of its images and sound. Just like your digital photo software, you can change the brightness, contrast, and color of your screen. Q: I’ve never made a budget that I kept. But now that I am getting older, I really need to start managing my money. Help me so my parents stop lecturing me! A: The good news is that there are apps and programs to get you on the right path. But these don’t do all the heavy lifting. It's a lot of effort to keep track of every purchase that you make. I like to recommend different methods for tracking your finances, but all of them do one important thing: Let you visualize how much you're spending and saving every month. Q: I am done with Facebook. How can I delete my account? A: You’re not the first. Many people find Facebook overwhelming, especially in a breakneck and controversial year like 2016. Most Facebook users prefer to take a break for awhile, deactivating their account for days or even months. The advantage of deactivating is that you preserve all of your information, including photos and statuses, and you can switch it back on whenever you want. Fully deleting you account takes a little more time, but the process will erase every byte of data from your social media account.

This according to hacker Stefan Esser. When Lucas Todesco released the Yalu iOS 10.1.1 jailbreak, people were a bit disappointed due to its limitations. It’s only available on the iPhone 7/7 Plus, iPhone 6s/6s Plus and the iPad Pro. Back in July Beta versions of iOS 10 came out as Apple resorted to an unorthodox technique to know if their opeating system can fend off jailbreaking intents that are tied to TaiG or Pangu. Semi-Tethered and Stability Issues People owning older device models weren’t the only ones disappointed. It turns out this jailbreak is semi-tethered, so you need to re-apply the jailbreak every time the device is restarted. Not only that, stability is another thing users need to contend with. Todesco is still doing some fine-tuning with the crack. The hacker wants users to get hold of version 4-1 that carries support for Cydia per blastingnews.com. Kiddies still bother me regarding the iOS 10.2 jailbreak. That is exactly why the team working on it doesn't disclose this. — Stefan Esser (@i0n1c) December 25, 2016 Also read: Nintendo Switch Release Date May Have Been Revealed By A Nosy Redditor   Latest Hack Coming Your Way Unfortunately, this is the best update the Apple Jailbreaking Community has gotten. It’s the first one for the iOS 10 series and users are eager to get one not requiring them to re-jailbreak their phone time after time. Stefan Esser lifted users hopes up when he tweeted that an iOS 10.2 jailbreak might come your way soon. There’s a team working on another crack and people just need to extend their patience a bit more. If this pushes through, it will be the first time that iOS jailbreaks are released back-to-back. Esser has been in the scene for quite some time now so perhaps there’s a good possibility this will come into fruition. Prior to the Yalu iOS 10.1 jailbreak, the last crack available was iOS 9.3.3 from Pangu, the Chinese hacking group. So here’s hoping a proper working tool would be made available to users very soon. Feel free to send us your thoughts on the issue.

For months now, many have speculated that the Cupertino tech giant is planning on getting rid of the home button altogether. These speculations are based on the recent patent filings from Apple regarding the technology. However, it would seem that HTC will be the one to beat Apple to the punch with the HTC Ocean. Rumor has it that the upcoming smartphone from HTC, dubbed HTC Ocean, will feature the said technology. And, it is coming sooner rather than later. READ ALSO: HTC Ocean Launch on January 12 with the Name HTC Ultra There have been talks that HTC will unveil the said smartphone on January 12. Unfortunately, according to WCCF Tech, the phone will not be released in the U.S. As it turns out, HTC is running thin in terms of resources when it comes to dealing with the country. HTC 10 (via htc.com) In addition to the virtual home button, the new HTC Ocean, otherwise known as the HTC Ultra, will sport a Snapdragon 835. A bit like the iPhone 7, the phone will also not have a 3.5-mm headphone jack. READ ALSO: LG G6 Release At MWC 2017; Price and Availability The HTC Ocean is also rumored to feature an edge-to-edge display much like the one on the Xiaomi Mi Mix smartphone. Furthermore, the display size will be a whopping 6-inch AMOLED screen. The introduction of the virtual home button to mobile devices will definitely set a precursor for others to follow suit. Before long, more phone manufacturers, Apple included, will feature the said technology. In fact, it?s not only Apple who is interested with this novel piece of engineering. Even Samsung is looking at it on the next iteration of its smartphone, the Galaxy S8. READ ALSO: Apple iPhone 8 Production to Start in March for September Release The acceptance of the HTC Ocean by the public will surely dictate the success of the virtual home button. Being the first to showcase the technology will mean a lot for HTC and its somewhat thriving fanbase. Furthermore, this will also dictate whether or not other companies will find this lucrative in terms of their own products. For more updates on the HTC Ocean, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones What will Apple launch in 2017? iPhone 8, iPad Air 3, Watch 3 and more in the offing Will Apple woo fans this year or play it safe with its traditional methods. Sami Khan   January 3, 2017 09:06 IST Apple logo,apple outlook 2017,Credit: Reuters Apple is going to have an interesting lineup of products in 2017, which will project the company's futuristic vision. In 2016, the Cupertino based tech giant's biggest launches were iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and the all-new Macbook Pro with Touch Bar. Also read: Foxconn to set up Apple products manufacturing unit in Gujarat The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus did not bring much to the table, except for a few changes like capacitive Home button, removal of 3.5mm headphone jack and a slightly changed design. This year, assuming the rumours are true, the iPhone 8 will be the best till date with major design overhaul and new features. But that's not it for Apple in 2017. Below are the list of upgrades to Apple's product line expected to be witnessed this year. New iPhones We are still a long way from seeing the new iPhones, but that doesn't mean we can't talk about them already. If you can recall, rumours about iPhone 8 started doing the rounds before the iPhone 7 series was launched, and it is only fitting to see a spike in the fresh speculations. It is worth mentioning that the current rumours are just the beginning and as the official launch closes in, we are going to get one too many. So far, the new iPhone 8 is believed to be a completely redesigned model by Apple with an edge-to-edge curved OLED display, dual camera with 3D imaging feature, a new A11 chipset and much more. The year 2017 marks the 10th year anniversary for iPhones, so expect some big surprises. New iPads If you think tablets are out of fashion, Apple will change that this year. The company's iPad line is much-appreciated when it comes to tablets, and rumours suggest this spring we will be treated with the most advanced iPads of the time. There is going to be a new iPad Pro with improved hardware and software, an edge-to-edge display to follow a singular design for its mobile devices in 10- and 12.9-inch sizes, new chipset, improved camera and battery and much more. Rumours are also rife with details about iPad Air 3, which will make its official presence in the market this year. New iMacs There was a lot of anticipation for the new iMacs last year, but Apple disappointed its fans by just launching the MacBook Pro. This year, the company is not likely to miss an upgrade to its PC line. According to KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, new iMacs would launch mid-year with Intel's Kaby Lake chipset, AMD graphics, keyboard with Touch Bar, higher-resolution displays and much more. There may also be an element of surprise attached to the new iMac, which will know for sure at the launch event. New Watch Apple hasn't really given much importance to its wearables lineup, but the Apple Watch 3 is expected to arrive this year. The new smartwatch by the company will have improved design with water resistance, a better processor, and launch alongside the new iPhones this year. New software As the tradition goes, the new iPhones will come with latest iOS 11 software and the new iMacs this year will come with latest build of OS X version. We are excited to see what changes Apple brings with these new software. Apple Watch and Apple TV software is due for an upgrade, which we hope to see this year. What we like to see Apple has a pretty expected routine when it comes to launching new products. But we would like to see some change in that, considering the spike in competition. We wish to see new wearable devices, preferably glasses, which have been in rumours for a while now. Apple could also step up its game in the smart home division by launching a new home hub. The company's untouched Apple TV also demands a new upgrade sometime this year. Our wish-list could go on, but it is best to not set the expectations too high.

Business Home LBoard Pakatan will provide aid but not BR1M, Azmin insists Ho Kit Yen Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Apple partner Wistron seeks to expand India smartphone parts plant Reuters | January 3, 2017 Whether Apple will begin manufacturing in India is unknown, but Wistron's desire to expand 'pretty quickly' could represent 'several steps in that direction,' the official said. MUMBAI: Smartphone component maker Wistron Corp, which counts Apple Inc among its customers, has applied for permission to expand its plant in the Indian city of Bengaluru, a high-ranking regional government official said on Monday. The Taiwanese contract manufacturer has also requested that its application be fast-tracked, the official at the state government of Karnataka in southern India told Reuters. The move comes less than two weeks after the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was in talks with India’s federal government about the possibility of assembling products in one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets, where the U.S. tech firm controls less than 2 percent. Apple setting up production in India would be a significant win for the government which has embarked on a major campaign to attract global manufacturers under the slogan “Make in India”. “Wistron has approached us to expedite certain clearances with regards to the augmentation and expansion of its existing unit,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified. Whether Apple will begin manufacturing in India is unknown, but Wistron’s desire to expand “pretty quickly” could represent “several steps in that direction,” the official said. Apple did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Wistron could not be reached for comment. Analysts have said local manufacturing could come as part of a wider strategy for Apple to expand in India and even lower prices after Chief Executive Tim Cook visited the country in May and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Certainly that (local manufacturing) will help in some level of cost optimization,” said Gartner research director Anshul Gupta. “Because looking at the current tax structure, local facilities do provide some kind of cost advantage.” Another of Apple’s Taiwanese suppliers, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd – commonly known as Foxconn – also has a manufacturing facility in southern India.

To the surprise of… exactly who? Trump’s meeting with top tech execs confirms a simple truth: All their ships are sailing in the same direction. Dear Wall Street Daily Reader, For a guy who built his electoral coalition on a foundation of fiery populist rhetoric and anti-establishment bromides, Donald Trump’s presidential transition has been heavy on elites. He’s selected a Cabinet whose aggregate wealth is greater than that of the bottom third of Americans households — 17 people of the people (out of 23 positions to be filled) who have more money than 43 million families. He’s also welcomed a cross-section of opinion leaders to the gilded Trump Tower, including rappers, boxers, former NFL stars, NFL owners, fashion icons, environmental activists/screen idols, and environmental activists/vanquished presidential candidates. Around these parts, though, the most conspicuous gathering of ring-kissers has to be President-elect The Donald’s December 14 summoning of tech industry leaders to his Fifth Avenue skyscraper. The convocation included: Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) founder and CEO Larry Page; Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt; Amazon Inc. (AMZN) chairman and CEO (and owner of The Washington Post) Jeff Bezos; Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook; Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins; Facebook Inc. (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg; IBM Corp. (IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty; Intel Corp. (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich; Oracle Corp. (ORCL) co-CEO Safra Catz; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella; Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith; and Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) and SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk. Apparently — and ironically, given the president-elect’s well-known penchant for dashing off 140 characters of pure impulse — Twitter Inc. (TWTR) and CEO Jack Dorsey were “too small” to merit inclusion. For a guy who built his electoral coalition on a foundation of fiery populist rhetoric and anti-establishment bromides, Donald Trump’s presidential transition has been heavy on elites. Palantir Technologies Inc. CEO Alex Karp, a close associate of Trump tech consigliere Peter Thiel, who set the invite list, was there. So were Trump appointees Gary Cohn (director-designate of the National Economic Council, formerly of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)) and Wilbur Ross (secretary-designate of commerce) as well as incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, senior counsel/chief strategist Steve Bannon, and senior adviser to the president-elect Stephen Miller Ever-present, of course, are Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, as well as sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump. That 12-heavyweight bullet list includes many outspoken critics of candidate Trump, including Bezos, who once said his behavior toward the press on the trail “erodes democracy around the edges” and joked about sending him to space. But now all their ships are sailing in the same direction. Here he is, introducing himself during the “open” portion of the session, with media present: “Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com. I’m super excited about the possibility that this could be the innovations administration.” As he explained after the meeting, “I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech — agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing — everywhere.” Trump, after lauding “ahead of the curve” and “very special guy” Thiel, was more direct about the new alignment: So I want to add that I’m here to help you folks do well. And you’re doing well right now, and I’m honored by the bounce. They’re all talking about the bounce, so right now everybody in this room has to like me at least a little bit, but we’re going to try and have that bounce continue, and perhaps even more importantly, we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There’s nobody like you in the world. In the world, there’s nobody like the people in this room. And anything we can do to help this go along, and we’re going to be there for you and you’ll call my people, you’ll call me, it doesn’t make any difference, we have no formal chain of command around here. It’s a rapprochement remarkably stunning and, at the same time, entirely predictable. Silicon Valley had little love for Trump. Actually, Silicon Valley’s rank and file probably still have little love for Trump. But Silicon Valley’s elite corporate officers recognize — as does the small-government-low-tax-no-regulation libertarian Thiel, who founded Palantir as well as PayPal Inc. — some long-term upside potential in the Trump era. It’s a rapprochement remarkably stunning and, at the same time, entirely predictable. It’s as simple, too, as Apple’s Cook put it in an explanation to his employees, of not wanting to be left behind. In an internal email verified as legitimate by TechCrunch, Cook wrote: Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be… The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas. During a subsequent Q-and-A, Cook noted that “governments can affect our ability to do what we do.” During an October 31, 2016, speech at the National Press Club, Thiel provided perhaps the most trenchant observation on what was a total sh*tshow of a campaign: But I think one thing that should be made distinguished here is the media always is taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally. I think a lot of the voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously, but not literally. Thiel was responding to a question from moderator Thomas Burr, president of the National Press Club, about a ban on Muslim travel to the United States. He added: And so when they hear things like the Muslim comment or like the wall comment or things like that, it’s not — the question is not are you going to build a wall like the Great Wall of China or, you know, how exactly are you going to force these tests. What they hear is we’re going to have — we’re going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy. We’re going to try to figure out a way to — figure out how do we strike the right balance between costs and benefits. Thiel, who almost single-handedly took down independent media upstart Gawker based in large part on a revenge motive, is unquestionably an odd one. “Silicon Valley’s power brokers want you to think they’re different. But they’re just average robber barons.” But his perspective on what the Washington Consensus has wrought shouldn’t be dismissed. There are our endless wars, our bubble-based economy, our inequality, our insane Wall Street-Washington, D.C.-Mainstream Media power nexus. The mainstream media loves to elevate the Bezoses, the Cooks, the Zuckerbergs, and the Musks into “fantastical and mythical figures,” as The Outline’s Emmett Rensin recently put it. Thiel has been both demonized (rightly, when it comes to his jihad against Gawker; wrongly, when it comes to the mere fact of his support for Trump) and lionized (for his entrepreneurial instinct). The full transcript of his National Press Club speech and the Q-and-A with Burr is illuminating, all argumentum ad hominem aside. Those folks are neither heroes, in the sense of a guy like John Glenn, nor villains, at least to the extent that they’re just playing the game as it’s laid before them. The “truth” is closer to this: “Silicon Valley’s power brokers want you to think they’re different. But they’re just average robber barons.” Before November 8, they were simply playing the odds, and the odds said Hillary Clinton would be the next Custodian of Empire. Now they’re back to “making the world a better place.” Except: The vast majority of Silicon Valley startups, the sort that project lofty missions and managed improbably lucrative IPOs despite never having graced the cover of The Economist or the frontal cortex of the president, work precisely like any other kind of mundane sales operation in search of a product: Underpaid cold-callers receive low wages and less job security in exchange for a foosball table and the burden of growing a company as quickly as possible so that it can reach a liquidation event. Owners and investors get rich. Managers stay comfortable. The employees get hosed. None of this is particularly original. At least the real robber barons built the railroads. What we really need to know is whether they talked about securing the Internet-of-Things (IoT) during that confab, because lives may actually depend on it. We’ll have more on the IoT death threat in tomorrow’s Wall Street Daily. NBNBC Here’s how science changes, courtesy of Boing Boing: People challenge orthodoxy: In July 2002, The New York Times Magazine published Gary Taubes’ article “What if It’s All Been a Big Fat Lie?,” which made the case for carbs, not dietary fat, as the cause of heart disease and obesity. Taubes was swiftly excoriated by the health and nutrition industry and made fun of by other food reporters. Nearly 15 years later, Taubes is no longer a heretic, and the idea that many kinds of fat are healthy is promoted by the orthodoxy, who act as if they knew it all along. Taubes has a new piece up for The Vindicated, “‘Nutrition Heretic’ Gary Taubes on the Long Road Back From a Big, Fat Public Shaming.” Smart Investing, David Dittman Editorial Director, Wall Street Daily Editorial Director David Dittman is an investment newsletter professional with more than 10 years' experience at staff, management, and strategic levels.

As most of you know, I was born with the gift of precognition. (I knew that was going to make you roll your eyes.) Granted, my past prognostications have been described as “pitiful” and “laughably inaccurate,” but critics tend to get hung up on silly details like facts and truth and the unnecessary trappings of reality. Was I wrong when I predicted that marijuana would be legalized nationwide in 2015, prompting Apple to release its first iBong? Not if you’ve been smoking a lot of marijuana. Was I incorrect when I foretold that in 2016, Donald Trump would deport himself and his followers to a small land mass in the South Pacific known as Trump Island? Given the rising popularity of fake news, I would say that prediction was spot-on. Regardless of how skeptics view my past prophecies, I assure you that this year’s look ahead to 2017 will not let anyone down. So here we go: –President Trump will be impeached by March. The reason for his impeachment is foggy right now, but it will likely stem either from his decision to give Alaska to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a birthday present or the fact that the wall project along the U.S.-Mexican border will be running $50 billion over budget due to Trump’s insistence that it be built with solid-gold bricks. Trump will respond to the impeachment by denying that he was impeached. He will then deny the existence of the word “impeach.” The accuracy of that denial will be confirmed by the website Breitbart. After he is forcibly removed from the White House, Trump will deny that he was ever president. Breitbart will then post a story that Trump himself never actually existed, and the disgraced former president will vanish in an orange poof of logic. –Online retailer Amazon will begin using drones for a majority of its deliveries, blocking out the sun with the joyful high-pitched buzz of commerce. The annual number of Americans killed by falling blenders will increase by 750,000 percent. –Apple will release the highly anticipated iPhone 8, which the company will claim is both larger and smaller than previous models. Because that’s a physical impossibility, consumers who buy the phone will receive empty boxes and, in order to remain on the cutting edge of hip Apple technology, they will have to walk around staring at an empty hand or holding nothing to their ear while talking into the air. Passers-by, not wanting to seem out of touch, will comment on the nonexistent phones and say things like, “Oh, man, he’s got the iPhone 8. It’s so large and small simultaneously!” Users of the iPhone 8 will become wholly disconnected from the internet and remember how to use their minds, causing them to evolve into superior humans. They will use their newfound intellectual abilities to develop rudimentary flip phones, and the cycle will begin again. –Fake news will become the new real news, while real news becomes the new fake news. Those who embraced fake news and denounced real news during the 2016 presidential election will respond to this paradigm shift at first by sticking with fake news – which will be what used to be real news – and continuing to denounce real news – which will be what used to be fake news. Upon realizing they’ve been tricked, the fake news enthusiasts will switch to real news – which at that point will be fake – and begin denouncing fake news – which at that point will be real. In the ensuing confusion, Christmas will be celebrated in June and Batboy will be elected president of the universe. –I will be locked up in a journalism gulag for predicting President Trump’s impeachment. Breitbart will report that I never existed. The fact-checking website Politifact will rate that report “half-true,” and CNN will spend half the year trying to find me. –The smartest investment of the year will end up being stock in the language software company Rosetta Stone, thanks in large part to relentless demand for its “Learn Russian” series. –Foodies will continue to find new and annoying ways to make food look weird and taste awful, leading to the inevitable legalization of state-licensed “foodie hunting.” A cookbook titled “10 Mouth-Watering Ways to Boil a Foodie” will be the surprise publishing hit of 2017, with the biggest surprise being its popularity among foodies. –After years of snubs, my finely sculpted calves will finally be crowned America’s Sexiest Leg Muscle by Sinew Weekly magazine. The trophy will be delivered by Amazon drone to my cell in the gulag, injuring five guards in the process. –I'll continue to write extremely silly things and miraculously get paid for doing so, and be grateful every day for those who take time to read my words and respond by: laughing with me; laughing at me; sending kind emails; sending unkind emails; wishing me well; hoping a drone drops a blender on my head; sharing a hit off their iBong with me; or simply thinking a thought they might not otherwise have thunk. I wish each and every one of you a happy and healthy New Year and hope 2017 is filled with good news – hopefully the real kind. ABOUT THE WRITER Rex Huppke is a columnist for the Chicago Tribune.

In December 2016, Apple announced its plans to manufacture iPhones in Bengaluru in association with Wistron. The smartphone giant is now expecting to start production of iPhones from April 2017. Reports published in The Business Standard stated that Foxconn, the biggest contract manufacturer for Apple is also in the queue to set up a manufacturing unit in India. Sources have revealed that Foxconn is planning to set up smartphone assembly lines in multiple Indian cities. It also has plans to set up a second iPhone facility in Gurgaon. Announcement about the same is expected to be made at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2017 on January 10 at Gandhinagar, Gujarat. Apple announced that it will open up an exclusive store under its brand name in Hyderabad for its mapping unit. A report in Economic Times stated that Apple has requested for concessions like relaxation in labelling rules and tax incentives. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has forwarded the same to Department of Revenue and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Government sources revealed that it might agree to some of the demands made by Apple for setting up a manufacturing unit in India. The government has also imposed a condition, which stated that Apple needs to promise a huge investment for manufacturing iPhones in India and at the same time commit generating lakhs of jobs.

Skip to main content Electronic Frontier Foundation Defending your rights in the digital world Search form Search Main menu Home About Our Work Deeplinks Blog Press Room Take Action Shop January 2, 2017 | By Nate Cardozo The State of Crypto Law: 2016 in Review This year was one of the busiest in recent memory when it comes to cryptography law in the United States and around the world. But for all the Sturm und Drang, surprisingly little actually changed in the U.S. In this post, we’ll run down the list of things that happened, how they could have gone wrong (but didn’t), how they could yet go wrong (especially in the U.K.), and what we might see in 2017. Savecrypto.org For a fuller picture of what happened this year, we need actually start this post with a brief review of what happened in late 2015. At the end of September of last year, EFF and our friends at Access Now launched an online petition to demand that President Obama protect encryption from any sort of compromise or backdoor mandate. The petition and its companion website at savecrypto.org used the White House petition site to let our members and supporters tell the President exactly what we think: strong crypto is critical to security in the digital world and any sort of compromise would be unacceptable. And despite garnering well over the 100,000 signature threshold that warrants a response from the White House, no substantive response ever came. Apple v. FBI: The All Writs Act in (in)Action If you’re reading this post, chances are you’re already familiar with the case that could have led to the biggest development in crypto law in 2016: the “Apple v. FBI” fight in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting. In February 2016, a federal magistrate judge in southern California in charge of the investigation into the San Bernardino shooting was presented with an application by the government to force Apple to unlock one of the phones used by the deceased shooters. That same day, the magistrate judge ordered Apple to write and digitally sign custom software to help unlock the iPhone 5C at issue. In an unprecedented move, the order required Apple to create a brand new version of its operating system with intentionally weakened security features, which the government could then use to get into the phone. EFF and an unusually large group of tech companies, nonprofits, academics, and others all filed amicus briefs supporting Apple. Our brief focused on why the order the judge signed would have violated Apple’s First Amendment rights. Others wrote briefs about why the order would have been bad for our security, and why the order was not actually authorized under the All Writs Act, the law the government used to justify its outrageous demand. If the FBI had won, 2016 could have become the year that the U.S. government obtained the legal authority to order American technology companies to create arbitrary backdoors in technology products. Indeed, the FBI’s demand was never about “just that one phone” and was all about creating legal precedent. Instead, the FBI found another way into the iPhone at issue and withdrew its illegal and unconstitutional demand without creating bad law. The Burr-Feinstein Bill, or Another Way 2016 Could Have Been a Lot Worse In April, less than two weeks after the Apple v. FBI fight ended with a whimper, crypto faced its next existential challenge. That challenge came in the form of a draft bill, proposed by Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). The draft bill would have created a new obligation on device manufacturers, software developers, ISPs, online services and others to decrypt encrypted data or offer “such technical assistance as is necessary” if ordered to do so by any court in the country.  The draft bill was absolutely terrible. Indeed, the language demonstrated an almost studied ignorance of everyday computer security practices that safeguard our devices and information from criminals. As written, the draft likely would have outlawed forward secrecy, an innovative security feature that many major tech providers, including WhatsApp, have implemented to limit the damage to user privacy in the event encryption keys are compromised. Thousands of EFF supporters spoke out to oppose the bill, and many others joined us in a campaign to pressure Obama again to take a strong stance against encryption backdoors. That work paid off: congressional support waned and the Obama administration’s decision not to endorse the bill was key to the proposal being scrapped for the year. The Investigatory Powers Act, or How 2016 Was Worse in the U.K. While we ended up winning the Apple v. FBI fight and defeating the Burr-Feinstein Bill, we weren’t so lucky across the pond in the United Kingdom. This year, the Investigatory Powers Bill, introduced in draft form in November 2015, has become the Investigatory Powers Act and is now unfortunately law in the U.K. as of November 2016. The law’s 245 pages codified the U.K. government’s plans to create a statutory basis for the country’s mass surveillance, data retention, and remote intrusion practices. Several of the Act’s provisions are especially troubling. First, the Act grants the U.K. the power to issue a “Technical Capability Notice” (S.189), a secret order to a telecommunications operator (which the Act defines so broadly it includes companies like Apple) to force it to “remov[e] electronic protection applied ... to any communications or data” and to “provide facilities or services of a specified description.” Second, the law also grants the U.K. the power to issue a “National Security Notice” (S.188)—another secret instrument, even more vaguely drawn, that would require operators to “carry out any conduct, including the provision of services of facilities,” which the British government “considers necessary in the interests of national security.” As Privacy International has noted, both of these instruments include gag orders that would prohibit Tim Cook from telling his customers what was happening. Third, the new Act provides for “equipment interference”—the U.K.’s euphemism hacking in the popular sense of that term. It allows the U.K. to break into private devices and insert new code for the purposes of surveillance or extracting data. The very questionable silver lining is that we don’t think that the U.K. government has taken advantage of the most dangerous provisions in the Act and forced backdoors into consumer technology… yet. We’ll be keeping a close eye on this one in 2017. 2017 and Crypto in the Trump Era Pretty much all we can say with confidence about what challenges cryptography law will face in 2017 is that we’re sure there will be some. President-elect Trump hasn’t said much on crypto directly, but during Apple v. FBI fight, Trump made it very clear he was on FBI’s side: “To think that Apple won't allow us to get into [the shooter's] cellphone? . . . Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it up.” He also called for a boycott of Apple until Apple caved. But like so much else, Trump has offered no specifics. Trump’s nominee for Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), is widely speculated to be aggressively anti-crypto. Again, Sen. Sessions has offered no specifics, but does “believe this is a more serious issue than Tim Cook understands.” Whatever 2017 and the Trump Administration bring, we’ll be ready for it. And you can be certain that we’ll fight as hard as we can for your right to use encryption without compromise. This article is part of our Year In Review series.

Caitlin McGarry (Macworld.com) 29 December, 2016 22:01 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments Apple has been doomed for decades, if the steady stream of headlines about the company, its stock price, and its product lineup are to be believed. If The Macalope has taught us anything, it's that the Apple deathwatch business is a brisk (and bizarre) one. The truth is much more complex. But by any measure, 2016 was a particularly tough year for Apple. The company endured a bitter legal fight with the FBI, saw its first revenue decline in more than a decade, and faced backlash over hardware tweaks in its upgraded flagship products: the iPhone 7’s lack of a 3.5mm audio jack and the overhauled MacBook Pro’s less-than-pro specs for a decidedly pro price. But there were also some bright spots: the success of the 4-inch iPhone SE, the upgraded Apple Watch Series 2, and the release of iOS 10, which turned Siri into a platform. Let’s look back at 2016, the year the headphone jack died. RIP, headphone jack Adam Patrick Murray When rumors that Apple was planning to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone first started swirling, the internet collectively freaked out. Some called it an outright user-hostile decision. Was everyone supposed to sacrifice their wired headphones and other peripherals for Bluetooth ones? When Apple senior VP Phil Schiller formally announced the change and called the decision “courageous,” Apple critics scoffed. But then the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus debuted, and it turned out that a lot of people were OK with Apple’s decision, especially because a pair of Lightning earphones and an audio jack dongle were included in the box. The company hasn’t yet reported its holiday quarter earnings, which would reflect just how many iPhones it sold, but the iPhone 7 Plus and jet black iPhone 7 were completely sold out on launch day. A case of limited supply or over-the-top demand? It seems like the latter. While Google celebrated its inclusion of the headphone jack in its flagship Pixel phone, Samsung is reportedly hitching its wagon to Apple’s decision (of course) by ditching the headphone jack in its next device. Delayed AirPods Adam Patrick Murray Apple didn’t just release a headphone jack-less iPhone. It had a companion accessory lined up, its own cordless Bluetooth earphones called AirPods. The $159 accessory was slated to ship in October, Apple said at its September iPhone launch event, but the earphones were delayed for months, reportedly due to connectivity issues. Apple started taking preorders on Dec. 13 and shipments began arriving on Monday, Dec. 19, but availability both online and in-store was limited—none could be found in NYC, for example, and shipping estimates quickly slipped to Febuary. But at least Apple made it in time for the holidays, even just barely. The good news: They’re pretty awesome. Second-gen Apple Watch Apple The AirPods may have shipped months after they were scheduled to, but the overhauled Apple Watch appeared right on time. Apple released two versions at different price points, both with upgraded processors that made native apps run much faster (a big sticking point with the first-gen watch). The Series 2 impressed us with GPS, a brighter display, and its new water-resistance, perfect for swim-tracking. If you don’t need all of those features, the Series 1 is just as powerful, but cheaper. Some say the Series 2 is what the first-gen watch should’ve been, but Apple’s intensified focus on health and fitness is a natural progression. Apple vs. FBI In February 2016, Apple faced one of its greatest challenges ever: pressure from the federal government to unlock a terror suspect’s iPhone. The iPhone at the center of the legal firestorm was a 5c model locked with a passcode and set to destroy all of its data after 10 wrong passcode unlock attempts. So the FBI asked Apple—then tried to legally compel Apple—to write software that would allow the government to bypass the iPhone’s security mechanisms. Apple refused. The ensuing weeks-long legal battle put Apple at the center of a debate about encryption, privacy, and what tech companies are obligated to do for their users and for the authorities. Apple argued that any software it created for the so-called “good guys” would eventually end up in the wrong hands. The FBI ended up finding another way into the iPhone and dropped their case against Apple. iPhone sales start slipping Apple reported its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years in the second quarter of 2016 because of sliding iPhone sales, a trend that continued as the year progressed. This year, the company reported its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001, down from $233.7 billion in 2015 to $215.6 billion. For comparison, Microsoft’s revenue in the 2016 fiscal year slipped from $93.6 billion to $85.3 billion year-over-year. Can the iPhone 7 Plus’s insanely great camera, the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar, or Apple’s laser focus on services reverse the downward revenue trend in 2017? Apple sure hopes so. MacBook Pro finally gets a refresh Adam Patrick Murray Apple finally gave its professional-grade MacBooks a refresh after four years of minor tweaks, and it sure was a big change. The company replaced the keyboard’s function keys with a contextually aware OLED touchscreen strip that changes according to the app you’re using. Apple also went all-in with USB-C ports. The Touch Bar has been a big hit with reviewers—we loved it, too—but the refreshed 13- and 15-inch laptops have been roundly criticized for their pricing ($1,800 for the smaller base model), 16GB max RAM, and issues with graphics glitches. There were also reports about battery life, but Apple resolved those with a macOS Sierra update addressing the battery time estimator. The Apple Car that will never be …Or will it? Rumors that Apple was working on a self-driving car started swirling in late 2015, but this year the rumor mill kicked into overdrive. There were reports of staff upheavals and changing strategies, and in the fall it became clear that Apple was switching gears. The company is no longer building its own car from scratch—instead, it is looking to build an automotive system to power an autonomous car developed by a partner experienced in areas where Apple is not. As it turns out, mass-producing vehicles and mass-producing iPhones are not the same. Better for Apple to bow out before launching a product doomed from the start than to proceed just to prove a point. iPhone SE launch Adam Patrick Murray One of Apple’s under-the-radar successes in 2016 was the iPhone SE. Who knew there was such a huge market for a small phone? Apparently, Apple knew, which is why the company released the 4-inch SE after supersizing its lineup with the 6 and 6 Plus in 2014. The SE has the lowest starting price of any iPhone at $399, the stylish look of the iPhone 5 (a design favorite), with the speed, power, and same great camera as the iPhone 6s. It also has a headphone jack, if that’s your jam. Released in March, the SE reportedly prevented a potentially larger iPhone sales slip than Apple experienced this year. Turns out that if you give the people what they want, they will buy it. Apple iOS 10 opens up Siri Apple’s voice assistant Siri has languished behind its chief rivals, Amazon’s Alexa and whatever Google is calling its voice-activated assistant now (Google Assistant or Google Now, depending on what device you’re using). Part of that is due to Apple’s hardline privacy policy, which limits Siri’s capabilities. But iOS 10 made Siri more open by allowing third-party app integration. Now you can use Siri to hail an Uber, send a Viber message, search for restaurants on Yelp, or find images on Pinterest, among a slew of other capabilities. iOS 10 also turned Messages into a platform with GIFs, stickers, Apple Music integration, and an iMessage App Store using texts to send money via Venmo, play games like Words with Friends, and share sports scores through ESPN. iOS 10 was a huge step forward for Apple. iPhone 6 glitches The iPhone 6 and 6s were plagued with problems in 2016. Toward the end of the year, Apple finally addressed a spate of battery complaints about iPhone 6s models. First the company said it was limited to a “small number” of iPhones produced between September and October of 2015, but then acknowledged the problems were more widespread than initally thought. The company launched a battery replacement program. Apple’s press releases about the issue have all been in Chinese, but affected American iPhone owners can take advantage of the free battery replacement, too. iOS 10.2 includes a diagnostic tool that will help Apple figure out exacty why its batteries are randomly shutting down. The iPhone 6s battery problems surfaced just after Apple addressed a touchscreen bug in the 6 and 6 Plus, dubbed “Touch Disease.” Earlier in the year, Apple fixed yet another bug, “Error 53,” which caused Touch ID to fail.

The good news is that it looks like Apple wants to help some of their customers celebrate the holiday by announcing several Chinese New Year-related promotions for those who buy an iPhone or Mac. Oddly enough Apple will be starting the event on the 6th of January and it will last for one day only, so you’ve got a few more days to decide what you want. According to Apple, “For one day only, get the latest Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones – Red when you buy select Mac or iPhone models, including iPhone 7.” Basically you get free pair of headphones if you buy a Mac or an iPhone, and the headphones will come in red which is an auspicious color of the Chinese New Year. The company has also launched a gift guide which includes a bunch of other (PRODUCT)RED accessories which we reckon is pretty appropriate given the color, and it helps out a good cause at the same time. Unfortunately it seems that this Chinese New Year promotion will only be applicable to those living in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, so if you don’t live in those countries then we guess you won’t be able to take part in the promotion.

In the meantime, marketers need to focus on the technologies that are showing signs of progress, whether it's with augmented/virtual reality, artificial intelligence or eyeglass video. "I think one of the challenges that we've still got with that technology is consumers are really looking for that frictionless experience," Di Richardson, EVP and Chief Strategy Officer at global media agency UM Worldwide, says in an interview with Beet.tv. "We've been trained now with our phones, the way we live, that we don't expect there to be dysfunction in our technology." Richardson cites as one example the latest iteration of wearable video technology (think Google Glass). "Time will tell, but what's happening with Snapchat Spectacles right now, I think it's a lot more seamless experience," says Richardson. "I think once we get a more seamless experience, we can then have the ability to take that to more people more often." And there are always the contributions from Apple to inspire more fluid human/technology interaction. "Think about what Apple have done really well, they think about it from the consumer experience. I think we need a little bit more of that in some of the tech that's being developed," she adds. While the use of data to better pinpoint target audiences and drive true brand engagement is happening on a heretofore-unachievable scale, there's still more work ahead, according to Richardson. "Part of the challenge that brands have in the space right now is we're still trying to get this right mix of creativity and the data," she says. "And I think we're learning a lot more, brands are learning a lot more, but we have to get to the point where the format makes the experience and I don't think we're quite there yet." The ability to change creative content and messaging on the fly has made great strides, particularly in the last two years, Richardson believes. But looking at the bigger picture with regard to creativity, the right ad for the right person at the right moment needs to go farther. "But how do we scale that?" Richardson asks. "How do we actually bring back that love of engaging with brands again?" Brands that have aligned themselves with a purpose are on the right track, to an extent. "I think brands are going to have to look beyond the end of their noses, so to speak, and think about what's their role, their contribution, how is it beyond the product or service they're offering that they can really drive a creative engagement with people," says Richardson.

Email | 02 Jan 2017 | Print  ExtraBITS for 2 January 2017 by TidBITS Staff We’re kicking off 2017’s ExtraBITS with two distressing links for Mac fans: a critical review of the new MacBook Pro by a professional filmmaker and evidence that the Mac is losing clout inside Apple. No Film School’s Review of the 2016 MacBook Pro -- Filmmakers are among the most demanding professional Mac users, so their perspective is valuable when evaluating Apple’s professional-grade hardware. Filmmaker Charles Haine reviewed the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for the No Film School Web site and found it lacking. Compared with a similar 2013 model, he feels that the new 15-inch MacBook Pro offers no significant advantages. He found the Touch Bar clumsy, the keyboard too loud, and the trackpad awkward. Most damning, he found that the much-touted display is not color accurate. While overall performance wasn’t notably different from the previous MacBook Pro model, the new MacBook Pro does offer a significant speed boost to GPU-intensive activities such as rendering RED files in Adobe Premiere and using the DaVinci Resolve non-linear video editor. Note that No Film School chose not to test with Apple’s Final Cut Pro X, saying, “While the 10.3 release is a major upgrade, and FCPX seems to be gaining ground with the pro market that it lost, it’s still just not that common a professional tool anymore.” Read/post comments Is the Mac Struggling Inside Apple? -- Over at Bloomberg Technology, Mark Gurman lays out the case that Apple is indeed marginalizing the Mac internally, as we have suggested recently. Gurman cites numerous sources within the company who reveal troubling changes. These days, the Mac hardware team gets less face time with Jony Ive’s design group, and managers have become more likely to float multiple competing ideas, meaning that time spent on losing designs ends up wasted. On the software side, Gurman says that there is no longer a dedicated Mac operating system group, with all engineers on a single team and many of them focusing on iOS first. Even Apple employees are asking if Mac desktops remain strategically important, which prompted a response from Tim Cook that was positive, if vague. Read/post comments   READERS LIKE YOU!

Chance Miller - Jan. 2nd 2017 3:56 pm PT @ChanceHMiller Feature iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Now that we’ve officially hit 2017, much of the attention towards Apple has turned to the iPhone and what the company has in store for this new year. 2016 was more of an evolutionary year for the iPhone rather than revolutionary, but that’s not to say changes like the dual-camera design on the iPhone 7 Plus and Portrait Mode aren’t notable in their own right. This year, however, it appears that Apple has a much bigger update planned for the iPhone lineup, with potential features including an all-new glass design, wireless charging, new screen sizes, and more. The rumors have caused many of us here at 9to5Mac to start wondering what exactly we’re most excited for come this fall…. Last week, Jordan broke down every rumor we’ve heard concerning the iPhone 8. The current consensus among reports is that we’ll see a new flagship iPhone 8 model, as well as updated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models with the normal ‘s’ updates. It’s said that the star of the show in 2017 will be a 5.8-inch iPhone 8 model with a host of new features, a new design, and more. The model is said to feature 5.2-inches of usable touch screen space, while the remaining .6-inches will curve around the edges of the device. This has been corroborated by several reports, all of which say that Apple plans to use a curved OLED display for the top-tier model. In addition to the display upgrades, the new iPhone 8 is said to feature an all-glass design, similar to that of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. It’s also been rumored that Apple will introduce new color options with the iPhone 8, such as red or Jet White. Wireless charging, a feature that has been rumored for several years, now looks as if it might finally be coming to the iPhone in 2017. It’s been speculated that Apple’s implementation of wireless charging will be true, long-range charging rather than the inductive solution some Android manufacturers have implemented. Another widely rumored feature is the removal of the physical Home button. Apple already took the first steps towards this change with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and their new solid state Home button. It’s been rumored, however, that the iPhone 8 will completely ditch the physical Home button in favor of a solution that can be embedded into the display itself in one way or another. Augmented reality has also been rumored for the iPhone 8, but whether or not it will be ready for this year remains to be seen. Tim Cook has long touted the capabilities of the technology and it’s clear that Apple has a vested interest in the industry, but it’s unclear how much of that work will be present in the iPhone 8. There have also been rumors of a new 5-inch iPhone coming in 2017, perhaps with a new vertical dual-camera design on the back. This model is expected to stick with the LCD display, as are the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. There are also, of course, the same iterative improvements we’ve come to expect with pretty much every iPhone refresh: speed bumps, camera improvements, iOS updates, and more. Maybe this year battery life will be a focus? You never know. Personally, that top-tier iPhone 8 model is calling my name. I’ve long wanted Apple to switch to OLED displays and with the all-glass design and curved screen, it sounds like the perfect blend of design and comfort. Though, long-range wireless charging is also a feature that I think will really revolutionize the industry. Interestingly, when we ran a similar poll in the lead up to the iPhone 7, the feature that excited users the most was a waterproof design. As always, it’s important to note that these are simply rumors at this point. We won’t know for sure what Apple has planned for 2017 until it makes the announcements itself. So, what do you think? What rumored iPhone 8 feature excites you the most? Take the poll below and support your choice with a response in the comments.

As our most important tool, ingrained into every aspect of our lives, they are stared at and handled more than the Princess Leias at Comic Con. Unfortunately, sometimes we lose and leave our fancy devices in mysterious places. Fortunately, there are ways you can track down your lost phone. Here's how. Before we get started, there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, be aware that these methods all require you to have your location services turned on. Your phone will also need to be connected to the internet. Also: safety first. Remember that if you suspect any trouble when tracking your lost device, contact the police and hand your information to them. It's not worth putting yourself in a dangerous situation over a phone. iPhone/iPad Apple has a pretty ingenious toolset that will aid you in the quest to retrieve your phone. Of course there are downloadable apps that can be useful too but these native tools are better. One of my very lovely work colleagues once left her phone in a cab after being at showing. All her pictures and interviews were on the device, so it would have been catastrophic had she lost it. We managed to get it back within half an hour using the following steps and tools available at www.icloud.com. Find My iPhone Many people may not consider using the Find My iPhone application after losing their device because they simply haven’t set it up. You’ll be happy to know that, as long as you have a passcode set on your phone, Find My iPhone is automatically set up. Visit icloud.com and login using your Apple ID. These are the same credentials you would use to purchase things on iTunes or to download apps. Click on Find My iPhone in the top right hand corner. You’ll be presented with a map and a drop down menu with all the devices associated with that Apple ID. Select the device you are trying to locate. Once you've done that, you'll see a map that tracks the current or last active location of your phone. You'll also see a menu screen with three options, Play Sound, Lost Mode and Erase iPhone. Put Your Phone Into Lost Mode Do this before you do anything else. After clicking on Lost Mode, you'll be asked to enter a phone number that you can be reached on. You'll then be asked to enter a message. Both the message and the number will appear on the lock screen of your phone. If a Good Samaritan should find your phone, they'll be able to reach you. Once you get your phone back, simply type in your passcode and it will unlock and be good as new! Follow Your Phone On The Map If you've left your phone in a cab, on a bus or on a train, you'll be able to see it moving on the map. Keep your cab receipt or transport ticket, it will tell you the exact cab or bus/train that you were on. Call the bus/cab/train company and explain your situation, giving the number of the vehicle. Public transport companies will allow you to pick it up from the depot. With cabs, you can arrange to have it dropped back to your location for a fee. The same goes for Uber. If you've dropped it or left it at a restaurant, it should appear to be stationary on the map and this tracking system will allow you to retrace your steps and pin-point exactly where you may have lost your precious device. So after you've put it into Lost Mode, you’re able to physically hunt it down. Remember: don't put yourself in danger. If you feel someone has stolen your phone, hand the location over to police rather than put yourself in a potentially hazardous situation. Play Sound You've looked on the map and realised you've left your phone in a coffee shop, but on returning to the coffee shop, you still can't find it. This is where the Play Sound feature comes in handy. Even if your phone is on silent, the Play Sound function will make your phone play a looped sound so you can find it even if it’s wedged in a couch somewhere. This is also pretty handy if you’ve misplaced your phone at a party/at work/in your bedsheets during a Netflix marathon. Log into icloud.com and then click "play sound". It’s a lifesaver. And if you’re worried about this sound draining your limited battery, the Find My iPhone menu shows you exactly how much battery you have left – that way you can weigh your options. Erase iPhone Should the worst happen and you simply can’t retrieve your phone, Find My iPhone gives you the final option to remotely erase your phone. This isn't necessary for everyone, but if you've got credit card details, banking information, passwords or sexy photos stored on your phone, you may not want those falling into the wrong hands. Click "erase iPhone" and follow the prompts. You have permission to cry, as your device is now lost forever. It's worth keeping in mind that if you're prone to losing things like expensive iPhones, you should regularly back up your device to iCloud. That way you can restore it if and when you buy a new one. Alternative Tracking Apps iCloud and Find My iPhone are the best tools available to find a lost iPhone. As mentioned, I have used these tools and successfully retrieved a lost device within half an hour. But if you want to use something else, here are a few apps for iOS devices that are also quite good. GadgetTrak iHound Device Locator Android Finding your lost Android phone is easy, just Google it! That's right, you can Google where your phone is. This is a new-ish feature of the Android Device Manager. As long as your phone is linked to your Gmail account and you’re logged into Gmail in your browser, you can just Google the phrase "where is my phone" to find your device. Android Device Manager First of all, make sure that you are signed into your Google account in your browser. These are the credentials that you use to purchase apps from the Google Play store and also log into your Gmail. Once you’ve signed in, open a new Google search and type in the phrase "where is my phone." A map will appear at the top of the search results page. Click on it. You’ll be directed to a larger map with a menu box in the top left-hand corner. Click on the drop down device list to make sure that you have selected the correct gadget to track. Once you have done that, the map should show you the current or most recent tracked location of your phone. The menu box will also tell you how accurate the tracked location is and also the last time your phone was tracked. Lock The first thing you should do is lock your phone. In the menu box you should see a Lock option. Click on it. You’ll then be asked to enter a Lock password. Many of you will have already set a lock code on your phones. This feature will override that and lock your phone to a new password. Type in a password of your choice and try to make this a difficult one. Should your phone fall into the wrong hands, you will regret using a simple password. You'll also be asked to enter a short recovery message and a phone number where you can be reached. The message should be something akin to "Lost phone. Please return to Mia. Thank you!" Now if anyone should pick it up, this message will appear on the Lock screen and they will be able to contact you. It will also ensure that you keep prying eyes out of your personal data. Follow Your Phone On The Map The next few steps are very similar to the steps for finding an iPhone, which is great! If you need to help a distressed friend who is on a different platform to you, be rest assured that method and functions are extremely similar. Now that you've locked your phone, it’s time to pay attention to the map — if you've left your phone in a cab or on public transport, you'll be able to see it moving on the map. Keep your cab receipt or transport ticket, it will tell you the exact cab or bus/train that you were on. Call the bus/cab/train company and explain your situation giving the number of the vehicle. Public transport will allow you to pick it up from the depot. With a cabs, you can arrange to have it dropped back to your location for a fee. If you’ve simply dropped it somewhere, it should appear stationary on the map. The map tracking system will allow you to retrace your steps and pin-point exactly where you may have lost your precious device. But keep in mind the location accuracy in the menu box eg. Accurate to 21 metres. This means that you will have to search a 21 metre radius for your abandoned device. Ring Since the location of your phone on the map is not a pin-point location but a radial area, the Ring function offered by Android Device Manager is especially helpful. By clicking on the Ring icon, your phone will begin to ring as it normally would and you’ll be able to follow the sound — even if it’s on silent. Erase Android Device Manager also offers an option to remotely wipe your phone. In the instance that you are unable to retrieve your phone, you will want to consider erasing the data stored on your device. You don't want random people being able to look through your folder of selfies or gain access to your banking apps. To erase your phone, simply click on the icon and follow the prompts. So long, pretty Android. Alternative Tracking Apps Google's native toolset is the best way to find a lost Droid. But if you're looking for other tools, here are some other very reliable and efficient Android tracking apps.

Reply 0 djbear @djbear Jan 4, 2017, 9:49pm More and more people switching to windows phone? Not likely Their market share has shrunk more than half in the past 2 years.

Asks me for my authentication code, which I can only access on my phone, which is apparently lost... Better to try the feature out first, before you lose you phone. Reply 0 quop @quop Jun 18, 2015, 4:14pm Use one of your backup codes - they're meant for situations like this.

All my music is backed up on my computer and there is nothing on my phone that I give a damn about. I either find it or scrub it and get another phone the next day.

Reply 1 leolamau Guest Jan 1, 2016, 11:39pm i lost my iphone 4s three times and return a iphone once to the owner. First time, accidently dropped it at Hume Highway. Used my wife's iphone and Find Iphone app to track it back to the exact location on the side of the road. Second time, dropped it while ridding on the bike, did not have access to another apple device so could not use Find Iphone app. But notice i lost it withing 10 minutes, so went back to the trail and ask the first person who was riding the bike and he got the phone. Third time, this time in Hong Kong. It fell off my pocket like the second time, but this time it had no sim card inside so no way to use Find Iphone app. But again realised it was lost within the first 10 minutes. Went back to food court, asked the cleaner and she said she handed it back to management. My parents who are not iphone users and dont now much about technology found a iphone 5s. So they just left it on, and it ran out of battery. After three months i got hold of this lost phone and attempted to return it back since i got my iphone returned back to me. This iphone 5s was passcode protected and i was in korean. I did some googling and some people recommended calling the telco and give them the IMEI number so they can contact the owner. So pop the sim to find the telco, Vodaphone. Called them and they kinda laughed at me for trying to return the phone back, anyway they had no trace of the IMEI number, i am guess they can only do search of the current activities, and given the phone had be lost for three months and more its no longer in their records for searching. I then tried connecting to my computer hoping to use some software to see the files inside or by pass the passcode, but no such luck, all software requires you to "trust" the computer and which requires the passcode to unlock the phone first. I then made the mistake of updating the iphone before search youtube for instructions of how to break the passcode. And there was plenty of exploit example, one involves using Siri, but Siri is only available if you have internent connections and other ways involves some key instructions but since i updated it to the latest OS, these exploits are no longer working. I then resorted to restoring the entire phone so i can by pass the passcode and then some how use the recovery too to undelete data. And then i found another security measure by Apple, is that if the owner of the phone uses Find Iphone app it will lock the account to the phone, and forever the phone cannot be unlocked by anyone else unless the owner removes this association. So tried the last thing i could think of (but should have tried it first), which is to put the sim to another phone and retrieve the phone number. And there it was the owner's phone number. I called it and she was surprised that someone found her phone. Luckily her sim was locked as well otherwise i would not be able to access the sim information. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

According to noted Apple leakster Sonny Dickson, iOS 10.3 will debut a new Theater Mode, which will make its presence felt with a new popcorn icon within the Control Centre. However, exactly what Theater Mode will offer is unknown at this stage. Related: iOS 10 review It could quite easily be rumoured night mode theme that makes it possible to use the iPhone or iPad in the cinema or in discreetly without disturbing other people. Although it’d be a surprise if Apple added a feature that encouraged such antisocial smartphone use. There’s also a chance the feature would prime the device with the perfect settings for watching video content. Thankfully, we won’t have long to wait to find out.

Grant showed that two-factor authentication isn’t needed when using an unknown Mac to login to iMessage, iTunes, FaceTime, the App Store or Apple’s website. According to Grant, only one of the five services sent an email notification advising that an unknown device was used to log in …  FaceTime was the sole service for which Apple sent an email notification, Grant said: It should be noted that similar messages have been sent out by Apple in the past for iMessage as well, though the same protection is not currently offered by iTunes, the App Store, and Apple’s website. While the iCloud ‘hacks’ didn’t involve any compromise of the service itself, relying instead on a combination of phishing and easily-guessed passwords or security questions, it did draw attention to the risks to technically-naive users (especially celebrities, who are forced to choose from a limited number of security questions whose answers can be easily researched). Apple briefly introduced two-factor authentication for iCloud.com in June of last year, before reintroducing it shortly after the scandal. But as Grant illustrates, other Apple services remain vulnerable. Check out the rest of the video demos on Medium. Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

The answers can be just as inscrutable as the strongest passwords. “What is your mother’s maiden name?” can be answered with QKkAa3VMuuQyTB7gfegxGnoYcaNu. It’s users answering the questions truthfully that’s the problem. frankman91 - 2 years ago Reply Are you on drugs? standardpull - 2 years ago Reply I can tell you from first hand experience running authentication services that letting users make up their own security questions, on the whole, is a lot less secure than letting them chose questions from a limited list. On the whole, people make up very stupid questions (like “what is 2+2”) Also, it is important to note that there is an unlimited number of security answers that users can supply. In short, only people who take security somewhat seriously can be secure. Even 2FA isn’t a panacea – those who think it is are putting too much trust in the technology and businesses that are involved in the business processes. Scott (@ScooterComputer) - 2 years ago Reply Wow…how hard would it have been for Apple to instruct an intern to figure all THIS out? Which means they know. Which means they’re not fixing it. Which means…?? Gregory Wright - 2 years ago Reply Give me a break. All of you experts on here. How do you know what’s going on behind the scene at Apple. atokosch - 2 years ago Reply Every time I do something with my Apple ID I get an email and I have been getting this for years. I log out on say my iPad I get an email saying ____’s Apple ID has been signed out on _______’s device. Same when I log into a device, even if I have had it for years and I had to log out for some reason. I also get one when I enable iMessage or FaceTime or turn those services off. I honestly think I have been getting these since my iPhone 4 or 4S. jdwarwick - 2 years ago Reply The worst thing is that you can log into iMessage with your Apple ID and ANY password. You do get an email about new device, but it’s not like you can do anything about it. xweaponx - 2 weeks ago Reply (I know this is ooollld, but I just recently started using Apple 2-Step Auth) I think that happened to me tonight, someone was phishing for my iCloud access. I got a notification that “Junior’s iPhoone” (spelled just like that) had MY iMessage added to it. I don’t have any devices named that. This disturbs me that anyone can ping my Apple ID with a fake password. I was asleep, I had to JUMP up and check all of my Apple Accounts. Not a sign of “Junior’s iPhoone” anywhere. Not even a history of the notification I got. The question is, HOW are they doing this, from another iPhone or are they using Google Allo? I had heard something about that, new Google messaging app, that it could be used to access iMessage accounts, and that’s not even on the same platform. I don’t know how true that is, though, but I can at least check that out by installing Allo into an android device I have and trying it myself. I think my safest bet is to use “Log out of all browsers” from my Primary iCloud accounts- But that’s iCloud, not iMessage. I don’t even know if this still applies, the article being 2 years old, I’m hoping that the security is a little better now. Thanks.

This year, the company’s promotion for the holiday is a one-day sale that will see customers receive a free pair of Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones with the purchase of a qualifying Mac or iPhone. “May the New Year dream come true.” The promotion will run in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, kicking off on January 6th at 8AM local time. While Apple is celebrating the Chinese New Year in Malaysia, it’s not extending the same promotion to customers there. For one day only, get the latest Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones – Red when you buy select Mac or iPhone models, including iPhone 7. In order to qualify for a free pair of Beats Solo3, customers must purchase an iMac, MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or Mac Pro. Interestingly, the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does not qualify for the deal, nor does the Mac Mini. If you’re more interested in purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus qualify for the promotion. Apple has also shared a new gift guide offering up some of the hottest gifts for the Chinese New Year. Products include various (PRODUCT)RED accessories such as the Apple Watch Sport Band, iPhone cases, the BB-8 Droid, and much more. The gift guide is similar to gift guides Apple has shared in other countries, such as the United States, but focuses largely on products that are red or gold in color. Last year in celebration of Chinese New Year, Apple launched two exclusive Apple Watch Sport models with dark red strips. In earlier years, it has held ‘Red Friday’ shopping events, offering sales similar to its Black Friday promotions in the United States. If you’re in one of the qualifying countries, had to Apple’s online store now to view full details of the Chinese New Year sale. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Advertisement In early September, Apple confirmed its highly anticipated iOS 10 release date. And on September 13th, the company rolled out the iOS 10 update for select iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models around the world. iOS 10 is a solid replacement for iOS 9 but it far from perfect. iOS 10 problems have been plaguing iPhone and iPad owners in the months since release and many users are calling for a new iOS 10 update to address these lingering problems. Fortunately, help is on the way in the form of a massive iOS 10.2 update for iPhone, iPad and the iPod touch. Apple’s confirmed an iOS 10.2 release and today we want to go over the most important things to know, right now, about the second major update to the iOS 10 operating system. Advertisement This roundup takes a look at what we know for sure about the iOS 10.2 update. It also outlines a few things you can expect from the upcoming iOS 10.2 release for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch including the iOS 10.2 release time in the United States and countries around the world. We’ll continue to add new information to this roundup so check back for regular updates. iOS 10.2 Beta If you want to try the iOS 10.2 update on your device right now, you can. Apple’s pushed an iOS 10.2 beta to developers and the general public. Anyone with an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch can download the iOS 10.2 beta, for free, via Apple’s Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.2 beta is pretty big and there are some very good reasons to think about trying it out on your iPhone, iPad or iPad touch ahead of the official release date. Advertisement You can test the iOS 10.2 update’s new features and you can also test its performance on your phone or tablet which might be a good idea if you’re using an older device like the iPhone 5 or iPad mini 2. Before you install the iOS 10.2 beta, make sure you prepare your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. A little prep work will go a long way toward preventing iOS 10.2 beta problems. And yes, there are a number of issues with the current version of the beta. We’ve noticed lag, issues with connectivity, random reboots, occasional abnormal battery drain, and issues with various apps. If you download the beta, there’s a good chance you’ll encounter an issue or two. To help you prepare, we’ve put together a guide that will take you through the beta installation process. If this is your first time installing a beta on your iPhone or iPad, make sure you take a look at those before you go through with the process. They could save you some time. If you do decide to give the iOS 10.2 beta a go, make sure you report issues as you see them. This will help Apple improve the final product. You might also want to look at our list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.2 beta on your iPhone or iPad. iOS 10.2 beta and its list of features make it tempting but there are definitely some reasons to avoid the beta. You Can Downgrade from iOS 10.2 Beta If you’re currently on the iOS 10.1 update or the iOS 10.1.1 update you can try the iOS 10.2 beta and drop back down if you decide you don’t want/like the beta. As of right now, you can download the iOS 10.2 beta and drop back down to iOS 10.1 or iOS 10.1.1. Unfortunately, you can’t downgrade to anything older than those two updates. The downgrade process is pretty straightforward. For a detailed list of instructions, take a look at our iOS downgrade guide. iOS 10.2 Release Date Earlier this year, Apple confirmed a new iOS 10 update for December. The update, it said, would deliver the company’s new Apple TV app to iOS users. Apple’s iOS 10.2 beta 2 delivered the new Apple TV app to beta testers so it looks like Apple will release iOS 10.2 sometime later this month. This isn’t confirmed but it appears likely at this point.  The only time Apple confirms specific iOS release dates is when it confirms them on stage during media events. And with no other media events rumored or likely for 2016, we probably won’t get an official iOS 10.2 release date ahead of time. That said, Apple’s left us a potential clue. The company hasn’t confirmed anything but it says it plans to address iPhone 6s random shutdown issues in an upcoming iOS update. That update will apparently arrive next week. From a support document on the company’s website: Outside the affected batch, a small number of customers reported an unexpected shutdown. Some of these shutdowns may be normal, because the iPhone will shut down to protect its electronic components. To gather more information, we will add an additional diagnostic feature to the iOS software update that is released next week. This feature collects a variety of information in the coming weeks that may help us improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shutdown operations. If such improvements can be achieved, we will deliver them through further software updates. The support document was posted on December 6th which means an update should arrive during the week of December 12th, maybe on December 12th itself. (Apple’s gotten into the habit of releasing new iOS software on Monday’s.) Next week or not, the iOS 10.2 release is close. iOS 10.2 Release Time The exact iOS 10.2 release date is difficult to predict but the iOS 10.2 release time isn’t. If Apple sticks to its usual release protocol, and there’s no reason to believe that it won’t, iOS 10.2 will arrive around 10AM Pacific on release day. The same can be said for all of the upcoming iOS 10.2 beta releases. Here’s what that looks like for regions in the United States and countries around the world including Australia and Japan: Eastern – 1 PM Central – 12 PM Mountain – 11AM London – 6 PM Moscow – 9 PM New Dehli – 10:30 PM Shanghai – 1 AM Tokyo – 2 AM Melbourne – 3 AM Auckland – 5 AM Apple probably won’t confirm the release time ahead of release so you’ll want to keep an eye on your device(s) around this time Monday-Friday. iOS 10.2 Update The iOS 10.2 update appears to be a pretty sizable upgrade for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and we could see even more added to it as Apple tweaks the beta ahead of its official release date. The crown jewel of the iOS 10.2 upgrade, for most people, will be the new emojis. Unicode 9 emoji are included in iOS 10.2 beta. Notable additions include an avocado, shark, croissant, a shark, a carrot, a squid, bacon, a kiwi, and an owl. iOS 10.2 beta includes new emojis. There are also new wallpapers, a setting that allows you to preserve your last known camera settings called “Preserve Settings”, performance improvements, a new Celebration messages effect, new wallpapers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and some smaller tweaks. It also, as we’ve noted, brings the new Apple TV app. The iOS 10.2 beta also brings a new TV settings section in Settings and a new SOS mode. The SOS mode is only available for users in India in iOS 10.2 beta 3. It was available to a much wider range of users in iOS 10.2 beta 2. Here’s a list of features that arrived with iOS 10.2 beta 1, here’s a list for the more recent iOS 10.2 beta 2 release, and here’s a list of changes on board the iOS 10.2 beta 3. The iOS 10.2 beta 4, 5, 6, and 7 updates are much smaller and didn’t bring any significant changes to the iOS 10.2 update. iOS 10.2 Jailbreak Don’t expect an iOS 10.2 jailbreak on the iOS 10.2 release date. Developers are reportedly working on an iOS 10 jailbreak but well-known security expert Luca Todesco is warning jailbreak users to avoid the iOS 10.2 update when it’s released. Those looking to jailbreak iOS 10 should remain on iOS 10.1.1 because there’s a higher likelihood we’ll see a jailbreak for that version of iOS 10. For more on the iOS 10 jailbreak, take a look at our roundup. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 12 known patches for potential exploits including one where an "attacker with an unlocked device may be able to disable Find My iPhone."  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.1.1 update and/or the iOS 10.1 update, know that iOS 10.2 brings their security patches with it. If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 24 Responses 09/22/2016 Franklin Marder Reply Why do you waste so much space discussing a release date that has not been announced. It’s as if you are using a template and leave in all of the extraneous stuff. To be useful your posts need to get to the point. 10/02/2016 Scott Reply Thanks for wasting my time reading this. 10/31/2016 juansamaniegor Reply love the new #iOS10 #iMessage but the only thing missing is have profile picture. 10/07/2016 Nick Reply Brevity is unfortunately not your strong point. 10/12/2016 Shitt Reply Bullshitting 10/16/2016 Clyde Reply This article is so badly written, I wouldn’t allow him/her to write a postcard after reading it! 10/16/2016 Franklin Marder Reply My issue is not the quality of the writing but the utterly misleading headline. It is in Beta and there is no known release date. I m a developer and I would know. This is also the second publication of essentially the same article and it just regurgitates Apple’s developer documentation. Publishing anything about a Beta release as if it is final information is misleading and shouldn’t be allowed by any responsible news site. 11/01/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply Guess Apple came 2nd this time since android had it first with the release of nougat… 11/19/2016 moo Reply there was always a squid emoji… 11/25/2016 David OBrien Reply What’s really getting on my nerves with the latest 10.2 beta is that when I go to write a text message… and choose a contact, if I come across one I’ve previously deleted, when I press the “I” and try to remove from recents, NOTHING HAPPENS! And it’s driving me mad! I’ve not seen anyone else reporting this, am I alone? 11/28/2016 Sick Of Adam Mills Reply These articles your write about “X You Should Know About OS Y.Z” have been trash from the beginning, when you first started doing them. Please make it stop! They are awful. It is painfully obvious you know nothing about software, or software development. Please pick any other topic you can think of to write about, excluding software. 11/30/2016 Theo Reply Wish Apple would go back to iOS 9.3.5. I detest so many things about iOS 10. Previously I could swipe to get rid of the lock screen. Now, I/we have to press the Home button. I have an iPad 4 with a non-operational home button. Now I have to spend money on a repair? The whole idea of a touch-screen is to get away from mechanical switches! Another thing: when I get a notification from Gmail of a new email, there is this broad banner that takes up unnecessary real estate on the screen. Then, when I open the email, the keyboard comes up and blocks half the screen. Mostly, I just want to read the email, not reply to it. Previously, a particular app allowed adjustment of font sizes. This feature disappeared with the “up”grade. A “pox on you”, Apple, for killing my enjoyment of my iOS devices! 12/04/2016 Don S Reply I have version 10.0.2 on my iPhone 6s. Am I way behind the times and in danger from security issues? 12/06/2016 Christi Reply iOS being the second biggest mobile platform in terms of volume and first in terms of developers remuneration. iOS apps development are a part of improving business, setting signature presence and building a great brand. Thanks for sharing 12/13/2016 Robert Kazi Reply On this new iOS 10.2 it is impossible to watch my old “home videos” wich I use to sync through iTunes. No way to see those videos on the new “TV” App 12/13/2016 Franklin Marder Reply You may want to look at the iOS version of the VLC app as it is a bit of a can opener for multi-media files.

After using the Apple Watch Sport for most of the year and comparing it to our time with the more expensive Apple Watch, these are the reasons that the Apple Watch Sport is a better choice for most users. Advertisement Apple just announced the Apple Watch Series 2, which is waterproof up to 50 meters, includes a faster processor and built-in GPS. There is an Apple Watch 2 Sport, but it is chosen as options when picking the Apple Watch you want. If you need to use the Apple Watch to swim or run a Tough Mudder wait for the Series 2. Here’s more on which Apple Watch series 2 to buy. Most consumers are comparing the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport and asking which, “Apple Watch should I buy?” while they try to figure out which one to spend money on. You can read our Apple Watch review to find out how this device holds up over time. The functionality between the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport is identical, but the look and feel is different. Advertisement The Apple Watch Series 1 Sport starts at $269 for the 38mm versions and $299 for the Apple Watch Series 1 Sport in 42mm. Apple doesn’t offer a Series 1 in Stainless Steel. The Apple Watch Series 2 Sport is $369 in 38mm and $399 in 42mm while the regular version is $549 and $599 in 38mm and 42mm respectively. We’ve seen deals that offer $50 off the Apple Watch Sport and up to $200 off the Apple Watch, so if you look for a discount you can find a lot of savings. Why we think the Apple Watch Sport is better than the Apple Watch. After extended time using the Apple Watch Sport and looking at some of the Apple Watch problems that come with the Stainless Steel model, here are five reasons the Apple Watch Sport is better than the Apple Watch. Advertisement It is possible to find Apple Watch deals that drop the price of both models $50 to $100 which helps with affordability. Rumors suggest the Apple Watch 2 is coming in late 2016. We are already seeing a wide variety of Apple Watch accessories and there are a multitude of new Apple Watch bands from third-parties that plan to add new styles and cheaper options to change the look of your watch without upgrading. There are also a number of stands and docks that work with both models featured in this comparison for a more elegant charging solution. Apple Watch Sport is Lighter   1 / 5 If you aren't used to wearing a watch and you want to work out, the Apple Watch Sport is a clear win. The aluminum case is lighter which means you won't notice it on your wrist as much as the Apple Watch with a Stainless Steel case. The Apple Watch Sport weighs 25 grams in 38mm and 30 grams in 42mm. the Apple Watch is 40 grams in 38mm and 50 grams in 42mm thanks to the heavier Stainless Steel. A nickel weighs 5 grams, so if you want to feel the difference you can hold three or four nickels in your hand. It's not a major difference, but it will matter to some users. You can also try-on the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport at an Apple Store to see the difference for yourself.   1 / 5 30 Responses 07/02/2015 Patrick Jensen Reply This is the dumbest list I’ve written. Stainless steel does scratch, yes, but those scratches can be buffed out extremely easily, in a matter of minutes. Aluminum scratches however, cannot be buffed out and dig deeper in to the material. The sapphire crystal display on the apple watch is of much higher quality, a hardness only second to diamond. The apple watch glass or “ion X” scratches EXTREMELY easily. The apple watch sport is also too light, it feels like a gimmicky, cheap toy. The apple watch on the other hand, feels solid, it has some heft to it. It feels like a real time peace and not like a little toy. The apple watch stainless steel will without a doubt hold up better over time. Also, while all the bands can be interchangeable the sport model looks stupid sporting a stainless steel band or a leather buckle. The stainless steel matches well with all the bands, no matter which one. While I do appreciate the sport model as well, I feel as though this article was written by someone who is jealous they couldn’t afford the stainless steel model, so they resulted to bashing it and saying why the cheaper model is “so much better”. 08/21/2015 Stop Complaining Reply Did your mommy let you on the computer again? ;-) 09/14/2015 You deserve a facepalm Reply Hey! Didn’t your mommy ground you from trolling in the internet? 03/06/2016 D Camp Reply No, but it does appear that not only were his reasons “not” to purchase rather…lame, he left his spell check off.

People are allowed to have their own opinions you know? 08/24/2016 crafthouseimages Reply Good man. 02/24/2016 Just the Facts Reply You are absolutely right. Steal is harder than aluminum: http://metalsupermarkets.com/blog/10-differences-aluminum-stainless-steel/ Its crazy to say or imply that aluminum is better because its scratches less. This idea is born form pure ignorance. The author should simply amend this section stating a correction and swallow the pride instead of making some weird anonymous insults, in the comments. 07/31/2015 Kingsley Arthur Rowe Reply i pick my watch for most of the reasons you listed in your article great minds think alike. :) 08/14/2015 mj Reply It really doesn’t matter if it will “hold up over time.” This is first-gen tech that will soon be obsolete and replaced by better tech. It most likely isn’t going to be a collectable, and it’s not fine craftsmanship that will last for decades like an expensive handmade watch that you would pass down to family. I’m going for the Sport model, and I’m gonna have fun with it :) 02/27/2016 Luke Reply I love your thinking, I’m doing the same thing!

I just bought my first one and did go with the 42mm Sport along with the Armorsuit screen protector for two main reasons. #1 – Cost… $250 cheaper than the comparable Apple Watch model. If I don’t like this then I’m not out as much $$. #2 new model on the horizon. Didn’t want to spend $600 on something I may want to replace later this year or early next (presuming I still like the Apple Watch brand). You could add a 3rd reason though and that is while the Apple Watch may “look” better and the sapphire glass is harder (but not as much) those reasons (along with a “prettier box”) left me not to be able to justify the Apple Watch over the Apple Watch Sport model. Just my 2 cents. 03/22/2016 Thelma Reply wao…!m­­­­­­­­­y room­­­­­­­­­ate’s e­­­­­­­­­x-w­­­­­­­­­ife ma­­­­­­­­­kes $83 e­­­­­­­­­very ho­­­­­­­­­ur o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e inter­­­­­­­­­net .

It seems like the one who wrote it, was choosing the sport because it cost less. I don’t really care about the cost. Im searching for reviews about the difference of them, because I want something that will last. Something that is durable, and that will withstand the weather, if it gets wet, everyday use. Im tired of my watches that I have to take to the store to change the battery every time they stop working. Tired of having to buy a different watch every time they tell me we can’t figure out how to take the battery out you have to take it to a jeweler. This article just said that the sport watch is a lot lighter then the stainless steel one, and that the prices differ by a lot. Also would like to find an article on how to change the apple watch band to a different one. 06/07/2016 James Reply If you need help with that Chris maybe you don’t need one. There really isn’t a difference in the watch other that steel,glass,and price. Also if you’re complaining about a battery then this watch isn’t for you. Only last for 18hrs before you need to charge it. 06/15/2016 ace Reply Stainless steel runs around the same tensile yield strength (really the best measure of strength for these metals) as standard aluminums. This will govern damage from impacts etc. Comparing the two on that level is kind of worthless. The elastic modulus (how rigid it is) of steel is about 2.9 times higher than the aluminium; given the similar strengths, this means that steel is 2.9 times “scratchier” than Al. This will mean that stainless steel will scratch Al and Al will not scratch stainless steel, and applies generally to how frequently a thing will scratch. It’s called the hardness of a material, and you can verify the info i have given by checking the brinell hardness of the materials: 6000 series Al runs around 95, while 304 stainless runs 265. Neither material is actually going to be fixed by polishing, but Al oxidizes when exposed to air, so part of that scratched material is actually powdered into a non-metal rather than pushed out of the way. At the end of the day, the scratch resistance is similar, and both kick the crap out of precious metals, let alone your skin, so i don’t really see this as a make or break criteria. -Structural Engineer. PS Please stop saying “steal” is “hard”. 07/27/2016 Rachita Reply Both has its ups and downs – http://techdracula.com/apple-watch-aluminum-vs-stainless-steel/ 08/23/2016 Chris Stanley Reply The writer can only be responsible for what he says, not what we understand. Stop crying. I read this opinion piece because I’m trying to make a decision. I can read many of these opinion pieces and put it all together and make my own decision based on my own desires and the opinions of others. If you don’t care about a 200 dollar difference then why are you even reading this? Just go out and buy one. 08/24/2016 cestasol11 Reply i like this watch 08/24/2016 crafthouseimages Reply I’d like to know if you can change the display, or are you stuck with the one chosen on purchase. I’d also like to know exactly what the features are; like, can you use it as a phone, now that would be cool. Does it receive text messages and other inherit features of our new phone devices? 08/24/2016 Brian Reply The face size and casing are part of what you buy. Sure you can get a band for an Apple Watch and put it on a sport but the watch case itself remains. Also if you wanted the larger screen then you would buy a new watch (because even if you find a larger face on the Internet it would cost about the same… the tech is in the face). You can make/receive calls (as long as your phone is in range w/ Bluetooth) but from what others have said the quality is same or worse than putting the phone on speaker. I do use it to answer but usually say “hold on… transferring the call to the phone”. Text come thru, simple emoji and preset simple replies but you can also use voice to text (which works except in loud areas). Again, your phone has to be in Bluetooth range. As I mentioned in a post back in April I bought the sport to “try it out”. I love it and would buy the Apple Watch but at this point waiting for (hopefully) the next hardware revision before plunking down the extra dough for the nicer one isn’t worth it. I’m hoping for integrated music playback (it can store music but you can only listen through Bluetooth). Better Bluetooth. Camera (because sometimes I want a quick shot without pulling out my phone with little regard to quality). WiFi would be really nice as BT lags sometimes. That’s on my “wish list” if Apple does continue hardware dev on the Watch. 09/07/2016 Malcolm McKay Reply All food for thought Brian. Sheesh, sorry for the late response to your reply. I think I may wait until the new one ships (I heard late Aug) Can’t wait to have a great Apple watch, lol. Sports are tempting but surely they must have a lesser build to be so much cheaper.

(BigStock Image) With 2016 now in the rear-view mirror, it’s time to take a quick moment to forecast what might be looming on the horizon in the near year. Who better to ask than a group of venture capitalists, the money managers who are paid big bucks to see around corners and determine what technologies will impact our lives going forward. The new year certainly brings a set of challenges and opportunities, and this much is clear: No one really knows what will happen. As venture capitalist Loretta Little says: “what a year 2017 will be to predict anything!” Even so, we quizzed five Seattle area venture capitalists to get their take on what they think will transpire in 2017. Optimistic by their nature, all of the venture capitalists believe the Nasdaq will continue to surge, with one predicting a 25 percent uptick. They also see a steady stream of initial public offerings. In terms of hot sectors, they are bullish about cloud computing, artificial intelligence and personalized genomics, while many think the technologies behind autonomous vehicles are a bit overhyped. Here’s more from our five VCs: Bill Bryant, partner at DFJ Bill Bryant at GeekWire Startup Day 2015. (GeekWire photo) Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 (candidates): Three (Avalara, Avvo and a biotech whose name I don’t know). I can’t formally comment on Redfin’s plans as DFJ is an investor but would imagine that Redfin will look closely at its options as the year progresses Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 8-10 new investments (1-3 of which will be in Seattle) Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $845 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $88.88 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $845 Apple stock close on 12/31/17: ($115.82 now): $88.88 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,924 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: CRISPR, voice everywhere, personalized genomics and every smarter robots. What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Machine learning/machine intelligence – not because its unimportant but because it (has) become basic tablestakes. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: I continue to believe we are very early on in the full transition of the enterprise to the cloud. Also, opportunities related to globalization (next billion coming online and entering the world economy), retraining and re-skilling initiatives aimed at those being displaced by automation, and the impact of renewable energy now being cheaper than fossil fuels. Advice to startups for 2017: We’ve had a remarkably forgiving five to seven year run where so many ideas seemed to work, at least for a time. The next five years will require more fortitude, a focus on ‘hard tech’ and solving deeply rooted societal problems.  We’ve had a remarkably forgiving five to seven year run where so many ideas seemed to work, at least for a time. The next five years will require more fortitude, a focus on hard tech and solving deeply rooted societal problems. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Facebook will find a way to buy, or bury, Snapchat. Microsoft will buy either SAP or Salesforce to consolidate its position in the enterprise. Bezos will purchase Twitter and consolidate it with the Washington Post. This will be an up or out year for VR/AR where it will start to generate a market and live up to early expectations – or not. The Bay Area will see a marked (10%+) decline in startup activity relative to locations like Seattle, Portland, Austin, Boulder and LA due to the cost of real estate and housing – startups and their employees will be priced out of the geography. The NBA will announce a return to Seattle. Tim Porter, partner at Madrona Venture Group Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 2 Madrona Managing Director Tim Porter. Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 10-14, consistent with our pace of the last several years. We continue to see many compelling opportunities and exciting new Pacific Northwest companies being formed, and so we plan to continue an aggressive investment pace. Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $875 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $67.50 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($748.87 now): $914 Apple stock close on 12/31/17: ($115.82 now): $115 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,825 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: AI and machine learning will continue to be the hottest and most important technological wave, infusing most/all sectors of technology, as all applications become “intelligent applications” over time.  AI and machine learning will continue to be the hottest and most important technological wave. What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Autonomous Cars. I think we are moving down the path towards truly autonomous self-driving cars faster than most anticipated just a few years ago, and we will definitely get there. We will see continued incremental innovation and capabilities demonstrated in 2017. However, we will also see players run into the reality of the many challenges around this technology. I and Madrona are long-term very bullish in this field, but the hype feels like it’s at a fever pitch versus what the industry can actually deliver this coming year. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: I am extremely excited about enterprises continued move to cloud native computing, updating their architectures to a combination of cloud, containers and microservices. Within this, I think you will see the popularity of Kubernetes continue to increase (one of our drivers behind investing in Heptio). Advice to startups for 2017: Be scrappy with cash, maniacally focus on your customers and prospects, raise money on reasonable terms when you have the opportunity to do so, be very detail-oriented measuring and understanding your unit economics, and then be aggressive scaling when you see favorable and repeatable unit economics for acquiring and retaining customers. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Private company M&A will increase. Mariners will make the World Series. Loretta Little, managing director at WRF Capital* Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 2-3? Still probably low because there is a lot of private equity out there for solid companies. Perhaps Redfin and Adaptive Biotechnologies. Loretta Little Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: Our investments are based on a fiscal year (July to June). We have made two new investments since July 2016. I expect, in calendar year 2017, we will make 2-4 more. Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $850 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $70 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $850 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ($115.82 now): $130 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): Who would have predicted the market increases amid all the uncertainty? Will that change? 5,600. What will be the hottest technology of 2017: Tech: virtual assistants & natural language processing. Biotech: CRISPR/Cas gene editing system What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Tech-autonomous vehicles; Bio – I’m not going to pick a specific technology. What makes me crazy in the life sciences arena is when scientists publish a paper or report data at a conference and it gets hyped by others so members of the general public believe there is an actual product. This leads to unrealistic expectations and sometimes a distrust of science. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: No specific area. I invest in early stage companies, so I am generally an optimist and try to track across the healthcare spectrum. Advice to startups for 2017: Be able to concisely describe your business, your value proposition and your goals. Stay flexible and continually revisit your assumptions. Ask for input from a myriad of sources. You don’t need to agree, but you should always be listening. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: These aren’t bold — I think they are pretty realistic — more vegetables, more VR, Viaduct vagaries and vocal voters. *Loretta wanted to offer this caveat: “My focus is on life science/healthcare companies so my predictions on tech companies are based on general observation versus in depth industry knowledge. I noticed you didn’t ask about Seattle Genetics, Amgen or Cerner.” Bill McAleer, partner at Voyager Capital Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 (candidates): Two: Avalara, Payscale or Offerup Bill McAleer Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 4 Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $825 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $74 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $942 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ($115.82 now): $126 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,680 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: Smart home applications; Text and chatbots emerge as a new channel for businesses to interact with customers What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Self-driving cars; also VR (virtual reality) as widespread adoption (once again )will be slow. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: Advanced analytics, AI and machine learning applications that optimize business processes and/or customer interactions; Advice to startups for 2017: Go solve real customer problems, not a perceived market opportunity; once you have a customer, make them happy and find ways to offer them more. If you have to raise capital, do it early in 2017 before the cost and availability of capital is more constrained. And don’t judge success by how much money you have raised, the most effective form of funding is revenue from satisfied customers and partners.  If you have to raise capital, do it early in 2017 before the cost and availability of capital is more constrained. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: -Venture funding will get tighter and valuations will moderate; several unicorns will have financial issues buy the end of the year -Interest rates will rise by 200 basis points and appreciation in the housing market will slow. -F5 and Twitter get acquired. -Rise of populism continues in Europe, threatening the EU. -Seattle will settle on an arena option for basketball/hockey, with Chris Hansen leading the way to a deal. -Seattle Rep musical,  Come From Away, is a smash hit on Broadway. -Seattle continues to thrive as a major U.S. tech hub Molly Otter, chief investment officer at Lighter Capital Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 4 Molly Otter Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: Another record year for Lighter Capital.  We will double our deals again and do 200 in 2017.

What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Virtual reality. I think we are going to find out who the winners and losers are in the VR space in 2017, with a lot of VR companies running out of steam/money. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: Continued use of big data to help reduce our cost of capital to our customers Advice to startups for 2017: Have a plan for getting to break even (you don’t have to be on it but at least know how you would execute it) Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Patriots win the Super Bowl (again)!

It’s something that I’ve been talking about on the Apple Core podcast for some time. When they originally came out I expressed that I didn’t care for them whatsoever. Several months later, and several delays later the hype got to me. Something clicked. I’m not sure what it was but here I am, right? I am now writing a review for the AirPods, something I wrote off as soon as they came out. So let’s start with why I bought them in the first place. Well, to be fair, I got them because it was an Apple product and it’s my job to review these things. Admittedly, I had some interest in them. In terms of sound quality, I set the bar super low. While I didn’t write a review specifically for them, I absolutely hated the EarPods (both the 3.5mm and Lightning kind). Everything from the sound signature down to the fact that the cable kept forcing them out of my ear. For the last several years, I’ve given up on the EarPods as a whole. I’ve been using over-ear headphones ranging from the worst of the worst (the Audio-Technica ATH-M50), to some of my favorites (the Oppo PM-3). Again, here I am, writing an AirPods review. I also wrote an initial impressions of the AirPods a few weeks ago. Sound Quality If you’re looking to purchase AirPods to be blown away by sound quality, these are not for you. They’re bass heavy and that bass extension bleeds into the mids quite a bit. Treble is better than the EarPods, but they’re a bit recessed. For music, I’d highly recommend looking elsewhere. Though, Bluetooth and sound quality never mix. Personally, I would never use the AirPods intentionally for music, but they’ll get you by in a pinch. Point blank, don’t expect these to replace your high-end audio equipment anytime soon. For low-bitrate audio such as phone calls, audiobooks, podcasts, and things of that nature, AirPods are amazing. Don’t even bother trying to EQ these because it’s not worth it, seriously. AirPods are decent at any genre that has tons of bass and is dominated by bass. But try anything else, the bass will feel overpowering and overwhelming to most who care about sound quality. The other issue is that with tracks with little to no low end, the AirPods will sound abnormally tinny to the trained ear and the treble will then overtake the mid-range. It’s been a while since I’ve actually tried EarPods, but AirPods aren’t terrible. Obviously, sound will vary greatly depending on how well they fit in your ear. Soundstage is similar to the ATH-M50s in the sense that everything sounds very boxed in and lacks any sort of instrument separation whatsoever, though that’s expected from a set of earbuds with no real seal. Function The AirPods are amazing functionality wise. Everything from taking out one ear and having your audio automatically pause, to them automatically pairing when you put them in your ears. They’re awesome. The problem here is that they’re not 100% reliable. I’d say that these functions work 95% of the time, which may be good enough for most. When you take one out of your ear, there’s a noticeable half-second delay, and it sometimes doesn’t pair automatically when you take them out of the case and put them in your ear. It’s obvious that AirPods were built around the iPhone. When you open the lid, a card shows up on your iPhone telling you the battery life of the case and your AirPods. If you have one earbud in, it’ll show you the battery life of each individual AirPod. This automatic card is only available on the iPhone, and not on the iPad, (maybe the iPod touch, but who owns one of those?). On the Apple Watch, you can pull up Control Center, tap the battery icon, and it’ll show you the same information, but that’s not automatic. On the Mac is where it’s clear that AirPods weren’t designed for the platform. To view battery life on the Mac, you have to tap into the Sound menu bar icon and you see a battery indicator without the percentage. And lastly, on the Apple TV. While being a counterpart to iOS, tvOS doesn’t automatically pair like the rest of your devices. You have to go into Settings > Remotes and Devices > Bluetooth to pair these. Not the greatest. It’s also the only Apple platform that doesn’t have easy access to AirPods. On iOS and the Apple Watch, you can swipe up on Control Center, get to the media controls/AirPlay button and pair from there. On the Mac, you can go to the Sound menu bar icon and pair there, on tvOS you have to dig into Settings to do so. Unfortunately, I’ve found battery life indication to be extremely unreliable. It’s not that the percentages it gives out is inaccurate, that’s not the issue. The issue is trying to get the interface to show up at all. On the iPhone and iPad you can view the battery indicator in the Battery widget in iOS 10. However, I’ve found that it isn’t always there. Ideally, it’s supposed to show up if it’s paired to the device, but that’s not always the case. Most of the time, I have to put them back in its case and take them out a second time in order for it to show up. Same goes for the Apple Watch. The case that the AirPods come in are pretty great as well. It’s always charging the AirPods while in the case, and the case gives up to 24 hours of additional battery life for the AirPods. Remember, “up to.” In my personal experience, I’ve gotten around 15-20 hours of additional battery life which is fine. I have to charge the case every 2-3 days. Albeit, feels like the case takes forever to charge in comparison to the AirPods. The AirPods can charge from dead to 60% in about 15 minutes, that’s pretty awesome. But the case? It takes around 2-3 hours to fully charge and unless you’re charging the case overnight, this could feel like forever. Speaking of charging, it’s flat out annoying that the AirPods shipped with a Lightning to USB-A cable. Apple claims that USB-C is the future yet no Apple mobile device has shipped with a proper Lightning to USB-C cable in the box. Apple’s claim of 5 hours of battery life is pretty accurate as well. I’ve gotten anywhere between 4-4.5 hours which is right on the ball with Apple’s estimate. The microphones that are built into the AirPods are on a whole other level in terms of microphones on mobile devices. I was walking down a busy Seattle street the other day with tons of people walking by and engine-based cars stuck in traffic, yet, the person on the other end of the phone call could hear me just fine. That’s impressive. Using the microphones for Siri also works surprisingly well when Siri wants to work. And that brings me to my final point, the double tap gesture for Siri is awful. Maybe I’m not doing it right, but I’ve found that the gesture works about 40% of the time. I’ll keep it on versus changing it to Play/Pause (own an Apple Watch) or having it do flat out nothing. I originally thought, “Why not map out the gestures from the EarPods to the AirPods?” I now understand Apple’s decision. The gesture simply doesn’t work reliably enough to add any additional gesture. However, requiring an internet connection to do simple things such as adjusting the volume, is flat out insane. How well do they stay in the ear? For whatever reason this is the most asked question when people see me with AirPods. This isn’t an easy question to answer as everyone has different ear shapes. But for me, EarPods fit just fine and AirPods are the same. If anything the AirPods stay better in my ears due to the lack of wire. Initially, I was paranoid about them falling out of my ear and I kept pushing them back in every time I felt like they’d fall out of my ear. Though, that’s starting to slowly fade as I get more comfortable with them. I have yet to have them fall out of my ear at all. Conclusion While it may seem like I absolutely hate the AirPods, they’re by far my favorite Apple product of the year. They work reliably enough that it’s not super annoying. Sound quality will be adequate for any non-audiophile person. I’ll primarily use the AirPods for podcasts, audiobooks, phone calls, movies, and other non-music audio. While pairing with Apple TV is supper annoying, I primarily use it there because the Siri remote is able to adjust the volume of my AirPods. While it won’t be replacing my audiophile grade headphones, it’ll now have a place in my pocket on me at all times for when I need them. If you’re looking for a set of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, AirPods are the only ones I can recommend. While no promises can be made about Apple improving its software quality anytime soon, AirPods and the experience you get from them (that’s mostly due to the Apple designed W1 chip) cannot be matched. In the end, it’s silly to disregard sound quality in a set of headphones, especially from an audiophile. However, functionality wise, AirPods set a high bar for wireless headphones and is a truly innovative headphone, even though sound quality isn’t there yet.

So here’s my review: they sound the exact same (if not worse) than the $25 earpods. Is it worth $150 extra for a cool battery widget? jleetj What’s the point of having an audiophile’s perspective if sound quality is going to be ignored? All that was discussed in the review has already been mentioned in other reviews by non-audiophiles. s fr Ghey.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | January 2, 2017 -- 19:53 GMT (11:53 PST) | Topic: CES 2017: The Big Trends for Business Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 In the market for a new laptop? Dell's new XPS 13 2-in-1 hybrid could be the ultraportable you are looking for. CNET: Dell flips its high-end XPS 13 into a new hybrid Since Dell unveiled its first ultraportable XPS 13 at CES 2012, it's not only consistently been one of the best Windows laptops, it has also been the best Windows-powered counterpart to Apple's MacBook. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage But now Dell's XPS 13 just got a lot better thanks to a 2-in-1 conversion, which saw Dell take its existing XPS design and add a 360-degree hinge. This means that you can take the laptop and fold it back into a variety of different configurations, from tent to kiosk to tablet. It makes sense for Dell to go with a 2-in-1 design for the new XPS 13, given that this is one of the PC segments that is continuing to see sales growth. For the more conservative users out there, the XPS 13 2-in-1 also works like a regular laptop. Dell offers two different touch display options -- a standard 1930 x 1080 full HD display or an UltraSharp 3200 x 1800 Quad HD+ panel. Powering the new XPS 13 2-in-1 is a choice between a 3.2GHz Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor or a 3.6GHz Intel Core i7-7Y75 processor, both 7th-generation Kaby Lake silicon, and both featuring Intel HD Graphics 615. Despite packing the latest silicon, Dell has designed the new XPS 13 2-in-1 to be completely fanless. RAM options span 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB dual-channel LPDDR3, while storage options go from a basic 128GB SATA all the way up to 1TB PCIe SSD with Intel RST. On the battery front, the 46WHr pack is good for up to 15 hours when combined with the full HD display. There is also a webcam, a fingerprint reader that's Windows Hello-compliant, a couple of USB Type-C ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, microSD card reader, display port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Dell claims the new XPS 13 is the "smallest 13-inch 2-in-1 device on the planet," and while it has some really tough competition, the engineers have made it 40 percent thinner and 20 percent lighter than Microsoft's Surface Book. Prices start at $1,000 (which is $200 more than the basic XPS 13), and the systems are available starting January 5. And no laptop is complete without accessories. For the XPS 13 2-in-1 Dell is offering the following: Dell Hybrid Adapter + Power Bank - Combination 45W charger and 12800 mAh power bank Dell USB Type C to HDMI / VGA / Ethernet / USB 3.0 adapter -- For when you need more ports Top Windows 10-powered alternatives to the...

Technology 0  Updated at 1:24 pm, January 2nd, 2017 By: Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN Share This Story We Matched NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — After significant delays and months of hype, Apple AirPods are finally here. When Apple kicked the headphone jack to the curb in September in favor of wireless headsets, all eyes were on the change and futuristic-looking earpieces. After all, the company was betting big on its wire-free earbuds and wasn’t afraid to upset some Apple fans along the way. The concept is simple: Users sync the earpieces up with an iPhone (via Bluetooth) to play music, take calls and send Siri requests. But AirPods raised a lot of questions. To start, it looked like Apple chopped the wires off of its existing EarPods and turned them into oversized plastic earrings. Would people actually wear these? Another question: How well would they actually stay put? Not to mention how lose-able each earpiece appears to be. It’s hard enough to keep track of wired earbuds. But after spending a few days with the AirPods — now available in stores and online orders arriving at doorsteps on Wednesday — one thing is clear: Don’t worry too much about them flying out of ears. We did jumping jacks, head bangs and even somersaults while wearing AirPods. They handled movement surprisingly well. There were times the AirPods became somewhat loose, but all normal activities such as walking and jogging far with them exceeded our expectations. Some users, however, have already reported issues with the set staying in place. The fit is comfortable too; we forgot we were wearing them after about 30 minutes. The issue, however, of potentially losing one when you’ve left the pair on the kitchen table is another story. Sure, the cleverly-designed AirPods case, which doubles as a charger, keeps them in tact, but it’s not insurance you’ll always be able to find both them when you want. (This is more about the user than the product itself). The good news is if you’ve misplaced one, the other still works. But it’s ultimately a costly mistake to fix: Replacement earpieces cost $69 each. The sound quality is surprisingly strong for such small set. Wireless headphones and earbuds are notorious for less-than-stellar audio, but AirPods pack a powerful punch. The stems host the antennas and bring the microphone closer to your mouth. It also comes with internal sensors, so if you take one earpiece out, whatever you’re listening to or watching will pause. AirPods can interact directly with Siri, too. The voice assistant takes requests, such as providing weather updates or opening apps, after tapping the side of either earpiece. But Siri integration isn’t perfect. It works better with Apple’s built-in apps, but it’s limited when it comes to third-party programs (i.e. you’ll often need to reach for your phone to perform tasks, such as upping the volume). Getting Siri to work can also be a challenge. It often takes several taps on the earpiece to get a response. The same issue surfaced for answering phone calls. But the AirPods’ ability to otherwise take calls is impressive. With a synced iPhone on a desk about 230 feet away, we could clearly engage in a phone conversation without needing the device nearby. But those who don’t have an iPhone and want to use the AirPods may be in luck: they also work with Android products. Meanwhile, the AirPods charging case is brilliantly designed. Resembling a small container of dental floss, it snugly houses each earpiece. The case gets about a day’s worth of charge before it needs refueling (via a Lightning cable). AirPods placed inside receive about a five hour power boost after just 15 minutes. That’s pretty solid mileage, but if you’re new to wireless headsets, remembering to charge yet another gadget comes with a learning curve. Although investing in the future of wireless audio technology isn’t cheap, the AirPods are priced competitively at $160. Other wireless earbud options cost more, such as the Samsung Gear iconix ($199) or Jabra Elite Sport ($239). The concept of wireless earbuds in general might take some time for a mass audience to accept, but in a few years, we’ll likely look back on how weird it was that we once wore wires dangling from our ears.

York fired general manager, Trent Baalke and first-year coach Chip Kelly yesterday after a season-ending loss to the Seattle Seahawks.

He also was vague on a lot of other issues, including whether he regrets firing Jim Harbaugh three years ago (and he has since fired the proceeding two coaches). Here’s the transcript (Ann Killion and Josh DuBow also transcribed sections of this). —JED YORK presser transcript/ -Intro: First I want to let the fans know I apologize for a 2-14 season. I apologize for being back here again and making a change. I think it’s very important we re-establish a championship culture. We need to make sure we move forward and find the right head coach and general manager, two guys that can work together and re-establish the level we all expect and we want for the San Francisco 49ers. -Q: Why did Trent stay all year and do contracts? -YORK: I think I said it last year that we were going to evaluate Trent. Trent had a very clear specific vision from me, clear and specific goals. When you look at Vance (McDonald) and doing a contract extension, when you look at Ray-Ray (Armstrong) and doing a contract extension I trust Trent’s evaluation. I want to make sure the guys we have on this team are guys who are going to be here a long time. It was a team effort. We didn’t make a final decision until  the very end of the season. But we still had to be professionals and do what was right for the San Francisco 49ers at any point of the year. Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date on what Tim Kawakami has to say about the 49ers and more with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store or the Google Play store. -Q: Why are you competent to lead this search? -YORK: Nothing that I’m going to say is going to be a satisfactory answer. We need to make sure that our success speak for itself, our actions have to speak for itself. I’ve done it before. We’ve put together a team that has had three NFC championship runs. That was in the past. I can’t live on the past. I need to make sure that anything I do is backed up by the results on the field.   -Q: Who makes the decision and any thought of bringing in a team president to oversee? -YORK: Ultimately the decision will rest with me. I will look at people inside the building and continue to consult people outside of the building, folks that I trust, folks who are very well respected. Our system and our structure is going to be a head coach and a general manager and ultimately that decision rests with me. -Q: Will it be GM first or could it be coach first and then GM? -YORK: I think we need to be open and flexible to structure. We need to make sure that the head coach and the general manager know each other, have a good  understanding for each other. It doesn’t mean that they had to have worked together in the past but they have to have a good respect for each other and a good understanding and know that they have similar visions and philosophies on building a football team. Whatever structure is the best with the people that we’re interviewing is the structure that we’re going to go with. -Q: Why should you not be dismissed? -YORK: Nothing I’m going to say… -Q: Say something -YORK: Nothing I’m going to say is going to be satisfactory. We’re going to be judged on what we do and what we accomplish. We haven’t accomplished enough. I own this football team. You don’t dismiss owners. I’m sorry that that’s the facts and that’s the case but that’s the facts. I’m going to do everything I can to get this right. This isn’t about a business and running an operation to make money. We’re making sure we’re doing everything we can to re-establish this culture. It’s not an easy decision to dismiss a head coach and a general manager, especially people who have a lot of times left on their deals. I think that’s the best thing for us and  that’s what we need to do to get us back to where we want to be. -Q: Last year, you said Chip will be here a long time. What were expectations for wins and losses and why was Chip let go? -YORK: Obviously your record speaks for itself. But I think there’s more to it than that. Again if you’re going to re-establish a culture and have everybody held accountable in the locker room, players accountable to each other, I think the best way to do that is a clean slate. -Q: How do you convince candidates that this is a stable team? -YORK: When you’re starting with a clean slate and have two guys that are coming in to work together, two guys who will be fighting for each other and building what they see is necessary to get the 49ers back to where we need to be. That’s what we’re trying to put together. We’re going to have the opportunity with a lot of draft picks, we’re going to the opportunity with a lot of salary cap room. There are some pieces here. I don’t think there are enough pieces here but there are some pieces we can build with. But it has to be a partnership, it’s got to be a collaboration between me, the head coach and the general manager so we can get this thing right. -Q: How do you convince someone they will get a chance after two one and dones? -YORK: This is a re-establishment of culture. It’s a tough pill to swallow this year. But we need to make sure that when we’re working with the coach, working with the general manager, if they’re on the same page and they’re fighting for each other and fighting together.

If you talk to our coaches and talk to people who have been here, they know that I care about this team. I think our candidates know that I care about this team and I will do everything that we can to win. We’re going to spend the money to win, we’re going to do the right things culturally to win and we’ll make sure they have every piece necessary in our arsenal to win. When I talk about winning a championship, it might not be realistic for us to win a Super Bowl next year but the decisions we’re going to make are not going to be a quick fix, PR turnaround to go from a two-win team to an 8-8 team but that’s going to falter and not get to where we need to go. We need to know that we’re going to build things thing and it’s going to be a step function and we’re getting our way back to a Super Bowl level and there are pieces we need to fill on the coaching staff, on the roster, in the personnel department, everything across football ops. We need to make sure we’re continuing to build that and we’re going to have a vision will last for a long period of time and they will have the opportunity to do that and instill it. -Q: What will you do differently so not you’re back here next year doing the same thing? -YORK: I need to make sure we have  the right communication between the general manager and the head coach and the head coach and his staff. That’s why those two guys need to be on the same page and we need to have the right people on the staff. We’re going to continue to do everything that we can to get better. They’re going to have a very, very long leash in terms of making decisions. There are no sacred cows here. Whether that’s in the personnel department, on the coaching staff, in the locker room. They need to be able to re-establish a championship culture. That’s going to take time  to re-establish a championship culture. I’m not doing this so we can get to 8-8 or 9-7 and say ‘See, we turned it around we’re good.’ My ultimate goal is to win a championship, win multiple championships. That’s the foundation we need to lay. -Q: What went wrong? -YORK: In my vision of Chip and Trent working together I think it’s clear that Trent probably has more of a defensive mind. Pairing him with an offensive-minded guys, having those guys be partners and working together and being able to scout players who fit Chip’s system and being able to do things that build a defense and have a championship caliber defense which Trent has been a part of from building a roster since I think starting in 2005, wasn’t in that draft, but really 2005 till now. That’s sort of the vision that I saw. But the marriage didn’t work. I should have probably seen it. It’s easy to play revisionist history but we are where we are. That’s why we’re cleaning the slate and we’re re-establishing that culture. -Q: You hired Mike Nolan first in 2005 and he hired Scot McCloughan. Could you repeat that? -YORK: We need to be open to the right structure with the right people. We need to get the right people. It can’t be that I have the 53-man roster and you need to go back to your office. We can’t have that. It has to be these two guys on the same page and when we disagree on a player, we need to know what to do when we disagree on a player and how to move forward and move beyond it. That’s very important to me. Whether the head coach is on control, the general manager is in control, they need to be accountable to each other. That’s the most important relationship in  the building. -Q: Was communication an issue this year? -YORK: We were 2-14. That speaks for itself. We didn’t do a lot of things right this year. But if we’re going to re-set and re-establish that’s where it starts with the coach and the general manager. -Q: Given everything that has happened since December 2014, looking back on it, was it a mistake to fire Jim Harbaugh? -YORK: I can’t look backward. We need to make sure we’re looking forward and doing everything that we can to get this team back. It’s very easy to play revisionist history. I’m just not going to play that game. -Q: Can’t you say that’s one place you went wrong and learned? -YORK: I think the most important thing is having the head coach and the general manager working together, battling for each other and being on the same page. That’s paramount. I’ve certainly seen that in  my time. That’s my focus and that’s my goal to make sure those two are together, they’re working on the same page and they know that they have the opportunity to build this thing the right way together. -Q: Where is search at now? What are the candidates looking like? -YORK: Obviously for better or for worst, I know some of these candidates, I’ve certainly interviewed some of the candidates in previous year. We’ve got an opportunity to … the rules of the NFL, how you can interview people. We obviously can’t interview anybody who is in the playoffs until the second week. You can interview teams with a bye the first week but you go to them. Then anybody who is out of the playoffs you can interview essentially whenever. It would be nice to be able to have a methodical way to go through and build the way you want. Some of this is the curveballs that exist in the NFL so we need to make sure we sit down and talk to the right people at the right times when they are available. -Q: Was there a particular game this season when you decided to fire Trent Baalke? -YORK: I sat down with those guys at the mid-way point and told them I wasn’t happy with where we were. And I wanted to know what we were going to do to get better, what was the plan. And ultimately I didn’t think we had a good enough plan and a good enough structure. I was very clear last year about where Trent stood. I think Trent had done a lot of great things for this organization in the past, but it was time to make a change. -Q: A lot of owners don’t make the football decisions. What’s your response to those who say you should remove yourself from football decisions and hire a president to run the show? -YORK: We have a president whose name’s Al Guido and I don’t make football decisions. -Q: What is the single most important thing that you’re looking for in your next GM? -YORK: I think with a GM, again, first and foremost it’s going to be a relationship between the head coach and the general manager. That’s paramount. I think I’ve said that and I’ll continue to say that. The characteristics that you’re looking for in a general manager–you need somebody that can evaluate talent, you need somebody that understands culture and can be accountable and can hold people accountable. You need somebody that can communicate well. And with a head coach, we need somebody that can set a culture; we need somebody that can communicate upstairs, downstairs, sideways, backwards, forwards, make sure that you get to the first player on the roster and the 53rd player on the roster and figure out how we can continue to build… And know that no roster in this league is perfect. You can look at all 32 teams and the teams that we can all pick that we say are going to be in Houston (for the Super Bowl), there are deficiencies in those. How do we make sure that we identify our deficiencies and we can hide them as much as we can, how do we identify our strengths, make sure we can do as much with those as we can. That comes from having the right discussions with the head coach, the general manager and putting the right people together. -Q: How involved is Paraag Marathe going to be in the search for the coach and GM? And is Tom Gamble a candidate in-house for GM? And will you roll over your complete salary cap surplus from this year to next year? -YORK: We’ve always rolled over the salary cap, so that’s easy to say. And our general manager and head coach will have the opportunity to spend it however they wish to make sure that we can rebuild this roster. Paraag will be with me in the interviews. We’ve certainly done research together and we’ll keep moving forward. Tom is a very loyal employee. I think he’s one of the unsung heroes in sort of the scouting world and the professional world of the NFL. I have a ton of respect for Tom Gamble. But again I think it’s time that we have two new people at the helm from the general manager and head coach perspective. -Q: Why did Chip have to call you about his job Saturday night? -YORK: I called Chip. -Q: What was that all about? -YORK: There was a report that said that he was going to be let go. I let him know, ‘Coach, I haven’t made up my mind yet. I’d like to sit down with you at the end of the game on Sunday. But we are where we are with a 2-win team. We’ve had those conversations. So now I’d like to sit down and give you an opportunity to discuss what you see with the team and what you see with our future.’ And we did that for about an hour and a half last night after the game. -Q: Do you see why a lot of people think the leaking is what’s wrong with this organization? -YORK: You have a two-win team that people have been speculating that there were going to be decisions that were made for the last month. You know, I wish that it would’ve been cleaner. But I think it was evident that we were considering making changes. I wanted to give Chip every opportunity. And again we sat down at the end of the game after Seattle… we had had conversations previously, and we made a decision at the end of the game. I wish that Chip had a better opportunity and I think he’s going to have an opportunity to be a great head coach going forward, wherever he decides to go. But I’m not going to sit and say anything bad about him. -Q: You’ve said Paraag will be in the interviews with you. Anybody else specifically advising you in this process? Also a year ago we asked what you’ve learned from this and you said to stay off of social media. Anything more? -YORK: Plus stay off of KNBR, too. Again I think the biggest thing is the relationship between the head coach and general manager. It is so hard to win football games in the National Football League. If you’re not on the same page within your organization, you give yourself no chance to win. And I think it’s no secret that I’ve known Trent for a long time; not an easy decision to get rid of somebody that I know, that I trust, that I respect, that I consider a friend. Had to be done. Chip is a damn good football coach. You can say whatever you want about having one year. I didn’t see the future going the right way and I didn’t see us being able to re-establish that championship culture. You have to be willing to make those tough decisions. You have to make sure that everything that we do is to make sure that we communicate and collaborate internally and that’s what the focus is for us moving forward. -Q: Any adviser other than Paraag? -YORK: Obviously my uncle is somebody that I talk to on a very regular basis. There are several other very well respected people, people that have been a part of this organization in the past, that have hired head coaches in the past… certainly that I know that are not getting back into the game, that have been Super Bowl-winning coaches and Hall of Fame-caliber coaches and some of them in the Hall of Fame… I’m not going to name people by names, but there are certainly enough people that I know and trust and respect that I think the world would trust and respect their opinion. I just want to give them–respective of their privacy and anonymity. -Q: It would give people more confidence in you if you named a few names. Maybe you’re not quite well enough connected and don’t have a Bill Walsh with you. Eddie had Bill and Eddie was not the expert, Bill was the expert. -YORK: And I’m not the expert, either, Lowell. -Q: I understand. -YORK: And this isn’t a debate. If we want to sit down and have a conversation, we can. -Q: Who are the people you can go to? -YORK: And again, I just addressed that question and out of respect to them, I’m not going to throw people’s names out there and use those people’s names. There’s only one Bill Walsh. I wish that there was a Bill Walsh. There’s not. We need to find the right person and re-establish the championship culture. Not Bill’s culture, not Jim Harbaugh’s culture and Trent Baalke’s culture. Not anybody else’s culture, but we need to make sure that we start fresh and start with a new culture between a general manager and a head coach and do everything we can to get us back to that winning way. -Q: Aare you consulting with 49ers greats who are around like Steve Young, Brent Jones, Harris Barton and Ronnie Lott? -YORK: Absolutely. There’s another four-time Super Bowl champion, but yes. -Q: His wife sat on your lap once? -YORK: She didn’t sit on my lap.  Let’s make that clear. (Smiles. This is all referring to the famous photo of him sitting on Jennifer Montana’s lap as a child at a game.) -Q: Are you embarrassed? -YORK: Absolutely. I am, I mean this isn’t acceptable to me.  It’s not. Our fans deserve better than this. I watched yesterday. I have the utmost respect for a guy like Joe Staley who, career wise, whatever, had no business playing in that game but he wasn’t going to let his players down. He wasn’t going to let his teammates down. You look at our fans. There were 59,000 fans here yesterday for a game that certainly didn’t matter in the win loss column. There were a lot of reports before the game about fans being here, not being here, but you still had 59,000 fans here because they cared about beating the Seahawks. I owe them so much more than what we’ve given to them. And we will give it to them. People who have questioned us in the past, we’ve tried to answer a lot of the questions. We certainly got close for a period of time but we didn’t get to our ultimate goal. I’m embarrassed where we are now and I’m going to do everything we can to get us back. -Q: What was missing from this year’s team that made it not a championship culture: How do you define that? -YORK: The teams that have continued success they’ve done it in different ways so you can’t just take a carbon copy of what New England has done or what Seattle has done or where the Dallas Cowboys are right now, a team with homefield advantage. You can’t just take a carbon copy and say that’s what worked over there and so that’s what’s going to work here.  You need to make sure that the right personalities are here. You go back to Bill Walsh – he hired John McVay and they worked together as a team. Whoever hires the other – whether the head coach hires the general manager or the general manager hires the head coach they need to be accountable to each other. They need to have a shared vision, a shared philosophy and they need to know that I am going to do everything that I can to give them the resources to execute on that vision, to execute on that philosophy. That’s what we’re trying to do. That’s what we’re trying to establish. -Q: Trent Baalke confirmed he was fired on Friday yet last night the players hadn’t heard. Seems somewhat dysfunctional? -YORK: I let Trent know and you know Trent went out and said something after the game. I think the game had started or was about to start. I gave him the head’s up before the game that we were going to let him go. And he knew that I was going to sit down and talk to Chip at the end of the game. With the players, I sat down with players today gave them the opportunity to ask any questions that they had and anything we address I’m certainly not going to share. They can if they want to. -Q: Has anyone been let go? -YORK: No. Talked to coaches and as many scouts as are internal. Some not in the building. Talked to football operations staff. I let them know that the new GM and new head coach would make the final decisions on who’s here and who’s not.  Those folks are all under contract. They’re going to have the ability to go somewhere else. There’s no tampering charges. They’re all free to talk to anybody else. No concern of that I want to make sure that their families are taken care of whether here or somewhere else. I wish them the best and respect all they’ve done Those are the people that on a day like this are forgotten. We talk about gm and the coach not about the guys really in the trenches. -Q: To be clear, everyone in the building is free to get a job somewhere else? -YORK: Correct -Q: What’s the timing of this search? -YORK: We need to get it right. I don’t expect it to be tomorrow. But when we find the right combination of people, we’re going to get them hired.     Tags:  Jed York San Francisco 49ers Tim Kawakami Tim Kawakami is a sports columnist for the Bay Area News Group.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage.

We’ve already posted an in-depth hands-on video walkthrough, but in this post we’ll answer some of the most frequently asked questions that we’ve encountered thus far. Is the screen glossy or matte? The LG UltraFine 5K Display features a glossy screen. How large is the screen? The screen is 27-inches diagonal. What is the chassis made out of? The LG UltraFine 5K Display is comprised mostly of black plastic. The base of the unit, however, is made out of solid metal. Does the display wobble? When adjusting the stand to higher positions, the LG UltraFine 5K Display is more prone to wobble, but you may still notice wobble even at the lowest height setting while typing. What version of macOS does the display require? Apple states that the LG UltraFine 5K Display requires a Mac running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 or later. It’s recommended that users run macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later to ensure the best compatibility. What is the UltraFine 5K Display’s native resolution? The UltraFine 5K Display features a native resolution of 5120-by-2880. It has a default resolution of 2560-by-1440 (Retina pixel doubled). The Retina mode affords the same amount of real estate as a 27-inch Thunderbolt Display, while providing tack sharp text and assets. What resolution does the UltraFine 5K Display support via macOS? The following resolutions are supported via System Preferences → Displays in macOS: 5120-by2880 3200-by-1800 2880-by-1620 2560-by-1440 2048-by-1152 1600-by-900 1440-by-810 1280-by-720 To view all scaled resolutions, hold the Option key when clicking the Scaled radio button. LG UltraFine 5K Display Hands-on video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more hands-on videos Does the LG UltraFine 5K Display work in Windows? We tested the LG UltraFine 5K Display in Windows via a Bootcamp partition, and can report that the unit performs admirably. You won’t get full 5K resolution, but you do you get 4K 16:9 (4096-by-2304) resolution, which looks superb on Windows 10. Brightness and volume controls work perfectly fine as well. We did experience some frame rate hiccups with the built-in camera, but hopefully that will be addressed in a future update. Which Mac models support the UltraFine 5K Display? The LG UltraFine 5K Display works with the following Macs at 5K (5120-by-2880 @60Hz) resolution: MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) The display will work with the following Macs at 4K (3840 x 2160 @ 60Hz) resolution when utilizing a Thunderbolt 3 Male to Thunderbolt 2 Female Adapter: Mac Pro (Late 2013) MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) and later MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2014) and later iMac (Retina, 27-inch, Late 2014) and later iMac (Retina, 21.5-inch, Late 2015) iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2015) MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) MacBook Air (11-inch, Early 2015) The display will work with the Mac mini (Late 2014) at 3200 x 1800 @ 60Hz resolution. For the Mac mini and the Mac Pro, Apple is recommending that the LG UltraFine 5K Display be used as a second display, not the primary display. Apple notes that the display might not turn on until booting into macOS. As such, boot picker and macOS recovery options might not be available on the display in pre-boot scenarios. Can I connect to two LG UltraFine 5K Displays? If you own a 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro, you may connect two UltraFine 5K Displays simultaneously at full resolution. Each display must be connected directly to the MacBook Pro via the included Thunderbolt 3 cable. The 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro can only support one 5K display at full resolution. How do you adjust screen brightness on the LG UltraFine Display? Since the display features no buttons or joysticks, and no OSD menu, users must adjust all monitor settings via the operating system. If you go to System Preferences → Displays, you will see a brightness slider that allows you to adjust the brightness of the LG display. Can I adjust brightness via a Touch Bar shortcut on the MacBook Pro? By using the individual brightness control buttons in the Touch Bar combined with the physical Control key on the MacBook Pro’s keyboard, users can adjust the brightness of the external LG UltraFine 5K Display. It’s not the perfect solution, because it’s a little delayed, and requires multiple key presses, but it’ll get you by in a pinch. Watch the time-stamped video below to see it in action: Is there an ambient light sensor to automatically adjust the brightness of the display? The LG UltraFine Display includes an ambient light sensor next to the camera, but this sensor doesn’t appear to work yet with the current version of macOS. There is no Automatically adjust brightness setting found for the display in System Preferences → Displays. How do you adjust the volume of the built in speakers? Similarly to how you adjust the display’s brightness, volume can be adjusted via System Preferences → Sound, and using the Output Volume slider. You can also use a menu bar shortcut to quickly adjust sound output, or use the volume controls on the Touch Bar or function row. How long is the included Thunderbolt 3 cable? LG includes a 6-foot Thunderbolt 3 cable, which should be long enough for most setups. Is there a power “brick”? The LG UltraFine 5K Display features an internal power supply, which means that the power cord is simply a cord, not a large power brick. Is the stand adjustable? The included stand, which comes preinstalled on the display, is adjustable. You can adjust the height (4.3-inches), negative (-5º) and positive (25º) vertical viewing angles, and slightly adjust the horizontal level. The monitor’s base doesn’t include rotation or horizontal viewing angle adjustments, and the monitor cannot be viewed in vertical mode. Can I mount the LG UltraFine Display on a VESA arm or mount? Yes. LG includes a special VESA cover that can be attached to the back of the display for mounting on a VESA arm or mount. You’ll need to detach the stand in order to install the VESA mount. The stand can be detached via a small lever on the back of the display. What is the resolution of the built-in camera? The LG UltraFine 5K Display features a camera with a max resolution of 1920-by-1080. Does the display include a microphone? Yes, you can use the display’s built-in microphone, which is next to the camera, to facilitate FaceTime calls or anything else that requires a microphone. Will the LG UltraFine 5K Display charge my MacBook Pro? If connected via the included Thunderbolt 3 cable, the LG UltraFine 5K Display will charge the 13- or 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro at full speed (up to 85W). Note that power delivery isn’t provided to older Macs connected using the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 adapter. Will the display provide enough power over USB-C to charge my iPhone or iPad? Providing up to 7.5W of power via each USB-C port, the LG UltraFine 5K Display will do an adequate job charging an iPhone, but it will be slow to charge an iPad or iPad Pro. If you do wish to connect an iOS device, we recommend having a few USB-C to Lightning Cables on hand. How fast are the downstream USB-C ports included on the rear of the display? The LG UltraFine 5K Display includes three downstream USB-C ports featuring USB 3.1 gen 1. This means that the speed maxes out at 5Gbps, which is standard USB 3.0 speed. Can I daisy chain the LG UltraFine 5K Display? You can add the display to the tail end of a valid Thunderbolt 3 daisy chain, but since the unit only contains a single Thunderbolt 3 input port, it will not work in the middle of a daisy chain. Are there any issues with macOS when connecting to the UltraFine display? As we’ve used this display, we’ve encountered several bugs that will likely be addressed in future macOS software updates. One such bug happens when using the shake to find cursor feature found in macOS. Normally, when you shake to find your mouse cursor, the cursor appears big for a second to help you find it, then reverts to normal size. Occasionally, when connected to the LG UltraFine 5K Display, I’ve noticed that a second cursor freezes in place on screen while enlarged. I can still control my Mac like normal, but having this second cursor frozen on screen is annoying. In order to get rid of the cursor, a simple disconnect and reconnect of the Thunderbolt 3 cable that goes to the display seems to work fine. You can also outright disable the shake mouse pointer to locate feature in System Preferences → Accessibility → Display. Though I’ve yet to experience any issues with sleep and wake myself, some users have experienced problems when putting their Mac to sleep and waking it back up while connected to the LG display. Where can I find an online manual for the display? LG has posted a manual for its UltraFine 5K Display on its website. You can find it here. Does any additional software come with the LG display? If you wish, you may download the companion LG Screen Manager app. This app, which is not required to use the display, allows you to take advantage of a software screen split feature, and update the monitor’s software version. You can find the LG Screen Manager app on LG’s support website. What is the warranty for the LG UltraFine 5K Display LG provides a limited 1-year parts and labor warranty. Since this is not an Apple-branded piece of hardware, all warranty claims are handled by LG. If you need repair or service, you can use LG’s online service request tool. How long will the LG UltraFine 5K Display be on sale for $974 Apple has extended its promotional discount of the LG UltraFine 5K display until March 31, 2017. After that date, the price will go back to the original $1299.95 amount. Should I save money and get the 4K version instead? I personally recommend sticking with the 5K version, unless money is the major determining factor. The 4K model features lesser resolution, no 10-bit color, no camera, no microphone, slower charging for 15-inch MacBook Pro owners, and slow USB 2.0 ports. That said, the 4K model is significantly cheaper at $524 while on sale. You could get two 4K monitors for almost the same price of a single 5K monitor. You can also connect multiple 4K monitors to a 13-inch MacBook Pro, something that isn’t possible with the 5K version. You’ll actually end up getting more pixels that way. At the end of the day, it’s a personal decision, and there are benefits to both routes, but I like the idea of having a single 5K display with integrated camera, microphone, and faster I/O.

On 30 August, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager announced that Ireland had given unfair tax advantages to Apple, writes Catherine Feore. The Commission estimated that Apple should repay €13 billion in unpaid tax to the Irish government. Both Ireland and Apple stridently rejected the Commission’s findings and will appeal; the US Treasury even threatened retaliatory action aimed at European business. The Commission’s investigation into Apple’s tax arrangements was prompted by the company’s testimony to the US Senate in March 2013. The Commission found that Ireland had granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which meant that it had paid substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. Bearing in mind that the official corporate tax rate for every other company operating in Ireland is 12.5% – already one of the lowest in Europe – Apple’s effective corporate tax rate was much less than the amount paid by other businesses. For example, in 2014 one Apple subsidiary paid an effective rate of only 0.005%. Commissioner Vestager put this into context – for every million euro in profits, Apple paid just €50 in taxes. The legal arguments surrounding the case are well-trodden; the scale, the long period involved (tax rulings in 1991 and 2007) and the high-profile beneficiary resulted in a flurry of interest in the normally prosaic field of European state aid law. Silicon Valley Silicon Valley sees this decision and others as an attack on its legitimate success. It is clear that Europe takes a much tougher view than the US government on questions such as unfair taxation, abuse of a dominant position, data protection and copyright. Next year, these struggles will continue in the form of further decisions (Google/Android), legal challenges (Apple, Uber, Privacy Shield) and the adoption of laws related to the EU’s Digital Single Market.

Production for the new tablet is set to start in December, which means its unveiling is likely to happen in the first quarter of next year.<br /> (Photo : GoSdGo/YouTube) Although it wasn't a bad year at all, 2016 will not be remembered as a great moment for Apple, given the fact that it didn't meet expectations in some of its products, and some of its most important rivals just got near of it in sales and popularity. However, this new year seems to be one of the most important opportunity for the Cupertino giant to achieve perfection, with the release of groundbreaking products that will definitely surprise everyone. Here are the most incredible. The iPhone 8 Could Be The Best Smartphone In The History The iPhone 8 will be definitely Apple´s most important move in 2017, given the fact that this year the company will commemorate the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. Naturally, we´re talking about what´s probably the most expected tech product in 2017, which means that Apple will be facing a lot of pressure in making something that meets the high expectations. In fact, what´s even more pressuring for the Cupertino company is the fact that even when the iPhone 7 got an incredible amount of sales, this smartphone has been considered as a huge disappointment n terms of upgrade, to the point in which some analyst explained that this was the main reason why Apple couldn´t capitalize Samsung´s weakness after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. As it was reported in previous articles, the iPhone 8 is expected to come with incredible specs and features that will make this mobile device something out of this world, to the point in which it could become one of the most incredible smartphones in the history. Naturally, customers don´t expect less than this, and Apple knows it. A New iPad Pro That Would Blows Everyone´s Mind There´s no doubt that the iPad has been one of the greatest products that Apple ever created, given the fact that it offers almost the same functionalities and features that you can find in a laptop or a desktop, in a single tablet. Considering this situation, a revamped version of the iPad Pro is one of the most expected products from Apple, and rumors suggest that this would actually be released in spring. Apparently, the new iPad Pro will be enhanced with a new hardware and a software that would blow everyone´s mind, offering a much faster display for a smoother on-screen zooming than the previous model, in addition to an expanded iOS support for the Apple pencil, so the users could easily work on many more areas of the device. Although these speculations haven't been confirmed it has been rumored that the new iPad Pro would probably come in a 10-inch and a 12.9-.inch model upgraded with a faster A10X processors that will replace the previous 9.7-inch version. Nevertheless, this last model is expected to be used by Apple as a low-cost tablet option.  New iMacs That Would Let Apple To Compete Against Microsoft One of the worst mistakes that Apple committed last year was releasing the MacBook Pro without any iMac, given the fact that this gave a huge advantage to the Microsoft Surface Studio, to the point in which the desktop area was a field totally dominated by the tech giant, instead of the Cupertino company. Naturally, this situation has been forcing Apple to launch a new iMac this year, and rumors suggest that this could actually happen. As reported by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple would launch this desktop around March or April and would include Intel´s Kaby Lake chips and AMD graphics. Apparently, there wouldn't be major spec updates, and the most notorious change would probably be a shift to USB-.C and improved processors. Also, is expected that the new iMacs would come with an incredible new keyboard that could include the controversial Touch Bar, the newest feature that the Apple released in the MacBook Pro. Although many believe that this would represent an incredible for the Cupertino company, there are others who suggest that this could be a huge risk, considering that this is an innovation that hasn't achieved unanimity. TAG Apple, iPhone 8, iPad Pro, iMac Related Articles The Most Outstanding Tricks You Can Do With Apple Airpods Along with the Touch Bar, Apple Airpods is the most controversial innovation made by the Cupertino company this year, considering that it represent a radical change of a device that customers were already used to.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple partner Wistron seeks India plant expansion for iPhone manufacture Apple Apple partner Wistron seeks India plant expansion for iPhone manufacture By Bindu Nair - Jan 2, 2017 Talk about Apple’s plans to start manufacturing iPhones in India has just gotten a shot in the arm courtesy a brand new report. Apple partner Wistron has apparently applied for permission to expand its present Bengaluru factory. This piece of information falls in line with earlier reports which had alleged that Wistron’s Bengaluru plant would be the epicenter of Apple’s Indian iPhone initiative. The company is supposedly planning to begin putting together iPhones at the facility by April this year. A high-ranking Karnataka government official told Reuters that Wistron has gone as far as to ask the state administration to fast-track the application by expediting certain clearances covering the augmentation and expansion of its existing unit. Still, the company’s extension plans may or may not be related to Apple’s Make In India intentions. Also Read: Apple wants govt to relax labeling laws before manufacturing iPhones in India The official for his part says Wistron’s eagerness to expand pretty quickly could perhaps represent several steps in that direction. Analysts are of the belief that Apple’s India overtures could eventually help the brand grow in India and lower prices since local manufacturing would help with cost optimization. Wistron was recently the subject of a separate Apple rumor related to the company’s next 2017 iPhone. China’s Economic Daily News had reported that the former would be the third supplier of the upcoming series of handsets after Pegatron and Foxconn. The components maker has so far only been confirmed to be involved in the production of the iPhone 5C and iPhone SE.

Even luxury watch brands have embraced smartwatches. In 2016, we saw Apple launch its second-generation smartwatch, Asus and Samsung their third and Fossil bring several fashion companies into the market, including Michael Kors and Skagen. So what else do we have to look forward to? Here are all the best smartwatches thought to be coming up in 2017. We have included devices that have been announced but are not yet available to buy, as well as a few rumoured timepieces for good measure. Pocket-lint Casio WSD-F20 Casio announced its second Android Wear watch at CES 2017 in the form of the WSD-F20. The new device sticks with the same styling as its predecessor and brings with it water resistance up to 50 metres, MIL-STD-810 certification, built-in GPS and support for offline mapping. It runs on Android Wear 2.0, has a 1.32-inch dual-layer display that is designed for low power consumption and it will be available from 21 April 2017. Casio WSD-F20 preview: Rugged outdoor smartwatch shows Android Wear can be great Garmin Garmin Fenix 5 Series Garmin's Fenix 5 Series was announced at CES 2017, comprising three models: Fenix 5, Fenix 5S and Fenix 5X. The Fenix 5 has a 47mm casing, the Fenix 5S has a 42mm and is designed for females, and the Fenix 5X has a 51mm case, making it the beefiest of the bunch. All the models have a 3-axis compass, gyroscope and barometric altimeter for measuring altitude and movement, as well as GPS and GLONASS for accurate location tracking. The Fenix 5 and 5S will cost $599, while the 5X will cost $600 and they will all be available sometime in Q1 of 2017. Garmin Fenix 5 brings fitness finesse in smaller sizes Huawei Swarovski Android Wear smartwatch Swarovski is bringing out an Android Wear smartwatch of its own at Baselworld in March 2017. The device was confirmed at CES 2017 after Qualcomm announced it would have its chipset inside. No details were revealed about the smartwatch itself other than the processor however so we will have to wait a few months before we find out what it will look like, but expect all the sparkles. Swarovski to launch its own Android Wear smartwatch in 2017 Misfit Misfit The Misfit Vapor is the activity tracking company's first touchscreen smartwatch and its most advanced device yet. It has all the usual activity and sleep tracking features, along with optical heart rate monitoring, built-in GPS and standalone music functionality. Vapor has a 44mm stainless steel casing, is water resistant up to 50 metres and it has Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor under the hood. It will be available sometime later in 2017 for $199. Misfit Vapor smartwatch brings heart rate monitoring, built-in GPS and waterproofing Android Police Google Angelfish and Swordfish smartwatches Rumour has it Google has plans to launch two Android Wear smartwatches, which are currently being codenamed Angelfish and Swordfish. It is thought they could be branded Nexus when they arrive though. Several details surrounding the watches have been leaked already from Android Police and the site has since followed up with a "recreated image" of the devices based on information from its source. Apparently the design could change entirely though as the watches are still in development so take everything with a pinch of salt for now. The larger device in the image is Angelfish and it features a large crown with smaller buttons either side. It is also said to be a standalone watch offering LTE and GPS. The smaller Swordfish device is said to lack these two features, while offering just one button. Are these Google's upcoming Android Wear smartwatches? Pocket-lint Sony FES Watch U The second-generation of Sony's FES Watch made its way onto the company's stand at IFA 2016, created in conjunction with Fashion Entertainment. The FES Watch U is not so much a smartwatch but a connected watch that offers an e-paper display and strap with a range of monochrome designs that can be switched over at the tap of a button. It won't deliver smartphone notifications or anything fancy but it has a three-week battery life and it is waterproof. The FES Watch U offers a much improved design on its predecessor, looking far less like a toy and more like an actual watch, and it is able to store 24 designs at any one time, allowing for quick and easy customisation. The Sony FES Watch U comes in two models, a premium option and a slightly cheaper option, with prices expected to be €600 and €500 respectively. The original FES Watch didn't make it out of Japan so it might be that this model doesn't either but for Japan, it's April 2017. Sony FES Watch U: The e-paper connected watch improves Hublot smartwatch Hublot could be the next LVMH brand to launch a smartwatch, according to a Bloomberg interview with Jean-Claude Biver, CEO of TAG Heuer and Hublot. Although details were thin on the ground, Biver said a Hublot smartwatch would feature sports-related functions. It is not clear whether Hublot will follow the same path as the TAG Heuer Connected by opting for Android Wear as the platform, but it's expected to arrive in 2017 or 2018. Considering how well the TAG Heuer Connected is reported to be doing, it is not surprising to see other brands within the parent company wanting a slice of the pie. We will keep you updated as we hear more. Hublot smartwatch news Pocket-lint TAG Heuer Connected 2 The original TAG Heuer Connected smartwatch was teased at Baselworld 2015, followed by a proper launch at the end of 2015. It might have been the first smartwatch from the company, but it won't be the last it seems. CEO Jean-Claude Biver not only revealed sister-company Hublot would be releasing a smartwatch at some point in the future, but he also told Reuters at Baselworld 2016 that TAG Heuer had "totally underestimated demand" for the Connected watch. Biver told Reuters that because of the success of the original, the company is planning a new collection for next year with six to eight models. A new model will apparently debut in 2017.  TAG Heuer hub Pocket-lint Tissot Smart-Touch Tissot used Baselworld 2016 to reveal its Smart-Touch smartwatch. The device is a watch first but delivers a range of functions beyond the current T-Touch offering. The design is based on the T-Touch Solar models, featuring a titanium case, ceramic bezel and sapphire crystal face with quartz movement inside. The battery can be charged by the sun and it features functions including a timer, alarms, compass, barometer and temperature. When connected to your smartphone, the Smart-Touch will all you to sync the time, get weather updates, change settings and share experiences with friends. There are also connected accessories, including a Find-It tag to help you keep track of other items and a weather station that can give you humidity, air quality and temperature readings. The Tissot Smart-Touch smartwatch was due to be available late-2016 for around CHF1000, which is roughly £710, but nothing has appeared as yet. Tissot unveils Smart-Touch Apple Apple Watch Series 3 It is likely Apple will launch another smartwatch at some point, but whether this will be in 2017 is not known. There have been a couple of patents filed by Apple, suggesting the new Apple Watch could be round. The patent, titled "Electronic Device Having Display With Curved Edges", shows a circular watch face and drawings indicate tech elements that would drive a round screen. It works similarly to a normal display, and the tech would be hidden in a bezel around the edge much like the current rectangular Apple Watch or, indeed, the iPhone. As with all rumours though, especially patents, this should be taken with a big pinch of salt for now. Your next Apple Watch could be round, according to leaked patent Pocketnow HTC One smartwatch Rumours that HTC is making a smartwatch have been circulating for some time now. It was thought the Taiwanese company would launch the Petra smartwatch at Mobile World Congress 2015, but nothing ever appeared. The rumours then suggested the design was being changed to a round model that would apparently appear in 2016 but again, nothing appeared. We are therefore still waiting. The Pocket-lint Guide to smartwatch etiquette Pocket-lint Guess Connect (2016) Guess announced the Guess Connect smartwatch at CES 2015. It looked like the traditional Guess Rigor watch but added a notification bar at the bottom of the face, powered by Martian. The company announced there would be several new designs of the Guess Connect appear in 2016, including a leopard print design and a new, smarter option, though nothing has appeared as yet. In addition to the new colours and styles of the original Guess Connect however, the company is also planning to launch an entirely new model, which will again be powered by Martian. The new watch will focus more on looking like a normal watch, adding just an LED notifier light within the watch housing instead. We're expecting to see the new designs and new model appear soon. These are the new Guess Connect watches and they are amazing Pocket-lint Sony Wena Sony announced the the Wena smartwatch in the run up to IFA 2015 under its First Flight crowdfunding platform, which is part of the Seed Acceleration Program that features other products such as last-years FES Watch. The Sony Wena approaches things a little differently to the current smartwatch offering, integrating the smart features into the metal bracelet rather than the watch face. It looks every bit like a traditional analogue watch, but the Sony Wena smartwatch has three functions. It monitors activity through a range of sensors, delivers notifications through a customisable seven-colour LED light and vibrations, and it can perform e-payments thanks to an NFC chip. The Sony Wena smartwatch went on sale in Japan in March 2016, but there is currently no confirmation for the rest of the world. Sony Wena hands-on Bulgari Bulgari Diagono Magnesium The Bulgari Diagono Magnesium concept was revealed at Baselworld 2015 and it is claimed to be a luxury timepiece "completely opposite" from other "so-called" connected watches. The company says it is 100 per cent Swiss and NFC-enabled. The Diagono Magnesium was described as a self-winding, mechanical watch that apparently works with a protected electronic passport called Luxury Wrist Vault. The passport app is said to have a range of possibilities including making payments, logging in securely to a digital community, opening doors and starting your car engine. Pricing, specs and a release date have yet to be detailed so whether we will see it this year or not is still to be confirmed.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Philippe Desnerck / Getty Images While healthy snack ideas are nice in theory, it may be hard to put them into practice. We live in a world that's equal measures go-go-go and all about convenience, meaning that it's usually so much easier to grab something rather than whip up a healthy snack yourself. But here's a little weight-loss secret: Preparation is everything, especially when it comes to snacks. While you might have all your healthy meals set in stone, if you go too many hours in between them without eating, you leave yourself open to becoming ravenous and hangry, then housing a box of cookies in the blink of an eye when you hadn't actually meant on indulging. Healthy snack ideas and recipes are essential for avoiding those moments, which is why we're here to help you out. Of course, healthy snacks are only part of what you eat in a day, and what you eat in a day is only part of what it takes to lose weight in a healthy, sustainable way. If that is your goal, there are other things you need to think about in order to get there. (If it's not your goal, that's cool—all this advice and all these snacks are helpful ways to eat and be healthier overall.) To lose weight you need to be thoughtful about your physical activity, your stress levels, how much sleep you get, and any confounding medical issues. Food is just part of the equation. The truth is, losing weight is a different experience for every person. What might work for your best friend might not work for you, and that's fine. And if you have a history of disordered eating, it's a good idea to check in with your doctor before changing your eating habits. These healthy snack ideas are intended to supplement healthy meals. They can help you take care of yourself in the spaces in between—to keep you full and fueled and feeling your best, all day, every day. If you want to sate a salt craving, eat... 1. 23 almonds (161 calories). Almonds serve up healthy fats, which play a big role in making food both tasty and satisfying. 2. Brami Lupini Beans (35 calories). These edamame-like beans contain 4 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein per serving, both of which are key in helping you stave off hunger. As if that weren't good enough, they also contain no added sugar. 3. 3 tablespoons hummus and 5 large baby carrots (125 calories). Given that hummus is made of chickpeas, it's a snacking star, packing in protein and fiber to keep you full. Plus, it's a pretty tasty vehicle for getting in your daily recommended 2 1/2 cups of vegetables per day. 4. 2 cups sliced bell peppers and 2 tablespoons guacamole (108 calories). What a delicious way to eat the rainbow—bell peppers offer fiber, plus a whole host of vitamins (A, B6, C, K, and folate, in particular). When paired with the healthy fats in guacamole, you've got a satisfying snack that'll go the distance. 5. 1 ounce of Salt Of The Earth Popcorners (110 calories). These popcorn-based chips are free of added sugar, contain healthy fats, and make a great substitute when you're craving typical potato chips. 6. 1 Wasa Wholegrain Crispbread topped with 1 tablespoon avocado and 1 tablespoon hummus (80 calories). Whole grains are a key part of a healthy diet. As complex carbohydrates, your body has to work hard to break them down, meaning they help to keep you full. Plus, whole grains contain fiber, too, for a satiating cherry on top of this healthy sundae. 7. 10 steamed medium asparagus spears topped with 1 tablespoon toasted almond slivers (114 calories). Fragrant pee aside, asparagus offers nutritional benefits like fiber, protein (yes, really!), and potassium, while the almonds add some healthy fats to keep your stomach happy. 8. 1 small potato cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices, tossed with 1 teaspoon olive oil and a pinch of finely chopped rosemary, baked at 450 degrees for 30 minutes, then dipped in 1/4 cup plain 2 percent Greek yogurt (206 calories). Potatoes have a bad reputation, but they're actually a healthy carb—as long as they're topped with the right things. In this snack, the olive oil and Greek yogurt provide fat and protein to keep the potato's carb content from spiking your blood sugar. 9. 1/4 cup black beans combined with 1 tablespoon salsa, 1 tablespoon cottage cheese, and 1 tablespoon guacamole; eat with 4 celery stalks (101 calories). Black beans provide a good dose of fiber, the salsa adds some veggies, cottage cheese contributes some helpful protein, and the avocado in guacamole brings healthy fats to the table. 10. 1/4 cup 1/4-inch-thick cucumber slices, tossed with 3 ounces plain 2 percent Greek yogurt, 2 teaspoons chopped cashews, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh dill (107 calories). Cukes are a water-rich vegetable, which can help them boost your hydration levels. People often think they're hungry when they're actually just thirsty, so keeping up with your water intake is a major part of avoiding unnecessary snacking. 11. 1 slice whole-wheat toast brushed with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, topped with 1 tablespoon plain 2 percent Greek yogurt and a mixture of 3 tablespoons diced tomatoes with a pinch of chopped garlic and basil (130 calories). This lightened-up bruschetta serves up the antioxidant lycopene, thanks to the tomatoes, some protein, courtesy of the Greek yogurt, and some healthy carbs from the bread (plus, of course, a lot of delicious flavor). 12. 1 Laughing Cow Swiss Original wedge and 6 Triscuits (170 calories). Such a simple snack, but it packs a nutritional punch, with a mix of protein, healthy carbs, and even some calcium, to boot. 13. 2 ounces Mountain America Tuna Jerky (140 calories). Instead of going for beef jerky, which can be high in saturated fat, opt for the leaner sea-based option tuna. Share via PinterestWmaster890 / Getty Images 14. 1 ounce buffalo mozzarella, 1/2 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, fresh basil (94 calories). Um, yum. Although this snack is low in calories, it feels pretty indulgent, which is convenient, since finding healthy foods you enjoy is the cornerstone of weight loss. 15. 1 stick Sargento Natural String Cheese + a kiwi (126 calories). Adding some creamy, cheesy goodness helps keep the kiwi's sugar content (7 grams per fruit, FYI) from spiking your blood glucose levels, which can create a cycle that throws your appetite out of whack. 16. 1 ounce Habanero Lime Peeled Snacks Peas Please (120 calories). Does anything scream "healthy" like munching on some baked peas as a snack? These have no added sugar, plus 5 grams of fiber and protein each per serving. 17. 1 cup unshelled edamame (189 calories). Edamame has a delightful surprise: Its protein content comes in at 17 grams in each cup. Eat it on its own, or use it in one of these high-protein snack recipes if you're feeling a little fancier. 18. 25 David Roasted And Salted Sunflower Seeds (159 calories). Healthy fats and protein at your weight-loss service! These seeds offer both in spades. 19. 1/2 cup Lightly Salted Wonderful Pistachios (160 calories). These nuts can aid your weight-loss efforts thanks to their hearty helpings of healthy fats, fiber and protein. Plus, the act of removing them from their shells forces you to slow down, a helpful habit when you're trying to lose weight. 20. SeaSnax Toasty Onion Roasted Seaweed Sheets, 2 ounces canned tuna, and 1 ounce avocado (170 calories). These are easy to whip up, but still feel complex enough to pat yourself on the back. To give all these healthy fats and protein some zing, drizzle lemon on top. 21. 2 pieces prosciutto, 4 dried figs (154 calories). Pretend you're lounging in an Italian villa with this snack, which pairs protein and fruit-based carbs in a pretty luxe way. 22. 1 6" Subway turkey breast sandwich on whole-wheat (162 calories). The protein and carbs are a great base for a veggie-loaded sandwich. This one's perfect as a large post-workout snack after an intense bout of exercise. 23. 1/2 piece whole-grain toast, topped with 1 scrambled egg and 1/4 avocado (197 calories). This Instagram-perfect snack has a foundation of carb-y deliciousness that you finish off with protein and creamy healthy fats. 24. 1 whole-grain English muffin, 1 ounce plain Greek yogurt, and 4 chicken breast slices (208 calories). Protein-rich Greek yogurt is a great stand-in for mayo, and it gets a lift from the added protein in chicken breast slices, helping to avoid hunger pangs. And thanks to the English muffin's carbs, you'll enjoy an energy boost, too. 25. 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds in the shell (143 calories). To make these healthy fats taste even better, sprinkle whichever spices your heart desires on top. 26. 1/4 cup Saffron Road Wasabi Chickpeas (130 calories). These roasted chickpeas are filled with 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein per serving, so eat up! 27. 1 ounce Enlightened Sriracha Roasted Broad Beans (100 calories). Every ounce of these little guys is loaded with 7 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber—perfect for preventing any impulsive trips to the office vending machine. If you're trying to satisfy a sweet tooth... Share via PinterestMónica Durán / EyeEm / Getty Images 28. 8 ounces plain 2 percent Greek yogurt with 1/2 cup fresh raspberries (234 calories). You get protein and healthy fats, plus a dose of antioxidants. 29. 20 frozen grapes (40 calories). This snack is sweetness epitomized—expect a boost of energy thanks to those tasty carbs. 30. 1/2 cup Bare Snacks Organic Granny Smith Apple Chips (110 calories). These apple chips are a great source of fiber (5 grams), plus they contain absolutely no added sugar, relying on apples' natural sugars for some flavor. 31. 10 strawberries and 1 inch Brie cheese (97 calories). Strawberries provide fiber, while even a small amount of the brie can help keep you full because of its fat content (plus it feels like a real treat—always a good thing). 32. 1/2 banana rolled in 1 tablespoon frozen semisweet chocolate chips (123 calories). When you want a sweet healthy snack, turn to bananas. The possibilities are basically endless, as evidenced by this mix! As an added bonus, potassium is a helpful debloater. 33. 1 cup uncooked oatmeal prepared with 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk and topped with 1/2 banana (218 calories). Oats are another one of those carbs that can help you lose weight thanks to all their fiber. To add some calorie-free sweetness besides the banana, experiment with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. 34. 1/2 an apple and a Justin's Classic Almond Butter Squeeze Pack (238 calories). How fitting that this snack contains the word "classic"—does it get any more old-school than this? Pairing an apple, which has energizing carbs, and a nut butter, with its protein and healthy fats, is a match made in heaven. 35. 1 Cherry Pie LaraBar (200 calories). Although bars are often loaded with ingredients that make them not-so-healthy, many R.D.s are fans of Lara Bars due to their simplicity. This bar kicks weird additives to the curb, with only three ingredients: cherries, almonds, and dates. 36. 1/2 a bar of Alter Eco Deep Dark Sea Salt Organic Chocolate (223 calories). Your answers to the healthy-snack-recipe gods have been answered. Step 1: Get a bar of intense dark chocolate. Step 2: Put some in your mouth. Step 3: Benefit from this superfood's antioxidants and indulgent taste. 37. 2 strips dried mango with 1 ounce macadamia nuts (219 calories). Dried fruit can go overboard in calories and sugar, but there's no reason you can't enjoy small amounts as part of a snack, along with some nuts for healthy fats to prevent a blood-sugar rollercoaster ride. 38. 1 box Horizon Organic Low-Fat Chocolate Milk (150 calories). It seems like chocolate milk and health would be complete enemies, but this drink is actually a winner because it blends protein and carbs in an easy-to-consume way, which is why many R.D.s love it as a post-workout snack. 39. 1 Yasso Cookies & Cream Frozen Greek Yogurt bar (100 calories). Stoke your foodie nostalgia with this healthier version of an ice cream bar, which relies on Greek yogurt to deliver some filling protein under the guise of a delectable treat. 40. 1 1/4 cups Smartfood Sweet And Salty Kettle Corn (140 calories). Sometimes even the biggest sweet tooth wants flavor that's a bit more layered, which is where the hint of salt in this snack comes in. And since popcorn is a whole-grain, these little kernels do your body good. 41. 1/2 a sliced pear with 1 ounce 70-85 percent dark chocolate (220 calories). While you can certainly snack on dark chocolate by itself, sometimes adding in another ingredient makes it even better. Enter: pears, which pack ample fiber in their skins, meaning this snack will help keep your stomach from rumbling before it's time for your next meal.

Yes, even when you're trying to lose weight, you can still have what basically amounts to a candy apple as long as it's in moderation! Giving yourself the freedom to eat these kinds of sweet treats, instead of banishing them to a "forbidden foods" list, makes it much more likely that you'll be able to enjoy a reasonable portion instead of overdoing it. 43. 1 clementine with 4 ounces plain 2 percent Greek yogurt (123 calories). Clementines' natural sweetness means you can enjoy this protein-rich treat without honey or any other version of added sugar. 44. 1 piece whole-grain toast, 1 tablespoon almond butter, 1/2 banana (251 calories). This simple snack is a breeze to make, but it doesn't skimp on nutrients, offering fiber, healthy fats, and some protein, too. 45. 1 cup warm unsweetened apple sauce (105 calories). Spoon this up for an easy snack with fiber and 52 grams of vitamin C, aka 86 percent of your daily recommendations of this essential nutrient. 46. 1 CLIF Nut Butter Peanut Butter Bars (230 calories). Here's another bar option that rises above typical grocery store energy bars, thanks to its 7 grams of fiber and 27 grams of carbs, which largely come from oats and oat-based flour. 47. 1/4 cup Dark Chocolate Whole Grain Clusters (190 calories). Granola often has a "health halo," as in, it seems like an inherently healthy food when the store-bought varieties are anything but. Luckily, some granola is definitely healthier than others, like this pick, which only has 5 grams of added sugar per serving, but 10 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and 30 grams of energizing carbs. 48. 7 Annie’s Oatmeal Cookie Bites (130 calories). Fuel up while pleasing your palate with these oatmeal cookie bites, which offer 4.5 grams of healthy fats per serving for some stick-to-your-ribs nourishment. 49. 1/4 cup 365 Everyday Value Backcountry Bundle Trail Mix (120 calories). Whether you're on a strenuous hike or just trying to power through a busy day at work, a good-quality trail mix is your friend. The only problem: It can be hard to figure out which ones are actually healthy. Try this one, which features carbs, protein, and healthy fats, thanks to its almonds, raisins, cranberries, pistachios, and sour cherries, plus some sweetness due to a hint of sugar. 50. 1 Betty Lou’s Protein Plus Chocolate Hazelnut Ball (160 calories). With 8 grams of fiber and 21 grams of carbs per serving, consider this an excellent pre- or post-workout snack that you can pop on the go if you have to. 51. 1 frozen banana, 1 cup frozen spinach, 1/4 cup plain 2 percent Greek yogurt, and 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk blended (165 calories). Pre-made smoothies are often brimming with added sugar, so make your own version that gets natural sweetness and creaminess from a frozen banana. The spinach (you won't be able to taste it, promise!) adds fiber and the Greek yogurt contributes protein, so you won't be hungry 2.5 seconds after downing this treat. 52. 1/2 cup blueberries with 4 ounces cottage cheese and 1 teaspoon honey (159 calories). If you happen to love cottage cheese, you're in luck—this divisive food can help you get your daily fill of protein. Mix it with blueberries for fiber and antioxidants and honey for sweetness. 53. 1 brown rice cake topped with 1 tablespoon almond butter and 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds (230 calories). Help yourself to some complex carbs you can get creative with! You can layer tons of different ingredients on top of a brown rice cake, but this combo shines thanks to its healthy fats, protein, and pomegranate-provided antioxidants. 54. 1 Medjool date stuffed with 1 tablespoon peanut butter (160 calories). This is a dietitian favorite for a reason—this easy-to-make snack has protein and healthy fats in spades. 55. 1 Apricot, Pear, Carrot, Beet Pressed By Kind Fruit Bar (110 calories). For a no-sugar added fruit leather, chow on one of these bars, which contain 4 grams of fiber and 125 milligrams of potassium per serving.
