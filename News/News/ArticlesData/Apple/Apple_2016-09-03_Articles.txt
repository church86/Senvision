With Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa services built-in, you can simply ask one of the digital assistants to set your temperature, and it's done. With Siri, you can do it from anywhere you have an Internet connection, using any iOS device or Apple Watch! Of course, you can use it the old-fashioned way, but instead of clunky dials and knobs, the #ecobee3 has a modern touch display built in. It can also monitor the temperature in multiple rooms of your home, making sure the rooms that are occupied stay comfortable! Check out the video for my full review - I also show you how to install the ecobee3! You can pick up the ecobee3 Smart Thermostat now.

I show you how you can do it today with the Ecobee3 smart thermostat. Stay tuned. The ecobee3 is a smart thermostat that connects to your home Wi-Fi network, allowing you to control the temperature from anywhere that you have an Internet connection. This isn’t new, as there are a few other devices out there that do the same thing. However, what sets the ecobee3 apart is that it has built-in support for Apple HomeKit, as well as Amazon’s Alexa. This means that you can control the ecobee3 thermostat with your voice by using Siri with an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or iPod touch, or an Alexa-enabled device like the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, or Amazon Tap. And with Father’s Day around the corner, this is one you might wanna pay close attention to, because it’s that good. Inside the box you’ll find the ecobee thermostat itself, along with one room sensor with detachable stand. Aside from HomeKit capability, this is another area where ecobee stands out. The sensor is placed in a room that’s separate from where the thermostat is placed, allowing the system to monitor temperature and motion in more than one place. So if your thermostat is on the first floor, but you spend a lot of time on the second floor, the ecobee will still know that you’re home and will keep the temperature right where it should be. Alternatively, it will also save you money when you aren’t home by optimizing the temperature accordingly rather than wasting your resources and cash. You get one sensor in the box as I mentioned, but you can have up to 32 of these in your home if you’re a straight up baller. You’ll also find the Power Extender Kit, screws and drywall plugs, standard and large trim plates, a quick start guide, installation guide, wire labels, and some ecobee stickers inside the box. Since I installed it myself, I made sure to turn off the power to my heating and cooling system, because the last thing anyone is gonna accuse me of is being a handyman and I wasn’t trying to kill myself. Ecobee says it takes about 45 minutes to install, but I was up and running in about 20 minutes, and again - I’m no handyman. First thing you wanna do is get rid of whatever crappy thermostat you’re currently using, and then label your wires if they aren’t already. Mine were already labeled from when I originally installed my older Nest thermostat, so I was able to save a step there. Then you choose the trim plate that is applicable to you, and screw it in place. The ecobee back plate has a built in level which is nice, so you know that you’re orienting everything the way that it should be. From there, you plug the wires for your system into the corresponding holes. Again, keeping the wires labeled makes this a snap. I got everything plugged in, pushed the wires back into the wall, and then connected the ecobee3 thermostat, which just snapped into place without much force. At this point, installation is done, and it’s time to turn the power back on, which will start the boot up process. The touchscreen interface is nice, and it walks you through setup in a nice, intuitive way. During the process you are invited to download the ecobee3 app, which mirrors the interface of the display, making it super easy to control from afar. You also get the option of using your iOS device to quickly get the ecobee3 set up on your Wi-Fi network, as well as getting HomeKit set up as well so that you can control the thermostat with Siri. Both of these just add to the convenience of setup, and makes a novice like me feel like I know exactly what I’m doing when installing hardware on my wall. Once everything is up and running, you’re then able to control the ecobee3 in a few ways. First, directly from the built-in touchscreen. When you approach it, the ecobee3 changes from the view only interface into the interactive one, which is cool. Changing the temperature is as easy as sliding your finger up and down the right-hand side of the display. You can also get a weather forecast right on the ecobee3 as well, and of course, you can change the settings too. You can also use a smartphone app to control the thermostat, which can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play for Android. Finally, you’ve got voice control, which is the most convenient, especially when it’s hands-free. For example, you can use Siri with the Hey Siri command... …or you can use an Alexa-enabled device like the Amazon Echo... This is where most of the appeal lies for me, and having both Siri and Alexa voice control is something that no other smart thermostat to date can do. As someone who’s been building my smarthome around devices that can take advantage of both HomeKit and Alexa, the ecobee3 is the perfect smart thermostat for my home thanks to that flexibility. If you’re in the market for a smart thermostat that allows you to interface with it in multiple ways from connected devices, I think the ecobee3 is the one to get. Now I wanna know what you think. Have you started buying devices that make your home a bit smarter? Leave a comment below letting me know what you’ve outfitted your home with, or if you’re still waiting for the market to develop.

I’m gonna leave a link to this, as well as everything in the bag, in the description below, but if you’re wanting to look this up on your own, it’s spelled N-R-G. Here’s what’s special about it. This is a bag built for gadgets. It’s ridiculously spacious, water resistant, and can charge  your gadgets when you’re on the go. More on that in a bit. You might be wondering why I called this the What’s in my Bag: Overkill edition, and you’re about to find out. As most of you know, I work from home, and creating tech content like this video is what I do for a living. What that means is, when I am on the go, it’s because I am leaving town - and that means I need everything necessary to keep the content flowing for you guys. Let’s start in the front pocket. Oh, and remember how I said this bag can charge up your gadgets? There’s a 7000mAh removable battery built in to this bag. It can be removed to be charged, or you can just open up the power port on the side of the bag and plug the AC adapter into there. The battery powers the USB port on the side of the backpack, which can charge up any smartphone or tablet. Even cooler, on the inside you’ll find built-in Lightning, microUSB, and Apple 30-pin charging cables, all of which are directly connected to the power in the bag as well. So, you are covered regardless of the device you have on you, and that’s pretty cool. MACBOOK Of course, when I’m on the go, I need my mobile workstation, and in this instance, that’s the 2016 MacBook. I’ve got the Rose Gold model with the upgraded 1.3GHz Intel Core M7 processor and 512GB of storage. I’ll be bringing you my review of Apple’s latest MacBook soon, but in my early tests it beats last years model easily. IPAD PRO In addition to the MacBook, I also keep a 12.9-inch LTE iPad Pro in my bag as well. Sometimes I just wanna use iOS apps to connect to my TiVo to watch shows, or stream Netflix, Hulu, or just play a game. Of course I’ve got the smart keyboard connected in case I also wanna get some work done... But yes, sometimes I don’t need the larger form factor, and therefore I ALSO have the 9.7-inch LTE iPad Pro with me as well. The larger model pretty much needs to be on a table or desk to be useable, and this smaller version is fine in the hands, and has that fresh True Tone display as well, which is great for reading. KINDLE OASIS That said, if I really wanna get some reading done without distractions or the temptation of other apps, I also have a Kindle e-reader in my bag at all times. RIght now, it’s the brand new Kindle Oasis, which Amazon just released last week. I’m a fan of this because it includes a leather charging cover, and a fully charged Kindle Oasis and Oasis case provides a ridiculous multi-month battery life. APPLE PENCIL Since I’ve got two iPad Pro units in my bag, it only makes sense that I’d also bring along the accessories that make the iPad Pro an iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil is definitely part of that equation, coming in handy when I’m making those sick YouTube thumbnails on the go. PowerAdd Slim2 CHARGER This small charger by PowerAdd sports 5000mAh of power, enough to recharge a current smartphone almost twice, and it’s not too big to fit into a pocket if you need to charge up while using your device. It’s also not too expensive at all at just $10. ANKER CHARGER But when I need more power, or to charge more than one device, this Anker charger is my go to. It’s sleek and slim, looks great, has 3 USB ports, a built-in flashlight, and has an incredible 20100mAh battery on the inside. You can even use this to charge the MacBook over USB-C. NINTENDO 3DS I’ve got the New Nintendo 3DS to take care of boredom on flights, as well as to give me an opportunity to get some gaming in since I’m so busy as home making videos nonstop. Specifically, this is the limited edition Legend of Zelda Majora’s Mask console. CABLES Of course, I need to have every cable that I may possibly need, because, you never know, right? Ethernet, Lightning, microUSB, mini USB, USB-C, etc. I’ve also got some USB-C dongles for the MacBook, in case I need to plug in a standard USB device or HDMI cable. IPHONE SE - VRS Design Case In the back pocket found on the rear of the NRG bag, I usually store a couple of extra smartphones. I’m usually reviewing and testing multiple models, and this is a great place to keep them protected. Here I have the iPhone SE, although you probably wouldn’t know it due to the unique case. This is actually another case from VRS Design, which can also hold some card or cash. Just like the LG G5, VRS design makes some sweet cases for iPhones as well. I’ll have more on these iPhone SE cases in a future video, so look out for that one. LG G5 - VRS Design Case Here I’ve got the LG G5, the latest flagship from LG. I keep that on me  in order to compare smartphones when I am doing reviews on the go. If you’re thinking about picking up the LG G5, I’ll leave a link to my full review video for you to check out. Oh, and to keep it protected, I’ve got it in a case from VRS Design. This one is called the High Pro Shield, and it’s two pieces - one soft piece that protects the phone from shock, and a hard bumper that goes around it. I’ve been trying out a bunch of different cases from VRS Design lately, and I’m a big fan of both the look and the quality of their designs. In fact, I’ll show you another one a little later on. If you need a case for your LG G5, VRS Design cases start at about $11. HTC 10 This is the HTC 10, and if you’ve been following my channel, you know that I picked my review unit up from the launch party that took place in New York City a couple of weeks ago. I’m just about done with my full review of the HTC 10, and while you wait for that, feel free to check out my coverage from the launch party, as well as my picks for the top 5 features on this device. NECTAR GLASSES: Dank Depending on where I’m going, sunglasses could be a necessity. I like to keep a pair of stylish but inexpensive shades with me at all times, just in case. I keep my more expensive sunglasses in my car, so when I’m on the go, I’m all about Nectar Sunglasses. Here you see the Dank edition Sunnies, which cost just $30. Moment Case and Lenses Moment Lenses and the accompanying Moment Case are invaluable tools for getting fantastic photos and videos using my iPhone 6S Plus (which isn’t in my bag because it’s home is my back pocket.) You insert the iPhone into the Moment Case, which is communicates with over Bluetooth, and provides a nice camera grip and shutter button. I have three lenses, all of which are premium glass. One is a wide angle, one is telephoto, and the last is a macro. Earin headphones I’m testing these Earin headphones. They are completely wireless Bluetooth earbuds. No wire to plug into your device, and no wire connected the two ear pieces. They’re decent so far, but audio drop outs on one ear or the other can get annoying. Still, many think wireless earbuds are the future, so I’m keeping my eye on this space. LSTN Wembley bamboo earbuds These LSTN Wembley earbuds are some of the best in-ears I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, which is why I’m not totally sold on the idea of completely wireless buds just yet. I’m usually more a fan of over-ear headphones, but I agreed to try out the LSTN buds and was immediately blown away by how great they sound - and the bamboo wood construction is beautiful. They’re noise-isolating and electro-acoustically tuned to produce high-end sounds quality at any volume, and the real wood housing provides a rich, full sound. Even better, your purchase helps support LSTN and Starkey Hearing Foundation’s mission to help restore hearing worldwide. Belkin SurgePlus USB Swivel Charger The Belkin SurgePlus has been a lifesaver, and it has had a spot in my travel bag for about 8 years. It plugs into a standard outlet, and provides you with three surge-protected AC outlets, as well as two USB charging ports. WHen you’re in a hotel room and outlets are scarce, the SurgePlus quickly becomes your best friend. Mophie Juice Pack When I’m on the go and don’t need to carry my bag with me, I look to the Mophie Juice Pack to keep my iPhone 6S running all day. It does double as a protective case, but that’s not why I use it - I just wanna be able to go from morning til late at night when I’m at these influencer events, and the Juice Pack means I don’t need to find an outlet. Audeze EL-8 Titanium This might be my favorite thing in my bag - the Audeze EL-8 headphones. World’s First Headphones With Fully Integrated Apple Lightning Cable. The EL-8 Titanium headphones come with an exclusive lightning cable that streams a complete 24-bit digital signal through a high quality DSP and DAC to offer better sound quality. The built in microphone can be used for phone calls and is SIRI compatible. An accompanying Audeze app can be used to apply EQ and sound presets. For non- Apple device compatibility, the headphones also include a standard analog cable. PlugBug PlugBug piggybacks onto your MacBook Power Adapter, creating a one-of-a-kind, dual charger for MacBook + USB devices like an iPhone or iPad, or really any USB-powered device. A newer model includes five international snap-on plugs and doubles as an international, stand-alone USB charger for iPhone and iPad. SanDisk USB-C Dual Flash Drive It has 32GB of storage, and the cool thing is that it can be plugged into both standard USB ports, as well as newer USB-C ports like the one found on the MacBook. That makes it easy to get files from one system to another, regardless of which USB type it supports. There you have it guys, that was your look inside my tech bag. I’m curious what you thought - I know I said it was overkill, but do you agree? Do you keep your bag nice and light, or are you hauling around even more stuff than I am? Hit me in the comments and let me know.

The model would see Apple’s cut of app developers’ per-user profits drop from 30 percent to 15 percent if a user went out on a limb to continuously give them money for 12 consecutive months. It’s not just for access to features within the app, but for access to the app itself. Such a model could give a new mission to publishing houses and maybe we’re going to see that effect starting from this point. Apple has officially raised the curtain on subscriptions, free trials and variable pricing depending on country. Any company can apply these features to their app. Subscriptions can be renewed automatically and last for various lengths of time. If pricing changes are set to occur, the company can keep current users at current price levels while offering new customers the new price. Developers cannot have an introductory pricing scheme wherein the cost goes up after the first month. Also, if a user cancels their subscription after a year, they have up to 60 days to resubscribe to the app in order for the developer to keep the 85/15 share. Let the subscriptions begin.

Photograph: Paul Faith/Getty Tax havens The Observer Why Apple’s low-tax deal is no blueprint for Brexit Britain The sweetheart tax deals offered by Ireland to the global corporate elite are coming to an end – because they are not sustainable, politically or socially Fintan O'Toole Saturday 3 September 2016 19.04 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close One of the islands that makes up Papua New Guinea is called New Ireland. But it seems that a much colder island far to the north might also wish to be called New Ireland – the island formerly known as Great Britain. In the wake of the European commission’s ruling that Ireland must reclaim €13bn plus interest in taxes from Apple, there is a good deal of excitement at the prospect of a post-Brexit Britain replacing its smaller neighbour in the affections of tax-shy global corporations. As the Daily Telegraph put it in an editorial: “If Ireland and the EU do not want a huge, wealth-creating firm doing business in their territory, Apple will be very welcome in the UK.” Welcome, that is, to use the UK as it has previously used Ireland – as a compliant state that will look the other way while vast profits pass through, untaxed. It is, on the surface, an appealing prospect. You only have to walk around Dublin or Cork to see that Ireland’s tax regime has been a honeypot for all the hottest digital corporations – not just the long-established ones like Apple, Microsoft and Intel but the entire new wave of internet behemoths: Google, Facebook, Twitter and so on. And the same is broadly true in other areas such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Little Ireland has a stock of US direct investment much larger than France and Germany combined. Ireland is the number one location worldwide for investment by US chemical and pharmaceutical companies and number two for IT companies. And no one thinks those corporations are attracted by the scenery. For the more excitable elements among the Brexiters, the EU’s ruling on Apple’s tax bill thus opens up a delirious prospect. The Brussels bureaucrats are moving against Ireland’s vigorously pro-business taxation policies, but Britain, when it throws off the shackles of the EU, will be free to swoop in and grab the golden eggs from the Irish nest. Apple and Pfizer, Facebook and Google, driven by EU persecution from the emerald isle, will seek asylum in the New Ireland next door, where the writ of the Eurocrats does not run and the government knows how to treat a corporation with the respect it deserves. Could there be any more dramatic illustration of both the evils of the EU and the thrilling possibilities of Brexit? There are, however, two small questions about this strategy. Is it possible? And is it desirable? The answers might perhaps curb the enthusiasm of the true believers. There is, for a start, the small matter of whether, even after the EU tax ruling, Apple wants to leave Ireland for the UK or anywhere else. The answer could hardly be clearer – it doesn’t. In an interview with Ireland’s national broadcaster RTE, chief executive Tim Cook was full of indignation at the very idea that Apple might have benefited from illegal state aid in the form of a sweetheart tax deal. “When you are accused of doing something that’s so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you, that’s how we feel,” he said. He made clear that Apple will appeal against the €13bn ruling and that it expected the Irish government to do the same. Those listening out for signs of a dismay that might be exploited by post-Brexit Britain will have been encouraged – up to a point. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty And the point at which the encouragement stopped was when Cook discussed Apple’s intentions. What will Apple do in benighted EU-ridden Ireland? Keep investing. He reaffirmed without qualification that Apple was going ahead with a major expansion of its campus in Cork: “We’re very committed to Ireland, have been for 37 years. We have a long-term romance together.” So why on earth would Apple remain in Ireland instead of taking refuge in the brave new post-Brexit world of low-tax Britain? Partly because tax, even for greedy corporations, isn’t everything. And partly because Apple is smart enough to know that the kind of outrageous dodge that resulted in a tax rate in 2014 for its Irish-based subsidiary of 0.005% is not sustainable – in Ireland, Britain or any other democratic society. Though market fundamentalists find it hard to believe, even global corporations need social relationships. Will they exploit every possible loophole to maximise their profits? Yes – ruthlessly and without conscience. But is the ability to dodge tax the sole criterion they apply to their decisions to invest? No. As Cook acknowledged: “We went into Ireland in 1980. We didn’t go there to seek advantages on taxes – we had only 60 employees and very little revenue.” This reassurance explains why public and political opinion in Ireland has been more ambivalent about the Apple ruling than the establishment consensus would suggest. The big right-of-centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, have backed Apple to the hilt and tried to rally the public by warning that accepting the unpaid taxes would drive multinational investors away. But most people seem to understand that it’s not so simple. The choice between colluding in morally obnoxious tax avoidance on the one hand and facing economic chaos on the other does not ring true. The Brexiters’ fantasy of stealing Ireland’s corporate investors relies on a deeply patronising attitude to Ireland. Underlying it is the notion that no foreign company would possibly invest in Ireland for any other reason than its lax attitude to taxation. But there are a lot of other reasons – a highly skilled and productive workforce, cultural vitality, political stability and (oddly enough) membership of the European Union with full access to the world’s biggest single market. The obsession of giant corporations with avoiding tax does not blind them to their need for the social, political and cultural resources on which they draw. This is not just a matter of theory. A crucial point easily lost in the noise of the EU’s Apple ruling is that the regime under which it could avoid so much tax has already changed. The notorious “double Irish” strategy used by Apple and other corporations to make themselves stateless for taxation purposes is being dismantled. Market fundamentalists would tell us that corporations will respond to this tightening of the tax regime by fleeing Ireland. Actually, they’ve responded by paying more tax: Ireland took in €6.9bn in corporation tax last year compared with €4.6bn in 2014 when the abolition of the “double Irish” was announced. And why was the Irish corporate tax regime made tougher? Not because of the EU but because of an organisation the Brexiters seem not to have heard of: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is the OECD, not the EU, that has driven attempts to clean up the worst excesses of corporate tax avoidance. (One way of seeing the severity of the Apple ruling is as an attempt by the EU to regain the initiative on an issue of such global consequence.) The UK is a member of the OECD and has signed up to these anti-tax avoidance strategies. Unless Britain wants to go completely rogue and leave the OECD as well as the EU, the fantasy of luring companies such as Apple with the virtual impunity from taxation they used to enjoy in Ireland could not be fulfilled. So much for the possibility of becoming the New Ireland – what about the desirability? Would it be good for Britain if it were to try to emulate Ireland’s strategy of relying on foreign investment and attracting it by becoming, in effect, a tax haven for the largest corporations? The key point about Ireland’s Faustian pact with global corporations is that it was a strategy of desperation. The country sold its soul in the 1960s because it had a stagnant agricultural economy. Indigenous industrial development was slow and weak, Ireland was an economic vassal of the UK and mass emigration was bleeding the country dry. Giving global corporations massive tax breaks wasn’t an ideological principle – it was a last resort when pretty much everything else had failed. This matters in the British context because it explains why very low corporation taxes could operate in Ireland without creating social conflict. The corporate devil gave the Irish Faust a pretty good price for his soul: a way of moving from backwardness to modernity. But Britain has a radically different economic, social and political history. Transplanting a policy that worked for very specific reasons in Ireland into post-Brexit Britain would show scant regard for the nature of either country. Ireland has had to live with the consequences of its particular choice. One of them is what US economist Paul Krugman recently called “leprechaun economics”. Krugman coined the phrase in response to the news that the Irish economy grew by an incredible 26.3% in 2015. Literally incredible – the figures are massively inflated by the fiscal juggling of the giant corporations. Irish GDP is meaningless. There is a vast gulf between the real economy and the kind of hyped-up faux-economy you get when you turn your state into a conduit for torrents of funny money. And that hype is not harmless – the Celtic Tiger bubble was one of its more catastrophic products. It is not accidental that Ireland has the most unequal distribution of market income (before tax and welfare) in the developed world. In effect, there are two Irish economies: the foreign corporate economy that is highly skilled, ultra-globalised and very favourably treated by the state; and a weaker indigenous economy that exists in its shadow. One of the consequences of this extreme inequality of market income is that the state has to do an enormous amount of heavy lifting through the income tax and welfare systems to keep these divisions in check. This activist state is hardly what the British right expects it will get if it follows the Irish model.

Apple has had operations in Ireland for 37 years. Photograph: Irish Examiner And here, surely, is the fatal contradiction in the notion of a post-Brexit Britain that will combine huge tax benefits for the corporate few with Theresa May’s promise of social justice for the many. The more honest voices urging Britain to replace Ireland as the new best buddy of the global corporations recognise that radical cuts to corporate taxes would have to be matched by drastic reductions in personal taxes because otherwise rage at grossly unequal treatment would destabilise society and politics.Hence the final paradox: giving the corporations what they want on tax means not giving them what they need in every other respect. The general low tax regime in this brave new Britain would be delightful for the likes of Apple – except when they want a terrific educational system to produce their smart workforce, a national health service to keep them healthy, a decline in social inequality to keep the political environment stable and lots of public investment in world-class infrastructure. And for those things they need big government funded by high taxes – on somebody else. It is pure delusion to think that the smartest corporations will be drawn to a Britain not only outside the single European market but no longer raising enough tax to invest in its society, services and infrastructure. Ireland is discovering that the game of beggar-my-neighbour tax policies is pretty much up. Inside or outside the EU, Britain will have to join Ireland and the rest of Europe in telling the corporations that, if they want to operate in civilised societies, they have to help pay for them. Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times FIAT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: AFP/Getty Images In 2015 the European commission ruled that the Italian carmaker’s financing company had paid taxes on profits that had been underestimated. The commission found that Fiat Finance and Trade, which is based in Luxembourg and provides financial services, such as intra-group loans, to other Fiat group car companies, engaged in “many different transactions with Fiat group companies in Europe”. Its investigation showed that a tax ruling by the Luxembourg authorities gave a selective advantage to Fiat Finance and Trade, which had allowed it to reduce its tax burden by between €20m and €30m since 2012. Fiat insisted its dealings merely amounted to a clarification of pricing rules and did not constitute state aid, but it was ordered to repay £25.5m. MCDONALD’S Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: AFP/Getty Images In May, the French headquarters of the global fast-food chain was raided by tax officials who seized financial documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The company’s finances have been in the spotlight since last year, following claims that it struck a deal with the Luxembourg authorities to significantly reduce its tax bill on European sales. Following the raid, a spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “From 2010 to 2014, the McDonald’s companies paid more than €2bn just in corporate taxes in the European Union, with an average tax rate of almost 27%.” AMAZON Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Reuters In 2013 it was revealed the online giant had paid only £10m in UK corporation tax, despite sales in Britain reaching £4.3bn. The commission is scrutinising Amazon’s 2003 tax deal with Luxembourg: Brussels believes it may have allowed Amazon’s European headquarters to lock in a preferentially low tax rate. However, Amazon says it does not receive preferential treatment from Luxembourg. It also insists that it is not based in the duchy – where it has more than 1,000 employees – primarily for tax reasons. STARBUCKS Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images The US coffee chain has said that it has not made a profit in the UK over 15 years despite cumulative sales of £2bn. Up to 2012, it had paid corporation tax of only £8.6m. In 2015, the commission ruled Starbucks had to repay £22.8m of what were described as “illegal” tax breaks. An investigation by the commission showed that a tax ruling issued by the Dutch authorities in 2008 gave a selective advantage to Starbucks Manufacturing in the Netherlands – the company’s European coffee roasting operation – which enabled it to reduce its tax burden. BELGIUM-LINKED MULTINATIONALS In January, the commission concluded that selective tax advantages granted by Belgium under its “excess profit” tax scheme were illegal. The scheme was found to have benefited at least 35 multinationals, which were ordered to return unpaid taxes – estimated to be worth around €700m – to Belgium.

If you do want to upgrade, selling off your old one before Apple's announcement is your best bet to get the most cash. Of course, selling your iPhone now creates the logistical problem of potentially not having a phone, so this is really only useful for people who have a second phone sitting around they can use for the next couple of weeks. It's worth it though, according to US phone reseller site Glyde, which is expecting a 15 per cent decline in pricing on older models as we get closer to Apple's event. There are a lot of places where you can sell off your old iPhone, including sites like Mobile Monster, Mazuma Mobile and Cash A Phone that make it easy to sell your device for a good chunk of cash without much hassle. There are a lot of variables, so check a few sites before you commit to selling. Gumtree is also always a great option. Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 4, 2016 at 2:11PM Stocks rose slightly last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) each added roughly 0.5% to stick at over 6% gains so far for the year. ^SPX data by YCharts The trading week ahead is shortened, with markets closed on Monday. However, the remaining four days are packed with news that could spark big moves in stocks. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is responsible for a disproportionate segment of the entire market's earnings, will talk about its new product plans first. Then, Restoration Hardware (NYSE:RH), and Kroger (NYSE:KR)will grab the spotlight with their quarterly earnings reports later in the week. Apple's product launch event Apple is holding a highly anticipated product launch event on Wednesday, where it's a safe bet that the tech giant unveils new iPhone models, likely dubbed the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Rumors have it that CEO Tim Cook and his executive team are adding some flashy new features, including a pressure-sensitive home button and standard wireless headphones, in addition to the traditional processor and display upgrades. Investors are hoping the refreshed lineup will help Apple return to growth in its biggest business after several quarters of declines. The popular iPhone SE might get an upgrade this week. Image source: Apple. Additionally, the company could show off an upgraded Apple Watch this week that aims to move that product into a more significant profit driver. The services segment, which has soared to 11% of sales from 8%, might just garner the most stage time, though, with software updates including on iPhone and iPad operating systems . Restoration Hardware's growth pace With its stock down 60% over the last twelve months, expectations are low heading into Restoration Hardware's quarterly release this week. The luxury furniture specialist's earnings are seen plunging by 66% because of costly production delays around its RH Modern concept. Consensus estimates also have sales rising by just 1% in a further slowdown from last quarter's 8% improvement . RH's shareholders will be looking for clarity around whether the retailer's move away from a promotional sales model into a membership focus is the right long-term strategy. Sales and traffic growth, along with gross profit margin figures, should provide answers there. At the same time, investors are hoping to see continued progress at building out its online presence and putting together a holiday product lineup that resonates with customers. Kroger aims for 51 straight quarters of gains Supermarket giant Kroger posts its quarterly earnings results before the market opens on Friday. Investors have soured on the stock lately as revenue growth slowed to a crawl. Comparable-store sales had been rising by over 5% for more than a year before dropping to a 4% rate two quarters ago and slumping to a 2% pace last quarter. Kroger's sales growth pace. Data source: Kroger financial filings. Yet that decline has more to do with food cost deflation than competitive pressures. Kroger's operating margin and sales volumes both improved last quarter, in fact. Meanwhile, the grocery chain's profits are growing at a healthy pace, even slightly above the 8% to 11% long-term target that CEO Rodney McMullen and his team have staked out. That implies the retailer should manage its 11th straight year of market share gains in 2016, even if its rate of growth isn't quite as impressive as it was last year. Ultimately, investors should look for Kroger to post its 51st consecutive quarter of positive comps on Friday despite an unusually weak grocery pricing environment.

By Brian Patrick Published on September 5, 2016 Share Tweet Comment In a couple of days, Apple fans finally get to see the iPhone 7 and be left with the decision to get one or pass. A lot of this would depend on how minimal the features the upcoming Apple flagship will carry. While many feel that demand for the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus will not be as big compared to previous offerings, the fact that it is the latest one in the market may be enough reason to get. There is no mention of its suggested retail price right now, but savings could come in the form of trade-in deals. Who are offering trade-in deals? Among the ones offering trade-in deals are like the big mobile carriers. That includes AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint. The offers they will have will vary but with the same intent of enticing sales and pushing the iPhone 7/ 7 Plus. Also Read: iPhone 7 Will Debut Solo This September, Laptop In The Fall But aside from the carriers, there are other groups likely to offer trade-in programs. That includes Flipsy.com or even Cult of Mac, both offering price locks and programs for users who want to get the latest Apple flaghship Should You Get the iPhone 7/ 7 Plus? Before even considering the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the first thing that one has to do is ask himself, “Do I want to get it?” Right now, a lot are not too thrilled because of the minimal changes. Many believe that getting the iPhone is like getting an upgraded iPhone 6s. Also Read: iOS 10 Not Ready For September Debut? Just the same, the fact is that this is the latest Apple model in the market and the features (minimal as they are) will still count. Better processors, slimmer design and a curious camera will be more than enough to woo potential buyers. Most are undecided at the moment because they have not seen the official product. All that could change once the iPhone 7 officially rolls out on Sept. 7. Liked this story? Subscribe to our newsletter or follow us on Twitter and Facebook for more iPhone 7 updates.

The details of the revenue seemingly voluntarily foregone by the Irish state are truly astonishing, with Apple paying an effective tax rate of 0.005% in 2014 and reports of 13 billion EUR foregone in the period 2003-2014. This is particularly remarkable given the austerity policies ordinary Irish citizens were facing during much of this period. DDCI is calling for the Public Accounts Committee to undertake a full review of the operation and social cost-benefit of the tax rulings system operated by Revenue. Todays news means it is now imperative to investigate the tax rulings system by which Revenue gives away billions in revenues to Apple and other multinational corporations  with no public record, scrutiny or accountability. Between 2010 and 2012 alone there were 335 rulings issued by Revenue. Due to the lack of transparency about these rulings, there is currently no way to estimate the impact of these further rulings to the exchequer, or to analyse the implications they may have in Ireland, and developing countries. Specifically, we argue that: Tax rulings should not be open ended, should be costed, and these costs should be included in government estimates. Revenue foregone through tax rulings should be included as expenditure in the government estimates and budget. DDCI is concerned about gaps in Irelands corporate taxation and incentives system, along with its transfer-pricing regime, which facilitate multinational corporations to operate aggressive tax dodging schemes from Ireland that reduce their global liabilities and deny much-needed tax revenues to low-income countries. Low-income countries lose out enormously when MNCs minimize their taxes through profit-shifting practices and aggressive tax avoidance, operated through countries like Ireland. Altogether, multinationals corporate tax avoidance costs poor countries around $100 billion/year, according to UN figures. DDCI Director, Maeve Bateman, said: "While the focus of this ruling is on Apple, there are many more tax rulings issued by Revenue we dont know the details of, with the strong possibility of even more revenue foregone by the exchequer. It is essential that increased transparency and oversight be applied to these secret rulings. Political representatives, the Public Accounts Committee and the general public need to be able to understand the basis on which companies tax liabilities are calculated. Todays decision makes it clear that keeping these decisions behind closed doors has been a costly mistake. Today, the worlds attention is on Ireland. However, this ruling could have significant implications for developing countries. A full review of the use of Irish tax rulings by multinational corporations would be a valuable first step in closing gaps in Irelands corporate taxation regime, and would reduce the outflow of revenue from developing countries."

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Here Is Our First Look At IPhone 7 Plus Packaging Posted: Sep 4 2016, 12:52pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple   Apple Insider   A new leaked picture of packaging for the the upcoming iPhone 7 Plus via Apple Insider suggests that Apple will be shipping the phone along with its AirPods. Don't Miss: Hottest CES 2017 Announcements This leak stands out from the rest because instead of mentioning a lightening to headphone 3.55 jack adapter it out rights states AirPods which are expected to be announced along with the new iPhone. Apple has decided to ditch the 3.5 mm headphone jack and in the light of this change it needs to come up with a replacement for the old EarPods. The expected turn of events was that Apple would originally offer an adapter and later as time would pass upgrade its customer to the new AirPods but if we are to heed this leak, than we Apple plans on selling the new iPhone with new AirPods, at least in some cases. At this time we can’t really comment on the authenticity of this leak vs that of the previous leaks. This might all be an elaborate setup to distract customers and create more hype as writing text on a white background is a pretty easy task or this could be the real deal as this near the release date legitimate pictures do tend to appear.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid The two most-anticipated laptops of 2016, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Apple Macbook Pro 2016, have been subjects of intense speculation by tech enthusiasts. If one is planning to buy any one of the two in near future, making a decision might be difficult as both are amazing devices to possess. Both Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Apple Macbook Pro 2016 are capable of fulfilling all computing needs. Hence, one cannot go wrong with either of the two. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 It’s hard to outdo this laptop as the upcoming 2-in-1 device from Microsoft is expected to feature the Intel Kaby Lake processors as well as the latest Windows 10 update. It will have a much better battery capacity compared to its predecessor Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and also a better stylus. Fans are expecting an Ultra HD Display of 4K quality and 3,840 × 2,160 pixels screen resolution. The Surface Pro 5 is believed to be a gaming-oriented laptop with AMD graphics processor “Polaris” or NVIDIA’s Pascal. Rumours suggest the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will replace the current AAAA battery-powered stylus with a Surface Pen. Up to now there has been little information as to its release date though an early 2017 release is possible. Some also believe the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will get an October release. For more details, click here. Apple Macbook Pro 2016 Also believed to be released later this year, the Macbook Pro 2016 is expected to receive a massive makeover from its earlier generations. The company has teased “radical changes” such as an ultra-fast second gen USB 3.1. If Apple Macbook Pro 2016 does come with a USB 3.1 support, it would have transfer speeds of up to 10GB/sec, writes GameNGuide. Moreover, the highly-publicised OLED touch bar may replace its function keys. Thunderbolt 3 for the Apple Macbook Pro 2016 is also a possibility. It supports both 10GB/sec USB 3.1 ports as well as DisplayPort 1.2. Intel's new Skylake platform may also be included, which will provide higher CPU powers and better battery life. Experts believe the Apple Macbook Pro 2016 will have the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Apple's Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology is also expected.

Joe McHugh, Fine Gael TD and minister of state, has described the situation is “very complex”, adding that “a lot of clarity is needed.” He said: “I have read what the commission ruled and it sets out a very dangerous precedent - the commission's interference in sovereign matters, and that is a very dangerous road to go down.” Fianna Fáil Deputy Charlie McConalogue said he believed the government has “a very, very strong position to stand over and a very defensible position in relation to its treatment of Apple.” He said if Ireland did not defend its position, companies that deal with the country, or have in the past, could lose faith in Ireland's position. Independent TD, Thomas Pringle, said he had no doubt that “a sweetheart deal” was done with Apple, saying, “obviously the commission has decided there was state aid there.” He agreed the commission has no competency with regard to corporate tax rates. “But they do in terms of state aid, and what the commission is saying is they investigated whether Ireland's tax deal with Apple amounts to state aid,” he said. Pearse Doherty, Sinn Féin TD and finance spokesperson, has called for a public inquiry to establish who facilitated “a sweetheart deal” with Apple. “Given the state is chasing people who have not paid their water charges through the courts it is unimaginable that the government will appeal this ruling,” he said. Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Pat “the Cope” Gallagher, Fianna Fáil TD, said he would express his views at a parliamentary party meeting. Meanwhile, during a phone call with Taoiseach Enda Kenny, TD, Apple CEO, Tim Cook, recommitted himself to the company's operation in Ireland. The Cabinet agreed on Friday morning to appeal the commission decision.   Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition Stephen McBrearty . . . in the Donegal Dr. McKenna Cup panel Donegal panel for Dr. McKenna Cup SLIDESHOW Donegal swimmers at Creevy are a hardy bunch!

The new line is the first indication of new headphones that will be arriving with the iPhone 7, the first to ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack in the Beats line. The new headphones will either feature Bluetooth capability or use Apple’s Lighting connector to provide audio, instead. Apparently, the email was sent out early by the Beats PR team, it also included an invitation to Apple’s September 7th event, which notes that new Beats products are being unveiled the same day. The email has since been removed from the site by the request of Beats. As it stands, Beats currently has a line of Bluetooth headphones but none of them take advantage of Apple’s Lightning port.

Home » The Arrival of iPhone 7 – a pivotal moment for Apple The Arrival of iPhone 7 – a pivotal moment for Apple Mon, 2016-09-05 02:59  editor News Comments Hemantha Abeywardena writes from London… Judging by the reported, off-the-cuff dismay of the top executives of Apple, this week was pretty horrendous for the tech giant, both on financial and PR fronts, when the EU hit it with a tax bill of astronomical proportion – a staggering $14.5 billion. If this week’s EU ruling caused a ‘headache’ for the team Apple, the anticipated launch of the new iPhone and Apple watch next week has the potential to cause collective ‘migraine’ in the same hierarchy, unless it reverses the plunging enthusiasm for Apple products among its loyal supporters in a significant way. Apple has admitted more than once this year that the sale of its star product, the iPhone, has been falling during two successive quarters; nearly in inverse proportion to that, Samsung, its main rival on smartphone front, has registered a surge in profit, thanks to its popular devices, Samsung Galaxy range. So, it’s not rocket science to figure out what goes on in the smartphone market; some, if not all, who desert the brand Apple have switched their loyalty to Samsung. Adding insult to injury, the competition is mushrooming across the smartphone landscape in an unprecedented manner with cheaper phones with similar specs or even more. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Quarterly Free Cash Flow - Last 5 Quarters | FindTheCompany Huawei, the Chinese smartphone maker, for instance, is a rising star that has left an indelible mark on the sands of smartphone industry. This week, I had the opportunity to play with the latest Huawei smartphone and it’s a marvel to look at in terms of innovation, elegance and creativity. In the UK, it comes with a 2-year warranty from the manufacturer and reviews, for a company still in its early years, have been very positive. In addition, there are quite a few start-ups in the UK that offer smartphones at an unbelievably low price with the same specs of a high-end brand. Since the innovation is not a monopoly of the big players in any market, these small players have been compensating for lack of resources at their disposal with breathtakingly-impressive creativity. In this context, this week, Apple cannot afford to get it wrong: if the company does not come up with a revolutionary iPhone – or at least, some revolutionary specs – it may neither reverse the decline in sales nor woo back customers, who may wait in the wings to desert the brand for good. I am one of those who sits on the fence at the moment, anxiously watching the launch, since my iPhone6, quite ironically, died down last week, after playing up for weeks with a flickering screen, while turning itself off at random intervals; it is not even 2 years old. According to a report published by the BBC – and complaints of disgruntled users online – I am not in a minority with the same issue. I have been using iPhones since the very first one; never did I face the issue of losing a phone within the first 20 months. Apple products normally are renowned for being reliable for longs periods of time. Apple’s stubbornly-enforced secrecy up until the launch date, understandably, has led to the functioning of the rumour mill in top gear. If they are to be believed, Apple is about to introduce a new, enhanced camera, a wireless headphone, and bigger memory – in order to address the issue of apps eating up memory. It might even make the phone thinner than the existing phones despite the risk of being bent in the event of sitting with a phone in a trouser pocket. The improvement of camera is a good move, if turns out that way. The camera in iPhone 6 is not very brilliant, when it comes to adjusting light; most of the photos that I took while in Sri Lanka last year were of poor quality owing to the failure of the camera in adapting itself to low light. The cameras on the phones of Apple’s rivals, meanwhile, are way ahead, when it comes to performance in changing light conditions. If the anticipated changes are limited to these reported features, they are not going to be revolutionary - unfortunately; they are just inevitable, evolutionary features during the journey of progress. The rivals of Apple will easily be able to beat the company at its own game. In short, Apple may not be able to revive its stagnating fortunes. It’s the same with Apple watch, the sale figures of which have not been published by Apple. Its revival strategy too remains to be seen, as it was never on a par with other revolutionary Apple products, such as iPhone and iPad, when it came to shoring up the excitement among the faithful. Apple’s recent tendency to introduce cheaper iPhones with fewer specs than the standard ones, perhaps, is a desperate measure to hold its customer base intact. Although, the success or failure of such a move is open to interpretation, it implies the struggle that the company is going through in coming up with revolutionary new products or adding revolutionary game-changers to existing ones, despite the availability of top-notch engineers both on hardware and software fronts. All in all, next week will be a watershed moment for Apple. In the ascending order of corporate worries, it may even be above the anxiety brought about by the huge tax bill, imposed on the company by a determined, woman commissioner of the EU. - Asian Tribune - Tweet Login or register to post comments News Headlines The unitary Constitution needs to be preserved for posterity António Guterres begins term as the 9th Secretary-General of the United Nations Chandrababu Naidu movements watched for a suicide attack - Letter by outlawed Maoist UN’s 9th Secretary-General - António Guterres begins his term The Hacking Menace in America and Strange Counter-measures The year 2017 dawns with new hopes of prosperity, coexistence and reconciliation in our hearts - President Srisena Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn urges unity in first New Year speech Finance Minister announces big bonanza for school children in New Year NRIs Hit Hard By Demonetization: GOPIO Declare a larger Wildlife Reserve, including the surrounding forest area - President Srisena Follow Asian Tribune on: Facebook Twitter We Are in Facebook     Make Your Donations Thinacheithi Current weather Sri Lanka - Colombo Scattered clouds Temperature: 25 °C Wind: North-Northeast, 14.8 km/h Pressure: 1011 hPa Rel.

First Name Last Name E-Mail Address Snickerdoodle Dandy Snickerdoodle Apple Cobbler: This very unique and easy to make cobbler infuses snickerdoodle flavors and apple pie to make this comforting apple dessert. I was always the kid who chose vanilla over chocolate, in cake and in ice cream. Chocolate chip cookies were good but I loved a sugar cookie. Then my mom made Snickerdoodles. It was a sugar cookie but it seemed extra special. Of course, when I learned to bake I learned that the cream of tartar added some tang to the cookie. My mom adds nutmeg and so do I. And instead of just rolling in sugar they are rolled in cinnamon-sugar. We had quite a few fall like baking days and that got me baking up a storm. I decided to do a whole week dedicated to my favorite cookie, the Snickerdoodle. No, they are not all cookie recipes, as this first recipe clearly shows…more like inspired by. This first dessert for Snickerdoodle Week is a combo of two of my favorites: apple pie and snickerdoodle. It uses one of my favorite, yet highly unique, way of making cobbler. You will panic when you see the dough floating in the water syrup but I promise you it all works out. A lot of people will ask do I have to use self-rising flour…yes. I have tried it with regular flour and adding leveeing and it doesn’t work the same. Did I like this dessert? Well, considering I normally eat mostly low carb and I have about one serving left (I made it Thursday night) I’m going with yes. Which is why I don’t make apple desserts often, I eat them. 🙂 Hopefully there are enough Snickerdoodle lovers out there that you will happy there is a whole week dedicated to it. 5.0 from 1 reviews Save Print Snickerdoole Apple Cobbler Author: Peabody Recipe type: Dessert   Ingredients ½ cup unsalted butter PLUS ¼ cup chilled unsalted butter, cut into piece 1 cup water 1 cup PLUS 2 TBSP granulated sugar ½ tsp. freshly ground nutmeg 1½ cups self-rising flour ¾ tsp. cream of tartar ⅓ cup milk 1 tsp. ground cinnamon ½ tsp. freshly ground nutmeg 3 cups fresh apples peeled and diced into bite size pieces 2 TBSP granulated sugar plus ½ tsp. cinnamon (to sprinkle on top) Instructions Preheat oven to 350°F.

In a food processor, pulse together flour, cream of tartar, nutmeg and remaining ½ cup chilled butter pieces until mixture resembles fine meal. Add milk and pulse just until a dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and with a floured rolling pin roll into an 11- by 9-inch rectangle. Whisk together the 2 TBSP of sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon and toss apple pieces in them. Beginning with a long side roll up dough jelly-roll fashion and cut into 1½-inch thick slices. (Slices will come apart and be messy). Arrange slices, cut sides up, on melted butter in pie plate or baking dish. Pour sugar syrup over slices, soaking dough, and bake cobbler in middle of oven 45 minutes. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over cobbler and bake 15 minutes more, or until golden. Serve cobbler warm with ice cream or whipped cream. Serves 6…or 3 if you are in our house. 😛 3.5.3208 Adapted from Gourmet Magazine June 1996 It's only fair to share... baked goods// breakfast treat// fruit// pie// Your Tummy Will Love Me Your Jeans Will Hate Me2 Comments Stay updated!

Want a new MacBook Pro? You'll need to buy some more stuff Curtis Moldrich @khurtizz 28 Oct 2016 whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email Image 1 of 19 Last night saw the launch of the brand new MacBook Pro, and it's probably one of the coolest laptops you'll see this year. Apple has added an innovative new Touch Bar, Touch ID and a host of performance upgrade – but it looks like there's a catch. The new MacBook Pro has four USB Type-C ports, and no USB ports at all. That means if you've got anything that uses a conventional USB cable – like an iPhone 7 for example – you'll need to buy another cable or shell out for a adaptor. That'll cost you £19 for an adaptor, or £25 for a 1m USB Type-C Lightning Cable.  While I'm not that bothered about Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, the decision to drop normal USB ports on the MacBook Pro but keep its headphone jack is an odd one. The MacBook Pro and the iPhone 7 both huge products for Apple, and the fact they can't play together straight out of the box is pretty terrible.  For a more detailed look at the iPhone 7, head over to our sister site Expert Reviews. Below you'll find everything you need to know about the iPhone 7 at a glance.  1. The iPhone 7 makes Apple less money  According to component analysis by IHS, an entry-level 32GB iPhone 7 costs $224.80 to make, while a similar iPhone 6s cost Apple $200 to manufacture last year. It’s important to remember that the price of the iPhone 7 has remained the same as the iPhone 7, and that means Apple is actually making less on its latest handset. According to IHS, the reasons for the decrease in profit come from several different areas, not just the camera, or the new screen for example. 2. The iPhone 7 is fast As you’d expect, the iPhone 7 uses a brand-new processor, but its A10 Fusion is much faster than we thought it’d be. Apple claims that the quad-core A10 Fusion processor at the heart the iPhone 7 makes the new handset twice as fast as the iPhone 6, but also achieves those speeds while giving you better battery life. It does that by using two efficiency cores and two high-performancee ones, and intelligently assigning tasks to each. That way, you should get a seamless mix of power and stamina. 3.  And the iPhone 7 Plus is faster than the iPad Pro Apple’s latest handset has been benchmarked, and according to new Geekbench results, it’s actually faster than Apple’s own 12.9in iPad Pro.  4. The 32GB handset up to EIGHT times slower than 128GB model Unbox Therapy conducted read and write tests using a £599, 32GB iPhone 7 and larger 128GB and 256GB versions of the iPhone 7. The 128GB iPhone 7  was able to read at speeds of 856Mbps compared to the 32GB handset’s 656Mbps. When it came to saving data, the 128GB model clocked a speed of 341Mbps while the 32GB handset lagged behind with 42Mbps. While the tests look pretty damning, in real world use, you probably won’t notice much of a difference between the handsets. Furthermore, it’s actually not Apple’s fault that the 32GB version of the iPhone 7 is faster than the 128GB version. As Extreme Tech points out in its article, larger SSD modules are inherently faster than their smaller counterparts.  5. You'll want a jet black iPhone 7... Probably The iPhone 7 will come in silver, gold and rose gold – just like the iPhone 6s before it – but Apple has also decided to introduce two new finishes to the mix. The new iPhone will also come in a matte-black finish debuting alongside a super-glossy jet black finish, too. However, the latter finish comes with a durability warning, and Apple claims it’s liable to small "micro abrasions". In other words, if you’d prefer to have a phone that looks great for longer, it might be best to steer clear of the Jet Black finish. Image 3 of 19 6. The home button is totally different – but the same The iPhone 7 features a completely redesigned home button, even if it does look identical to the one on the iPhone 6s. This time round Apple has removed the mechanical workings of the home button, and replaced them with a Force Touch-enabled sensor with haptic feedback. That means users should be able to customise the sensitivity of the new button, and it also means third party developers will be able to use haptic feedback in interesting new ways. Although the changes sound drastic, we’ve already tested the new home button, and somehow it feels just like the old one.  7. And it adds a cool new feature  That lack of mechanical parts means the new Home button less likely to go wrong, but it also means that when it does, Apple can use software to detect the problem and create a neat workaround. Over the weekend, a MacRumors forum member discovered that if the new home button goes wrong, the iPhone 7 is able to detect the issue, and give users an onscreen button instead. The button appears along with a fault warning telling the new user to get their new phone fixed. While a broken home button is the last thing you want to see on your new iPhone 7, at least you’ll still be able to use it. You can see what the feature looks like in the image from MacRumors below. 8. The iPhone 7 has two speakers, but no headphone jack Apple has removed the 3.5mm on both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, but it’s throwing a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter in the box for free. However, it’s clear that Apple wants us to go wireless with the iPhone 7, so the company has released its own AirPod earphones, as well as three new Beats models. Interestingly, each of these Apple-made headphones use a W1 chip, which Apple says will change how we think about wireless connectivity. In addition, the iPhone 7 now has dual speakers too, so you can listen in stereo without headphones. 9. The iPhone 7 features much-improved cameras See related  iPhone 7 deals: The best iPhone 7 deals in the UK iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Which smartphone should you buy in 2016? iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6s: Should you upgrade to Apple's latest phone? The iPhone 7 includes big improvements to the camera, whether you buy an iPhone 7 or an iPhone Plus. The standard iPhone 7 comes with a 12-megapixel camera at the rear, but the iPhone 7 Plus comes with a dual-camera system, comprising of a wide-angle and telephoto lens, too. That means you’ll be able to 2x optical zoom, and also get a neat bokeh effect on your pictures. This time around, Apple has given both phones optical image stabilisation, and the front-facing camera is a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera. 10. The iPhone 7 DOES have a sapphire lens The results of a recent scratch test suggested the iPhone 7 didn’t feature a sapphire lense, but Apple has since clarified the specs of the new iPhone 7 camera. “Apple confirms the iPhone 7 camera lens is sapphire, and under proper testing conditions, achieves the hardness and purity results expected from sapphire.” Sapphire is supposed to be virtually unscratchable – one of the reasons it’s used in high-end watches and camera lenses – but in this case, the lense looked to be damaged. So what happened? iMore suggest that the lens was fractured rather than scratched, and that this can happen when “you have something so incredibly thin — unlike the much thicker watch used for comparison — and you apply pressure with no level of control.” 11. The iPhone 7 will have better battery life Most importantly, the new iPhone should have significantly better battery life. Apple says the new iPhone 7 will “two more hours on iPhone 7 and one more hour on iPhone 7 Plus than the previous generation”. That equates to 14 hours of talk time for the iPhone 7 and 21 hours for the iPhone 7 Plus, or ten days' standby for the regular handset and 16 days' standby for the Plus. Image 13 of 19 12. The iPhone 7 is water-resistant, not waterproof We’ve seen water-resistant phones from the likes of Sony and Samsung for a while now, but the iPhone 7 marks Apple’s first attempt at a handset that laughs in the face of swimming pools. Both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are IP67 rated, which translates to “splash, water and dust resistance” in tech speak. However, water damage isn’t actually covered by Apple in the iPhone 7’s warranty, so it’s probably best to avoid dunking your new iPhone in water if you can. 13. The iPhone 7 is super hard to make in Jet Black According to a new report by respected analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is in the midst of a global shortage of Jet Black iPhones, and it’s because the finish is so tricky to get right. According to Kuo, the Jet Black iPhone 7’s 9 step manufacturing process has a 60-70% yield rate – meaning 30-40% of Jet Black components don’t make the cut. The result? Despite lower demand for the iPhone 7 than the iPhone 6s, Apple is struggling to make enough Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. That’s bad news for Apple, and terrible news if you’re one of the many people still waiting for a Jet Black iPhone 7.  iPhone 7: Release date, price and storage You can pre-order an iPhone now, and Apple began shipping the first handsets from 16 September. Of course, those dates only refer to unlocked phones bought directly from Apple. If you’d prefer to get the iPhone 7 via an upgrade or contract, you might have to wait longer – especially if you’re after the sold-out Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 starts at £599 for the 32GB version, £699 for the 128GB version and finally end at £799 for the 256GB model. The iPhone 7 Plus will cost a fair bit more, and start at £719 for the 32GB version, £819 for the 128GB model and £919 for the 256GB model. If that sounds expensive, you’ll be glad to know the iPhone 7 will also be available in the UK on Apple’s upgrade programme for the first time, which you can read more about here.

When Apple introduced it with their big 12.9-inch iPad Pro, artists gave it rave reviews thanks to how well it works. People like me love it because it handles handwritten notes better than any stylus you can get for the iPad. In addition, the iPad Pro works great as a laptop replacement. Now we have the smaller iPad Pro with a 9.7-inch screen to go along with the larger iPad Pro. Advertisement The Apple Pencil has some issues, but it can also do some pretty cool things. Whether you’ve got the bigger iPad Pro 12.9-inch version or the smaller iPad Pro 9.7-inch version, the Apple Pencil can help you get some cool things done. We’ve collected 12 things that you didn’t know the Apple Pencil could do. Secure Your Apple Pencil So You Don’t Lose It I lost my first Apple Pencil. It’s easy to do because Apple designed it poorly without any way to secure the Apple Pencil to your iPad Pro. Some third parties now offer ways to keep this from happening. Take a look at these. Advertisement One of the best options comes from Switch Easy. The Cover Buddy for the larger iPad Pro includes a spot on the back that holds the Apple Pencil in place. It keeps it secure and doesn’t easily pop out. Advertisement When the user wants to put their iPad down it holds the iPad Pro at a slight angle, which works better for writing and onscreen typing. The cover comes in black, white and clear. It’s $39.99 at their site or Amazon. Two other options include the Leuchtturm Black Pen Loop which buyers can get on Amazon for only $8. It sticks to the iPad Pro or an attached keyboard. The Pencil slides into the loop with a snug fit so it won’t slide out too easily. This offers the cheapest option. Advertisement The best in-between option comes from Stylus Sling. It’s holds the Apple Pencil inside an elastic pocket that stretches to fit over the edge of the iPad Pro Smart Cover or Smart Keyboard. There’s also a tiny pocket for the USB adapter that lets users charge their Apple Pencil with a Lightning to USB cable. Get it for $25 on Amazon.   Charge Apple Pencil Using iPad Pro Lightning Connector When Apple Pencil owners first open the box, they need to pair the Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro by connecting it to the iPad Pro’s Lightning connector. Leave it plugged in for a while to charge up the Pencil. Tap Pair when it pops up after connecting Apple Pencil to iPad Pro Advertisement Apple promises 30 minutes of use after connecting the Pencil for 15 seconds. Leave it plugged in for more than fifteen minutes and it will likely hit 100%. For a look at How to Pair and Charge Apple Pencil with iPad Pro, watch the video below to see how to do it. Charge Apple Pencil with Lightning Dock Do you also own an iPad or iPhone Dock? Use the included Lightning Adapter that Apple ships in the box and slide it onto the charging dock Lightning connector. Then put your Pencil on the dock. It works great on the dock I use. Advertisement Unscrew the Tip to Replace It To replace the Apple Pencil tip, unscrew it. Hold the tip and twist the Pencil. Apple put a replacement tip in the box with the Apple Pencil, but how do you change it? It’s simple. Just unscrew the tip that comes installed and it will come off. Then, attach the replacement tip and screw it on. Draw Thicker Lines by Pressing Harder Press harder and the Pencil will respond in apps like Procreate that support it. The Apple Pencil includes pressure sensitivity in supported apps. Procreate 3 supports the Apple Pencil pressure sensitivity. Press harder and you’ll get thicker lines as demonstrated in the image above. Press lightly and it will respond. This helps artists create some beautiful things. Tilt the Pencil for Pencil Shading in Drawings Hold the pencil normally and get regular lines. Hold it at an extremely low angle and draw using the side of the tip and you get shading. Below you’ll see how to hold the Pencil to get this shading effect. Adobe Sketch supports the shading feature as does Apple’s iOS 9 Notes app. Paper by FiftyThree will also support shading. Add Drawings to Notes Tap the new note icon to add a new note. Tap the drawing icon to add a drawing. The Notes and Mail apps on iOS can add drawings and inking as of iOS 9. In notes create a new note by tapping the new note button in the upper right corner. It looks like a square with a pencil on it at a 45-degree angle. If the onscreen keyboard shows up, hide it by tapping the button on the lower right corner of the onscreen keyboard with the down arrow under a keyboard icon. The drawing interface on iOS 9 Notes app. Tap on the icon in the lower right that looks like a squiggly line. This brings up the drawing interface. A drawing toolbar shows up at the bottom of the screen. Create Straight Lines and Perfect Shapes While we’re looking at Notes, users can use the Pencil to create a straight line by taping on the ruler icon. Use two fingers to place it where you want the straight line. Rotate it with the two fingers. Now use the Pencil to draw a line along the edge of the ruler. It automatically straightens the line perfectly. Paper by FiftyThree will let Apple Pencil users create perfect shapes. The Paper by FiftyThree app now supports Apple Pencil and includes a feature that helps people draw perfect shapes like circles, squares and triangles. Open a drawing and tap on the toolbar button that shows a ruler behind the pen. The app will start to recognize shapes and lines and make them perfect. Precision Pointing Don’t forget that the Apple Pencil does a great job of just tapping the screen. Users can scroll pages, select small buttons, hunt and peck on the onscreen keyboard or use a third-party keyboard like Swype or Swiftkey. These keyboards let you type by moving from key to key without lifting the Pencil. Take Notes in Your Handwriting The best app for handwritten note taking on iOS is Notability. Most people will think of the Apple Pencil as a drawing or art tool. However, it’s a great handwriting tool. You can use the Apple Notes app from iOS 9. But a few better options include the following: Penultimate – connects with Evernote for great drawing and handwriting Notability – uses iCloud to sync between iPad, iPhone, and Mac with great organization and will export to Evernote. OneNote – the best solution for Windows users who also use the desktop version of OneNote Evernote – the company added handwriting and drawing tools to the app, but we still prefer Penultimate or Notability MetaMoji Note – Almost as good as Notability, but offers cross-platform syncing of notes so it’s the best option for people who use an iPad with an Android phone and a Windows computer. Trace Through Paper Thanks to Apple Insider for this tip. Put a piece of paper on the iPad Pro screen and use the Apple Pencil to trace the image on the page. The iPad Pro display still recognize the Pencil’s input through most 20 lb. bond paper. If someone hands you a page in a meeting or school, you can trace things like pictures, charts or graphs. Draw on Mail Attachment Images and Files As we pointed out in our 51 New iOS 9 Tips, Tricks & Hidden Features, iOS 9 added the ability to draw on Mail attachments like picture files or PDF files. To do so, open up a message with an attachment. Tap and hold on the attachment till the pop-up shows (see below). Choose Markup and Reply. Press and hold on a Mail attachment and choose Markup and Reply. The attachment image or PDF file will open and there’s a toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Use the tools to make notes, highlight things or sign a PDF. The Apple Pencil will do a great job of marking up files. 4 Responses 12/06/2015 Hasnia Reply 0=1my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

If you'd rather read about its bigger-screen sibling, try our iPhone 7 Plus review. Apple announced the iPhone 7 on 7 September 2016, alongside the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The new iPhone handsets feature better cameras, new, super-speedy processors, two new colour options and improved water resistance. The iPhone 7 is available to buy in the UK now, via the Apple Store and UK carriers. (Read our roundup of the best cheap iPhone 7 deals UK.) If you're still debating whether or not to buy an iPhone 7, our review is sure to help. We test and rate the iPhone 7's design and build quality, features, tech specs, speed, camera capabilities and value for money. And we'd like to give a special mention to Mobile Fun for lending us the iPhone 7 we used to write this review! If you're interested in the full current iPhone range, meanwhile, take a look at our iPhone buying guide 2016 and best iPhone deals UK. Or if you're more interested in future iPhones, read about iPhone 7s rumours, iPhone 8 rumours and iPhone 9 rumours. iPhone 7 review: Design & build quality Let's address the elephant in the room before we go any further. While previous Apple releases, and the usual 'tick-tock' pattern of iPhone updates, led us to expect the iPhone 7 would be a completely redesigned iPhone, in fact it features essentially the same design of the iPhone 6 and 6s. That's the third year now with the same design. Many will say that's a bad thing - but it isn't quite so simple. The iPhone 7 looks gorgeous, there's no doubt about that, boasting an aluminium unibody with curved edges and 2.5D glass that helps make the phone sit in your hand much more comfortably, while also providing a nicer experience when swiping from the side of the display. It isn't just standard aluminium like the material used by its competitors, either - the iPhone 7 features 7000 Series aluminium, making the iPhone more durable without adding much weight and giving the device more of a premium feel. The iPhone 7 is, physically, the same size and shape as its predecessors, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6, measuring in at 128.3mm x 67.1mm x 7.1mm, but with a few notable differences. The rear-facing camera and TrueTone flash are bigger, and the eagle-eyed among you will spot that the antenna lines are gone from the back of the iPhone. Well, not gone, but repositioned to the top and bottom of the smartphone to make them less noticeable and provide a cleaner look. Read next: iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6s | iPhone 7 vs iPhone 7 Plus | iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 While the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6s in many ways, weight isn't one of them. It isn't heavier to compensate for the larger battery and additional tech; in fact, it's actually 5g lighter than its predecessor, weighing in at 138g. While 5g doesn't sound like a lot, we were surprised at just how noticeable the weight difference was in the hand when comparing the two smartphones, with the iPhone 7 feeling lighter and more comfortable to hold than the iPhone 6s. iPhone 7 review: Colour options As well as this, there are two new colours available: Black and Jet Black. The first is a direct replacement of the Space Grey that came before it, but uses a darker shade of aluminium, which we definitely prefer, and is quickly becoming our favourite colour option. Due to a black display and black body, there's no visible border between display and body, providing an almost completely uniform look that definitely works in Apple's favour. We've shown the black iPhone 7 to a number of people over the course of a week or so, all commenting that it looks different to any other iPhone - in a good way. Left to right: iPhone 7 & 7 Plus models in Rose Gold, gold, silver, black, Jet Black The second new colour option is Jet Black, which has a high-gloss finish that Apple is showing off in most of its promotional material. While the Jet Black model looks great in photos, we can't help but worry about smudges and scratches. In fact, even Apple has suggested using a case with the Jet Black model if you're worried about imperfections. On its iPhone 7 page, Apple writes: "Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use." However, despite Apple warning users about possible "micro-abrasions", nobody fully understood how easily it scratched until it started appearing in the wild. As you can see in the below tweet, it can go from gorgeous, high-end device to "ew" in a matter of minutes, and users should bear this in mind when thinking about purchasing it: So you thought a jet black iPhone was a good idea. pic.twitter.com/L3j7iqlu5I — Vlad Savov (@vladsavov) September 19, 2016 Oh, and we forgot to mention the most important part: the Jet Black finish is only available on the 128GB and 256GB storage options: there are no (comparatively) budget 32GB models in that colour. Of course, if black isn't your colour, you can also buy the iPhone 7 in the standard gold, silver and Rose Gold colour options. These, along with the matt black, are available across all three storage options. One last thing: according to Mac Otakara, Apple plans to add a 'Jet White' version of the iPhone 7 at some point in the near future. This has yet to be confirmed, but the source has been known to be reliable in the past and we're feeling optimistic. iPhone 7 review: Camera design As mentioned, the size of the camera on the rear of the iPhone 7 has been increased, and although it still protrudes from the back of the phone, it bulges out more seamlessly now that Apple has removed the aluminium ring around the camera you'll see on older examples of this design. This is one more element contributing to the clean look that Apple was chasing with the iPhone 7, and although it initially took some getting used to, we love the look of the new camera. The benefits of the tech inside speaks for itself, although we'll come to that in more detail below. However, it's worth noting that while the improved camera was welcomed by many, the new shape of the camera means that existing iPhone 6 and 6s cases won't fit the iPhone 7, despite having otherwise identical dimensions to its predecessors. iPhone 7 review: Water-resistance The iPhone 7 is also Apple's first water resistant phone. Apple has waterproofed individual connections within the iPhone rather than adorning it with ugly rubber plugs, and is officially calling it splash-, dust- and water-resistant, at IP67. That means you can dip it in water up to one metre deep for up to 30 minutes, and the smartphone should survive. If for whatever reason it suffers water damage, however, it's worth nothing that this isn't covered by Apple's warranty and you'll have to fork out for a replacement/repairs yourself. (For more, see How to dry out a wet iPhone.) We've used the iPhone 7 in a number of wet situations, such as in the rain and answering a call in the shower, as well as outright submerging it, and it has performed quite well with no lasting problems or damage. It is worth noting, however, that the sensitivity of the display is affected when submerged or covered in large water droplets, which makes the phone hard to operate when wet. iPhone 7 review: Goodbye, headphone jack One of the big talking points of the iPhone 7, following months of speculation, is the lack of a headphone jack. You've got several options, though: you can plug your traditional (3.5mm) headphones into the Lightning jack using the Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter in the box; use the new Lightning EarPods that come with the iPhone 7; buy yourself a pair of Lightning headphones or wireless headphones, such as Apple's own wireless AirPods. The headphone jack adaptor isn't the best-looking accessory, but let's be honest, when do adaptors ever look elegant? The adaptor works well and it can actually be left on the end of standard wired headphones, removing the need to carry it around separately. It works as well as any adaptor should, and for only £9, we'd be tempted to buy one or two and leave them in places where they're required, at work, say, or in the car (if you use an auxiliary input). Of course, the removal of the headphone jack initially caused a bit of a stir, but we're confident that iPhone users will quickly come to terms with the fact that the 3.5mm jack has been ditched, just as we all did when Apple replaced the 30-pin connector with a Lightning connector. In fact, we've been using wireless headphones for some time now, as they're actually a lot cheaper to pick up than most people realise. And even for those unwilling to stop using their wired headphones, you can buy an adaptor that'll make any wired headphones wireless. Besides, the missing jack paved the way for other enhancements, including a new, larger Taptic Engine for use with new Home Button (more on that below) and a larger battery which Apple claims will offer an extra hour of battery life compared to the 6s. The removal of the headphone jack also paved the way for higher quality audio playback, and while we're not bad-boy teenagers sat on the back of the bus playing the latest Grime tracks full-blast, we've noticed a positive change in audio quality. Playback is not only higher quality, but is also louder, and we can even feel bass emanating from what sounds/feels like the screen itself. While it's hard to notice the jump in audio quality when listening to streamed music, we especially noticed the richer tones when receiving text messages using the same tone we'd used on our old iPhone. It was much clearer, louder and crisper than ever before, making even the annoying text message jingle sound rather good. iPhone 7 review: Home button The Home button is where that improved Taptic Engine comes into play. It's been used to enable a completely flush Home button, that is actually not a button at all, although it still has that familiar Touch ID ring around it. Here's the interesting part about the new Home button - instead of physically moving up and down, pressing the new Home button triggers the clever Taptic Engine to trick your finger into thinking the button is pressing down. The Home button on the iPhone 7 is odd - not necessarily bad per se, but unexpected. And in a fundamental user interface tool like this one, a control you'll be using frequently, that can be off-putting. The solid-state trackpad on the MacBook and 2016 MacBook Pro, as many readers will know, is an astonishing feat of deception: many users would be willing to swear that the trackpad is clicking downwards, so clever is the haptic effect. It doesn't feel like something clever is happening - it just feels like you're clicking it, when you're not. The iPhone 7's Home button is not like that. You can tell at once that something is up: there's physical feedback, sure, and that's important to making a control satisfying to use, but it feels different. The designers have essentially given up on the pretence that you're clicking a button physically. It feels like you're pressing on a piece of unmoving glass, and something elsewhere in the object is buzzing promptly in response. We're aware that the Taptic engine is situated close to the Home button - roughly where the inside bits of the headphone port used to be, going by Apple's publicised diagrams - but, as irrational as this might sound, it doesn't feel like it. It feels like the buzz is deep within the guts of the phone, some distance from the button. To a certain extent you can customise the way the Home button reacts to your touch with varying levels of feedback, but none felt entirely naturalistic to us - at first, anyway. They all felt, well, odd, with setting one offering barely any feedback, setting three offering a much more intense vibration and setting two offering in our view the best of both worlds. However, as we continued to use the iPhone 7, we fairly quickly grew accustomed to the feedback produced by the Taptic engine. After little more than a week of regular use, we had decided we didn't want to go back to the standard Home button. The effort required to use the Home button is less than with the traditional Home button, providing a much nicer overall experience, and the software-enabled button is still sensitive enough to tell the difference between a tap and press, meaning you shouldn't get any accidental activations - we definitely haven't thus far. We've even come to like the feedback provided by the updated Taptic engine, and find ourselves clicking it for no real reason apart from to feel the sensation. The new software-enabled Home button isn't perfect, however, mainly due to the fact that it requires skin-to-glass contact to activate. On the surface, that sounds great - when would a situation ever arise where you wouldn't tap the Home button with your finger? But we can offer a couple of scenarios that we've encountered over the past week or so. The Home button can't be used when wearing gloves, and also can't be used by fingernail to turn on the display and check time/notifications without unlocking the device. That's in part due to the Touch ID scanner being so responsive that it only needs a split-second to unlock your iPhone when touched: a true first-world problem. iPhone 7 review: Display For the third year in a row, Apple decided against upping the (Retina HD-class) resolution of the 750x1334 iPhone 7 display, which is quickly becoming eclipsed by competitors like Samsung with the Quad-HD resolution Samsung Galaxy S7. The iPhone 7's 324ppi (pixels per inch) pixel density simply cannot compete with the eye-watering 577ppi of its main competitor, the Galaxy S7. Still, Apple has upgraded the technology inside the display to provide users with a brighter and crisper display without upping the resolution. How? Apple has improved the display of the iPhone 7 by making it a whopping 25 percent brighter than the iPhone 6s, making it much easier to use in direct sunlight with a maximum brightness of around 700nits. This is combined with the new DCI-P3 wide colour gamut which is primarily used with high-end 4K TVs, and is one of only three smartphone manufacturers to integrate the tech into its phones. The end result? A display that is crisp and gorgeous with great colour reproduction, ideal for everything from scrolling through Facebook to watching movies on Netflix and even editing movies in iMovie. Naturally, the display of the iPhone 7 features the 3D Touch pressure-sensitive technology introduced along with the iPhone 6s, and which allows the display to measure the pressure of the input (your finger), enabling it to tell the difference between a tap and a push. This opened up a whole new world for Apple when it was first introduced, and it has gone from strength to strength since then. iOS 10 introduces a number of new ways to use 3D Touch on the iPhone, allowing you to 3D Touch icons on the Home screen to bring up brand-new widgets, and 3D Touch Messages notifications to open a mini Messages app above whatever app you were already in. Of course, these are only a handful of examples of the ways you can use 3D Touch on the iPhone; you can find the best 3D Touch tips and shortcuts right here. 3D Touch really gives the iPhone 7 the edge over its competitors as none have quite been able to match the responsiveness and features available, including Huawei's flagship P9 Plus. It does take a little bit of getting used to at first, but trust us when we say that if you train your brain to use it when you first get the smartphone, you'll enjoy the overall iPhone 7 experience so much more. iPhone 7 review: Specs, performance and benchmark results Apple's new processor is called the A10 Fusion, and is the first quad-core processor to be found in an iPhone so far. The M10 Fusion is coupled with 2GB of RAM, which remains unchanged from the iPhone 6s but should allow for more processing power, resulting in a responsive, speedy smartphone. Apple claims that this combination makes the iPhone 7 the fastest smartphone in the world, and although it performed far better thank the iPhone 6s in our benchmark tests, it (rather surprisingly) didn't steal the top spot - but we'll come to that below. In real world use, the iPhone 7 is, of course, stupidly fast and responsive, with everything from apps to the camera opening almost instantly. We've played a number of games on the iPhone 7, from fairly basic side-scrollers to 3D, power-hungry apps and not noticed any kind of lag, screen tearing or outright freezing at any time. It can handle anything we throw at it and even when we intentionally tried to get it to slow down a bit by running power-hungry apps, we couldn't. If you're looking for a stupendously powerful smartphone, the iPhone 7 is a solid option. However, whether you really need the extra speed of the A10 Fusion or not is debatable; the iPhone 6S is already plenty speedy enough in our opinion, and even when running iOS 10, there's no sign of lag. It does, however, allow seriously powerful games to be created for the iPhone in the future, and the processor is also designed with efficiency in mind. Apple says that, on average, users will find that their iPhone 7 battery lasts two hours longer than the iPhone 6s did, thanks to the A10 Fusion. What does that translate to in terms of real-life usage? We've found the iPhone 7 battery life to be surprisingly good, allowing us to become less tethered to the wall on a daily basis. Will it last all day? Depending on its usage, sure. We've used the iPhone 7 constantly and never really found ourselves completely out of battery, and with the occasional battery top up throughout the day, we've got no real complaints when it comes to battery life. (Read our tips on How to improve iPhone battery life.) Along with the A10 Fusion processor, users can expect to find an M10 motion co-processor that allows the iPhone to track motion without a significant drain on battery, giving you better battery life when using GPS, fitness tracking apps and more. It also means that the iPhone can automatically track your steps, flights of stairs climbed and more without impacting on battery life, all of which is viewable via Apple's Health app. Apple has also improved the storage capacity of its latest smartphone range, as the company bumped the base model of the iPhone 7 up to 32GB, getting rid of the 16GB option that was never enough space. The 64GB variant is gone too, replaced by a 128GB option, with the new high-end storage option being a whopping 256GB. Well, with a new, improved camera with RAW support and a range of high-performance apps, you'll need all that storage, right? Read next: How to make space on an iPhone iPhone 7 review: Speed benchmark results So, how did the "fastest phone in the world" hold up in benchmarking tests? As briefly mentioned above, while the results of the iPhone 7 were a huge improvement when compared to the iPhone 6s, they're not quite good enough to steal the top spot in this category. Why? Well, let's explain. (And before we go any further, please note that across all of the following speed benchmark tests, higher scores are better.) Let's start with Geekbench 3, which tests the overall processing power of the smartphone - while the iPhone 6s scored a rather respectful 2524 in single core mode and 4400 in dual-core mode, the iPhone 7 blew that out of the water with scores of 3503 and 6088 respectively. While this is a huge improvement on Apple's behalf, it doesn't quite beat some of its' high-end Android rivals, namely Samsung's Galaxy S7. In dual-core mode, the Galaxy S7 scored 6466 according to our benchmark results, 378 points clear of the average score of the iPhone 7. However, while Apple's iPhone 7 wasn't quite the best in terms of general processing power, it comes into its own when measuring graphical power. To measure this, we selected two GFXBench tests - T-Rex and Manhattan - with varying levels of quality/textures, and recorded the average frame rate of each graphic. The iPhone 7 managed to score an impressive 60fps in both T-Rex and Manhattan, beating not only the iPhone 6s (60fps and 52fps respectively) but also Samsung's Galaxy S7, which scored 53fps and 27fps. However, while the GFXBench results are impressive, we must take them with a slight pinch of salt. Why? It's down to screen resolution. While the iPhone 7 features a display with a resolution of 750 x 1334 (326ppi), the Galaxy S7 for example features a much higher resolution at 1440 x 2560 (577ppi). This means that despite being similarly sized, the Galaxy S7 has to power more than double the number of pixels on the display. When running the same game, the S7 will require more power than the iPhone, a factor that will affect its benchmark results. In reality, both the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 are powerhouses when it comes to mobile gaming, and you shouldn't experience any real lag when using either smartphone in day-to-day life. Anyway, back to the results. Lastly, we ran the JetStream benchmark which tests the speed of a smartphone's mobile browser - Safari, in the case of the iPhone 7, while Android smartphones often utilise Google's Chrome browser. The iPhone 7 destroyed the competition in this respect with a score of 160.2, blowing the Samsung Galaxy S7 (61), HTC 10 (44.1) and LG G5 (53.6) out of the water. In fact, Apple's iPhone 6s was the previous winner with a score of 113.8, proving that Safari is one of the best mobile browsers available today. Take a look at the interactive graphic below to see how the iPhone 7 measures up to the competition: iPhone 7 review: Camera and photography One area that has had quite the upgrade is the camera department. While the iPhone 7 misses out on the iPhone 7 Plus's dual-lens camera, it has still been vastly improved when compared to the iPhone 6s. It's still 12Mp, but finally has optical image stabilisation across both photo and video modes along with an f/1.8 aperture and a six-element lens. What does this mean to those buying an iPhone 7? Apple says that the improvements will allow users to capture better low light photos and videos with up to 50 percent more light than the iPhone 6s - but does it? We've tested the iPhone 7 camera in a number of conditions including low-light, and we were quite surprised by the images provided by the smartphone. Of course, no phone camera will ever match the quality of low-light images taken by a DSLR, but the iPhone 7 does pretty well. Take a look at this photo taken on the streets of London at night (click to enlarge) - the overall photo looks good with no blatant noise or softness, and with fairly even exposure and good detail. Even when zoomed in at 100% with a 1:1-pixel ratio, you can still make out the details of elements such as the brickwork of the buildings on the lefthand side of the photo, as well as the window frames of the row of houses in darkness. Text, such as the writing on the bus stop to the far left of the photo, is slightly too soft to make out. This is a common issue with low-light photography and something that most smartphones struggle with. In terms of macro photography, the iPhone 7 performs well. It's fairly easy to take macro photos on the Camera app, and combined with the display, it's easy to spot whether it's in focus or not (the Camera did well with focus most of the time). Even when zoomed in at 100%, you can see details of the leaf - although in this respect, we're not sure much has changed from the iPhone 6s as that was also impressive at macro photography. Standard photos are generally evenly exposed with great colour reproduction and fine detail, although environmental factors may affect the quality of the image taken. Take a look at the above photo of St. Pancras Hotel, taken on an overcast day in London - the colours are even and you can pick out individual bricks on the hotel and surrounding buildings, although it starts to get 'soft' towards the back of the photo, an issue prevalent in most cameras. You can clearly make out the writing on buses and vans, and even the Euston Road street sign. Of course, the iPhone 7 features Live Photos support, and this feature has also been improved with the camera of the iPhone 7. Live Photos capture a second and a half of movement before and after the original photo was taken, along with audio, and offers this to you in a GIF-esque fashion activated by pressing down on the still photo. One of the main complaints from iPhone 6s users was that Live Photos were generally a bit shaky and not too clear, a sentiment we tend to agree with. However, thanks to the Optical Image Stabilisation of the iPhone 7, Live Photos are now much improved with better clarity and stabilisation, which should encourage more people to use the feature. The lens isn't the only element of the rear-camera setup to be improved, as the True Tone flash has been enhanced, too - it now features four smart LEDs for a more natural light that is 50 percent brighter than that of its predecessor. It performs well, offering a range of slightly varied light tints for the perfect selfie in dark conditions, although we usually avoid using flash when taking photos unless necessary, as harsh light is never flattering - top tip there. As for the front-facing (selfie) camera, you'll now get 7Mp to play with, up from 5Mp on the iPhone 6s. And to be quite honest there's not much more to say about it. The camera produces more detailed photos than before, but we've not noticed a huge jump in quality as we have with the rear-facing camera. It should be great for FaceTime and Skype, but as you'll be using it to film yourself, you won't see the benefit - only the recipient will. Read next: iPhone photo tips iPhone 7 review: Video But what about videos? How do they fare on the iPhone 7? The good news is that unlike in the past, the Optical Image Stabilisation will work across all photo and video modes, providing users with much smoother videos whether they're filming in 1080p @ 60fps, 4K @ 30fps or 720p @ 240fps for slo-mo. The stabilisation is impressive, there's no doubting that, and can provide users with stable video even when walking along the road, holding the phone with one hand. Take a look at the short GIF below for a better idea of what we mean: The only real gripe that we have with regards to video on the iPhone 7 is that Apple refuses to put some kind of toggle in the Camera app that allows you to change recording modes on-the-fly. Currently, if you want to switch between [email protected] and [email protected] (for example), you need to go to close the Camera app, go to Settings > Photos and Camera > Record Video and select your preferred option. This can make a difference in terms of light levels, as [email protected] will capture less light than [email protected] and thus shouldn't be used in low-light situations, but with no way to quickly change prior to recording, many of us are left with dark videos. iPhone 7 review: Software The iPhone 7 ships with the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 10. There's plenty we can tell you about iOS 10: It has a refreshed design, Siri enhancements, Photos, a brand new Messages app with its own App Store, Maps and News improvements and lots more. We'd recommend reading our iOS 10 review  and iOS 10 tips for more information about what users can expect with iOS 10 (and you'll get these new features even if you choose not to buy the iPhone 7 - assuming your current handset is an iPhone 5 or later). However, there are a small number of iOS 10 features that are specific to the iPhone 7 and its bigger brother, the iPhone 7 Plus. The first feature is haptic feedback, which we think is quite surprising given that Apple made a huge song and dance about the Taptic engine in the iPhone 6s, claiming it could create subtle bursts of haptic feedback much more accurate than a standard vibration motor. While we're not disputing that the Taptic engine does this (the Taptic engine on both phones are fantastic), we're just surprised that the feature didn't even make it to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, as we're fairly confident they could've supported it. Anyway, when you interact with certain elements of iOS - from swiping down to access the Notification Centre to swiping through options on a dropdown window - you'll get corresponding haptic feedback that slightly crosses the bridge between software and hardware. It's an interesting sensation, as the phone will give you a subtle 'tap' as the notification centre 'hits' the bottom of the display and bounces, just as it would if the Notification Centre were a real, physical element. It's fun, creates a new sense of depth for iPhone 7 users and we're really disappointed that iPhone 6s owners won't get to experience this new way to use Apple's Taptic engine. iOS 10.1, an update to iOS 10 that came a month or so after the launch of the iPhone 7, introduced additional camera features, namely Portrait Mode. Portrait mode is designed to mimic the kind of shallow depth-of-field photos taken with expensive DSLRs, with the subject of the photo in focus and the background blurred. This is done in part via software on the smartphone, but needs the dual-camera setup of the iPhone 7 Plus to achieve the effect, meaning that even iPhone 7 users cannot access this feature. iPhone 7 review: UK prices Following its 7 September unveiling, the iPhone 7 is on sale now. Read more: iPhone 7 deals. iPhone 7 (32GB): £599 iPhone 7 (128GB): £699 iPhone 7 (256GB): £799 The iPhone 7 is available in three models with three different price tags. The first comes with 32GB of onboard storage, which costs £599. That's more than the £539 the iPhone 6s was when it launched, which is a shame as it hasn't gone up in price elsewhere. It's likely to have something to do with the, er, 'changes' in the economy since the UK voted to leave the EU, but we haven't had confirmation that this is the case. (Read more about Apple's recent UK price rises here.) The second model has 128GB, and costs £699, again significantly higher than the equivalent model of iPhone 6s was prior to the iPhone 7's arrival. In fact, it has increased by £80. The third model is 256GB, which is the highest capacity we've ever seen for an iPhone. This will set you back £799, which is a whole £100 more than the third model iPhone 6s was at launch, and is close to the £819 price tag of the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus, which has a larger display and a dual-lens camera. If you want to buy the Jet Black model, you'll need to opt for the 128GB or 256GB options. It's not available with 32GB capacity. iPhone 7 review: Podcast Before we get to our verdict on the iPhone 7, here's a little audio discussion you may find interesting. The UK Tech Weekly Podcast team discuss the launch of the iPhone 7 in their 31st episode, embedded below. The UK Tech Weekly Podcast comes out every Friday. Follow the team on Twitter to get notifications of new episodes. OUR VERDICT So, is the iPhone 7 worth it? While we think the iPhone 7 is a sleek, gorgeous and generally fantastic phone with enhanced cameras, an improved design (with beautiful new colour options), better battery life and a supercharged quad-core A10 Fusion chip, we think it’s a more appealing upgrade for iPhone 6 (and earlier) users. We don't think we could justify the upgrade from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone 7, especially with the price hike in the UK, as the changes aren't as groundbreaking as some we've seen in the past. Don’t get us wrong: we love the IP67 water resistance, the doubling of the storage tiers, the cameras and more. But we think of the iPhone 7 more as a fine-tuned iPhone 6s rather than the next step in the iPhone lifecycle. Think evolution, not revolution.

Wednesday, August 31, 2016 · 2:35 pm · 18 Comments “We are optimistic about cashless payments generally and, in the past, have been enthusiastic about Apple Pay. However, our sense of Apple Pay is mixed at the moment,” Market View writes for Seeking Alpha. “As we monitor the page of retailers that accept Apple Pay, we are concerned that it’s not adding new merchants quickly enough.” “Apple management has noted that ‘Apple Pay is growing… with more than five times the transaction volume of a year ago.’ Last month in Apple’s quarterly earnings call, management said that Apple Pay’s ‘estimated monthly active users (were) up more than 450% year on year’ the prior month,” Market View writes. “However, actual metrics are not disclosed and the growth is off a very low base. Services revenue, the category in which Apple Pay is recorded, grew 23% in the first half of fiscal 2016 to 10% of total revenue from 7%, but Apple Pay is just one component of Service revenue.” “Maybe part of what we perceive as slowness in driving merchant integration is just the early stage of contactless payments in the U.S.,” Market View writes. “In fact, according to Digital Trends, Apple Pay dominates the domestic contactless payments market, accounting for “75 percent of all contactless payments in the U.S.,” but mobile wallets are a niche product at this early point. Domestically, only 0.2% of all in-store sales were paid for using smart devices in 2015, according to research firm eMarketer.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: As retailers upgrade their antiquated POS infrastructure, we’re finding – anecdotally – Apple Pay to be more widely available. We’ve paid by Apple Watch more in the last two months than in the previous ten because the capability is now there at more places. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

Loading... Comment Feed 18 Comments Russell9870 Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 3:28 pm · Reply I’ve recently used Apple Pay in the U.S. at Party City, Five Guys Burgers and Dash’s Market. None of these are listed on the Apple Pay page at Apple.com. However, searching for these retailers using Apple Maps shows that they do accept Apple Pay. Apparently the list of retailers accepting Apple Pay is growing faster than the web site page can be updated. However, it seems like the Map team is updating in a more timely manner. Justin Reese Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 3:31 pm · Reply Here’s something I don’t understand. A lot of retailers have the VeriFone or other hardware to support Apple Pay, but it isn’t activated. I’ve been to Cub Foods, Micro Center, SuperAmerica, Casey’s, Dairy Queen, Lunds and Byerly’s, all of those places support Apple Pay. Holiday does not. schmluss Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 5:37 pm · Reply Verifone is the hardware provider. Some of this hardware runs Verifone software, some of it runs the credit card processors software. Each processor has to certify the hardware with their system. This is why they are ready for EMV, but not processing EMV. Justin Reese Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 7:29 pm · Reply I realize that, but I’m just curious why it’s taking some merchants so long to get set up with it. I use Apple Pay on a daily basis with all of the places I shop at. Birdseed Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 3:49 pm · Reply No. trondude Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 4:47 pm · Reply Kinda weird thing going on with Apple pay lately. It seems as soon as merchants install chip capable readers, now Apple pay requires your debit PIN, whereas before it never did. Kinda sucks, as now it takes pretty much the same time as swipe or chip transactions. The merchant in question here in So Cal is Sprouts Farmers markets, this happen to anybody else? Rigged Thursday, September 1, 2016 - 2:26 pm · Reply Yep. It seems this change is everywhere and it does suck. Grrrilla Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 5:07 pm · Reply It’s a function of marketing. Until Apple goes out into the media and shows people what Apple Pay is, uptake will remain low. Aside from the very few of us that check Apple-related websites, almost no one has heard of Apple Pay, or knows how to use it, and the banks and businesses that support it have to pay a percentage, so they’re not pushing it too hard. I use it where I can, and even at the same businesses that are set up for it (particularly McDonalds), they don’t remember how to use it each time I try, and I have to show it to them. And they all look at me like I just showed fire to the cavemen. Apple needs to market Apple Pay, if they want it to take off. Then again, I don’t think that’s a priority right now. yojimbo007 Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 5:54 pm · Reply its ok… but i like to see it much faster… and Gas Stations ..please ! Justin Reese Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 7:30 pm · Reply I remember when Exxon/Mobil had their own NFC keychain fobs at the pump, where you bound it to a credit card and any of their pumps would accept it. Imagine using Apple Pay at the pump? No need to set foot into the store or use your card. iFan Thursday, September 1, 2016 - 10:19 am · Reply I don’t have to imagine that … BP and Meijer gas stations in SE Michigan allow me to do that now. JdinDMV Thursday, September 1, 2016 - 10:48 am · Reply ExxonMobil has an app right now that works great w Apple Pay. Use it all the time. Fantastic. yojimbo007 Thursday, September 1, 2016 - 2:00 pm · Reply i cant find the app that lets you pay…. can u give me the name or a link to the app? thanks pbiphoto Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - 8:56 pm · Reply I’ve started visiting major brand stores, making a small purchase, and asking if they take Apple Pay yet. When I’m told no I tell them of a competitor who does take Apple Pay, then tell them “I’ll check back in six months to see if you want my money. In the meantime I’ll keep spending my money in your competitor’s stores.” I usually ask for the manager and tell him/her the same thing. iFan Thursday, September 1, 2016 - 10:27 am · Reply Meijer in my town started accepting Apple Pay on day 1 that it was available – despite the fact that they were part of the CurrentC consortium. Since that day, I have used Meijer more and more, while using Target, Lowes and Walmart less and less. Rigged Thursday, September 1, 2016 - 2:29 pm · Reply Does Apple Pay you for your efforts? You deserve it! James Thursday, September 1, 2016 - 11:29 am · Reply I think the biggest problem is people don’t know it’s accepted. With so many new terminals and cards it is confusing trying to figure out if they accept it or not. Add to the complication that merchants can have terminals that show the tap and pay icon but they haven’t activated it and that makes it even more confusing. IMHO if a terminal has the tap and pay symbol it should have to be activated otherwise get a different terminal. Jeff Sunday, September 4, 2016 - 2:03 pm · Reply I have notice the opposite trend in Canada. When Apple Pay fist became available here it worked in a lot of the stores I frequent. In the last few weeks they have suddenly stopped. Stores like Costco were the first place I ever used tap on my bank card and also Apple Pay but now both have stopped working.

Lasta , CP Contributor Sep 4, 2016 | 9:02 AM x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Sony is back with a new smartphone called the Sony Xperia XZ. New Sony phones come faster than regular customers can keep up, and some are hopeful that the new device will make up for the company's previous let downs. Reuters/Beck DiefenbachApple CEO Tim Cook, seen above introducing the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, will be unveiling a new iPhone sometime next year that will feature an all-glass design. With the new Sony Xperia XZ recently getting some hands-on reviews, let's look at how it fares with the Apple iPhone 6S. Design Sony Xperia XZ's body is made of Alkaleido, a new aluminum alloy. While the Xperia X Performance and Xperia X are also aluminum-brushed, the alloy used in XZ is quite different. In fact, it is warmer than your regular metallic smart device and looks sleek. Similar to previous Sony smartphones, the Xperia XZ is a dull-shaped rectangle, but this time, curves are added on the smartphone's sides, making it easier to handle. Meanwhile, the Apple iPhone 6S is shaped like your typical iPhones; thin, small, and handling is trouble-free. Like Sony, the body of the iPhone 6S is aluminum; cool and feels nice to touch. The screen of the Xperia XZ is 5.2" full HD display, while that of the iPhone 6S is 4.7". Overall, the iPhone 6s seems to be easier to handle than the Xperia XZ, although both devices are really comfortable to hold. Fingerprint scanners are available on the Xperia XZ as well as on the iPhone 6s. The iPhone 6s has a convenient mute switch, and the side controls are easily accessible with the thumb and the index finger. With Sony's latest device, the location of the volume rocker can improve, but it's nice that the device has a 2-step camera shutter key. Display Sony Xperia XZ has a 1080 x 1920 pixel screen, while the iPhone 6s' smaller screen has 750 x 1334 pixels. That's a density of 424 pixels per inch for the Xperia XZ and 326 pixels per inch for the iPhone 6s. Sony wins the pixel comparison, but while some users say they notice the lack of detail in using Apple, others say the images are still sharp. The Xperia XZ runs with the Snapdragon 820 processor, 2900mAh battery plus fast charging, and a 3GB RAM with 32 giga bytes of storage. Camera Sony Xperia XZ has a remarkable 23 MP rear camera. The front camera is at 13 MP.Moreover, compared to previous Sony phones, this device has improved image stabilization, autofocus, exposure handling and dynamics. The iPhone 6 has a 12 MP camera, much less than the Xperia XZ, but still competitive against most competitors. Sony is also better in terms of the camera software, providing intricate manual mode and additional features. User Interface Sony's customized Android user interface is one of the cleanest among Android-run smartphones. Sony Xperia XZ's interface colors blend well with the exterior. The phone comes with pre-loaded PlayStation and Sony apps that you can remove anyway. Overall, it is your archetypal Sony experience and fans will appreciate the familiarity. The iPhone 6s uses the iOS 9 operating system, and is easier to use than the Xperia XZ interface. Of course, the Xperia XZ is still easy to use and is not as heavy as other Android-run smartphones.

Last week, European Commission anti-trust regulators ordered Apple to pay up to €13bn in taxes to the Irish Government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid. Mr Juncker, speaking on the sidelines of the G20 summit in China, said that the European Commission investigations on taxation have mainly targeted European companies. The decision comes amidst a co-ordinated global initiative to crack down on tax evasion by multinational companies, spearheaded by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The ruling against Apple has pushed the issue into the limelight and raised the risk of significant push-back from the US, analysts say, where some lawmakers are saying the result represents a European encroachment on the US potential tax base. Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has said he fully backs the Government's plan to appeal the Apple tax ruling. Speaking on RTÉ’s This Week, Mr Martin rejected claims the US multinational had a special deal in Ireland, saying the Revenue Commissioners carried out tax assessments with complete independence. Mr Martin said that appealing the ruling was essential "to protecting the foreign investment which is vital to Ireland's economy". The European Commission issued a statement this afternoon saying that it would not comment on speculation about what it is investigating. The statement added that it is investigating over 1,000 tax rulings in 23 member states. Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook last week described the ruling as "total political crap", but France and Germany have come out to back Brussels on the decision.

Likely to Unveil New Beats Products Alongside iPhone 7 Will Beats get some keynote time at Apple's product launch event on Wednesday? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Sep 4, 2016 at 10:35AM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual iPhone event is almost here. The company has an event scheduled on Wednesday where it is expected unveil its iPhone 7. While the iPhone will almost undoubtedly be the main focus of the event, the tech giant may give one of its newer brands some love, too. One rumor points to an unveiling of new Beats by Dre products. Beats headphones. Image source: Beats. Why new Beats headphones are likely Apple's plans to unveil new Beats products at the event were discovered by iGeneration (via MacRumors) in an email accidentally sent by Beats public relations team. After posting a screenshot of the email, iGeneration was quickly asked to remove it, reports MacRumors' Juli Clover. While the email didn't specify which Beats products would be unveiled at the event, they are likely to be headphones. Not only is Beats primarily a headphone company, but Apple has incentive to launch new headphones if rumors about the company ditching the headphone jack with iPhone 7 really are true. Speculation about Apple eliminating the headphone jack on iPhone 7 also suggests the company plans for headphones to connect either wirelessly or with the iPhone's Lightning connector. Since Apple owns Beats, Apple presumably plans to update its Beats headphones to work with a Lightning connector. Interestingly, however, if iGeneration is right about Apple planning to debut new Beats products at the event, any new headphones deserving of meaningful time during the company's keynote will likely include more than a simple change to the adapter. Perhaps new Beats headphones will feature a design overhaul. If Apple does overhaul its Beats headphones, the move could be the first major update for the headphone lineup since the tech giant acquired Beats in 2014. While Beats headphones have evolved during the past few years, the changes have arguably only been incremental. It's worth noting that if Apple does give its Beats headphones a major update, it could help the company demonstrate why eliminating the headphone jack makes sense. Apple wouldn't be the first company to highlight the advantages of Lightning-connected headsets; Cirrus Logic recently announced a headset development kit for Lightning-based audio accessories, arguing the technology enables high-fidelity audio and better interaction with iOS apps for custom audio experiences. Beats headphones. Image source: Beats. Of course, it's also possible that new Beats headphones will be mentioned during the keynote, but only briefly. With the limited information iGeneration received, this is definitely possible. And if this is the case, changes to the headphones may only be incremental. Does it matter? New Beats headphones might be more important than investors think -- at least in the near term. Sure, Beats products likely only represent a sliver of Apple's revenue; Beats products, along with Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPod, and Apple-branded and third-party accessories all fall under the company's "Other Products," segment, which account for just 5% of the company's revenue. But Apple's move to ditch the headphone jack could spark a surge in orders for new, compatible Beats headphones. Still, it would be nothing more than speculation to predict Beats headphones will become meaningful to the company's business. Chances are they will remain mostly unimportant to operating results. And even if there is a surge in Beats headphone sales after the launch of an iPhone 7, higher demand likely won't be sustainable, as other headphone makers will probably quickly make their own Lightning-based headphones. Ultimately, of course, where Apple needs to shine is the iPhone itself. At about 64% of the company's revenue in the trailing 12 months, it's the primary driver of the company's business.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Korean Press Reports the Exploding Note 7 is a Severe Blow to Samsung that could help the iPhone 7 | Main | Samsung's Battery Woes now Creating a Contagion Effect on their Supply Chain » September 04, 2016 Developing Ultrathin Flexible Circuit Boards will Support Apple's More Radical iPhone Form Factors The 2017 anniversary iPhone has been rumored to include a glass embodiment with curved edges. Patently Apple posted a report late last month titled "The Joke of the Week: Apple is going to Copy Samsung's Edge Smartphone Design," wherein we covered some of Apple's long standing patents regarding displays with curved edges along with more radical designs to clearly illustrate that Apple would never be copying Samsung's design as the press was playing up for a week, but rather Apple fulfilling their own inventions that were published by the U.S. Patent Office before any Samsung Edge patent was on record. Of course the question that remains is how far will Apple be able to go with their anniversary iPhone form factor design? Will it be an evolutionary or revolutionary shift in design?   An iPhone with curved edges as illustrated below, is a patent figure from Apple's 2011 granted patent. This is doable 100% as Apple is using Samsung's flexible OLED displays that we know could produce this design eyes closed.     And then there are more radical Apple device form factor patents on record as those noted below.   As noted in the bottom figure above, the key factor to any radical iOS device embodiment with a curved display, be it an iPhone, Apple Watch or other, will be using a flexible circuit board.   This weekend, the Wall Street Journal reports that ultrathin flexible circuit boards are around the corner and that products such as thin solar cells, computer displays using OLED and others will generate $26 billion by 2020 from 8.6 billion in 2016. .     The WSJ's report begins by noting that "Silicon Valley is rethinking one of its least glamorous and most ubiquitous building blocks, the circuit board, in a bet that flexible, form-fitting alternatives could reshape electronics and spur more manufacturing in the U.S.   Researchers now are looking to replace the circuit boards on which chips are placed, using techniques they call flexible hybrid manufacturing. Techniques include wiring semiconductors together on flexible surfaces, creating products that are more versatile than existing circuit boards."   Mr. Thompson, executive director of manufacturing consortium NextFlex stated for the report that "One key development has been techniques devised by companies such as American Semiconductor Inc. and Uniqarta Inc. to make thinner silicon wafers for chip production. In some cases, the resulting chips can be rolled up like a piece of paper."   Flexible hybrid manufacturing could offer more opportunities for such work, some industry executives say, as companies devise new gadgets that must be introduced quickly and evolve rapidly.   Some executives hope U.S. companies develop proprietary know-how to make flexible circuitry, which could make it harder for foreign factories to produce the same products. 'You don't want to share it,' said Daniel Gamota, vice president of Jabil's hardware innovation group.   That certainly sounds like something right up Apple's alley. Though as much as I'd love nothing more than seeing Apple be the first smartphone vendor to bring this to market behind a cool new iPhone form factor with a curved flexible display for 2017, I think I'd be going over the edge of realistic possibilities.   Yet at the end of the day, one of Apple's patent figures noted above makes it very clear that they're working on devices that require flexible circuit boards in order to deliver extreme new form factors in the future. Will these radical form factors begin rolling out some time after 2020 or as early as 2017?   Either way, Apple is working on it and the technology behind next-gen flexible circuit boards is well underway. So it's not a pipedream, it's a coming reality.

Sep 4th 2016, 3:44 PM 15,677 Views 121 Comments Share487 Tweet Email4 Martin says Ireland's tax policies over the past 30 years have been successful. Image: Leah Farrell/RollingNews.ie FIANNA FÁIL LEADER Micheál Martin has said that his party will support the government in its appeal of the Apple tax decision. The European Commission ruled on Tuesday that Apple owed the Irish exchequer at least €13 billion in back taxes after it found that Ireland had provided illegal State aid to Apple. The government confirmed on Friday that it will be appealing the decision on the basis that it rejects the commission’s findings. Speaking this afternoon on RTÉ’s This Week programme, Martin said that his party also favours an appeal, calling it “essential”. “We believe an appeal is essential. Consistently, we have been supporting our industrial strategy over the last 30 odd years, we led that in terms of attracting thousands of jobs in opening Ireland up and bringing foreign direct investment in,” Martin said, adding that this strategy has been “successful”. I think it is very important that there is certainly around Irish policy and Irish tax policy. I think it’s important that the independence of the Revenue Commissioners is upheld. Martin flatly rejected the commission’s findings, saying that Irish governments have never given Apple a “special deal”. “I take issue with the terminology and the language used by the commission in terms of the Irish government has done a special deal with a company,” Martin said. “Irish Revenue Commissioners are independent of government. They make tax rulings and I believe they made an honest tax ruling in relation to this in 1991.” Martin also argued that the way in which Apple has developed since 1991, when it’s profits have gone “stratospheric”, has contributed to the issue at hand. “The idea the Irish revenue should be a collector general for Apple’s revenues worldwide is a flawed one,” he said. Martin also confirmed that, while his party is supportive of an appeal, his party would not be contributing to the wording of any such appeal by the minority Fine Gael-led government. “The decision to appeal is an executive one and I’m very clear on the demarcation of the line between the government and the Dáil in that respect,” he said.

X Seen & Heard: Apple story steals the newspaper headlines Arts to benefit as lord mayor proposes 1% levy on hotel bookings, reports ‘Sunday Times’ Sun, Sep 4, 2016, 16:43 Lord Mayor of Dublin Brendan Carr: plans a 1 per cent hotel levy on hotel rooms. It could could deliver up to €3 million a year for the arts, the Sunday Times reports. Photograph Sam Barnes         Apple remains the focus for the business pages with all the Irish Sunday broadsheets leading on the story. The Sunday Business Post follows up The Irish Times story about the EU Commission looking at the tax arrangement of a number of other multinational companies in Ireland, while in the Sunday Times IDA Ireland chief executive Martin Shanahan says the EU ruling is as bad for Ireland as our bailout during the financial crisis or the Brexit vote. The Sunday Independent carries a second instalment of its interview with Apple chief executive Tim Cook. ******************* Dublin’s lord mayor, Brendan Carr, plans a 1 per cent hotel levy to fund arts initiatives in the capital, the Sunday Times reports. The levy along the lines of similar charges operating in many European markets, could deliver up to €3 million a year, the paper reports. ****************************** Merger and acquisition activity in the Irish market is “significantly down” on last year and likely to remain so for the rest of the year, according to the Sunday Independent, quoting IBI Corporate Finance chief executive Tom Godfrey who blames the Brexit vote in the UK and the uncertainty it creates around Britain’s future relationship with the EU. ************************** The takeover of Dealz parent Poundland is on a knife-edge, the Sunday Telegraph writes, with US hedge fund Elliott Management having built up a stake of close to 25 per cent in the British business. Elliott has already forced bidder Steinhoff to raise its bid once. Steinhoff cannot raise the price again, according to the paper. ************************** An investment partnership comprising some of the biggest names in Irish business – Ardagh’s Paul Coulson, developer Bernard McNamara and Paddy Power Betfair chairman and former Anglo Irish Bank non-executive director Gary McGann – is talking to the NTMA about recovering close to $500,000 from the IBRC under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, according to the Sunday Independent.

Photograph: Eric Vidal/Reuters         The European Commission may open a fresh investigation into tax rulings offered by Luxembourg as early as this week, as EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager continues her clampdown against corporate tax avoidance. Luxembourg is already awaiting a final decision on the EU state aid investigation against Amazon following an almost two-year investigation. A separate probe into McDonald’s tax dealings with the duchy was launched in 2015. However, it is understood that a new investigation could be opened in the coming week by the EU’s competition arm. A European Commission spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Last December, the European Commission found Luxembourg had illegally offered state aid tax treatment to Fiat, ordering the government to recoup up to €30 million from the company. A similar order was made to the Netherlands over Starbucks. Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks John McManus: Apple’s adventures in tax wonderland Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules The relatively small numbers involved in both rulings had led some analysts to believe a similarly low figure would be reached in the commission’s investigation of Apple’s tax dealings with Ireland. But while the two previous rulings focused on the methodology used to calculate transfer-pricing arrangements underpinning the deals, the Apple ruling focused on the internal arrangements within two Apple subsidiaries registered in Ireland. Some Brussels-based commentators believe Ms Vestager will be keen to announce a clampdown on an EU rather than US company, in a bid to soothe concerns in Washington that Brussels is unfairly targeting US multinationals. Ms Vestager is due to meet US treasury secretary Jack Lew in Washington later this month. The US administration has accused Brussels of protectionism in its targeting of the tax arrangements of US companies in Europe. Tax practices Luxembourg’s role at the centre of alleged unfair tax practices is politically sensitive for the European Commission given that Jean-Claude Juncker was prime minister when many of the alleged sweetheart deals were negotiated. Within weeks of the former head of the eurogroup’s appointment as European Commission president in late 2014, the Luxembourg Leaks scandal broke, revealing how the Luxembourg authorities had helped hundreds of companies slash their tax bill. The revelations galvanised Mr Juncker’s willingness to prioritise tax avoidance as a key policy focus during his five-year tenure. The former Luxembourg prime minister stressed, on appointment as successor to José Manuel Barroso at the helm of the EU’s executive arm, that the European Commission would be “more political” than previous administrations. ADVERTISEMENT Ms Vestager has refuted allegations that the finding by the commission’s competition division against Apple was political, arguing that state aid law applies to tax as well as other forms of state aid. Brussels’s order that Ireland recoup up to €13 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes over a 10-year period marks by far the biggest judgment made by the European Commission related to state aid. The previous record was €1.3 billion in 2014. In his first public comments since the Apple announcement, Mr Juncker said in China that the “landmark ruling” was made “without discrimination and without bias”. “This is the result of intensive work which has been going on for many years,” he said. “Our rules on state aid have always been clear: national authorities cannot give tax benefits to some companies and not to others. This is the level playing field that the commission is always working to defend. We apply these rules without discrimination and without bias.”       Topics: Jack Lew Jean Claude Juncker Jose Manuel Barroso Margrethe Vestager Amazon Apple Fiat McDonald's Starbucks Read More Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Cliff Taylor: Battle lines drawn in State’s EU Apple appeal Court ruling on Spanish tax may give clues to Apple appeal Meet ‘the Maxforce’ – the EU team that fined Ireland €13bn over Apple Apple CEO invited to attend tax ruling hearing in Dublin EU Court asks Government to tweak its Apple tax appeal European Commission refuses to comment on Noonan claims Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Why Ryanair is offering package holidays now Work Millennials start new year with old-school paper diaries and pens English Soccer Jermain Defoe double leaves Liverpool frustrated Irish Times After 2016, economic forecasting for 2017 has got to be perilous Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

Likely to Unveil New Beats Products Alongside iPhone 7 Will Beats get some keynote time at Apple's product launch event on Wednesday? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Sep 4, 2016 at 10:35AM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual iPhone event is almost here. The company has an event scheduled on Wednesday where it is expected unveil its iPhone 7. While the iPhone will almost undoubtedly be the main focus of the event, the tech giant may give one of its newer brands some love, too. One rumor points to an unveiling of new Beats by Dre products. Beats headphones. Image source: Beats. Why new Beats headphones are likely Apple's plans to unveil new Beats products at the event were discovered by iGeneration (via MacRumors) in an email accidentally sent by Beats public relations team. After posting a screenshot of the email, iGeneration was quickly asked to remove it, reports MacRumors' Juli Clover. While the email didn't specify which Beats products would be unveiled at the event, they are likely to be headphones. Not only is Beats primarily a headphone company, but Apple has incentive to launch new headphones if rumors about the company ditching the headphone jack with iPhone 7 really are true. Speculation about Apple eliminating the headphone jack on iPhone 7 also suggests the company plans for headphones to connect either wirelessly or with the iPhone's Lightning connector. Since Apple owns Beats, Apple presumably plans to update its Beats headphones to work with a Lightning connector. Interestingly, however, if iGeneration is right about Apple planning to debut new Beats products at the event, any new headphones deserving of meaningful time during the company's keynote will likely include more than a simple change to the adapter. Perhaps new Beats headphones will feature a design overhaul. If Apple does overhaul its Beats headphones, the move could be the first major update for the headphone lineup since the tech giant acquired Beats in 2014. While Beats headphones have evolved during the past few years, the changes have arguably only been incremental. It's worth noting that if Apple does give its Beats headphones a major update, it could help the company demonstrate why eliminating the headphone jack makes sense. Apple wouldn't be the first company to highlight the advantages of Lightning-connected headsets; Cirrus Logic recently announced a headset development kit for Lightning-based audio accessories, arguing the technology enables high-fidelity audio and better interaction with iOS apps for custom audio experiences. Beats headphones. Image source: Beats. Of course, it's also possible that new Beats headphones will be mentioned during the keynote, but only briefly. With the limited information iGeneration received, this is definitely possible. And if this is the case, changes to the headphones may only be incremental. Does it matter? New Beats headphones might be more important than investors think -- at least in the near term. Sure, Beats products likely only represent a sliver of Apple's revenue; Beats products, along with Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPod, and Apple-branded and third-party accessories all fall under the company's "Other Products," segment, which account for just 5% of the company's revenue. But Apple's move to ditch the headphone jack could spark a surge in orders for new, compatible Beats headphones. Still, it would be nothing more than speculation to predict Beats headphones will become meaningful to the company's business. Chances are they will remain mostly unimportant to operating results. And even if there is a surge in Beats headphone sales after the launch of an iPhone 7, higher demand likely won't be sustainable, as other headphone makers will probably quickly make their own Lightning-based headphones. Ultimately, of course, where Apple needs to shine is the iPhone itself. At about 64% of the company's revenue in the trailing 12 months, it's the primary driver of the company's business.

However, this move is for a good cause, since this could prevent overheating and power consumption issues.  When it comes to the camera systems of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, the former will sport a standard version of the back camera found in its predecessor, while the latter is rumored to rock a dual-lens camera module that will possibly make the larger variant cost more than the 6s Plus when the latter debuted. The lenses of the module are said to be 12-megapixel, and one will cater to the wide-camera angle technology the device will offer.  In relation to the camera systems of the new iPhones, Kuo revealed that their rear camera flash could be upgraded with four LEDs and the possible addition of a new ambient light sensor. These upgrades would enable users to capture superb quality images.  In terms of the enhancements to their bodies, MacRumors has learned that Apple has enhanced the devices’ form factor by improving their IPX7 water resistance property. Now, users will not have to worry about accidentally dipping their handsets in water or accidentally spilling liquids on them. Another new feature that the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will be sporting is the new audio amplifier that has been added to the handsets in lieu of putting a second speaker at the bottom now that the 3.5mm headphone jack is gone, as per a recent Apple Insider report. Other upgrades fans can expect to see when the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus make their official debut include the wide color displays that are inspired by the wide color technology of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a more pressure-sensitive Home button and improved proximity sensors.  Kuo’s revelations come a day after Apple Insider reported about leaked images of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus packaging that appear to confirm the rumored 256GB storage variant and the inclusion of bundled wireless earphones, called AirPods.  Meanwhile, a simple mistake by the Apple PR team has outed the inclusion of Beats by Dre headphones for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to the slew of new products the Cupertino giant is going to showcase during its Sept. 7 event.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

In those two weeks we’ve seen a number of new details emerge (including two new iOS 9 updates) and today we want to recap and take a look at the most important things we’ve learned about the iPhone 5 iOS 9 release. Advertisement In June, Apple confirmed plans to release yet another iOS update for its aging former flagship from 2012. The iPhone 5, a device that started with iOS 6 on board, would be getting the iOS 9 update that Apple had planned for the fall. In mid-September, Apple made good on its promise and released the iPhone 5 iOS 9 update. And while the iPhone 5 isn’t the spring chicken that it once was, Apple managed to pack a ton of features and enhancements into the device’s upgrade. Two weeks ago, we downloaded and installed the iPhone 5 iOS 9.0 update. A week ago, we installed the iOS 9.0.1 update. And yesterday, we installed Apple’s brand new iPhone 5 iOS 9.0.2 update. Yes, we’ve seen seen three iOS 9 updates roll out in three weeks. That list doesn’t include the new iOS 9.1 beta for iPhone 5. We’ve been taking a close look at the iPhone 5 iOS 9 update and today we want to tell you about a few things that we’ve learned about the current state of the update and the iPhone 5 iOS 9 update’s future. Keep these in mind as we push ahead towards the iPhone 5’s iOS 9.1 release. iPhone 5 iOS 9 Performance: Mostly Good 1 / 10 We've used all three iOS 9 updates on the iPhone 5 and thus far, we've mostly had a good experience with Apple's brand new software. However, there is one issue that's been plaguing our device and we're concerned that it might not go away without a factory reset.  The good: The iPhone 5 iOS 9 update is holding up well in key areas like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and app performance. We haven't run into any major bugs though the device continues to struggle in one very important area.  Advertisement The bad: The UI feels sluggish and jerky. We can't even open a folder without experiencing a little stutter. The same thing happens when we swipe to the right to open up Spotlight Search. It lags.  This is an issue that we've been dealing with since the release of iOS 8.1 and that's why we're convinced that it's not going to go away without a factory reset of the device.  For now, iOS 9's features and performance and other areas make the software tolerable on the iPhone 5 and we're hopeful that the iOS 9.1 update helps dislodge these speed issues. We'll see.  1 / 10 26 Responses 10/01/2015 Ochonu Reply 9.01 or 9.02 doesn’t install it just hangs for days on verifying or installing. I have to do a soft reset before I can use my phone 10/01/2015 Ochonu Reply Sorry I mean iPad air the latest version hangs it cannot install 9.01 or 9.02 10/02/2015 Trisha Reply Can we return the unit? I recently bought iphone 6plus and updated it to ios9.01 and now no facebook kept on hanging wife problems? Please help 10/02/2015 Igwota Reply Jackross reply is inappropriate. It is an advertisement rather than a solution to iPad/iPhone problem we are having! I suggest that it is unhelpful and should be deleted by the moderator of this site 10/05/2015 marivic Reply i updated to 9.02, now i can not download my emails 10/06/2015 Maik Reply what i cannot understand is that Apple does bot find the reason for the vpn-problems which are making receiving emails from my company’s Exchange server impossible. 10/06/2015 Nishant Reply Should i update my i5 to ios9..?? i’m afraid that my device will be slow down after upgrading the IOS.. 10/07/2015 Alan Reply Every update to correct bugs brings new problems. Why? 10/07/2015 Allysan Reply Even after the upgrade to 9.0.2 my alarms freeze my phone. I am having to do a hard reset on my phone at least twice a day. Any idea how to fix this??!! 10/09/2015 Jogi Reply My gamecenter doesnt work..have iPhone 6s. More people got this problem? 10/10/2015 LilBit Reply I have iPhone fives S version 9.0.2, my phone is freezing up constantly, I can’t type more than two or three words and it text without it freezing. It is freezing on my home screen on my lock screen. MyTouch function has become more difficult to use. My correct word voice is very sluggish and sounds drunk. Phone is lagging very badly, I’m even having problems loading this message. Have tried three times to submit hasn’t worked yet. I am very disappointed in Apple, I just wish I could take this back to the original settings. I would like an answer directly from Apple. 10/12/2015 Charles Reply Since updating my iPhone 5C with 9.0.2, I have a ton of photos 493 (of which most were previously deleted) and 104 videos (which most were deleted) too. I think apple downloaded all photos from the Cloud onto my phone. Very frustrating as I have to now go in and individually delete most of them. The new 9.0.2 also added the following folders: Music, Wallet and Find Friends. They seem mostly useless with not much “value add”. 10/13/2015 Mick Reply Since updating to 9.02 on my iPhone 5 my contacts show ALL email addresses I’ve ever used along with contacts. Even when I select contacts only from the group menu, it doesn’t save this setting when you close the window. Most annoying. 10/14/2015 L Biely Reply The iOS9.2 update has been disasterous for my beloved iPad mini as the Game Center presents a blank white page, response time is slow, apps freeze and it is difficult to remove an app. With that said I would like to know why this happened and what/ when is Apple going to do to fix this disasterous update that has left me with a level of frustration and a dislike for this iPad and rethinking the use of Apple products. Help… 10/15/2015 Tram Reply I am unable to use phone application in my iphone 5s after upgrading to IOS 9.0.2. Having tried to itune, restarted, reset network setting, but phone app is still not working. Help please 10/15/2015 Rick Reply have an I phone 5S and updated to 9.0.2. Now my phone is calling people without my knowledge and not even showing as an outgoing call. People are calling me back asking why I called and I have no answer. Also my text message entry point looks like a Calculator with zeros and a decimal point. It doesn’t let me type anything. The Bluetooth in my truck started to ignore the phone and not recognize it until I restart my phone. Sometimes I do this to her three times a day. What in the hell is going on? 10/17/2015 Rebecca Reply I have the IPhone 5 version 9.0.2, and noticed that after this update: 1. While using my regular Jabra headset (with play/pause feature on the microphone cable included) to playback an audiobook on Overdrive app, music from my Music library would come on automatically when I pressed the pause button, and my Up Next feature would fill up with the rest of the album, and I could not return to my Overdrive audiobook. Plus, my Overdrive app would stop at the end of each section or part without any prompting from me. (It used to be that, unless I paused it, the sections flowed from one end to the beginning of another.) Fiddled with clearing my Up Next feature in my Music app . This did not fix anything. Finally, I moved my Music app icon to the very final page of my phone, it is sitting on that page all by itself, and my headset is working with my iPhone properly now. 2. As for the battery life, I have started using the low power mode that came with this update and was pleasantly surprised with how well it has actually worked. The only drawback from my perspective (slight though it may be, and not a “deal breaker”): the unit returns to “normal” power mode automatically after it senses that it has been charged enough (I believe this was created so the unit can refresh apps). Wish I could keep it on “low” power mode… So, I’ve been re-setting it. (I can certainly choose the “normal” setting if I wanted to refresh my apps.) The low power mode actually helps me in my daily use. Please note that my knowledge of the above items come from being an iPhone user only, don’t really know why moving the Music app worked for the first issue… But it did, so I hope it works for others. Good luck! 10/17/2015 Ana B. Reply For me one if the worst parts is the email search function. It’s almost useless. Can’t go back to the search results and only searches people and subject, not message content. Terrible! 10/19/2015 Dara Barrett Reply Every time I try to look at a link via FB or Trip advisor, for example, I get kicked back to my thumbnail page…so frustrating..totally regretting doing any 9.0 updates! Don’t do them!!!! 10/20/2015 Wendy Reply Since the upgrade I cannot retrieve my emails on either my iPhone5 or iPad. Additionally, it’s not updating my Facebook feed. Thoroughly fed up with it. Any idea how long it’ll be before we get a fix? 10/20/2015 Sam Reply so I have an Iphone 5s and since the new upgrade, I CANT LOAD ANYTHING!!! Facebook, games, safari, etc. The only three things that work are my already purchased music, my messages app, and my calls app. I CANT EVEN CHECK FOR UPDATES!!!! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!!! 10/26/2015 M. Taylor Reply With iOS 9.02 I lost SAFARI and BOTH cameras! I just wasted another 15 min. reading a page and a half of little more than “9.02 is broke”. I’m moving on to a page with information. 12/08/2015 John Michaels Reply Like many others, I am finding double, triple, or quadruple battery drainage, especially with Safari and email, and also legs and delays in responsiveness . The interesting thing is – the symptoms started about a week ago when I was still on iOS 7. I upgraded to iOS 9 in hopes of improving battery life and general responsiveness, but nothing doing, if anything it is worse. Many have posited that it is a worm constantly seeking other victims, which would make sense given that the massive battery drain only happens when working on the Internet. More interestingly, mail eats up more batteries then YouTube. Have tried all of the usual fixes, turning off all background refresh, location services, etc. A new insights or suggestions on this weirdness would be greatly appreciated. 12/28/2015 Bubbles Reply My iPhone 5c keeps freezing ever since i got the update. I answered a phone call and the notification panel slid down in the middle of the call, then it jammed and wont slide up. i cant even unlock or turn off my phone because the touch options wont allow me to do anything beyond the stuck notification panel’s. Please help? 03/24/2016 Binish Reply Should I need to update my iPhone 5c to iOS 9 ??? Confused 09/04/2016 John Reply I can’t actually get the update on ios 9 my phone’s version remains to as ios 8.4 it is so annoying that I can’t update it. What do you think might the problem on my phone? Please help Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Apple includes a new version of Touch ID on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus that performs better, but there are still problems. Most users know that it can unlock the iPhone or iPad with a touch, but it can also let users log in to apps like Amazon, LastPass and others. Touch ID also connects to the App Store to let users pay for apps with a fingerprint as well. Many apps also let users log in with Touch ID, and it is useful for buying things with Apple Pay. Here’s how to fix Touch ID problems. When Touch ID works perfectly you can unlock the iPhone, buy something on Amazon and then make a purchase in the App Store without entering a passcode or a password. Unfortunately sometimes Touch ID doesn’t work due to a variety of Touch ID problems and issues. If your Touch ID Problems start right after updating iOS 9 to another version, like iOS 9.3.2, you may need to downgrade while you have a chance or deal with the problem until another upgrade arrives. We’ve seen some iOS updates degrade performance, and the next one fix them. Throughout 2016 we’ve already seen several new iOS updates deliver fixes and features. Although it may seem like a Touch ID problem, there is a reason that your iPhone asks for your passcode more frequently on recent updates. Apple outlines a requirement that we’ve run into a few times. If you don’t use your passcode for six days and the Touch ID has not unlocked the phone for eight hours, you will need to enter a passcode. That is Apple’s rule, and it is set for your security. Advertisement With a few minutes you can fix most Touch ID problems on your own. Here’s how to fix Touch ID not working on iPhone and iPad; Retrain Touch ID with your fingerprints. Turn Touch ID off and back on. Clean the Touch ID sensor. Check to see if Touch ID is broken. Dry your finger and Touch ID sensor. This is how you can fix most Touch ID problems on the iPhone 5s or newer and the iPad mini 3, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro or iPad Air 2. How to Fix Touch ID Failures The easiest way to fix Touch ID failures is to re-train the iPhone with your fingerprints. Over the last year the iOS software updates delivered improved performance that fixed Touch ID “forgetting” fingerprints and there are general improvements to Touch ID performance on iOS 8 and higher. This can also help if your fingerprint changed slightly in the last several months due to wear, dry skin and more. Unlock the iPhone or iPad and re-train Touch ID to fix most Touch ID failures. Before you do this make sure you remove any dirt or sweat from the Touch ID sensor and wipe any oil or sweat from your hands. Advertisement Go to Settings -> Touch ID & Passcode -> Enter your Passcode. On the next screen swipe from right to left on each fingerprint to delete them. When this is complete you can tap on Add a Fingerprint… to re-train Touch ID. The video above shows how to set up Touch ID, which is all you need to do to fix many Touch ID problems How to Fix Touch ID Not Working in App Store Another common Touch ID problem is when you cannot use it in the App Store. Sometimes this is related to to the need to re-train Touch ID, but other times it is a software issue. Some users on older versions of iOS reported that Touch ID no longer showed up on the App Store. This should fix that Touch ID problem and most other App Store Touch ID issues. Fix Touch ID not working in the App Store. Go to Settings -> Touch ID & Passcode -> Enter your Passcode. Then turn off iTunes & App Store. Reboot your iPhone or iPad. Go back to Touch ID & Passcode in Settings and turn iTunes & App Store back on. This should solve the bug that stopped Touch ID from working in the App Store. Keep in mind you still must enter a Passcode after 24 hours of no purchases. How to Fix Touch ID Not Working at All There is an off-chance that your Touch ID sensor will break. Although rare in this instance nothing you do will work and you will not be able to train Touch ID. If this is the case you can try a hard reset to completely wipe your iPhone and set it up like new. This may resolve the problem, but if it does not you will need to visit an Apple Store or send the iPhone in for repair. How to Fix Touch ID Problems In Cold or Winter When it is cold out or during winter there is an increase in Touch ID problems. The cold weather wears your hands greatly and it can often change the print just enough to make Touch ID stop working. Retrain Touch ID for cold weather. It is a good idea to re-train Touch ID on the iPhone or iPad with your winter-worn hands. If you are not using all the available fingerprint options, you can also just add a new fingerprint when your hands are cold. This may solve the problem partially. Unfortunately this may continue to be a problem during cold weather even if you re-train. How to Fix Touch ID Problems When Wet or Dirty If your fingers or the Touch ID sensor is dirty or wet it will likely fail. This is due to water, dirt or prune-like fingers preventing a good scan. If it is just water or dirt on the sensor or your finger you should wipe both of them off with a clean cloth. This will not help if your fingers are wrinkled by too much time in the water. The new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus Touch ID sensor works better in wet situations, but it is not perfect if there is a lot of moisture. 23 Best iPhone 6s Cases Speck CandyShell Clear iPhone 6s Case 1 / 23 The Speck CandyShell Clear is the first clear iPhone 6s case from Speck, and the first clear case from the company overall.

My iPAD air 2 is WIFI only and is off air for many hours at a time between uses. Every time, like clockwork, I am required to enter my passcode after such a long event of being offline so long. The fingerprint does NOTHING, not even types in my passcode automatically. After I use my passcode, I can let it sleep many many times over days so long as it has WIFI in between and the fingerprint always works to unlock my iPad. Its extremely frustrating to be on the commuter train with only one hand available and my touch fingerprint doesnt even try to work since my iPad was offline between uses. I have trained the touch ID with 4 fingers at all angles, so I know its not the reader. It seems more like policy designed to require the passcode when its disconnected from the internet longer than a certain period. Really dumb policy if thats true. 04/06/2016 Ficklenerd Reply Correction: As it turns out, my Ipad 2 Air does produce an excuse for requiring the code instead of accepting the fingerprint. After its been sleeping for a while, the access code excuse is “TouchID requires the access code upon booting up from a shutdown”. So, Apple decided that sleeping, even while plugged into the charger, is considered a shutdown and must therefore deprive me of using my Touch ID fingerprint and having to type the access code in again? How exactly does this protect my privacy or provide convenience? Still a dumb policy. I bet Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave. 04/08/2016 carole Reply I don’t recall being asked to create a passcode when I ilitialized my TouchID thumb print … how can I create one when the phone keeps deactivating ????

Following forum advice, i turned off the function and completed a soft reset. Now when i go back into touch id it goes to the screen asking me to set up and then within a second it switches to a screen telling me that it has failed and is unable to compete touch id and i should try again later. Between it working and not working i’ve done nothing different with my phone. The only change is the update. Any help? 07/16/2016 Prashanth Reply Emma, even I am facing the same problem as you after upgrade to 9.3.2 really crazy how this upgrades kill our phones. Now after touch id stopped working on my iPhone 6 even that home button failed to work. Leh me know if anyone have any solution for the above issue. 07/26/2016 Erika Reply I sent My iPhone 6s for service, i had a broken screen. One week ago I picked up à new exchange unit (probably no Idea to fix my broken one). The problem is my touch id stopped working today. It doesen’t work at all… I paid 300 dollars to repair my phone and now this exchange unit stopped working. So angry and disapointed at Apple. Some ideas what could be wrong? 09/29/2016 LouF Reply I’ve noticed that a programming scan does not work if the phone is charging. I thought I couldn’t get through adding/rescanning a print after doing tile grout work, but after unpluging the Lightning cable the read worked fine. The first time. There were at least five failed tries. I sometimes also get an erratic touch screen/display (jumps ALL around). This just happened again while leaving this comment. I unplugged the cable, and it stopped. I find many times I spend more time futzing with this TouchID trying to unlock the phone than not. I’ll give it a little more time, but it’s on the verge of the being disabled as with I’ve done with almost all of the new features Apple adds. How about an “undo” in Notes. 10/09/2016 VENKI Reply how to downgrade ios 10.0.2 to 9.3.5 for iphone 5s 11/18/2016 Draco Reply Factory reset gave a message that the phone was incompatible with touch id, even though it used to work. The problems are mechanical, like the touch screen ones that Apple is now charging users to fix, claiming it is user error. 12/01/2016 Pissed Reply So your solution to fix the Touch ID problem is to reset you finger print again and again??? So you are saying that this fixes the problem??? If i Go to Settings -> Touch ID & Passcode -> Enter your Pass code. On the next screen swipe from right to left on each fingerprint to delete them. When this is complete you can tap on Add a Fingerprint… to re-train Touch ID. This is workaround not a fix, it does not fix anything, if the problem occurs every day, twice a day??? Back in in my day, when we say things like you article states “How to Fix Touch ID Failures” it fixed the problem. It seems that now a days we settle for temporary solutions to problems especially in the computer industry (software and hardware problems) and we are being trained to accept this as a standard, well we sell this feature but it kind of works, but it does not oh well, what ever happened to accountability – Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

You can fix a frozen iPhone in 10 seconds without a computer or any other accessories so that you can get back with your day. You can also use this to fix a frozen iPad. Advertisement Sometimes a frozen iPhone will not let you do any type of activity, and often you are stuck on-screen in an app or on a home screen. This can also help if your iPhone is stuck off and won’t turn on, but mainly you will use this when the iPhone is stuck on with an app or something on-screen. This is a hard-reboot, but some people will call it a hard-reset. Don’t worry about the reset part of this name. You are not resetting the iPhone like you would with a factory reset that wipes all the data clean. Fix your frozen iPhone in seconds. This may not solve all of your problems. If the iPhone freezes regularly you may need to remove an app or perform an actual factory reset on your iPhone and start from scratch. It’s normal for an iPhone to freeze once or twice in a year after you install a bad app or run into a problem. If things continue to freeze or go bad, there may be a hardware problem that requires a trip to an Apple Store. Fix a Frozen iPhone in 10 Seconds You can fix a frozen iPhone in about ten seconds by pressing and holding the power and home button at the same time until the iPhone restarts. Once the iPhone screen changes from the frozen state to showing an Apple logo or just a blank screen you can let go. Advertisement This is a hard reboot. By pressing and holding the home button and power button you force the iPhone to restart. This is similar to holding the power button on a Macbook or laptop or just unplugging a device from power. You’ll see this screen when you fix a frozen iPhone. You don’t need to hold the power buttons after the phone restarts. You should not lose any data doing this, but if you were typing a message, document or working on something inside of an app you may lose that small bit of work depending on when it saved. You don’t need to be plugged in to power or connected to a computer to use this method of fixing a frozen iPhone. If the battery is low, it may help to plug-in to power, but otherwise you are good to do this anytime the iPhone is frozen. Advertisement This works on any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on any version of Apple’s software including iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9 and the upcoming iOS 10. Read: iOS 9 Tips and Tricks For users who consistently have this problem, it may be good to uninstall a problem app or make sure it is up to date. If you never restart your iPhone or iPad and you have this happen once or twice a year you can often avoid it by restarting you iPhone once every other week. If this is a continual problem you should consider backing up the iPhone to iCloud or your computer and then performing a factory reset. This takes longer to complete, but it can resolve problems. If you choose to to restore from an iPhone backup and the problem continues you may need to hard reset the iPhone and then set it up as a new device.

Take our quiz! Photos of the Day Our best photos of the year 2016 P-l-e-a-s-e. These are taxes America should have required Apple to pay to the U.S. Treasury. But we didn’t – because of Ryan, Schumer, Hatch, Wyden, and other inhabitants of Capitol Hill haven’t been able to agree on how to close the loophole that has allowed Apple, and many other global American corporations, to avoid paying the corporate income taxes they owe. Let’s be clear. The products Apple sells abroad are designed and developed in the United States. So the foreign royalties Apple collects on them logically should be treated as corporate income to Apple here in America. But Apple and other Big Tech corporations like Google and Amazon – along with much of Big Pharma, and even Starbucks – have avoided paying hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on their worldwide earnings because they don’t really sell things like cars or refrigerators or television sets that they make here and ship abroad.   Their major assets are designs, software, and patented ideas.  Although most of this intellectual capital originates here, it can be transferred instantly around the world – finding its way into a vast array of products and services abroad.  Intellectual capital is hard to see, measure, value, and track. So it’s a perfect vehicle for tax avoidance.   Apple transfers its intellectual capital to an Apple subsidiary in Ireland, which then “sells” Apple products all over Europe. And it keeps most of the money there. Ireland has been more than happy to oblige by imposing on Apple a tax rate that’s laughably low – 0.005 percent in 2014, for example. Apple is America’s most profitable high-tech company and also one of America’s biggest tax cheats. It maintains a worldwide network of tax havens to park its global profits, some of which don’t even have any employees. Sitting atop this network is “Apple Operations International,” incorporated in Ireland. Never mind that Apple Operations International keeps its bank accounts and records in the United States and holds board meetings in California. It’s still considered Irish. And its main job is allocating Apple’s earnings among its international subsidiaries in order to keep taxes as low as possible. As a result, over last decade alone Apple has amassed a stunning $231.5 billion cash pile abroad, subjected to little or no taxes.   This hasn’t stopped Apple from richly rewarding its American shareholders with fat dividends and stock buybacks that raise share prices. But rather than use its overseas cash to fund these, Apple has taken on billions of dollars of additional debt.   It’s a scam, at the expense of American taxpayers. Add in the worldwide sales of America’s Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Franchise operations, and the scam is sizeable. Over 2 trillion dollars of U.S. corporate profits are now parked abroad – all of it escaping the U.S. corporate income tax. To make up the difference, you and I and millions of other Americans have to pay more in income taxes and payroll taxes to finance the U.S. government. Why can’t this loophole be closed? In fact, what’s stopping the Internal Revenue Service from doing what the European Commission just did – telling Apple it owes tens of billions of dollars, but to America rather than to Ireland? The dirty little secret is the loophole could be closed, and the IRS could probably do what Europe just did even under existing law. But neither will happen because Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Franchise have enough political clout to stop them from happening. Ironically, the European Commission’s ruling is having the opposite effect in the United States. It’s adding fuel to the demand Apple and other giant U.S. global corporations have been making, that the United States slash taxes on corporations that move their overseas earnings back to the United States. In other words, they want another tax amnesty. Congress’s last tax amnesty occurred in 2004, when global U.S. corporations brought back about $300 billion from overseas, and paid just a tax rate of 5.25 percent rather than the regular 35 percent U.S. corporate rate. Corporate executives argued then – as they argue now – that the amnesty would allow them to reinvest those earnings in America. The argument was baloney then and it’s baloney now. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that 92 percent of the repatriated cash was used to pay for dividends, share buybacks or executive bonuses. “Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R.&D., even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions,” the study concluded. The political establishment in Washington is preparing for another tax amnesty nonetheless. In a white paper published last week, the Treasury Department warned that an American corporation like Apple, ordered by the European Commission to make tax repayments, might eventually use such payments to offset its U.S. tax bill “when its offshore earnings are repatriated or treated as repatriated as part of possible U.S. tax reform.” Rather than another tax amnesty, we need a crackdown on corporate tax avoidance.  Instead of criticizing the European Commission for forcing Apple to pay up, American politicians ought to be thanking Europe for standing up to Apple.

European Union leaders have called for China to take action on its bloated steel industry and defended an order to Ireland to collect back taxes from Apple, highlighting the trade strains looming over a global economic summit. By Joe McDonald, Associated Press Sunday, Sept. 4, 2016 | 6:27 a.m. HANGZHOU, China — Chinese President Xi Jinping called Sunday for leaders of the United States, Germany and other major economies to resist pressure to raise trade barriers as they opened a summit amid sluggish global growth and disputes over China's steel exports and Apple's Irish tax bill. China made trade a theme of the Group of 20 meeting even as Beijing faces complaints it is flooding world markets with low-cost steel, fueling demands for trade curbs. The president of the European Commission highlighted the conflict by calling for the summit to take action. Opening the two-day meeting in this lakeside city southwest of Shanghai, Xi called for more innovation to spur economic growth and reforms to global financial and economic management. He appealed for cooperation in taxes, anti-corruption and measures to "improve the ability of the world economy to resist risks." Chinese officials said earlier that Beijing would propose a plan to boost trade and innovation through regulatory changes and closer government cooperation. "We should build an open world economy," Xi said before an audience that included President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Theresa May and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India and other governments. "Group of 20 countries should abide by their commitment to avoid taking new protectionist measures, strengthen investment policy cooperation and take effective action to promote trade growth," Xi said. China hopes to use its status as this year's G-20 leader to increase its influence in global economic management. Chinese officials say they want the G-20, created to coordinate the response to the 2008 financial crisis, to take on a longer-term regulatory role. The World Trade Organization is forecasting this year's global trade growth at an anemic 2.8 percent — its fifth straight year below 3 percent. Leaders at the meeting have said they will call for "inclusive growth" — a reference to efforts to defuse pressure to protect local industries by spreading the benefits of closer global integration to millions of people who have been left behind by wrenching changes. Obama stressed that theme at a separate news conference with May. "We understand that many of our citizens are frustrated by the pace of globalization and feel they're not experiencing the benefits of international trade," Obama said. "We must all work together to spur economic growth, to boost free trade and build a fairer economy that truly works for all." Also Sunday, the head of the European Union's governing body called for action on China's bloated steel industry. The G-20 meeting "must urgently find a solution" to excess steel production, said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. He called on Beijing to accept a monitoring mechanism for overproduction that Beijing's trading partners blame for low prices and job losses. Juncker also rejected U.S. criticism of the order for Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple. An EU panel ruled that Apple improperly received government aid in the form of tax rates that were lower than those paid by other companies. Ireland has made low taxes a part of its strategy to attract investment. "Free trade must be fair trade," Juncker said at a news conference with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council. Another prominent issue at the summit is G-20 member Britain's June vote to leave the 28-nation EU, seen by some analysts as the first in a wave of moves by other nations to retreat from free trade. Germany, South Korea and other governments say they also want to discuss climate, energy and possible reforms to the global tax system to reduce tax evasion. The meeting began on a diplomatic high note following a joint announcement Saturday by Obama and Xi that their governments had submitted documents committing them to carrying out the Paris climate agreement. But U.S. and other officials say they plan to bring up Chinese industrial overcapacity and other potentially thorny issues. Washington has imposed import duties of up to 500 percent on Chinese steel to offset what regulators say are improper subsidies. China, the world's biggest steel producer, has committed to reducing its production capacity by 100 to 150 million tons by 2020, a pledge Xi repeated Saturday. "This is a global problem, but with a specific Chinese dimension we have to address," Juncker said. "We are really insisting on the need to take this seriously." Juncker defended the EU's tax order on Apple against U.S. criticism and rejected suggestions that the company was targeted because it is American. He said previous tax orders have affected European companies, including a January ruling that covered 35 enterprises, most of them from Europe. "This is not a decision against the United States of America," Juncker said. Tusk affirmed the EU's stance on Britain's possible departure, saying there would be no talks with London over future relations until it formally begins the withdrawal process. Uncertainty over the status of trade, immigration and other critical issues has disrupted business activity and prompted anxiety among investors. "We need to protect the interests of the members of the EU that want to stay together, not the one which wants to leave," Tusk said. Speaking at the news conference with Obama, May said her government was going ahead with its departure and was looking to create new trading opportunities. "There will be no second referendum, no attempt to turn the clock back or get out of this," May said. The two leaders tried to downplay the impact on U.S.-British relations, but Obama suggested that London might have to wait to make a post-EU trade deal. He said Washington is focused on finishing trade deals with Asia-Pacific governments and the EU. 0 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

China promises co-operation on steel at global summit Business by Joe McDonald, The Associated Press Posted Sep 4, 2016 6:35 am MST Last Updated Sep 5, 2016 at 7:20 am MST HANGZHOU, China – China agreed to co-operate more closely with its trading partners on its politically volatile steel exports as leaders of major economies ended a summit Monday with a forceful endorsement of free trade and a crowded agenda that included the Koreas, Syria and refugees. In a joint statement, Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. President Barack Obama and the leaders of Britain, Japan, Russia and other Group of 20 nations pledged to boost sluggish global growth by promoting innovation. “The global recovery lacks momentum,” Xi told reporters after the meeting. “We need to do more to unlock the potential for medium and long-term growth.” There was no mention of a global stimulus or other joint action, which officials said earlier was unworkable because economic conditions vary widely from country to country. In an effort to shore up public support for trade, the leaders promised “inclusive growth” to spread the benefits to people who have been left behind by wrenching change. That reflects a recognition that economic strains are fueling political tensions and a growing clamour to raise barriers against foreign competition. The statement expressed “opposition to protectionism on trade and investment in all its forms.” The governments pledged to avoid devaluing their currencies to boost exports. They called for co-operation to reduce tax avoidance. They appealed for stepped up aid for surging global numbers of refugees and their host countries. Chinese leaders hope the two-day meeting will increase their influence in managing the global economy. They want the G-20, created to respond to the 2008 financial crisis, to take on a longer-term role promoting trade and economic growth. The joint statement reflected that ambition by calling it the “premier forum” for economic co-operation. Beijing made trade a theme of the gathering in this lakeside city southwest of Shanghai but faces complaints that a flood of low-cost Chinese steel into global markets threatens U.S. and European jobs, propelling the rise of political movements that promise to curb trade. The joint statement calls for formation of a steel forum under the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to study excess production capacity. In a concession to Beijing, the statement doesn’t mention China by name and says excess steel capacity is a global issue. However, U.S. and European officials say the vast Chinese state-owned industry, which accounts for half of worldwide output, is the root of the problem. Washington has hiked import duties by up to 500 per cent on Chinese steel to offset what it says are improper subsidies. Beijing promised in January to reduce steel production capacity by 100 to 150 million tons by 2020. But that is half of China’s estimated excess capacity of 300 million tons, so deeper cuts would be required to bring it in line with demand. “The market is distorted by subsidies and other support measures, and that is the fundamental problem,” said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, according to broadcaster NHK. The president of the European Union’s governing body, Jean-Claude Juncker, called Sunday for the G-20 to take action on steel. He said the trade bloc will look at Beijing’s response when deciding whether to grant China market economy status, which would make it harder to bring anti-dumping cases. The steel forum could help to ease strains with Beijing’s trading partners, said economist Rajiv Biswas of IHS. “It may help to reassure countries about tangible steps China is taking,” he said. Obama, Xi and other leaders called during the meeting for governments to defend free trade. “The benefits of trade and open markets must be communicated to the wider public more effectively,” the joint statement said. The World Trade Organization is forecasting global trade growth this year at just 2.8 per cent — its fifth year below 3 per cent. The International Monetary Fund has cut its outlook for global economic growth to 3.1 per cent. The G-20 as a group is unlikely to be able to do much to boost trade or economic growth, Biswas said. He noted that talks on Obama’s TPP initiative for Asia-Pacific governments and a U.S.-European pact have slowed or stalled. Britain is wrestling with the effects of its June vote to leave the EU. Russia, Nigeria and other economies are in recession. “I would say it is hard for the G-20 to come up with a co-ordinated action plan because many of the countries are caught up in domestic issues,” Biswas said. The summit was frequently overshadowed by other concerns. It got off to a rocky start Saturday when there was no staircase at the airport for Obama’s plane. Quarrels with Chinese officials broke out on the tarmac and at other venues over access by U.S. officials and reporters. Heavy security for the event brought Hangzhou, a city of 2.5 million people, to a standstill and left downtown streets deserted. On Monday, North Korea added to the drama by firing three ballistic missiles off its east coast. At about the same time, Xi was in Hangzhou telling his South Korean counterpart, Park Gyun-hye, that China opposes plans to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system outside South Korea’s capital, Seoul. China has warned Seoul against installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence, or THAAD, system. But Monday marked the first time Xi raised the issue directly with Park. Beijing complains THAAD will allow the U.S. military to peer deep into northeastern China. Another key issue at the meeting was Britain’s vote to leave the 28-nation EU trade bloc, seen by some analysts as the first in a wave of moves by governments to withdraw from free trade. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who took office after the referendum, tried to reassure other governments Britain was not isolating itself. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayypip Erdogan, met to discuss the conflict in Syria and to try to mend frayed relations. ___ Associated Press writers Louise Watt and Christopher Bodeen in Hangzhou and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to fix name of Japanese leader to Shinzo Abe.

The G-20 meeting "must urgently find a solution" to excess steel production, said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. He called on Beijing to accept a monitoring mechanism for overproduction that Beijing's trading partners blame for low prices and job losses. Juncker also rejected U.S. criticism of the order for Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple. An EU panel ruled that Apple improperly received government aid in the form of tax rates that were lower than those paid by other companies. Ireland has made low taxes a part of its strategy to attract investment. "Free trade must be fair trade," Juncker said at a news conference with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council. Another prominent issue at the summit is G-20 member Britain's June vote to leave the 28-nation EU, seen by some analysts as the first in a wave of moves by other nations to retreat from free trade.

Ng Han Guan / AP Germany, South Korea and other governments say they also want to discuss climate, energy and possible reforms to the global tax system to reduce tax evasion. The meeting began on a diplomatic high note following a joint announcement Saturday by Obama and Xi that their governments had submitted documents committing them to carrying out the Paris climate agreement. But U.S. and other officials say they plan to bring up Chinese industrial overcapacity and other potentially thorny issues. Washington has imposed import duties of up to 500 percent on Chinese steel to offset what regulators say are improper subsidies. China, the world's biggest steel producer, has committed to reducing its production capacity by 100 to 150 million tons by 2020, a pledge Xi repeated Saturday. "This is a global problem, but with a specific Chinese dimension we have to address," Juncker said. "We are really insisting on the need to take this seriously."

Ng Han Guan / AP Juncker defended the EU's tax order on Apple against U.S. criticism and rejected suggestions that the company was targeted because it is American. He said previous tax orders have affected European companies, including a January ruling that covered 35 enterprises, most of them from Europe. "This is not a decision against the United States of America," Juncker said. Tusk affirmed the EU's stance on Britain's possible departure, saying there would be no talks with London over future relations until it formally begins the withdrawal process. Uncertainty over the status of trade, immigration and other critical issues has disrupted business activity and prompted anxiety among investors. "We need to protect the interests of the members of the EU that want to stay together, not the one which wants to leave," Tusk said. Speaking at the news conference with Obama, May said her government was going ahead with its departure and was looking to create new trading opportunities. "There will be no second referendum, no attempt to turn the clock back or get out of this," May said. The two leaders tried to downplay the impact on U.S.-British relations, but Obama suggested that London might have to wait to make a post-EU trade deal. He said Washington is focused on finishing trade deals with Asia-Pacific governments and the EU.

"The EU Commission has for the first time undertaken a very dramatic step by entering the overall world struggle against illegitimate tax planning through diverting profits from country to country," Israel Tax Authority Head Adv. Moshe Asher CPA told "Globes" in the wake of the European Commission's order to Ireland to collect undue tax benefits of up to €13 billion given to Apple. Asher said, "The EU decision is also in line with the Israel Tax Authority's position and the international approach existing today that there has to be a connection between revenue from real operations and the factories that develop the IP, on the one hand. On the other hand, an official campaign has been opened against multinational tax planning and diverting illegitimate profit, which is very common around the world, and in practice prevents the country of origin, the US for example, the taxes that it is due." The EU Commissioner claims that Apple was awarded illegal assistance by the Irish government over the years and that this hurt competition in Europe. While the global business world is in turmoil over this ruling and its ramifications for the international business community and world tax regimes, and especially tax benefits, Asher actually sees this development as a continuation of the global trend. This trend reflects policies that the Israel Tax Authority has been applying for some time, in attempts to uncover the real amount of tax that foreign companies should be paying. Asher said, "There is a global trend and as part of this international organizations are saying to various countries 'stop attracting income to yourselves in an illegitimate way.' In practice the EU is sending an unequivocal message to its member countries that tax benefits must be awarded in a proper and legitimate manner, with economic content, and not to divert profits to a place that does not have enough economic content. This is the significance of the matter." He continued, "This is in line with the BEPS project of the OECD and the G20 regarding dealing with the erosion of the tax base and diversion of profits. There too they are preventing the diversion and leaking of profits from country to country, simply because a second country gives excessive tax benefits for revenue from royalties, even though the IP was not developed in that country, and there were no real or substantive operations there." Israel's relative advantage Asher sees the EU decision as an opportunity for Israel to attract multinational companies and bring in money a lot of money to the country's coffers. He said, "Today throughout the world they are doing everything s that ultimately companies bring profits back to the source country, where the company is genuinely based. We see an opportunity in this issue because it connects up to legislation that we have recommended and will soon be brought to the Knesset as part of the Economic Arrangements bill with regard to IP and high-tech companies" He continued, "In Israel, we examined these issues about IP and high-tech companies as part of the Andorn Committee as well as another committee headed by Minister of Finance director general Shai Babad and we will bring appropriate legislation to the Knesset. This will give Israel a relative advantage over other countries and we hope it will be realized. I believe that after we enact the amendment to the law, international companies will prefer to come to Israel. Asher talks about the new taxation rules for high-tech companies to be included as part of the Economic Arrangements Law, which ensure technology companies a 6-12% companies tax reduction and a 4% tax on dividends. The legislation, initiated by the Minister of Finance Moshe Kahlon, and the Tax Authority, seeks to position Israel as an attractive location for the operations centers of international high-tech companies and targets investments worth billions of dollars. Asher is certain that this legislation, together with the international mood as expressed by the European Commissioner's Apple ruling, will put Israel on center stage as an attractive investment location. He said, "Israel has an advantage on this issue because we have factories, we have engineers, management, manufacturing supervision etc. We have business and when you really bring the IP here with the intention of complying with international standards, then it will be legitimate that all the revenue from this business, including revenue from royalties, will be in Israel." RELATED ARTICLES HSBC hands over list of 8,000 Israeli Swiss accounts Israel Tax Authority cracks down on landlords Panama Papers name hundreds more Israelis Voluntary disclosure tax plan extended to June 2016 "Therefore," explains Asher, "I think that the EU decision on this subject strengthens the Ministry of Finance and Israel Tax Authority's existing policy to encourage the transfer of IP of international companies to Israel as part of the high-tech legislation we are bringing to the Knesset in this context. This is in contrast to those countries where there is almost no development by engineers even though they take for themselves all the revenue from royalties and the companies' profits are transferred there." Asher re-emphasized, "We are in the opportunity phase. The coming years are a time of opportunity in which large companies will study the BEPS project recommendations and look at what happens to Apple. We expect great changes around the world with hundreds of billions of dollars of IP being moved from country to country to a place where there is real and genuine economic content and Israel is a country that can offer economic content like this together with a reasonable tax rate, but not zero." He continues, "So, for example, if an international company like Apple will come to Israel, it can set up factories here - and according to the law that we are currently trying to enact in the Knesset on high-tech companies - the company can receive a tax rate of just 6%, because it is a mega-company. For other international high-tech companies, we will offer a company tax rate of 12%." Doesn't that create uncertainty in the taxation sector worldwide including Israel and concern that agreements reached with international companies will be reopened? "The world is currently undergoing changes and has even shaken up the manufacturers in this current stage of uncertainty. However, we think that we meet international standards and also we will make the impending legislation that we are bringing to the Knesset subject to the BEPS rules. In addition, throughout the years, we have nurtured companies through the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment., which is based on first of all setting up a factory in Israel. The moment you have a factory and not just a company with a post box with no real economic content, then you have operations in a country and it's not just for show. Here you need a real factory that can be attributed to revenue because Israel has a major workforce in development, first class engineers, high-tech and a supportive business environment in this field, and very many high-tech factories and companies have opened - real companies."

Earlier this week the European Commission found Apple's tax deal with Ireland illegal and ordered the tech giant to pay €13bn, plus interest, in back taxes. The total figure is about €19bn. The Dáil will be recalled on Wednesday to rubberstamp the Cabinet's decision to appeal the ruling. However, Green Party Leader Eamon Ryan said the appeal was ill-advised. "The Government said two things on Friday. They said they would appeal. I don’t think we'll win first of all. "Secondly, they said they want to lead in terms of tax justice.

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsApple (AAPL) Takes a Page from Samsung’s Playbook Apple (AAPL) Takes a Page from Samsung’s Playbook Apple looks to release the best iPhone model yet in 2017. To do this, they are copying something that Samsung has already done. September 4, 2016 WSP Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) users are certainly looking forward to the September 7 release of the new iPhone 7. But, the company also has another big news for 2017. In celebration of the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, Apple will be releasing the iPhone 8. Since it’s all just a big plan for now, there isn’t much we know about the iPhone 8 yet. Rumors say that the new model will have a glass body and a curved edge-to-edge OLED display. An integrated type Camera and Touch ID integrated display has also been mentioned. Then there’s the fingerprint sensor and speculations that the home button will be embedded. The biggest news though lies in its iris-scanning capabilities. Earlier this year, the well-connected KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo mentioned that there is a possibility that the new iPhone will have additional biometric sensor technologies. He said that Apple was already working on an iris-scanning solution allowing users to identify themselves and their transactions using only their eyes. This is what led Apple to purchase Emotient, a company offering software allowing the analysis and identification of a person’s face even if his/hers expressions change. The iris scanner will offer customers additional safety features. It is harder to replicate the complex patterns of a person’s iris than that of a fingerprint. The 2017 iPhone will presumably have both Touch ID and iris scanner. Samsung got a head start with the iris technology, as it is already present in the new Galaxy Note 7. But, there is a big chance that Apple will change the way it implements this feature to make it more practical for the users. This is why some experts claim it will serve more than just the purpose of locking the phone. Digitimes translated a report from the Chinese-language site MoneyDJ about the 2017 iPhone. It stated: “Xintec is expected to enter mass production for iris-recognition chips in 2017, which will boost the backend house’s revenues for the year, the report cited market watchers as saying. New orders for iris-recognition sensors include those for the chips that will be embedded in the 2017 series of iPhone, the watchers were also quoted in the report.” Xintec is a Taiwan-based supplier that is affiliated TSMC. It has been reported that TSMC will be supplying the A10 processors for this year’s iPhone 7. It will start the mass production of iris-recognition chips in 2017 so they can satisfy the orders of Apple and other smartphone suppliers. Unfortunately, Xintec has not yet confirmed anything. Their spokesperson says that the company does not provide any comments on rumors or speculations about specific products or custom orders. On a side note, there were some reports stating that Samsung has stopped their production of the Galaxy Note 7 model. This was due to the different complaints of some customers who said that their devices exploded. The company is looking deeper into this problem.

By Lee Min-hyung Will Samsung Electronics' plan to recall Galaxy Note 7 smartphones drive up sales of its major competitors, Apple and LG Electronics? Officials here remain poles apart over whether the Galaxy recall plan will help its rivals enjoy benefits ahead of the release of their flagship devices. Samsung's unprecedented recall of the 5.7-inch handset came on Friday when Samsung Electronics' mobile chief Koh Dong-jin officially announced the plan to replace all the Note 7 smartphones amid growing controversy over its explosion. The company halted shipments of the latest flagship model. The decision came at a critical time when Samsung's major rivals, Apple and LG Electronics, plan to unveil their new flagship handsets next week. Apple will launch its new iPhone series ― iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus ― on Sept. 7, while LG also will hold the introduction for its large-screen flagship handset, V20, on the same day. "If Samsung fails to resume shipments for Note 7 at the earliest, this will, to some extent, drive up sales of new handsets from Apple and LG," an IT industry source familiar with the matter said, Sunday. "But Samsung made a quick decision to recall the device, providing customers trust that the company prioritizes their safety. In this respect, Apple and LG may not enjoy substantial, long-term benefits following the issue." The source said that it is true that the issue has hurt the image of world's largest handset manufacturer, but the rapid decision to recall all the handsets, regardless of the purchasing date, can offset the damages in the long run. The Samsung mobile chief on Friday apologized for the quality issue of Note 7 and said the company decided to halt sales of the handset and replace the handsets with new ones. Koh said in a meeting with reporters: "It will take two weeks for us to prepare for new products. Preorders for the Note 7 exceeded that of Galaxy S7. We are going to exchange more than one million Note 7 smartphones with new ones." Samsung said it had received 35 claims of explosion for the new flagship handset at home and abroad through service centers, as of Sept. 1. This is equal to 24 out of a 1 million. The company attributed the explosion to faults in battery cells. Another source familiar with the matter, however, claimed the recent controversy will come as a severe blow to Samsung Electronics' mobile business. "Potential risks will continue to linger over its explosion, unless all the customers visit service centers to replace their devices," said the source. If explosions of the phones continue to be reported, this will undermine customers' purchasing appetite," he said. "This will also lead some customers to buy smartphones from its rivals ― including Apple and LG." mhlee@ktimes.com   Celebrities to return from military in...

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Apple iPhone 7 v iPhone 6S: 7 most expected feature upgrades over its predecessor Round-up on expected features of Apple iPhone 7 series, which is expected to make its debut on Sept. 7 in San Francisco. Rohit KVN   September 4, 2016 18:00 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares Amazon Prime offers best deal on iPhonesREUTERS/David Gray Apple is scheduled to announce the new line of iPhones for the year 2016 at the annual product launch event next week on Sept. 7. 2015 iPhone 6S series, despite boasting innovative 3D Touchy feature and other improvements over its predecessor, failed to enthuse critics and buyers. Having learnt some hard lessons, The Cupertino-based firm is leaving no stone unturned to make the new iPhone 7 series a success. We have sifted through multiple reports and have clubbed together a list of 7 probable key feature upgrades which are likely to make the cut in the upcoming Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models. Design: Numerous leaked images have indicated that the iPhone 7 features trademark curved corners, similar to what found in previous generation Apple iPhones, but with redesigned antenna lines on the top and the bottom. It is also shown to having Type-C port, while 3.5mm audio jack has been ditched. The 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus is expected to have a dual-camera module at the top left corner, while the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is said to feature single circular snapper with LED flash. As far as display is concerned, the smaller iPhone 7 will have 750Ã—1334p resolutions. On the other hand, the phablet version is said to come with full HD display (1920x1080p) screen. Both the models are said to come in five colour options -- Deep Blue, Gold, Rose Gold, Space Gray and Silver. Build quality: The 2015 iPhone 6s series phones were covered with high-grade anodised Aluminium 7000-based shell. This year, too, the upcoming Apple iPhone 7(and Plus) are certain to come with more powerful and durable metal. The sighting of iPhone 7 series with Type-C port has led many to believe that the 2016-series devices will have water-proof features like seen in Samsung Galaxy S7 and Note7. They are believed to come with IPX7 rating, which enables to survive five-feet underwater for 30 minutes. Processor and RAM: Multiple reports have indicated the 4.7-inch screen feature Apple A10 CPU, which can clock close to 2.4GHz speed, backed by M10 co-processor and 2GB RAM. The iPhone 7 Plus too will have same CPU and co-processor, but Apple has reportedly incorporated 3GB LPDDR4 RAM to market the phablet as a top-end device series. Storage: For several years now, tech pundits and Android fans have been ridiculing Apple for selling 16GB-based iPhones, which offers very little space for storing media contents and files, as the device's iOS gobbles up more than 50-percent storage. Well, this year the company would be ditching 16GB and introduce 32GB as the base variant along with 64GB and 128GB models. Camera: Besides the processor, camera hardware is expected to have major upgrade in iPhone 7 series. They are said to have bigger lens and wider aperture size to get good quality pictures under low-light conditions. The 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is reportedly coming with 12MP primary camera with 1/2.6-inch sensor, F/1.9 aperture and 1:3 microns pixels, whereas the iPhone 7 Plus is said to boast two 12MP cameras on the back with 1/3-inch sensor and F/1.9 aperture. Both the devices are expected to have 5MP front-snapper. Battery: It is believed that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would come with 1,960mAh and 2,190mAh batteries, respectively.  Apple iPhone 7 - Value-added feature: Force Touch: The soon-to-be launched iPhone is expected to house an advanced home button. Earlier models used to have clickable finger-print sensor. Now it has come to light that the device will have touch-sensitive home button with bio-metric sensor and come with Force touch feature. For the uninitiated, the Force touch trackpad was used on Apple Watch and recently released Macs. When the user initiates Force click by pressing on the trackpad, it opens up functions of the applications many apps and system features on the Mac.

What if you've only ever been an iPhone user, and you're thinking about switching to an Android phone? Here's a little background on what makes each gadget tick, along with what you can expect from the user experience and a few leading phone options should you decide to take the leap. Operating systems Let's start at the beginning. When we say iPhone and Android, we're talking about phones (hardware) that use different types of operating systems (software). Apple uses closed, proprietary operating systems: Mac computers run on OS X (soon to be called MacOS) and mobile devices run on iOS (iPod, iPad, iPhone...sound familiar?). Only Apple devices have native iOS or OS X operating systems, so they can be referred to as iOS/OS devices or just "Apple devices" more or less interchangeably. But non-iOS devices work a little differently. Android phones can be made by any manufacturer - "Android" is actually the operating system. It's an open source software first developed by Google. Some companies, like Samsung, do extra work on the operating system for an experience that's unique to their devices. Other (typically smaller) companies use operating systems pretty close to "stock" Android. What closed vs open means for the end user Take note of the words "closed" and "open" - these differing approaches to software offer a lot of insight on company politics and ultimately manifest in the user experience as well. Apple's software is (mostly) closed. The company doesn't share access to the tool that keeps its devices running, with the exception of limited information for app developers. Android software is open. Google owns Android, but works to develop the software and share it for free (there are guidelines for hardware-makers to use Google's core apps, but the core software itself is distributed without strings attached). (Almost) anyone and everyone can take Android software and make it do whatever they want. Before shaking your fist at the ghost of Steve Jobs, keep in mind there are plenty of reasons to keep systems closed. Ivory towers don't build themselves. Closed systems mean greater security, since hackers have fewer access points to distribute malware. It also prevents the user from inadvertently messing up their own system. Apple has very successfully used their closed system to provide an intuitive, robust and stable user experience. On the Android side, there's more room for customization by both the manufacturer and the user. So while an Apple user can pick up anyone's iPhone and know more or less what they're in for, the difference between one Android phone and the next can be jarring. Updates By now, you know the drill -- when your iPhone needs an update, you get a big notification. Once you opt in, there's a download, then the phone restarts. From there, all of the apps need to be updated accordingly. If you don't upgrade your apps, one by one they'll start to cease function. And if your phone gets too old to support the current OS, you're out of luck. Android updates are rolled out more slowly. Nexus devices (which Google developers in collaboration with a manufacturer partner) get the updates first, and then other manufacturers follow suit. Users don't always know when, if ever, their phone will receive Android software updates, and there's always the option to opt out. Know that you might get hungry comparing specs for the first time. Android names each version of their software after a different sweet: Right now, most new phones are running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but Android 7.0 Nougat was just released. App store Apple's App Store contains only carefully vetted Apple-approved products. You can only get content through the App Store, and the App Store contains only Apple content. It's next to impossible to put non-Apple approved content on your phone, with jailbreaking being rarer (and harder) now than it was in the first five years of iOS devices. Android has one centralized app store: Google Play. The Google Play store sells Android apps, but lots of other stuff too - it's kind of like iTunes and the App Store rolled into one. More importantly, you can also put apps - and even other app stores - on your phone from outside Google Play. So if you want to experiment with different types of (non-vetted) content, you can go right ahead. Historically, Apple's App Store has been the superior of the two, beating Android in terms of quality and quantity of apps. But that gap, along with many others, is closing. Cloud storage and backups "Not enough storage. The iPhone can not be backed up because there is not enough iCloud storage available." If you're like me, you've been ignoring messages like these for weeks. If you're more organized, you've had to jump through hoops to either upgrade your iCloud space or deal with your files like an adult. Automated backups to the iCloud are great in theory. Your phone backs up to the cloud over Wi-Fi, keeping your files safe without you lifting a finger - until it starts becoming a headache. The small storage capacity of the free tier of iCloud (5 GB) and the iPhone's automatic reliance on it is enough to send users up a wall. Does Android offer a better solution? Sort of. Whereas iCloud can give a full system restore in minutes (get a new phone, restore your iCloud backup and voila), Android backups are piecemeal. For example, all of your contacts are saved in Gmail, and you can keep your apps and music on the Google Play cloud. Google Photos works similarly. So, while there's no built-in system-wide tool that brings apps and their content back just the way you like them, all of your data exists somewhere. Gaming and other hardware characteristics We've gone over major differences between the operating systems, which is the most important difference between iPhones and Android devices. But there are some general hardware trends that persist in the different environments as well. Making the switch from iPhone to Android means countless more device options. That's a pleasure for some, but a chore to those with decision fatigue. In general, it's easier and more affordable to find an Android phone with more internal and external storage (SD cards). Apple users pay a premium to get the amount of storage that would be entry-level for another manufacturer. Beyond cloud connectivity, iPhones also lack support for external storage. If you've been filling up your iPhone, switching to Android could make your life much easier. Switching from an iPhone likely means you'll be looking into a different type of display as well. Apple devices have been using IPS display technology. Android phones can have either IPS or AMOLED, but AMOLED is quickly becoming the favorite across leading manufacturers. You'll notice darker blacks, brighter whites and more color saturation. Compatibility with high-tech accessories also varies among manufacturers. Android devices win out. In this department, the major feather in iOS's cap is the Apple Watch. Not only are there dozens of Android-compatible smartwatches out there, several Android phones are virtual reality-ready as well. Apple hasn't announced any plans for a VR headset. There are a plenty of other hardware options currently available on Android phones that haven't yet come to iPhone: fast charging, wireless charging, water resistance and modularity, to name a few. If there's a feature you really like, that alone would make the switch worth it. Recommendations So if you're thinking of walking out on iOS, where should you look first? Here are a few of our picks. Thanks to the number of options, you can choose a phone that caters to your lifestyle more specifically than any iPhone. The Samsung Galaxy series is probably the Android option most analogous to iPhone in terms of availability, price, and popularity. It also encompasses some of the best Android hardware perks. The "7" series is the company's 2016 collection, but recent years' models have many of the same features. Phones in the Galaxy S7 series are Gear VR-compatible, flaunt sophisticated glass bodies with rounded edges and are IP68 water resistant. Full retail price starts at about $670 for a Galaxy S7 versus $649 for an iPhone 6S. Here's a spec-by-spec comparison of the two phones, but keep in mind that's just the base model S7. There are specialty models too, like the rugged S7 Active, or the Galaxy Note 7, a larger option with a stylus and a few new features. The Moto Z Play is a soon-to-be-released modular smartphone that has clever camera, slideshow, speaker and battery life accessories that make it both fun and utilitarian. Plus, it's more affordable than its big brother, Moto Z. The HTC 10 is an all-around stellar pick that clearly puts quality over gimmicks. It lacks some of the more headlining features like water resistance, but it's solidly equipped and provides a high-end, focused and premium experience. Of course, now that you've done background reading on the two types of systems, you might be ready to cast a wider net with your research. In that case, our 2016 smartphone comparison guide is a great place to start.

Opening the Group of 20 meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping appealed Sunday for governments to resist pressure to raise trade barriers. At the same time, a European leader highlighted the conflicts looming over the summit by calling for action on China's bloated steel industry. China made trade a theme of the gathering in this lakeside city southwest of Shanghai even as it faces complaints a flood of low-cost steel exports are threatening U.S. and European jobs, fueling demands for trade curbs. "We should build an open world economy," Xi said before an audience that included U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Theresa May and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India and other governments. Governments should "avoid taking new protectionist measures" and "take effective action to promote trade growth," Xi said. Xi called for innovation to spur growth and reforms to global financial and economic management. He appealed for co-operation in taxes and fighting corruption, and for measures to "improve the ability of the world economy to resist risks." China hopes its status as this year's G-20 leader will increase its influence in global economic management. Chinese officials want the G-20, created to respond to the 2008 financial crisis, to take on a longer-term regulatory role. Other leaders have called for "inclusive growth" - a reference to efforts to spread the benefits of closer global integration to millions of people who have been left behind by wrenching change. Obama stressed that theme at a separate news conference with May. "We must all work together to spur economic growth, to boost free trade and build a fairer economy that truly works for all," said Obama. Also Sunday, the president of the European Union's governing body, the European Commission, called for action on China's bloated steel industry. The G-20 meeting "must urgently find a solution" to excess steel production, said Jean-Claude Juncker. He called on Beijing to accept a monitoring mechanism for overproduction that Beijing's trading partners blame for low prices and job losses. China, the world's biggest steel producer, has committed to reducing its production capacity by 100 to 150 million tons by 2020, a pledge Xi repeated Saturday. "Free trade must be fair trade," Juncker said at a news conference with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council. Another prominent issue at the summit is G-20 member Britain's June vote to leave the 28-nation EU, seen by some analysts as the first in a wave of moves by other nations to retreat from free trade.

And, for Gwyneth Paltrow , that can be almost be taken literally - as we noted when a recent pic showed her daughter looking like a dead-ringer of the Oscar-winner. But fans could easily be forgiven if they got the pair mixed up. Earlier this year, the pair shared a selfie on Instagram that sent fans around the world into meltdown over how alike they both looked. But they're not the only ones who enjoys a striking resemblance to one another. On the contrary, pop culture is packed with celebrities whose offspring are chips off the old block... Gwyneth Paltrow and her daughter Apple certainly share a striking resemblance (Photo: Getty) Chris Martin out with Apple in Malibu - where fans noted her likeness to her mother (Photo: X17Online.com) Jay Z and Blue Ivy Carter There's no doubting the paternity of Beyonce's baby girl, Blue Ivy - she's virtually a carbon copy of her rapper father, Jay Z, who is frequently seen cradling the adorable youngster in public. Next time that happens, note the similar eyes and matching expressions. One cheeky fan even face-swapped the pair...with remarkably uncanny results. Perhaps she'll grow up to have his rapping ability, too?

Fifteen year-old Kaia is pretty much a mini-me of supermodel Cindy, as these pictures show. Fortunately, the 50 year-old catwalk star is one of the world's most beautiful women, so her adolescent youngster will have little to worry about in the looks department. To prove it, Kaia - who was recently spotted hanging out with Kendall Jenner - is already following in her mother's footsteps.

But, even if that wasn't the case, it wouldn't take a genius to work out that Liz, 50, and Damian, 14, are mother-and-son.

As if that wasn't enough he's also just made his acting debut on his mum's TV show, The Royals.

Note the strong jawlines and that cheeky glint in the eye. Funnily enough, her half-brother, Rocco Ritchie, looks nothing like his pop star parent - but is a doppelgänger for his handsome dad, Guy.

So it's all good that her eldest daughter, Mamie, 33, was made from the same mould. With almost-identical eyes, she also boasts the same nose and is also an actress (the pair starred together in flop film Evening, with Claire Danes). Add to that blonde, shoulder-length hair in a similar style and - from a distance - they could be twins.

However, the similarity is only skin-deep as the teenager's passions revolve around music, rather than acting. His band, The Dirty Harrys, are gigging around London as we speak and have already been given expert guidance from Blur, no less.

European Union leaders have called for China to take action on its bloated steel industry and defended an order to Ireland to collect back taxes from Apple, highlighting the trade strains looming over a global economic summit. (Associated Press/Ng Han Guan) Topics G20-meeting Trade Global-Economy-Threats Share this article  share on facebook  share on twitter  share on google plus  share on Linkedin  share on whatsapp  comment  share on email share this article follow Us    European Union leaders called Sunday for China to take action on its bloated steel industry and defended an order to Ireland to collect taxes from Apple, highlighting the trade tensions looming over a global economic summit. The Group of 20 meeting of leaders of the United States, China, Germany and other major economies "must urgently find a solution" to excess steel production, said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. He called on Beijing to accept a monitoring mechanism for overproduction that Beijing's trading partners blame for low prices and job losses. Juncker also rejected U.S. criticism of the order for Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple. An EU panel ruled the company's low taxes were improper government aid. "Free trade must be fair trade," Juncker said at a news conference with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council. The toughly worded comments reflected the political pressures on governments at a time of weak global economic growth that is fueling demands to protect local industries. Another prominent issue at the summit is G-20 member Britain's June vote to leave the 28-nation European Union, a move seen by some analysts as the first in a wave of moves by other nations to retreat from free trade. China, the G-20 host, has made trade a headline issue for the meeting in Hangzhou, a scenic lakeside city southwest of Shanghai. Chinese officials have said they will propose a plan to boost commerce through closer cooperation on regulation, finance, tax and other issues. China hopes its status as G-20 host will bring it more influence in management of the global economy. Chinese leaders say they want the G-20, launched to coordinate the response to the 2008 financial crisis, to take on a longer-term role overseeing global economic management. Germany, South Korea and other governments say they also want to use the meeting to discuss climate, energy and possible reforms to the global tax system to reduce tax evasion. The two-day meeting began Sunday on a diplomatic high note following a joint announcement by President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that their governments had submitted documents committing them to carrying out the Paris climate agreement. But U.S. and other officials say they plan to bring up Chinese industrial overcapacity and other potentially thorny issues. Washington has imposed import duties of up to 500 percent on Chinese steel to offset what regulators say are improper subsidies. China, the world's biggest steel producer, has committed to reducing its production capacity by 100 to 150 million tons by 2020, a pledge Xi repeated Saturday. "This is a global problem, but with a specific Chinese dimension we have to address," said Juncker. "We are really insisting on the need to take this seriously." Juncker defended the EU's tax order on Apple against U.S. criticism. An EU panel concluded Apple received improper aid because it paid lower rates than other companies. Ireland has has made its low taxes part of its strategy to attract investment. Juncker rejected suggestions the EU was targeting an American company. He said previous tax orders have affected European companies, including a January ruling that covered 35 companies, most of them from Europe. "This is not a decision against the United States of America," said Juncker. "We are basing our decisions on facts." Tusk affirmed the EU's stance on Britain's possible departure, saying there would be no talks with London over future relations until it formally begins the withdrawal process. Uncertainty over the status of trade, immigration and other critical issues has disrupted business activity and prompted anxiety among investors. "We need to protect the interests of the members of the EU that want to stay together, not the one which wants to leave," said Tusk. Speaking at a joint news conference with Obama, British Prime Minister Theresa May said her government was going ahead with its departure and was looking to create new trading opportunities. "There will be no second referendum, no attempt to turn the clock back or get out of this," said May. The two leaders tried to downplay the impact on U.S.-British relations but Obama suggested London might have to wait to make a post-EU trade deal. He said Washington is focused on finishing trade deals with Asia-Pacific governments and the EU.

Many reports are saying the company will ditch its headphone jack. Many reports have said Apple plans to ditch the headphone jack for a second speaker in the new iPhone.  (ADNAN ABIDI / REUTERS)   By Hayley TsukayamaThe Washington Post Sun., Sept. 4, 2016 Apple confirmed Monday that it will have a press event on Sept. 7 — at which it is expected to introduce a new iPhone and the next version of the Apple Watch. While Apple never says what it’s planning before it announces new products, this is the time of year for a new iPhone and there have been plenty of reports indicating what’s expected for the next smartphone. The main rumour is that the company is going to break with its normal upgrade rhythm this year. In the past, Apple’s alternated between offering major updates for the iPhone and smaller, more incremental updates. According to that schedule, Apple should be offering a significant update to the iPhone this year, and call it the “iPhone 7.” But reports from analysts and other Apple watchers indicate that Apple’s actually not going to offer that much of an overhaul to its phones, but will instead likely introduce two phones that look an awful lot like its current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. A bigger change to the device is actually now expected next year, in 2017. Apple is expected to give the guts of the phone its typical overhaul, with faster chips, a better camera and maybe a larger battery, according to multiple reports, including one from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The larger version of the iPhone, which will probably be called the iPhone 7 Plus if Apple sticks with its conventions, may have two cameras on the back of the phone. Despite not being a “major” upgrade on the scale of years past, Apple is expected to make at least one big change: many reports have said that Apple will do away with its headphone jack. Instead, reports have said, the company is expected to use the space now occupied by the headphone jack for a second speaker. Headphones for the iPhone may instead work with the Lightning port on the bottom of the phone, which is currently only used for charging and data transfer. Article Continued Below That would make the standard headphones that users have had for years completely useless with a new iPhone. Since the rumour first broke, there’s been lots of pushback from those who say it’s not a consumer-friendly move. That includes Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who told the Australian Financial Review last week that Apple shouldn’t ditch the headphone jack unless it also improves the sound quality over Bluetooth wireless headphones. Overall, Apple’s iPhone sales in 2016 haven’t been as strong as they were last year, and that’s worried many investors who know that the majority of Apple’s money comes from iPhone sales. If the reports are true, Apple is unlikely to get a sales bump on the scale that it normally does when releasing an overhauled iPhone. For example, those still using the iPhone 6 (or older) may find themselves unwilling to pay for more incremental updates, and may hold out for another year until the next model. Then again, Apple is nothing if not surprising — so hopeful phone buyers shouldn’t go into mourning just yet. Read more about: Apple The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

They don't enjoy the endless shelf life of autumn's "storage" apples, but if you refrigerate them, you can easily pile up enough to make a big batch of  applesauce - or the following recipe. From Greg Patent's 2007 book, "A Baker's Odyssey: Celebrating Time-Honored Recipes from America's Rich Immigrant Heritage," here's how to make Missoulian Jody Anderson's recipe for Swedish Apple Pudding, an applesauce topped with a layer of sponge cake. Swedish Apple Pudding Makes 8-10 servings. Jody Anderson, who made this for me on a late summer day when her Transparents were at their peak, learned this recipe from her Swedish mother-in-law, Anna Anderson, who had been taught the recipe by her mother, Bed Bood. Mrs. Bood immigrated to the United States in 1885 from Varmland, an area of Sweden with a relatively mild climate conducive to growing apples. Jody says only late-summer apples will do for this recipe, and since she has a Transparent apple tree right outside her kitchen door, that is what she always uses. Any first-of-the-season apples, available at farmers' markets and in some supermarkets, will work. Lodi, Summer Red, and Wealthy are all excellent. I have also had wonderful results with first-of-the-season McIntosh, which are available in late September into the first part of October. Jody's mother-in-law developed a technique for cooking the apples in batches in a microwave oven. "I just love the fact that there's no spattering," Jody says. But I have also made the applesauce in a large pot on top of the stove with minimal to no spattering. APPLE FILLING: 1 lemon 5 pounds of late-summer apples (see headnote) 3/4 cup of water 1 1/2 - 3 cups of granulated sugar one 8-ounce can of crushed pineapple in juice (not drained) CAKE: 2/3 of a cup of bleached all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder 1 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon of salt 3 large eggs, separated 3/4 of a cup of granuluated sugar 3 tablespoons of cold water 3/4 of a teaspoon of pure lemon extract 1 1/2 - 2 cups of heavy cream or half-and-half, for serving.   To make the filling: cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into a large bowl. Add 8 cups of cold water and drop in the lemon halves. Quarter, core and peel the apples, then cut them into ½ inch chunks. Add them to the acidulated water as you go. To cook the apples in a microwave oven: drain the apples and measure out 4 cups. Put ¼ cup of the water into a large (6 quart) microwave-safe bowl and add the 4 cups of apples. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave on high power for 11 minutes. Remove the bowl and, beginning at the edge of the bowl farthest away from you, to avoid scalding yourself, carefully lift off and remove the plastic. Mash the apples a bit with a potato masher just to break them up a bit; the sauce should have some texture. Add ½ cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of the crushed pineapple with its juice, stir well, and taste. If the mixture is too tart, add more sugar to taste. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap again and microwave on high power for 3 minutes. Transfer the sauce to another large bowl. Repeat the procedure twice more, using 3 quarts of apples in all. (You may have some leftover apples, which you can turn into applesauce to eat.) To cook the apples on top of the stove: put all the apples into an 8-quart stockpot and add the ¾ cup of water. Cover the pot, set over medium heat, and cook for about 10 minutes, until the liquid comes to a boil. Uncover the pot and stir well, then cover and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 20-30 minutes more, until the apples are tender. Add 1 ½ cups of sugar and taste. If the mixture is too tart, add more sugar. Use a potato masher to break up the apples a bit, but don’t overdo it; you want a sauce with some texture. Continue cooking the apples at a simmer, uncovered, over medium-low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they are very tender. Add the pineapple with its juices, and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Measure 6 cups of the filling (if you have less, that’s okay) into a large microwave-safe bowl to reheat in a microwave, or into a pot to reheat on the stove. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or pot lid and set aside. Adjust and oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Have ready a 2 ½ - 3 quart baking dish about 3 inches deep. To make the cake: sift together the flour, baking powder, cornstarch and salt In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until very thick and pale, about 5 minutes. While beating, gradually sprinkle in the sugar, then beat for another 2-3 minutes. The yolks will be very thick. Beat in the water and lemon extract. Add the dry ingredients and stir them in with a whisk just until the batter is smooth. Reheat the filling in a microwave oven on high power for 3-5 minutes, or reheat it in a pot on the stovetop. The sauce must be boiling hot when the cake batter is poured on top. Meanwhile, in a clean bowl, with clean beaters, beat the egg whites on medium speed just until they form peaks that hold their shape and curl softly at their tips when the beater is raised. Gently fold the whites into the cake batter only until no whites show. Carefully uncover the hot applesauce, give it a stir, and scrape it into the baking dish. Spread it evenly, and immediately pour the cake batter on top. Put the pan in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and springs back when gently pressed. To serve hot, let the cake cool for at least 5 minutes. To serve warm, let the cake stand for about 1 hour. Or cool the cake completely and serve at room temperature. Spoon portions of cake and applesauce into serving bowls and pass the cream at the table to be poured around the cake. Storing: Leftover cake keeps well the refrigerator, covered, for a day or two. It’s excellent cold. (Broadcast: "The Food Guys," 9/4/16 and 9/8/16. Listen weekly on the radio at 11:50 a.m. Sundays and again at 4:54 p.m. Thursdays, or via podcast.)

Classic Niçoise salad has tomatoes, capers, green beans, hard-boiled eggs and cucumber over a bed of lettuce, and with the addition of some canned salmon or tuna, it turns into a meal. Greek salad's hallmarks include chopped ham, red onion, feta cheese, Greek olives and hard-boiled eggs, but as Jon points out, "you don't have to get carried away with adhering to some recipe."

Apple holds its cards close to its chest when it comes to the release of its new devices. Last week it sent out cryptic invitations to an "invitation-only event" in San Francisco at 6pm on September 7.  Apple's invitation to the event on September 7 Credit: Apple The Silicon Valley giant is known for lacing its invitations with clues regarding its events. For example, in 2014 it added a shadow to the stalk of the apple on its logo that was reminiscent of a sun dial, hinting at the launch of a smartwatch.  This time is no different. Fans have speculated that the dots on the invite look a bit like lens flare, the slightly blurred bright spots that sometimes appear on pictures taken in low light.  Is it just me, or is this years iPhone media invite darker? Could this be a clue? #Apple https://t.co/WZLHCumKHt pic.twitter.com/ZsoBUhvVZ8— Drew (@drewmarasco) August 29, 2016 Let the guessing begin! What do the blobs on Apple's invite mean? That’s a depth effect you can get w better cameras pic.twitter.com/dJJdT7eScG— Geoffrey A. Fowler (@geoffreyfowler) August 29, 2016 The invitation clue has led to speculation that the iPhone section of the launch will focus on iPhone photography. Apple is expected to release two new phones with much better cameras next week, which could feature a marked improvement in low light. About | iPhone 7 What features will the iPhone 7 have? The handsets make up the tenth generation of Apple's smartphone, and are expected to come in two sizes, the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch 7 Plus. It will probably look fairly similar to its predecessor, but without the two antenna bands across the back of the device. It could also come in an additional colour, with glossy black the bookies' favourite.  The most anticipated features of the handset include an upgraded camera, with a "dual-lens" system on the iPhone 7 Plus, a pressure-sensitive home button, and a faster A10 processor.  What the AirPods and iPhone 7 could look like Credit: Synkami/Twitter One of the more controversial expected updates is the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack. It is not yet clear what will replace the EarPod headphones that come with the iPhone at the moment, but the company could introduce a set of Lightning EarPods or wireless "AirPod" headphones.  Some less certain suggested features include a better battery, a system that makes the phone waterproof and fast charging.  controversial decisions that made the iPhone better When will it be released and how much will it cost? For the last two years Apple has publicly released the iPhone two weeks after unveiling it at the San Francisco event. A leaked retail schedule from US phone carrier AT&T confirmed this with the suggestion that it will go on sale September 23. iPhone release dates But prominent leaker Ev Blass said Apple could bring the date forward and release the new products on September 16.  Just to clarify, this refers to the retail release, not the launch event. To be even more specific, it should happen on Friday, Sept. 16th.— Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 23, 2016 Reports have suggested that supplies of the iPhone 7 could initially be limited, meaning that the devices could sell out fairly quickly.  The starting price for the iPhone 7 could differ from previous years thanks to currency fluctuations and the possibility that Apple will ditch the 16GB model. If Apple keeps prices in line with the last two years, we can expect the iPhone 7 to start at £539 and the 7 Plus at £619.  iPhone 7 - the rumour round-up Play! 02:26 What about the Apple Watch 2? Alongside the iPhone, Apple is going to launch the second generation of its Watch, according to reports. The upgraded Watch is expected to have GPS connectivity, a faster processor and a better battery.  Anything else? That's all we're expecting Apple to release at this event, but the company is rumoured to be planning another product launch for October. At the follow-up event it will probably release a new range of Mac computers.  The updated MacBook Pro could have a "Dynamic Function Row" that will replace the function keys on the keyboard with ones that change depending on how you're using the laptop, according to Bloomberg. It is also expected to have a faster processor and the option of a more powerful graphics card.  Apple could also release updated MacBook Air laptops that have USB C ports, and iMac with a faster processor and new graphics card, and a 5K screen.  Will there be a new iPad? As Apple released the scaled-down version of the iPad Pro in March, it is unlikely that it will release another version of the tablet this Autumn. But Bloomberg reports that the company could release new software features for the device at the beginning of next year, including Apple Pencil improvements and compatibility with more apps.  Next year the company could release an iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch screen, instead of the current 9.7-inch, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.  iphone 7: what will it look like   Follow The Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: iPhone Apple Show more Technology latest 02 Jan 2017, 12:51pm How to permanently delete your Facebook account 02 Jan 2017, 11:05am Delete yourself from the internet with this website 02 Jan 2017, 10:34am Teenager invents phone charger which generates energy from the human body 01 Jan 2017, 8:00pm CES 2017: New technologies on display are yet to convince the public of their value  Premium 31 Dec 2016, 7:01pm Google plans UK launch of paid-for YouTube Red service 31 Dec 2016, 4:41pm Letting technology ease the burden of business trips  Premium 31 Dec 2016, 11:28am The 10 best video games of 2016 30 Dec 2016, 4:18pm iPhone bug will break the Messages app with a single text - here's how to fix it 30 Dec 2016, 2:37pm CES 2017: What to expect and when is it? 30 Dec 2016, 1:38pm Hipster Michelin-starred restaurant uses iPads instead of plates 30 Dec 2016, 1:22pm Parents claim Hatchimals are mumbling swear words in their sleep 30 Dec 2016, 12:53pm The best robots of 2016 30 Dec 2016, 10:48am Twitter may finally let users edit their tweets 01:02 29 Dec 2016, 10:01pm Who was Charles Macintosh?

Join For Free Build fast, scale big with MongoDB Atlas, a hosted service for the leading NoSQL database on AWS. Try it now! Brought to you in partnership with MongoDB. This is a guest post by Jenkins World speaker Manisha Arora, Co-Founder of Veertu. We at Veertu Inc. have been doing virtualization for a while. Veertu’s technical co-founders were part of the team that built KVM and nested virtualization technology, SDN, and SDS for public cloud at Ravello Systems. So it’s been pretty interesting for us to see the evolution of infrastructure in the Linux and Windows domains over the years, and how it has kept pace with innovations in the application development area. However, when you look at mobile app dev, it’s pretty clear that dev and test infrastructure is still trying to catch up with the innovations in the app dev domain. This is even more obvious for the Apple device ecosystem. So we started to work on a software solution that is based on our innovative technology which virtualizes OS X (now called macOS) based infrastructure, with the goal that all application development that’s being done on OS X (Native OS X apps, iOS, watchOS, tvOS apps, apps that need to run in Safari) can leverage this infrastructure whenever, wherever, and however they need it. In our session at Jenkins World 2016, we will describe this and show you how to apply it to high-velocity iOS build and test workloads. As most of you already know, iOS dev, build, and test is done using xCode and Simulator, which is Apple’s development SDK and runs on macOS. Different iOS projects want different versions of Xcode, different ruby versions, different gems and different dependency managers. When there are teams of 4 or more iOS developers working on these projects, the scale and complexity of build and test environments for code commits significantly increases. In the Linux world, this is addressed by executing build and test workloads on a cloud infrastructure (public or private), where specific environments with all the dependencies are spun up on-demand for every code commit/build. The build and test infrastructure can scale up/down in line with the speed of application development. The same isn’t true for iOS application development on the Apple platform. There is no server grade infrastructure technology available for the Apple platform, which addresses this challenge completely.  In the last 3-4 years, a lot of service providers seem to have come up with offerings for iOS build and test environments on-demand, but after careful investigation and multiple customer conversations, we concluded that none of these providers can meet the demands of customer’s dynamic workloads in real time. The problem is unsolved and growing with exponential growth of mobile app dev. We are developing a native infrastructure virtualization platform for MacOS, which will sit on top of the Mac operating system and enable the users to take a cluster of Mac hardware (Mac Minis, Pros etc..) and convert it into a private cloud. While there have been attempts to do this in the past with desktop-based virtualization, it doesn’t really meet the needs of CI dev/test workloads. CI dev/test workloads for iOS need server grade features like high performance, with no overhead in virtual instances, small footprint, non-intrusive execution of multiple instances in a single piece of hardware, and faster boot times. Our upcoming technology will address all this and offer a solution which users can use to very quickly build, control, and manage on-demand private cloud for iOS build and test from within their Jenkins CI process and other CI platforms.

China made trade a theme of the Group of 20 meeting even as Beijing faces complaints it is flooding world markets with low-cost steel, fueling demands for trade curbs. The president of the European Commission highlighted the conflict by calling for the summit to take action. Opening the two-day meeting in this lakeside city southwest of Shanghai, Xi called for more innovation to spur economic growth and reforms to global financial and economic management. He appealed for cooperation in taxes, anti-corruption and measures to "improve the ability of the world economy to resist risks." Chinese officials said earlier that Beijing would propose a plan to boost trade and innovation through regulatory changes and closer government cooperation. "We should build an open world economy," Xi said before an audience that included President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Theresa May and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India and other governments. "Group of 20 countries should abide by their commitment to avoid taking new protectionist measures, strengthen investment policy cooperation and take effective action to promote trade growth," Xi said. China hopes to use its status as this year's G-20 leader to increase its influence in global economic management. Chinese officials say they want the G-20, created to coordinate the response to the 2008 financial crisis, to take on a longer-term regulatory role. The World Trade Organization is forecasting this year's global trade growth at an anemic 2.8 percent — its fifth straight year below 3 percent. Leaders at the meeting have said they will call for "inclusive growth" — a reference to efforts to defuse pressure to protect local industries by spreading the benefits of closer global integration to millions of people who have been left behind by wrenching changes. Obama stressed that theme at a separate news conference with May. "We understand that many of our citizens are frustrated by the pace of globalization and feel they're not experiencing the benefits of international trade," Obama said. "We must all work together to spur economic growth, to boost free trade and build a fairer economy that truly works for all." Also Sunday, the head of the European Union's governing body called for action on China's bloated steel industry. The G-20 meeting "must urgently find a solution" to excess steel production, said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. He called on Beijing to accept a monitoring mechanism for overproduction that Beijing's trading partners blame for low prices and job losses. Juncker also rejected U.S. criticism of the order for Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple. An EU panel ruled that Apple improperly received government aid in the form of tax rates that were lower than those paid by other companies. Ireland has made low taxes a part of its strategy to attract investment. "Free trade must be fair trade," Juncker said at a news conference with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council. Another prominent issue at the summit is G-20 member Britain's June vote to leave the 28-nation EU, seen by some analysts as the first in a wave of moves by other nations to retreat from free trade. Germany, South Korea and other governments say they also want to discuss climate, energy and possible reforms to the global tax system to reduce tax evasion. The meeting began on a diplomatic high note following a joint announcement Saturday by Obama and Xi that their governments had submitted documents committing them to carrying out the Paris climate agreement. But U.S. and other officials say they plan to bring up Chinese industrial overcapacity and other potentially thorny issues. Washington has imposed import duties of up to 500 percent on Chinese steel to offset what regulators say are improper subsidies. See how St. Louis stocks are faring How do they stack up?

"This is a global problem, but with a specific Chinese dimension we have to address," Juncker said. "We are really insisting on the need to take this seriously." Juncker defended the EU's tax order on Apple against U.S. criticism and rejected suggestions that the company was targeted because it is American. He said previous tax orders have affected European companies, including a January ruling that covered 35 enterprises, most of them from Europe. "This is not a decision against the United States of America," Juncker said. Tusk affirmed the EU's stance on Britain's possible departure, saying there would be no talks with London over future relations until it formally begins the withdrawal process. Uncertainty over the status of trade, immigration and other critical issues has disrupted business activity and prompted anxiety among investors. "We need to protect the interests of the members of the EU that want to stay together, not the one which wants to leave," Tusk said. Speaking at the news conference with Obama, May said her government was going ahead with its departure and was looking to create new trading opportunities. "There will be no second referendum, no attempt to turn the clock back or get out of this," May said. The two leaders tried to downplay the impact on U.S.-British relations, but Obama suggested that London might have to wait to make a post-EU trade deal. He said Washington is focused on finishing trade deals with Asia-Pacific governments and the EU. Associated Press writer Louise Watt contributed to this report.

Voices If Theresa May wants to stop multinationals like Apple dodging tax in the UK, this is how she can do it Sensible politicians are aware there is something fundamentally awry with the manner global companies are taxed. If Theresa May wants to stop them from avoiding paying tax entirely, this is what she needs to do Ben Chu @Benchu_ Sunday 4 September 2016 10:46 BST Click to follow The Independent Online EU Commissioner Vestager gestures during a news conference on Ireland's tax dealings with Apple Reuters Steve Jobs must be revolving in his grave. Not only has his successor, Tim Cook, introduced one of those stylus pens the Apple founder always regarded as an indicator of technological failure but Cook’s now also demolished Apple’s carefully cultivated cool image. “When you’re accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you, and that’s how we feel,” Cook blustered in an interview last week in response to the verdict of the European Union’s Competition Commissioner that Apple had benefited from a 25-year sweetheart tax deal from Ireland and now needs to stump up €13bn in avoided corporation tax. As he hyperventilated over the injustice, Cook sounded eerily like the uncool “PC” character from one of those “Hello, I’m a Mac” adverts from the late 1990s. What a way to undermine a brand. Read more Why iPhone 7 will be the least important thing at the iPhone 7 launch Yet there is one substantive economic argument that the Apple boss advanced this week. “Taxes for multinational companies are complex, yet a fundamental principle is recognised around the world: a company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created,” he said in a statement. Here’s a serious case to grapple with. So where is Apple’s “value” created? Apple’s implied answer seems to be that it is at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, the address of the company’s California headquarters. That’s where many of its brilliant designers and engineers work. That’s where its executives like Cook are based. But this raises the awkward question of why Apple registered the profits of all its sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in an Irish subsidiary, rather than back in the US parent company. Or, rather, why did Apple, with the connivance of the Dublin authorities, register those surpluses in a stateless shell corporation, meaning that some €16bn of its profits a year incurred virtually no corporation tax at all? This suggests that the value of all those billions of dollars of profits was created not in Cupertino, but came out of the ether (or perhaps the cloud). Apple now suggests it always intended to repatriate these profits to the US, at some stage, to be subject in full to America’s 35 per cent corporation tax. If you believe that, Tim Cook has a stylus he’d like to sell you. The simple fact is that multinational companies have long been able to exploit variations in national corporation tax regimes for the benefit of their shareholders by artificially “shifting” profits across borders with the stroke of an accountant’s keyboard. They have been effectively picking and choosing where they pay corporation tax.  And Apple, with the help of Dublin, pushed this strategy to its extreme by deciding that it would pay corporation tax on a large slug of its profits nowhere at all. Cook really shouldn’t be surprised when that kind of aggressive tax shopping and dodging sticks in the throat of many people – even the ones who love Apple products.

Yet is it true that the value of a multinational company is created in the place where the firm has its headquarters, or its research base? Apple’s development teams in California are certainly crucial in generating its profits. But so are its marketing and finance teams based around the world. So are its retail teams in every country it operates. “There is usually no single source of profit,” argue the corporation tax experts Michael Devereux and Rita de la Feria. “Profits arise from many locations as the multinational takes advantage of local conditions to maximise its worldwide profit.” If this is true, there is a powerful case for a new approach to taxing companies, especially multinationals. Devereux and de la Feria propose a “destination-based” corporation tax. So instead of trying to work out where “value” is created or the “source” of the profit, national authorities would simply levy the tax on firms where their products or services are sold and consumed by customers. So for Apple its UK corporation tax bill would simply be calculated by taking its UK sales, subtracting the cost of employing its British-based workforce and other local investment overheads, and taxing the difference. There are several major advantages of moving to such a system.  It would eliminate the incentive for multinational firms to spend time and energy employing accountants to shift reported profits across borders.  It would fit with the general public view of what constitutes substantive (and thereby taxable) economic activity by a company within a territory. It could also be introduced unilaterally. The UK is a large enough market that it could face down the inevitable threats from multinationals to desert our shores. Is it remotely plausible Apple would decide not to sell iPhones to Britons? Or that Starbucks would go on coffee strike? Or that Amazon would stop selling us books? Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address Double taxation would not be an issue as multinationals required to pay extra UK corporation tax under the new regime would be able to proportionately lower their tax dues to governments elsewhere in the world on the grounds their corporate income had already been taxed. Indeed, this would, helpfully, give a nudge to other governments to follow the UK’s lead in imposing their own destination-based corporation taxes for fear of losing out on their share of the overall multinational taxation pie. Sensible politicians are aware there is something fundamentally awry with the manner global companies are taxed.  “It doesn’t matter to me whether you’re Amazon, Google or Starbucks, you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to fellow citizens and you have a responsibility to pay your taxes,” proclaimed Theresa May earlier this year. If the prime minister wants to live up to those fine sentiments, she should look seriously at imposing a destination-based corporation tax. The alternative could well be an infinite loop of multinational tax dodging and growing public anger.

Following its acquisition of machine learning platform Turi earlier this month, Apple is now growing the team that will serve as the company’s new machine learning division focusing on integrating the tech into new and existing products. Apple confirmed tat the company had acquired Turi earlier in August, stating that it “buys smaller technology companies from time to time,” albeit without providing details. Apple has apparently started expanding the team acquired by the acquisition and is bringing in new application developers as well as data scientists into Turi’s Seattle location, where the company is based. The new machine learning division will work alongside Apple’s product teams to prototype new features and improvements that could be integrated into Apple’s existing apps and future products. Prior to Apple’s acquisition, the Turi platform offered a number of use cases for software developers to implement machine learning tech including recommendation engines, fraud detection, sentiment and customer/user analysis, and more. Apple has newly posted job listings on its website for similar positions on the Turi machine learning team. Apple had hinted as to an expansion in the Seattle area, citing that it was interested in up to 354,000 square feet of office space that could accommodate up to 2,300 employees. That would significantly increase the office space the company currently has in the area. Apple is already using machine learning in many of its products that could benefit from the new team. An interview with executives following the Turi acquisition offered some insights into the company’s recent work with machine learning in Siri, iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, as well as the upcoming iOS 10 release arriving this fall. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

CLICK HERE Woolly Worms To Race During Annual Central Square Apple Festival Written by Contributor, Sep 3, 2016, Comments Off CENTRAL SQUARE – The Brewerton Speedway is usually associated with big block modifieds, mod lites and other vehicles, but the track will host a completely different level of competition — woolly worm racing — at the 33rd annual Lioness Club of Central Square Apple Festival Sept. 24 and 25. The 33rd annual Central Square Apple Festival, featuring nearly 300 crafters and vendors, entertainment and amusement rides, takes place at the Brewerton Speedway Sept. 23 – 25. A full slate of entertainment, including a pie-baking contest and the crowning of Miss Apple Festival will take place over the weekend. For a schedule visit http://centralsquareapplefestival.com/. In addition to enjoying hundreds of crafters, vendors, entertainers, food booths, demonstrations and amusement rides, visitors to the festival will have a chance to race their own woolly worms and cheer on their favorites in races sponsored by the Oswego County Pioneer Search and Rescue Team. The festival opens Friday evening with amusement rides and games by Playland Amusements from 5 to 9 p.m.  The full slate of food, entertainment and activities will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24, and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 25. Festival admission is $5 per vehicle. All vehicles and pedestrians should enter at the CNY Raceway Park entrance at 154 US Route 11, just north of the Brewerton bridge. Golf cart and shuttle transportation will be provided to and from the festival grounds. The Brewerton Speedway entrance will be closed. Apples, apple products, and desserts  will be supplied by Appledale Orchards of Mexico, Cicero United Methodist Church, West Monroe Methodist Church, Central Square Lions Club, Teen Challenge, and Brewerton United Methodist Church. Additional food choices include barbecued chicken dinners, breakfast sandwiches, fried seafood, pizza, egg rolls, poutine, taco in a bag, blooming onion, maple products, and a large menu of traditional festival food. The festival is an important fundraiser for many local non-profit groups who earn money to support their own organizational missions. The Lionesses donate all of the proceeds from the event back to the community. “The Lionesses have many local charitable activities that benefit a wide array of people and organizations, including the sight and hearing-impaired, local food pantries, libraries, families in need and the emergency community serving the north shore of Oneida Lake and southern Oswego and northern Onondaga counties.” said Apple Festival Executive Director Ellen Ellison Sykes. Again this year the Oswego County Pioneer Search and Rescue Team will hold its annual Woolly Worm Races at the Apple Festival. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, contestants will encourage woolly bear caterpillars to crawl up a 3-foot length of string. “The Woolly Worm Races are a unique event to raise money for the all-volunteer Oswego County Pioneer Search and Rescue Team,” said Scott Morehouse, SAR director. “Anyone can participate. No person is more likely to have a winning worm than any other person, although worms raced by children do seem to win a bit more frequently.” First place winners both days will receive $500 awards and second place daily winners receive $100 each. Each race winner and semi-final race winner will receive small cash awards. Saturday’s daily winner earns the title of “2016 CNY Woolly Worm Champion” and that worm is used to predict the severity of the upcoming 2016-17 winter. Queen Woolly Worm Erica Schreiner congratulates $100 winner Andrew Graham of Clay at last year’s Woolly Worm Races. The event takes place at the Central Square Apple Festival Sept. 24 and 25 and is a fundraiser for the Oswego County Pioneer Search and Rescue Team. Schreiner is a member of the Search and Rescue Team. Race details are available at https://www.facebook.com/CNYWoolyRacing/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE. Trophies are awarded to first and second place winners each day. There is a $5 entry fee for the Woolly Worm Races. Contestants are encouraged to bring their own woolly worms, although the team will have a supply on hand for racing. Local musician Emmalee Herrington opens the festival with the National Anthem and a concert from 9 to 9:30 Saturday morning and 9 to 10 Sunday morning. The fourth annual Miss Apple Festival competition will be from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday. Apple pie judging is from 1 to 1:30 p.m. Saturday. Scarecrow contest winners will be announced at 1:45 p.m. Saturday. Other special events and performances include Jammin’ Beats DJs, Magical John, Curls the Clown, Team Sgarlata Martial Arts, author Wendy LaDue, Tom Gilbo and the Blue Suedes, Central Square Gymnastics, wool spinning with Pam Locke, Central Square Redhawk Regiment Marching Band, Dance Craze by Shannon, The McCarthy Family, Lisa Lee Band, Ronald McDonald and Kids Kingdom Princesses, humvee display and obstacle course by 403rd Family Readiness Group, Love My Parrots, NYS Police Rollover Demonstration, Operation Safe Child ID by Oswego County Sheriff’s Department, agricultural display by Oswego County Fair, Oswego County Fire Prevention Display, SPL Kids’ Kingdom, and Copenhagen Carvers.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Apple Hit With Hefty EU Tax Ruling; What Cramer, Kass Think Written by: Tony Owusu 08/30/16 - 2:20 PM EDT Tickers in this article: AAPL AMZN SBUX On Friday, Real Money queried what Apple  was going to do with its $200 billion cash pile. If the EU has its way, at least $14.5 billion of it will be used to pay back taxes, according to a European Commission ruling Tuesday. While investors punish Apple shares, the team at Real Money has divergent opinions on the implications of today's news.  The European Commission charged the Irish government with giving Action Alerts PLUS holding Apple a sweetheart tax deal that resulted in the world's richest company paying a lower share of taxes than it should have. The EU estimates that Apple has paid an effective tax rate of just 1% on its European sales since 2003, with that rate falling even lower -- to 0.005% -- in 2014. Today's ruling concludes a two-year investigation into the company's Ireland-based EU operations. The EU charges that the tax benefit gave Apple an unfair competitive advantage.  More Headlines More 'Peak Autos'; Who Cares About Friday's Jobs Report: Best of Kass The Market Is a Puzzlement, How High-Valuation Stocks Get in Trouble: Jim Cramer's Best Blogs Andrew Left: Cyberdyne Has Made Little Progress in Winning FDA Approval H&amp;R Block Taxed by Intuit's Do-It-Yourself Business Model EpiPen Price Relief Could Come From Rivals Before Politicians Investors appear worried the tax ruling could negatively affect the stock, with shares currently down 0.6% Tuesday. Jim Cramer, on the other hand, isn't worried at all.  Monday on CNBC, Cramer mentioned that Apple had the worst chart in the AAP portfolio. But today, Cramer quashed any notion that he was turning on the stock, writing, "My take is this: If you want to trade it, be my guest. The chart says sell. But the company? Bigger than the chart. Worth owning, not trading. Sorry, I am just not good enough to get you out and then get you back in when the time is right. If you are, be my guest." While Cramer sees the ruling as "outrageously unfair," Seabreeze Partners Management President and Real Money Pro contributor Doug Kass -- who is short Apple -- took a different view of the ruling, telling Real Money in an email exchange that the "1% effective tax rate in Ireland, from my perch, provides an unfair competitive advantage for Apple. "I think, as it relates to Apple and other multinationals with large non-U.S. cash hoards, the EC decision will dent legislation in the U.S. meant to repatriate overseas profits," Kass continued. "This is especially true if Democrats win the presidency, which seems likely."   Apple isn't the only major U.S. conglomerate being targeted by the EU's tax watchdogs. Both Growth Seeker holding Amazon  and fellow AAP holding Starbucks  are also currently under investigation. Yesterday Apple sent out invitations to a Sept. 7 conference that most expect to be the platform that the company uses to introduce the iPhone 7. Kass believes Apple's problems run deeper than today's ruling. "I'm sticking with this negative investment thesis on Apple, which transcends today's news and is directed toward the company's less-than-attractive intermediate-term profit outlook relative to consensus expectations," Kass wrote in his Daily Diary today. "After all, it remains my view that the Apple iPhone's last important product upgrade cycle is now behind us." 1 2 next  last »

Lefsetz Letter Archives Subscribe to the Lefsetz Letter The CAA Book Jerry Heller More Exclusives “Another Apple Exclusive: Travis Scott” This is the company that doesn’t pay taxes. I don’t know why everybody keeps pontificating that Apple is a beloved enterprise whose customers will follow it like lemmings no matter where it goes. That’s a dying paradigm which is undermined every time the Cupertino company does something consumer unfriendly. This is not DuPont, not some mining company no consumer actually touches. Rather, Apple made its bones by selling to the rank and file, not corporations. And even though Tim Cook has tied up with IBM, even though there’s been a push into the corporate sphere, the lion’s share of the dough comes from you and me. And we’re starting not to like these people. Cook is bland, Jony Ive has disappeared, and Eddy Cue was lambasted in the “Wall Street Journal” for overreaching. Apple’s Hard-Charging Tactics Hurt TV Expansion As for Apple Music, it’s faceless. Musicians criticize Daniel Ek, but they don’t know who to complain about at Apple Music. Until Apple-bleeder Sean Glass said that Larry Jackson was the man, no one knew who was working with acts at Apple. Apple Music Exclusives – Sean Glass As for Jimmy Iovine, he seems to be in the witness protection program. Kind of like streaming itself. There’s a fiction that these exclusives will drive subscriptions. I’m not so sure. You see the average person just doesn’t need one. At least that’s what they believe. Sure, YouTube is free, but the Tidal people kept bitching the competition didn’t pay enough and they were getting poor when they were all rich, the wannabes and already made-its say Spotify doesn’t pay enough and Apple Music…worked even worse than MobileMe and is about as desirable as the Watch. As for their vaunted Beats 1 radio service, when in hell did anybody have a “successful” product and not tell anybody about it, that’s not Entertainment 101. The reason we haven’t heard any ratings numbers is because they suck, you know that. And now the Apple Music Festival in London is going behind the paywall. Watching Apple’s Music Festival will now require a subscription This is like charging people for single episodes of “Vinyl” and “Roadies,” they just don’t care. You’ve got to make people want the product first before you can charge them. What next, an entry fee at the Apple Store? Spotify says the free tier causes conversion, you’ve got to taste it to embrace it, like dope. I was against the service being free on the mobile handset, but data said it caused conversion, so I was convinced. As for the future, tweaks are reasonable, but I wouldn’t go against the data, no growing company does. But we live in an industry where it’s show me the money 24/7 and we do our best to destroy our nest egg. Recording revenues are off by 66% since the turn of the century… Are we gonna blame that all on pirates? No, I think the industry is complicit. First by selling overpriced CDs with only one good track. If I was running the world I’d be more fan-friendly. But no, the music industry would rather have the public as an enemy, in an adversarial position, is this any way to run a business? OF COURSE NOT! As for Lucian Grainge banning exclusives… I’m worried we’ve got a “Hit Men” situation, wherein CBS drops indie promo and everybody else doubles down, loves the lack of competition. Time will see but in a world where cash is everything it’s not hard to believe these acts are dashing for it. Do you know who Travis Scott is? I don’t. And I’m proud of it. And the only people who do are young without credit cards, and they’re gonna tell their parents to cough up ten bucks a month for Apple Music? Come on, they’re just gonna steal it, find it elsewhere like with Frank Ocean. WOW: Entire Frank Ocean Album Is Now Available on SoundCloud… Frank Ocean’s Entire ‘Blonde’ Album Is Now Available on YouTube… You’ve got to convince the people with the wallets first, the parents. I’m interested to see iPhone 7 adoption. Because handsets are no longer subsidized in the U.S. And it is not a revolution, that’s the iPhone 8, next year. What has Apple done for us lately? Just ask Walt Mossberg, who drank the kool-aid, who was a friend of Jobs, he questions a company that hasn’t upgraded its laptops in four years. Mossberg: The post-Jobs Apple has soared financially, but lacks a breakthrough product This is the gang that can’t shoot straight. As for Samsung Galaxy Note 7’s burning up… Who cares? Samsung is the alternative, the yin to the yang. People are gonna jump from Android to Apple like they do from Trump to Clinton, as in NEVER! What kind of enticement is this? Music that used to be free on YouTube, that I can still buy on iTunes, I’ve got to pay ten bucks a month to hear it and then have it disappear? We’re putting the cart before the horse. Closing the barn door before most people see a need to pass through it. Exclusives would work better when everybody paid for a music subscription and they might jump ship. Now it’s just a circle jerk amongst players who want to get paid and a corporation rolling in dough with no future roadmap. But ain’t that America, where everybody has their head in the sand until disaster arrives. Kind of like BlackBerry. The company thought it was indomitable and so did the financial press, and then it crashed. It used less data! It was more secure! There was a keyboard! Who cares! Who cares about these exclusives other than those involved with them? Almost nobody.

We round up rumours of a new 12-inch MacBook, after no refresh in October 2016 by Lewis Painter | 09 Dec 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Is a 13in MacBook going to launch in 2016? When will the 2017 12-inch MacBook be released? What can I expect from the next 12-inch MacBook in terms of tech specs? How much will the 2017 12-inch MacBook cost? Will the 12-inch MacBook replace the MacBook Air range? Apple only released the 2016 variant of the 12in MacBook back in April 2016, but we're already looking to the future and what we could expect from next year's model, the 2017 12in MacBook. Here, we sift through the latest rumours surrounding the 2017 MacBook and also our personal predictions based on previous Apple events, and knowledge of the company. Those of you that want to find out more about the current 12in MacBook released in April 2016 can take a look at our 12in MacBook review, which covers everything from pricing to performance and design, sprinkled with our personal opinions of Apple's latest MacBook. Apple decided not to update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, and decided to cut the 11in MacBook Air completely. This suggests that the MacBook is set to replace the Air line. We suspect a refresh to the MacBook line in March 2017.

So, when are we likely to see the next-generation 12in MacBook? Considering that Apple only recently released the 2016 variant of the laptop, we assumed we wouldn't be seeing another upgrade until next year, 2017. Apple has trademarked three new MacBook mode numbers, according to a Russian trademark filing. The three new model numbers, A1706, A1707 and A1708, were tipped to be a 13in and 15in MacBook Pro, and a MacBook with a 12in screen. This is all according to the reliable KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo - we aren't sure if these model numbers correspond with the new MacBook Pro models - but we will update this article once we confirm the model numbers. We had originally expected to see the 2016 variant of the MacBook announced during 2016's spring Apple event, which was one year on from Apple's unveiling of the very first 12-inch MacBook models. But instead, Apple revealed the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro and new Apple Watch straps, with no mention of an updated MacBook. A few weeks later Apple surprised us by updating the MacBook without any bells and whistles or another event. Apple is a company of habit - new iOS software is showcased every June (along with macOS, tvOS and watchOS) which is then released alongside the latest generation iPhone months later, in September. It has been that way for more than a few years now, with the only exception being with the launch of the iPhone 4. Following Apple's MacBook habits to date, it suggests to us that we'll be seeing the 2017 MacBook sat on our laps between March and May 2017.  New MacBook 2016 rumours: Will the 12in MacBook replace the MacBook Air? In October 2016 Apple showcased four new MacBooks, none of them an Air model. It seems Apple wants us to believe that it hasn't officially killed off the Air, but it all looks like an indirect confirmation of the 12-inch MacBook replacing the Air in Apple's affection and ongoing product portfolio. Apple's MacBook Air design is now eight years old, and it's quite possible that the MacBook is lining up to replace it in the near future. When the MacBook Air first launched, its biggest selling point was its thin and light design, hence the name; but the MacBook now outshines it in those areas. To be honest, barring a major and revolutionary redesign it seems unlikely that the MacBook Air has much of a future ahead of it. Plus, for those looking for ultimate portability there's the new iPad Pro with a 12.9in screen. Content continues below Here's why it doesn't matter that the MacBook is expensive, underpowered and only has one port The last time there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (white and black, and then eventually aluminium). Those were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air reduced. It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models replacing the MacBook Air models at a lower price than they are now, at least eventually - especially considering the MacBook Air’s less-than-exciting 2016 update. According to trusted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the 12in MacBook is now Apple's best-selling computer, closely followed by the 13in MacBook Pro, which adds further fuel to the rumour that it'll soon replace the MacBook Air thanks to its popularity. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also claims that Apple is planning to introduce a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in model in the third quarter of 2016. Kuo is a goldmine for inside Apple information and has been called "the most accurate Apple analyst in the world", providing accurate rumours regarding the iPhone 6s months in advance of its release, along with a flurry of predictions about the upcoming iPhone 7 which many assume to be true. Current rumours suggest an October hardware event where Apple will announce the 2016 MacBook Pro - will the company announce a larger MacBook alongside it? However, while Kuo is usually accurate, we're not too confident about this one. The rumour hasn't been backed up by any leaks or other sources, and it seems like a pretty strange move to release a new MacBook only 1in larger than the current model, so it's best to take this with a pinch of salt. If true, we think it signals the end of the MacBook Air range. See more MacBook Air rumours here. New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: UK price While we’re still a way away from the official announcement of the 2017 MacBook, we can already speculate about the pricing as Apple rarely changes the price of its range from generation to generation, unless it’s a fairly hefty upgrade. With that being said, the 2016 MacBook Pro will set you back £1,449 for the basic variant and £1,949 for a more powerful variant - and the prices have all gone up since Brexit too (Basic Air is £100 more, and basic MacBook is £200 more expensive!) New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: Design and features Looking at the change in design from the 2015 MacBook to the 2016 MacBook, it suggests that we won’t be seeing huge physical changes. In fact, the only change in design from the original MacBook and the 2016 MacBook was the addition of a new colour option, Rose Gold, to go alongside the readily available Gold, Silver and Space Grey options. Aside from that, the design hasn't changed for the MacBook. It's incredibly thin at 13.1mm, and it weighs just 0.9kg, making it 24 percent thinner than the MacBook Air, and we don’t expect that to change dramatically in future. Will the 2016 MacBook have a Force Touch keyboard? Update 14 October: According to 9to5Mac, Apple is in talks with the Foxconn startup, Sonder - a company that uses E Ink technology to display its keys (see a video here). This allows a way of customising keys and even adding symbols which would not be possible on a regular keyboard. It's rumoured that Apple will use this technology in their next MacBook. Back in autumn 2015, it emerged that Apple had filed a patent that appeared to show its design for a Force Touch capable keyboard. Along with the 2015 MacBook Pro, the 2015 MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, which gave electric pulses that feel like clicks, but is a glass plate that doesn't actually move. Like on the iPhone 6s, you can press harder for a deeper click to access menus and options within certain apps. The new MacBook also has keys unlike any other Mac, which have very little travel in order to make the chassis ultra-thin. The newly discovered patent shows what seems to be a whole keyboard and trackpad area fit to house this technology. As this shows, the whole keyboard and trackpad, plus areas to the left and right of the pad, could theoretically be customised to the user's tastes and, for the first time, not have a physical keyboard. However, we have seen Apple file patents in the past that are to bookmark ideas for the future. It'd be amazing if this technology were included in the new MacBook next year, but we feel this is one for the coming years. It would potentially allow you to have several language keyboards saved and switch between them on the adaptable display. We can but dream. Imagine typing on a surface that felt like a keyboard, but was actually electric feedback telling your brain you're pressing keys? If this is Force Touch's future, we are excited. Will the MacBook feature an Apple Pencil-compatible trackpad? It's not the only new addition to the MacBook either, if the latest patent approval is anything to go by. According to a patent filed by Apple which was recently approved, an upcoming Mac could boast compatibility with the Apple Pencil - although the Apple Pencil depicted in the patent is far more advanced than the one on sale at the moment. The Pencil in question features a number of sensors that could detect movement, orientation and depth and, according to the patent, could be used with a Mac as an 'air mouse' or possibly even a joystick for gaming. The patent reads: "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." It doesn't end there, either - apparently an upcoming Mac trackpad will feature Apple Pencil support, allowing users to use and draw directly onto the trackpad with the precision of the iPad Pro. While the patent doesn't mention whether the trackpad will be built into a MacBook or offered as a standalone Mac trackpad, we imagine that if Apple plans on utilising the patent, it'll do so with its newest line of laptops - the MacBook.  Will Apple discontinue Thunderbolt? One question that has arisen is whether the introduction of USB-C spells the end of Thunderbolt. We don't think that Apple will drop Thunderbolt from its Pro Mac line up any time soon, but the standard may well disappear from the consumer level Macs eventually. The reason we think it will remain on the MacBook Pro, Mac Pro and the iMac is Apple's efforts to convince the industry to adopt it since its introduction in 2011. However, Apple also promoted FireWire to the industry and eventually removed that from its Macs. New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: Tech specs What can we expect to see from the 2017 MacBook in terms of design? While rumours are scarce at these early stages, there is one interesting rumour that, if true, could herald in a new generation of Force Touch-enabled keyboards for Apple's laptop line. Processors The next-generation MacBook is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors: that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But there's another, less predictable, possibility. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has spotted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE" being supported. This isn't a chip family that anyone has heard of, but it's probably an Apple custom ARM chip: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Apple might be about to put ARM chips in its new MacBooks. Image courtesy of Techtastic Will the 2016 MacBook have LTE connectivity? It seems that sharing your iPhone's cellular connection with your MacBook wasn't enough for Apple, if the latest patent approval is anything to go by. The patent, as described by the US Patent and Trademark Office, will allow the company to embed LTE hardware in the 2017 MacBook, making it the first cellular-enabled Mac in Apple's range, past or present.  As well as LTE connectivity, the patent describes the use of Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth and satallite connectivity, and mentions ways to boost the signal without interference from the metal body of the MacBook. It's worth mentioning that this idea isn't new, though - it was originally filed on June 8 2015, and there was also talk of a 3G-enabled MacBook Pro back in 2008, but the idea was eventually rejected by Steve Jobs as he felt it'd tie the user down to a particular carrier.  Thinking of buying a Mac?

Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will the new MacBook Air be released in the UK? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? The MacBook Air has had an update in 2016, but it was such a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model - that we're looking ahead to the next MacBook Air update. Will we have to wait until 2017 for a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup, or was the 2016 announcement just a teaser for something bigger near the end of 2016? In this article we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air for 2016 or 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. After the Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it seems unclear if the MacBook Air line has been completely killed off. No new MacBook Air was announced at the event and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions, and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind.  It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099 - this is likely due to Brexit. Meaning the older MacBook Airs are more expensive to buy now! We see this as Apple's way of completely cutting the Air product line, as not many people will want it with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: UK release date Apple hosted a special event on 21 March 2016, and ahead of the event we (quite naturally) expected new MacBook Air and MacBook models. After all, the spring event represented one year since both were last updated (or one year since it was first launched in the MacBook's case) and before that new Air models arrived in April of 2014. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. Instead, we had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that's only for the 13in model. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the 2017 MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March-May as has been the case in previous years.  See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release | New Mac mini release New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that a 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. Content continues below However, the 11in may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We think that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether.  Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think that Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015).  Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suspect that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leaped past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out any more," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst forsees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011.  Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. MacBook Air 2016 release date: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminum again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that some time in 2016 or 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand.  What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implimenting the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the current price of the 11in MacBook Air. New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update 'as soon as October'. This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. Although with this being said, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2016 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch Update 27 October 2016: We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built in to the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen any time soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When will Apple release the 5th-gen Apple TV? Interface changes Apple TV streaming service Complete guide to 4th-gen Apple TV (2015) When will Apple release the next Apple TV - the 5th-generation Apple TV, or Apple TV 5 - in the UK? And what new features, tech specs, UK price and design changes should we expect from the new 5G Apple TV for 2016 or 2017? The fourth-gen Apple TV - the first Apple TV device to allow users to install apps - was unveiled by Apple at the iPhone 6s launch event on 9 September 2015, and went on sale weeks later. Nearly a year later, we're looking ahead to the launch of the next, fifth-gen (5G) Apple TV. Indeed, there are already rumours that a next-generation Apple TV might arrive in late 2016, although Apple could also be waiting until next year to release a special model to celebrate the Apple TV's 10th birthday. In this article we gather all the evidence related to the 5G Apple TV's release date, as well as reporting on all the rumours and clues about the 2016 Apple TV's new features, tech specs, UK price and design changes. However, if you're still interested in the Apple TV that's available right now, we've got plenty of information about the 2015 Apple TV, including pricing and the best places to buy. And don't forget our Apple TV buying guide 2016. Read next: How to set up the new Apple TV | New Apple TV vs old Apple TV | Apple TV tips UK Last updated to include the news that the third-gen Apple TV has been discontinued, and what this might mean for the release of the fifth-gen Apple TV. New Apple TV 2016 release date rumours UK: When will Apple release the 5th-gen Apple TV? We feel that Apple may choose to hold it back until the start of 2017 and make more of the product's 10th anniversary. Here's when the four generations of Apple TV launched: 1st-gen Apple TV: January 2007 2nd-gen Apple TV: September 2010 3rd-gen Apple TV: March 2012 4th-gen Apple TV: September 2015 Evidently, Apple updates its Apple TV less often than its iPhones, iPads and Macs: there was a three-and-a-half-year wait between the first and second models, and between the third and fourth. Based on that, it would be reasonable to expect the 5th-gen Apple TV to appear in 2018 or even 2019, and we certainly don't have firm evidence to dispute that. But our instincts tell us that the Apple TV's position and status in the company's portfolio of products has changed. It used to be a sideline and a hobby, but with the growing importance of streaming media and smart-home applications, and with the arrival on the platform of games and its own App Store, Apple TV is moving to centre stage. And we're not the only ones to think Apple is likely to start updating the TV more frequently from now on. A report (link for subscribers only) in DigiTimes last year predicted that the fifth-generation Apple TV would go into trial production as early as December 2015, with volume production starting in the first quarter of 2016. Changes were said to include a dramatically improved hardware performance and new functions "to help it no longer serve only as a set-top box". Content continues below Read next: 14 best Apple TV alternatives | Best TV streaming devices Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV Apple has officially discontinued the third-generation Apple TV after being on sale since 2012. The move from Apple forces users to invest in the upgraded fourth-gen Apple TV, which starts at £139 compared to the £59 price-tag of the third-gen device. The third-gen Apple TV didn't feature tvOS or the App Store, but was used as a budget option for users that only wanted to stream content to their TVs.   The choice to remove the third-gen Apple TV from the Apple TV lineup suggests, to us at least, that the wheels are in motion and that the fifth-gen Apple TV will be making an appearance sooner, rather than later.  Q3 2016 earnings call comments: 'Something bigger' on the way Tim Cook made non-specific but intriguing comments about the future of the Apple TV at Apple's Q3 2016 earnings conference call. He made it very clear that Apple has big plans for its TV division, and plans to build "something bigger" with the product and surrounding ecosystem. Near the end of the hour-long call, a question was posed by Kulbinder Garcha, the managing director of Credit Suisse: "I think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck in the sixties and seventies, and the experience hasn't changed," Garcha said. "I understand that you've got the Apple TV box out, but in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something Apple wants to do themselves, do you want to partner, could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity, as opposed to, here's an Apple box and we sell some units but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size?" Tim Cook's reply was enigmatic. "The introduction of Apple TV and tvOS in last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall… think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time," he said. "I don't want to be more precise than that but you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of." New Apple TV release date: WWDC 2016 and tvOS 10 Back in spring we argued that the 5G Apple TV was unlikely to be launched at WWDC 2016, since the event came round less than a year after Apple rolled out the fourth-gen model and none of the previous Apple TVs had launched in summer. Indeed, Apple launched no new hardware at the event whatsoever. But the new version of the Apple TV's operating system, tvOS 10, got considerable stage time. As we often observe when discussing new iPhones and iPads, many of the most significant updates come not from new hardware but from free software updates. Siri gets some big improvements in tvOS's new update: it can now search the Apple TV's movie and TV database with more complex queries. It can search YouTube, too, and any live streaming channels can be launched by saying "watch" and then the name of the channel. There's a new dark mode for Apple TV, which makes the background black instead of the bright white we're used to. And the Apple TV Remote app has been redesigned; it now offers all the Siri remote features and can be used for Siri queries using the built-in mic. One last thing Apple didn't mention, but has since come to light in Apple support documents, is that the requirement for Siri Remote compatibility for Apple TV games has been relaxed. That means they can focus on MFi game controllers, which are much more game-friendly than the Siri remote. See: Best Apple TV game controllers. Read our Complete guide to tvOS's new features for more information on the software update. New Apple TV release date: 10th-anniversary Apple TV Looking again at those launch dates above, we feel like the looming tenth anniversary of the Apple TV might be a tempting occasion for a big update. Apple tends to dislike historical wallowing - famously refusing to build a museum in its new headquarters because "we're focused on the future, not the past" - but there is a precendent for an anniversary product in the form of the Twentieth Anniversary Mac (number 4 in our article The 5 weirdest Macs of all time). Read next: Best Apple TV game controllers | Best Apple TV games | Best Apple TV apps New Apple TV 2016 release date rumours: Apple's 27 October event While many assumed that we would see the introduction of the fifth-generation Apple TV at Apple's October 2016 event, the event focused mainly on the new MacBook Pro. The New MacBook Pro features a Touch Bar, offering contextual controls depending on the app you're using - you can find out more about the 2016 MacBook Pro here: MacBook Pro 2016 UK release date, pricing and features The Apple TV wasn't completely out of the spotlight though, as Apple introduced the TV app for the Apple TV and iOS devices. The app looks to integrate streaming content from a number of providers, but is US-only at first. Those in the US can expect the app to appear as part of a software update in December, while those in the UK have no solid release date just yet.  New Apple TV 2016 rumours UK: Interface changes An Apple TV owner's user experience is largely dictated by the software side of things. How will Apple change the Apple TV interface? New cross-provider programming guide interface Apple's next big plan for its Apple TV isn't new hardware: it's a software-based programme guide. That sounds boring, but it's potentially a powerful way of improving user-friendliness for those who are signed up to multiple content providers. The first foundation of this strategy was laid with the announcements of tvOS 10 at WWDC in June. tvOS 10 includes a new feature known as 'single sign in', whereby a user can sign in once, with a single login and password, and tvOS will then automatically sign into a whole raft of services for them: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and so on. Nice and convenient. But for many of us who do use multiple TV and movie services, a bigger issue than multiple sign-ins is simply keeping track of everything that's available to watch. Each service will have its own ways of highlighting new, popular or user-tailored recommendations, but having to open up two, three or even more apps to check out what's on offer when planning an evening's viewing is a slight pain. This is where Apple comes in. The company is really good at stuff like this: forging the relationships with the content providers and creating a simple and trusted umbrella interface enabling users to browse and access everything they want. That was what iTunes was so good at, and the iOS App Store is successful in that regard too. We just hope the new Apple TV programming guide has strong search. The App Store still has disappointing search, with worthless spammy apps that are good at SEO ranking above legitimate apps on relevant search terms. The two scenarios aren't quite the same - there isn't really such a thing as spam TV - but Apple still needs to find a way to foreground higher-quality content so it isn't drowned out by the volume. For more information about upcoming changes to the Apple TV's interface, take a look at our complete guide to tvOS 10. New Apple TV 2016 release date rumours UK: Apple TV streaming service Update 15 August: Rumours suggest that Twitter are in talks with Apple to launch their Apple TV app. The Twitter app will be enable NFL Live Streaming capabilities. Rumours that Apple will launch a TV streaming service have been around for a while. If you'd like more of an in-depth discussion of this topic, take a look at our separate article about Apple's streaming service plans. Unfortunately for anyone who was looking forward to the launch of the service, it sounds like it will be further delayed as Apple continues to negotiate with the TV networks in the US. The December 2015 report from Bloomberg claims that Apple is putting its plans for the streaming service on hold because the cable companies and networks are proving resistant to the idea. In fact, Apple may ditch the idea altogether, focusing instead on offering the tvOS platform for media companies to sell their content directly to consumers via the App Store, according to the Bloomberg report. Bloomberg reckons the reason for the resistance is Apple's demand for content at a price that the networks aren't happy with. CBS CEO Les Moonves, who has often commented on the rumoured service, has also claimed that Apple has put the streaming service plans "on hold", according to Bloomberg. Previously Moonves had hinted that the rumoured Apple TV steaming service would arrive in 2015. The revelation came during an earlier interview with Bloomberg TV in which he suggested his company would soon come to an arrangement with Apple. Moonves said: "Apple is having conversations with everyone about doing their own streaming services. We have had those conversations, as have the other networks. Do I think something will happen? Probably, but I don't know when." This isn't the first time Moonves has made comments about the rumoured service. Earlier this year he made a similar revelation in an interview at a Re/code conference, giving the impression that he was in ongoing conversations with Apple.

Here are all the clues, hints and theories about Apple's rumoured (and possibly mythical) iPhone 7 Pro handset, including release date, design, features, leaks and mockups. Has it been pushed back to 2017, or cancelled entirely? by Lewis Painter | 15 Sep 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will Apple launch the iPhone 7 Pro? Does the iPhone 7 Pro (or plain iPhone Pro) even exist? Apple held an event on 7 September 2016 where it announced the iPhomne 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. In the months leading up to the launch a wide number of pundits predicted that they would be joined by a 'Pro' model, but with just days to go this rumour absurptly stopped: it was almost unilaterally agreed that the iPhone 7 Pro was dead - and this proved to be correct. But the iPhone 7 Pro remains a rumour. Perhaps we will see an interation of it next year; perhaps Apple was indeed planning an iPhone Pro and changed its plans when it was able to set up sufficient camera components to equip all of its 5.5-inch iPhones with twin lenses. Perhaps the iPhone 7 Pro never existed at all. In this article we discuss all the clues, hints and theories about Apple's rumoured (and possibly mythical) iPhone 7 Pro handset, including release date, design, features, leaked photos and mockup illustrations. If you're looking for information about the current iPhone range, by the way, read our iPhone 7 review, iPhone 7 Plus review, iPhone 6s review, Phone 6s Plus review, iPhone SE review; and our iPhone buyers' guide. iPhone 7 Pro UK release date rumours UK: The Pro theory When Apple introduced a larger counterpart to the iPhone 6, the iPhone 6 Plus, Apple fans were shocked - for many years there was only a single flagship iPhone per year, and now fans had a choice between two. This continued with the introduction of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, offering consumers the choice between a 4.7in and 5.2in smartphone. There are slight differences between the two handsets, with the Plus model featuring a higher resolution display and better camera tech. Well, in recent months a rumour has grown suggesting that Apple is thinking about expanding this to three new iPhones each autumn - it didn't happen with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but there's a feeling that September 2017 could see an iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus (or iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, depending on how jaunty Apple's branding department is feeling) accompanied by an iPhone 7 Pro or iPhone 8 Pro. The general theory is that the Pro would be much like the Plus-branded iPhone of the same generation in terms of design, but would offer more 'Pro' features for those that want it. iPhone 7 Pro UK release date rumours UK: Release date Bloomberg predicted (correctly) that Apple would release only two iPhone models in September 2016, meaning we did not get to see the hoped-for three new iPhones as we had been expecting for a few months. Bloomberg's sources suggested that the dual camera we expected to see on the iPhone 7 Pro was actually going to be given to the iPhone 7 Plus. However, Nikkei claims that the 'Pro' smartphone will make an appearance in 2017, the year of the iPhone's 10th birthday, instead. It's said that the premium model will sport an OLED display similar to that of the Galaxy S7 Edge with two curved edges, and may even be bigger than the 5.5in Plus model.  Interestingly, rumours suggest that the iPhone 7 range will in fact be named the iPhone 6SE. There's no information on the Pro-line of iPhones, however these rumours are in-line with what Evan Blass ‏suggested on Twitter (@evleaks) - that Apple will be naming its next phone line the iPhone 6SE. Content continues below iPhone 7 Pro design rumours: What will the iPhone 7 Pro look like? What will the Pro smartphone look like? Japanese magazine Mac Fan has shared a detailed design schematic of the upcoming iPhone 7 Pro and although we should take leaks with a pinch of salt, the image looks promising. According to the magazine and the leaked schematics, the iPhone 7 Pro will feature the same overall design and dimensions as the iPhone 6s Plus, but with a couple of notable changes. The first notable change is one that Apple fans have been dreading - the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack from the bottom of the smartphone. (If there isn't a headphone port on the iPhone 7, there's going to be a lot of demand for three things: Lightning headphones, Bluetooth headphones, and Bluetooth speakers.) Interestingly, while many assumed the extra space provided be the removal would be filled by a second speaker, but according to the schematics, the Pro will feature one speaker like the rest of the line-up. As well as the removal of the 3.5mm jack, the iPhone 7 Pro is to feature a dual-camera setup on the rear of the device, slightly protruding from the shell unlike the claimed flush design of the iPhone 7. We talk a little more about the rumoured dual-camera setup below. Another addition to the iPhone 7 Pro is the Smart Connector, which was originally reported to be a part of the entire iPhone 7 family but is now unique to the Pro. It’s not the first leak showcasing an iPad Pro-esque Smart Connector on an iPhone 7 Pro either, as last month a photo leaked claiming to be the sleek iPhone 7 Pro chassis, complete with dual-camera setup, redesigned antennas and a Smart Connector. The photo can be seen below: Based on the above leak, Feld & Volk has created a range of mock-ups showcasing the design, helping us get an idea of what the iPhone 7 Pro marketing will look like following the launch: Another leak that adds fuel to the flames of an iPhone 7 Pro comes in the form of a case leak. Or two. Or more. As first picked up by 9to5Mac, cases claiming to be for the next generation smartphone appeared online, seemingly confirming a number of rumours about the upcoming smartphone, including a Smart Connector on the rear of the smartphone. You can see the photos below: The images, if true, gives us a glimpse of the (assumingly finalised) design of the iPhone 7 Pro, complete with a binocular-esque dual-camera setup aligned horizontally with the rear microphone and dual flash. However, we have our reservations about the authenticity of the leaks. Why? To work with Apple to produce cases for an unreleased product is a difficult, if not nearly impossible feat. Of course, high-end manufacturers have more chance of this happening - but the company that created the cases is realtively unknown. If the company did manage to work with Apple, why would it ruin chances of future partnerships by leaking valuable information months before its release? And why would they be on sale right now? So, even though we think this is what the iPhone 7 Pro will look like, we doubt that these 'leaks' are genuine.  More recently, notorious Apple leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer of nowherelse.fr has tweeted a myriad of photos the entire iPhone 7 family - the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and 7 Pro too - with the Pro featuring the much rumoured dual-camera setup and smart connector. You can see the tweet below: And now, the back... https://t.co/QobAsGEIC6 #iPhone7 #iPhone7Plus #iPhone7Pro pic.twitter.com/r5IZFxqmWS — Steve Hemmerstoffer (@stagueve) July 18, 2016 While Hemmerstoffer is usually fairly accurate with his leaks, we're not entirely convinced by these photos. Why? If you look carefully at the rear of the iPhone 7 Pro, you'll notice something a little 'off' with regards to colour/brightness surrounding the rumoured smart connector - possibly a poor Photoshop attempt, although it could also be weird lighting. While we hope that these are in fact real, we'll have to wait until September to find out for sure.  Our most recent look at the upcoming iPhone 7 Pro comes via popular YouTube Channel Unbox Therapy where YouTuber Lewis Hilsenteger shows off the upcoming iPhone 7 Plus (or Pro, as it sports 'pro' features like the Smart Connector) and, like with other rumours, seems to confirm a number of features of the upcoming smartphone. It features the rear-facing dual-camera setup, the missing headphone jack that has caused controversy for almost a year now and even the iPad Pro-esque smart connector. During the video Hilsenteger uses digital calipers to measure the iPhone 7 Plus/Pro chassis, which is apparently fractionally slimmer than the current iPhone 6s Plus. It's claimed that the iPhone 7 Pro will be 7.14mm when compared to the 7.18mm 6s Plus, although this is within a margin of error in the calipers and as this is only a dummy case unit, it may be thicker once the internals are included. It's also worth noting that the previously rumoured Blue iPhone 7 was inaccurate (it's apparently going to be a darker shade of grey/black instead), bringing the valididity of this video into question.  iPhone 7 Pro pricing rumours: How much will the iPhone 7 Pro cost? If the iPhone 7 Pro is real, how much will it cost compared to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus? While we're still months away from finding out for definite, a recent leak via Weibo seems to provide us with pricing information for not only the iPhone 7, but the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro too. While the pricing may be inaccurate, especially as it's in Chinese Yuan and not GBP, it seems to confirm the existance of the third iPhone model if nothing else.  It's worth keeping in mind that this was intended for the Chinese market and we haven't seen much in the way of change in pricing, only for the top-end models.  iPhone 7 Pro feature rumours: What will the iPhone 7 Pro feature? The iPhone 7 Pro is said to be largely the same as the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of internals, boasting the same display and processor, but with a few notable differences that bring it into the ‘Pro’ class. According to a report from KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who has an amazing track record with predicting unannounced Apple devices and features, the iPhone 7 Pro will feature a whopping 3GB of RAM, up from 2GB available on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. This should give it an edge in terms of performance and coupled with (what we expect to be) a 64-bit A10 chipset, should provide users with an incredibly powerful smartphone. A recent report from The Wall Street Journal suggests that Apple may be about to ditch the 16GB base model, and that the iPhone 7 family (7, 7 Plus and 7 Pro) will all come with at least 32GB storage as standard. Writing for the Wall Street Journal, Joanna Stern claims that "The new iPhones are expected to have more storage for those photos. Instead of 16GB as a starting point for the entry-level iPhone, the new starting point will be 32GB, according to a person familiar with Apple’s iPhone plans. Hallelujah! I’ve long said that keeping the 16GB iPhone was just a ploy for Apple to get people to buy the 64GB model—for $100 extra." While WSJ doesn't provide any evidence to back up the claim, publication has a fairly accurate track record when it comes to leaks and rumour,s so this one might just be true. Along with the upgraded internals, the flagship feature of the iPhone 7 Pro is said to be a rear facing dual-camera setup comprised of two iSight cameras. The dual-camera setup is said to protrude slightly from the case as opposed to the flush nature of the iPhone 7. There is a good reason for this though, as its been speculated that this may allow for recording of standard and slow-mo videos at the same time, upgraded Live Photos and even possibly providing users with different focal lengths. Of course, the official use for the dual-camera setup will not be revealed until the launch event in a few months’ time. Another feature headed to the Pro smartphone is the Smart Connector featured on the iPad Pro 12.9 and iPad Pro 9.7. It makes sense for Apple to only include the Smart Connector on the iPhone 7 Pro though – the company launched a 12.9 in tablet featuring the technology in September 2015 and instead of launching an iPad Air 3 with a Smart Connector, it was named the iPad Pro 9.7. It only makes sense for Apple to continue the Smart Connector = Pro branding with the iPhone, supporting both the rumoured inclusion of the Smart Connector as well as the name of the smartphone. Last, but not least, it has been suggested that the iPhone 7 Pro may be waterproof much like Samsung’s 2016 flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S7. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, though not marketed as being waterproof, can survive a small stint in water thanks to a gasket around the sides of the smartphones and the logic board being covered with a waterproofing material. It won’t survive as long as the Galaxy S7 submerged under water, but hopefully the iPhone 7 Pro will. We’ll be updating this section with the latest rumours as soon as we hear them, so make sure you check back regularly for the latest information on the iPhone 7 Pro.

The growth in the number of global smartphone sales is huge. Not only is the number of manufacturers increasing, but also the users ready to embrace diverse brands. Consequently, the condition has led to a boom in Chinese smartphone market. Much to the tech industry’s surprise, Chinese upstarts emerged out of nowhere and collected an important chunk into their name. Brands like Xiaomi Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. have created quite an impact in the international market this year. A part of global consumers, for a change, chose to go for these brands instead of high-end Samsung Electronics Ltd. or Apple Inc. smartphones. These new-age manufacturers have their eyes set on the international market, especially in the United States. For one thing, they aim to steal smartphone sales in the region where dominants Samsung and Apple are ruling. Apple iPhone Sales – The Point Where Innovation Is Lagging Sure, the Chinese brands are powerful and rising at a tremendous pace. But, it’s also true that they are not mighty enough to create a dent in the business of global giants' duopoly. Samsung and Apple are the global dominants to be precise, which of course everyone is aware of. China hit Apple smartphone sales awfully in the home ground, but the global smartphone sales for the company have been stable. In other words, the business remained undented until some time back. Samsung Galaxy Note7 recently came to life cracking a bigger irony for Apple with its phenomenal design. Apple, on the hand, which is expecting the iPhone 7 release in September has minimal overhaul plans. Again, the situation makes Apple lag behind Samsung when it comes to targeting users. Samsung is currently ruling the global smartphone business. It’s not that anyone can remain on the top for a long while. But for now, Samsung is at a point, where only Apple’s game-changing innovation can uproot it from its dominant position. Obviously, we’ll have to wait till the iPhone 8 release to witness the shift. Why would anyone go for a piece that looks exactly like the one launched a year back with minor design changes? A point that dually needs to noted. Meanwhile, Samsung is trying everything in its power to please, appeal, and hook up its Brobdingnagian user base. Samsung’s shares are gradually outperforming Apple’s undented record. The South Korean behemoth has raised the bar too high with its recent releases. Moreover, the company has moved a step forward in its bid for international dominance. The global smartphone sales saw a hike in the last quarter of 2015 according to Gartner. Samsung occupied the bigger chunk of market share with 22.5 percent of the global market. The number of units sold by Samsung was 320,220. On the contrary, Apple managed to sell only 15.9 percent of the overall market with a sale of 225.851 units. This month, Samsung renewed its all-time Jan’2013 hit by touching 1,675,000. The growth in shares has increased by 45 percent from a year ago. Over the same period, Apple’s shares have dropped by 5 percent. Apple has its minimal innovation to blame for the massacre this year. The release of iPhone 4SE and the premium iPhone 6S Plus failed to recreate the so-called “Apple Magic”. Samsung’s Dominance Likely to Continue Until iPhone 8 Release It’s quite clear that Samsung has a clear run on the global market at present. Thanks to the release of Galaxy S7 clan and Note7. The potent marketing strategy of S7 and Note7 has created a halo effect on other Samsung smartphones too. In fact, every handset in Samsung’s portfolio has received a strong boost in their potential sales. iPhone 7 is unlikely to create a strong impact, which will pave more way for Samsung to continue ruling the market. On the negative side, the impact on Apple iPhone sales which we’ve explained above doesn’t include the one from China’s leading companies yet. They are selling their smartphones in the larger chunk of the world. Their tremendous sales growth in fastest-growing economies like India and their home country are adding more to the misery. Of course, like I previously said, these are likely to alter Apple’s international sales picture. Thanks, to higher priced iPhones, but Samsung is likely to give Apple a hard time throughout the year. The bigger question that arises is will Apple allow Samsung to dent its sales structure after iPhone 7 release. Against all odds, will consumers embrace the newest Apple product even though it arrives with the minimal overhaul? Only time will tell.

Read on for iPad Pro 2 release date, specs, new features, design & UK price rumours. Latest: a new 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro with a bezel-free screen and no Home button has been predicted for 2017, and analyst Gene Munster is predicting a folding iPad in the near future by David Price | 14 Dec 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the iPad Pro 2 be released in the UK? (Or whatever they call the next version of the iPad Pro.) And what new features will be added to the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions of the iPad Pro 2? The iPad Pro 2 launch is an exciting prospect - but we may have to wait a bit longer. Apple made a splash in September 2015 when it unveiled its first giant tablet: a device known at the time only as the iPad Pro and rocking a blockbuster 12.9-inch screen, quad speakers and a super-quick processor chip. The following March a smaller and frankly better 9.7-inch version of the iPad Pro came out, creating mild naming complications (we now call them the iPad Pro 12.9 and iPad Pro 9.7 respectively) and kindling a degree of regret in the hearts of early adopters. But we are now looking ahead to the future of the iPad Pro line. When will Apple release the iPad Pro 2, and what new features and design changes will this product incorporate? Will there be separate 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch editions of the iPad Pro 2 - will there even be a 7.9-inch model, a sort of iPad Pro mini, or a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2? Our iPad Pro 2 release date & new features rumour roundup weighs up all the clues, hints and evidence about the new iPad Pro models, as well as our wishlist of new features that are missing from the current generation of iPad Pro hardware. Check back regularly for the latest iPad Pro 2 rumours. Updated, 14 December 2016, with a rumour of a folding iPad; on 7 Dec, to discuss rumours about the iPad Pro 2's design - that it will be thicker than the iPad Pro and feature mostly bezel-free screens and no Home button; and on 30 Nov, with rumours about a new inbetweener 10.5in iPad. Read next: iPad buying guide 2016/2017 | Best cheap iPad Pro deals UK iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: Launch date When will the next iPad Pro come out in the UK? March 2017, most likely. During Apple's September 2016 event, there was no mention of the iPad line (focusing instead on the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2), while its October event showcased a smart if costly new MacBook Pro. If it had a new iPad Pro up its sleeve, surely Apple could have found time at one of these events to mention it... which suggests to us that the iPad Pro 2 is being held back until next year. And March is generally when Apple holds its first event of the year. (After the MacBook Pro launch, there were rumours of a third autumn launch event or product refresh from Apple, focusing on the Mac Pro line and potentially squeezing in some iPads at the same time. It's pretty clear now that this isn't going to happen.) iPad Pro 2 release: One iPad launch event, or two? As with the two strands of iPhone models - the mid-size iPhone 7 and large-screen iPhone 7 Plus, both launched in September 2016, and the smaller iPhone SE, released in March 2016 - there are two schools of thought here. Either Apple will unify the two Pro brands into a single annual update event, or it will continue to update half the models in spring and the other half in autumn. Content continues below Both theories have down sides. If, as now looks likely, Apple does a full refresh (9.7-in and 12.9-inch together) in March 2017, then the current hardware will be starting to feel old before then - the original Pro will be 18 months old, which is a long time to be the most expensive tablet on Apple's books. Then again, the company would have been in almost as tricky a position if it did a full refresh in September, presumably upsetting a bunch of people who just bought new devices. Three major iPad updates in the space of 12 months might just be taking the mickey. There's also something a bit messy, a bit un-Apple, about having two press event to announce what would essentially amount to two SKUs of the same product line. I think the company will want to keep things simple. A final thought, however, is that people don't update their iPads as often as their iPhones: only 6 percent of the respondents to our poll said they get a new iPad every year. It's therefore debatable whether Apple actually needs to bring out new iPads this often. It could probably switch to a biennial release schedule without causing much of a problem. Read next: iPad Air 3 rumours | iPad mini 5 rumours | Apple Pencil 2 rumours iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: New 10.5-inch iPad Pro The latest rumour suggests that Apple won't update its iPad Pro line-up again in 2016, but will make up for this in 2017 by launching a new size. Ming-Chi Kuo, a market analyst with a strong track record, has published a report making predictions about Apple's moves over the next couple of years. Kuo is cautious in his iPad sales predictions - cutting a previous estimate of 45 to 50 million for the year to 35 to 40 million, partly because of a lack of new products in the near term: despite a comparatively strong performance in Q3 2016, iPad sales remain flat - but argues that Apple will sell three sizes of iPad Pro. There will be a 12.9-inch Pro, a 9.7-inch Pro and a new 10.5-inch Pro, Kuo predicts, with the smallest offered as a low-cost option with a lower-powered processor as well as a smaller screen. Kuo's reasoning is that an 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro would sell well to the education and business sectors: "If the iPad comes in a larger size, such as a 10.5-inch model, we believe it will be helpful to bid for tenders within the commercial and education markets. As a result, we expect Apple to launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017." These three iPad sizes don't include the 7.9-inch form factor of the iPad mini. Apple could continue to sell the mini alongside the three iPad Pros, but the success of the iPhone 6 Plus and the upcoming launch of the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple may feel that this area is covered by its phablet offerings. But we'll discuss the prospects of an 'iPad Pro mini' in the next section. This new 10.5in or even 10.9in size is rumoured to come with a bezel-free design, as it will accommodate the larger screen in a smaller form-factor. This might potentially see the end of the home button. iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: Will there be an iPad Pro mini? Following the launch of the 9.7-inch Pro it's now firmly established that the Pro brand doesn't just refer to Apple's biggest tablets - instead, it refers to a set of specs and features and, in a way that's hard to define, any tablet that sits at the top of Apple's range. If we accept that a 9.7-inch tablet can be an iPad Pro, could we get a 7.9-inch Pro as well? The highly respected securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks so. In a recent report, Kuo predicted that there would be no more iPad updates in 2016, but that multiple new iPads would be launched in 2017. These will include a new inbetweener 10.5-inch iPad Pro, he reckons (as we discuss in the section above); and also a 7.9-inch iPad Pro, displacing the iPad mini line. We could end up in a situation where every current iPad is branded as an iPad Pro, which would be a bit strange. The truth is that there's no concrete reason why there can't be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro 2, but for various reasons we still don't expect Apple to do this. For one thing, unlike the Air line-up, the minis are still being updated; the mini 4 came out at the same event as the first iPad Pro, which suggests that Apple plans to keep both brands going at the same time. And besides, the Pro brand has always existed in opposition to a lower-end alternative: the MacBook Pro sits opposite the MacBook Air (and plain MacBook); the Mac Pro opposite the iMac; and so on. Apple can't just call every tablet a Pro. We're starting to suspect that the Air brand may be phased out across Apple's laptop and tablet departments, but there still needs to be two lines left in each of these areas. Apple still sell a MacBook Pro and a 12-inch MacBook, we expect; in the same way, we'd expect there to be iPad Pro models and iPad mini models. To read more about the iPad mini 5 - or the iPad Pro mini - then take a look at our iPad mini 5 rumour roundup. iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: Design What design changes can we expect from the new iPad Pro 2? Folding iPad We'll start with the most out-there rumour. Analyst Gene Munster - he of the relentless and widely mocked 'Apple television' predictions, who in my opinion was somewhat vindicated when it turned out that Apple had been developing a telly but gave up on the plan - has predicted that Apple is going to make a foldable iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, cites recent patent activity that shows Apple is exploring the idea of a foldable iPhone, and extrapolates this concept to the tablet sphere (where, because of the larger form factor of the devices, a folding design probably makes more sense). The timing of the prediction is interesting, coming as it does shortly after the end of the first series of Westworld, HBO's violent and disorienting TV series based on the 1970s Yul Brynner film of the same name. In Westworld, the human programmers who set the behaviours and personalities of the park's western-themed android inhabitants do all their programming on slick foldable tablets. The foldable tablet designs on the show make a lot of sense and look fantastic. (The idea of programmers working on tablets seems less plausible.) Bezel-free screen Macotakara, a Japanese-language Apple site, predicts that the iPad Pro 2 will have a largely bezel-free screen and no Home button, citing sources in Taiwan. The bezel (the non-screen area around the edge of the screen on an iPad, which you hold while using the device) will apparently be removed from the bottom of the iPad Pro, meaning the Home button will disappear, and Touch ID will have to be integrated into the screen itself. Oddly, the site predicts that the bezel will remain at the top of the iPad Pro 2, and will continue to house the front-facing FaceTime camera. Thicker design Macotakara also believes that the 12.9-inch model of the iPad Pro 2 will be 3mm thicker than its predecessor, and says the middle-size model of the iPad Pro will have a 10.9-inch screen, not 10.5-inch as has been rumoured elsewhere. iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: Leaked photos AppleInsider has published two photos, ostensibly showing the iPad Pro 2, that were sent into the site by an anonymous reader. The images, like most Apple hardware leaks, are said to originate from the Asian supply chain; in this case it's said to be an employee at a Chinese supplier who has taken and leaked the photos. Both photos show the same onscreen imagery - the General > About tab of the Settings app, chosen presumably because it includes model number designations and other details that can corroborate the photo's legitimacy. (But, as AppleInsider observes, such details are not difficult to spoof, so the photos may yet be fake.) The About page says the depicted iPad is model MH1C2CD/F: that certainly sounds right, since that designation hasn't been given to any publicly known iPads, while broadly following the conventions of earlier Pro models. (The 128GB cellular 12.9-inch iPad Pro, for instance, is designated ML3K2B/A. By contrast, the iPad Air 2 uses a slightly different format: the 128GB cellular model is MH332B/A.)  Although, we should note that spoofing the model number can be changed relatively easily. More so, the model shows only 12GB of available storage - this can however be a test version, where 12GB of internal storage is more than sufficient. As one would expect, the depicted iPad is running a version of iOS 10 - you can tell because Siri gets its own top-level tab in the Settings app rather than a sub-category within General. Unfortunately - or conveniently, if you're cynical - it's virtually impossible to deduce anything else about the device from the shots, which don't show hardware ports or buttons, and have nothing else in frame with which to compare size of screen and so on. About all this tells us is that a new iPad Pro is probably on its way in the next few months.  Once we know more information or sent more details on the screenshots we will update this article. iPad Pro 2 rumours: New features wishlist The iPad Pro tablets are great, but they're not perfect. Here are a few new features and design tweaks we'd like to see in the second-gen iPad Pro. iPad Pro 2 wishlist: Bring the 9.7in Pro's new features across to the 12.9in model An issue we've addressed several times across this article concerns the disappointment felt by a number of 12.9-inch iPad Pro owners when the cheaper and in many respects better 9.7-inch iPad Pro was launched six months later. So the first thing we'd ask for is consistency. To achieve this the larger Pro model needs to get: A 12-megapixel rear-facing camera (up from 8Mp) A 5Mp front-facing camera (up from 1.2Mp) 4K video recording Live Photos Display with True Tone and 'wide colour' A 32GB cellular buying option A pink colour option iPad Pro 2 wishlist: Better keyboard accessory (for 9.7-inch model) The Pros are explicitly aimed at business users, and for this reason it was critical to get some good keyboard accessories. Apple's own Smart Keyboard is a strong offering in the larger size - even though it's expensive, and Macworld is divided on the issue of whether Logitech's less attractive Create keyboard offers a better typing experience - but the 9.7-inch version is a different matter. As a result of the smaller keys typing accuracy is weaker; the lower weight means it feels less satisfying under the fingers. (The design looks great, however, and is magnificently slim and light from a portability point of view. And the Smart Connector - and the fact that you never have to worry about battery life - is wonderful too.) We feel that Apple needs to create - or persuade a third-party accessory maker to create - a 9.7-inch keyboard you can really type on. And this may involve some compromises. It may need to have a foldout design (sounds ugly, right?) so that it could fit in larger keys. It might need to be heavier (thereby reducing portability) in order to feel better and reduce movement on the desk. But whatever happens, the smaller Pro needs an updated accessory line-up in order to compete as a business tool. Read next: Best iPad keyboards iPad Pro 2 wishlist: More (smaller) Home screen icons This is a software change rather than a hardware one, but it's frustrating that Apple doesn't allow you to fit more app icons on the screen of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At present you're allowed 20 app icons (or folders), plus up to six in the Dock, and this is exactly the same that you're allowed on the 9.7-inch iPads, which feels like a waste of the extra space. By default, the icons are the same size, so there's far more empty space on the screen. You can select a zoom view, with larger icons, but we'd prefer the option to have a grid of 5x6 icons, plus a seventh icon in the Dock. iPad Pro 2 wishlist: iOS 10 We expect the new iPad Pro 2, to ship with iOS 10 pre-installed. The new mobile operating system is already out for a vast majority of Apple devices. It brings over 100 new and updated features, which add new functionalities to iDevices running on it. Although, there are no special iPad-only features that have yet been announced or discovered on iOS 10 - so we hope Apple will address this during their March 2017 presentation. iPad Pro 2 wishlist: Processor Update 5 October: We expect the iPad Pro 2 to be shipped with the A10X, designed off the A10 Fusion processor found on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. There are rumours to suggest that the processor to be included within the iPad Pro 2 will be the A10X, an upgraded A9X built on a smaller FinFET technology. If this is to be the case, the rumours would suggest that a 2016 release is increasingly unlikely. This would point towards a potential release date of spring 2017, with a new 10nm processor included within the iPad Pro 2. Might we also see 4K (3840x2160) recording abilities? Some rumours suggest that the feature will be integrated within the OS, as the likes of the Nvidia and AMD mobile-generation graphics cards might make an appearance within the iPad Pro 2.  iPad Pro 2 wishlist: Design & display There are certain rumours suggesting that the iPad Pro 2 will feature an OLED or a flexible AMOLED display. Both are possibilities, but it's unlikely Apple will change their display manufacturing process. Nevertheless, it's a speculation some have - as Apple is losing its market share in the tablet industry and with ever growing competition, analysts predict Apple needs to react in a drastic fashion to interest consumers to stay or switch to an Apple product. Some say that the next iPad Pro 2 will feature a borderless design, providing a much better user experience and again, a more unique tablet in the market.  It's also rumoured that the new 12.9in iPad will be 0.3mm thicker, which would be a surprise - especially if it adds better battery life. Through this rumour by Japanese site Makotakara (spotted by 9to5Mac), we could see various design changes, such as the removal of the famous home button - not only on the iPad, but also on the upcoming iPhone 8.

It is projected to be a bumper crop year for apples in Michigan, according to a statement issued by the Michigan Apple Committee. "We have been seeing a steady increase in crop size each year," Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee, said in the statement. "This increase is in large part because of technological advancements, as well as an increase in the number of growers participating in high-density plantings (1,000 or more trees per acre)."

Comments Contents Release date Design changes New features Tech specs UK price Features wishlist The iPad mini 5 or iPad Pro Mini is expected to come out in March 2017 alongside the iPad Pro 2. Here's what we expect to be announced at Apple's Spring 2017 event. When will the new iPad mini 5 be released in the UK? And what specs and new features will the iPad mini 5 get compared with the iPad mini 4? What UK price will Apple charge for the iPad mini 5? The iPad mini 5 is, in a sense, overdue. The iPad mini 4 was unveiled in September 2015, with significant design changes, updated specs and new features that make it one of the best 8in tablets around. But that was 13 months ago, and we can't help but wonder what's next for the iPad mini.

Updated 13 December 2016 with a rumour suggesting the iPad mini 5 could have a foldable display. iPad mini 5 release date rumours UK: Release date No new iPad mini was announced at Apple's September or October 2016 events, which suggests to us that the new mini 5 will be released in March 2017. Despite having seen the release of previous iPad mini versions in October and November, we have not seen any further leaks or any information suggesting a 2016 release. We therefore expect the new iPad to be released in March 2017, the same time frame of when the iPad Pro was released (31 March 2016).  iPad mini 5 release date: Past behaviour In the past, the iPad mini 4 was released in September, when Apple hosted a press event to show off the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 6s Plus, the iPad Pro and the new Apple TV as well as the new iPad mini. The mini 4's September arrival was mildly surprising, as the original iPad mini, iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3 were all launched at October events, each time coming a month after a September iPhone launch. In 2015, however, Apple didn't have an October event, lumping its new iPhone and iPad announcements into a single night. On the other hand, Apple has added a new date to its calendar earlier in 2015: a March event where the company released new Macs and the Apple Watch.  Content continues below At Apple's March 2016 event, the company announced its new iPhone SE, 9.7in iPad Air Pro, iOS 9.3 and new Apple Watch straps. Looking at the current trend and rumours, we think Apple will release the iPad mini 5, or iPad Pro Mini to be released at the 2017 March event. It is also rumoured that it might be named the iPad Pro mini because of its new rumoured launch date - as it would follow the iPad Pro line-up. With most iOS device launches, the product itself doesn't arrive in shops for a little over a week after the unveiling, but Apple managed to take the wraps off the iPad mini 4 and announce its retail launch at the same time. As for the UK release date, that's likely to be the same date as the primary launch in the US. That's what happened with the mini 4, at any rate. We're sure there will be an influx of release date rumours as we race through 2016, so we'll keep you updated right here in this article. iPad mini 5 release date rumours UK: Podcast - Apple's March 2016 event iPad mini 5 release date rumours UK: Design changes The iPad mini 4 has plenty to recommend it, but in broad design terms it's actually pretty close to the very first iPad mini; it's been slimmed down and had various features added, but the two devices look largely the same. Can we expect a more radical redesign this time around - something like the jump from rounded-corner iPhone 3GS to the sharper-edged iPhone 4? It's possible, but we haven't yet heard anything to back up the theory that Apple is tearing up its old design manuals and starting from scratch. Early hints suggest that, as before, we could be looking at a more conservative redesign and gentle, less noticeable improvements. Thinner design So far, speculation suggests that the iPad Air 3 and iPad mini 5 will be even thinner than their predecessors (which are already an incredible 6.1mm), at just 5mm. It's certainly possible - the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablets are already 5.6mm thick, but we're not sure it's entirely necessary. 7000-series aluminium chassis The iPad mini 5 could also have a different chassis, this time made with 7000-series aluminium like the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to make it more durable, particularly if it is indeed thinner to help prevent the tablet from bending. Flexible display While we're a little sceptical about the iPad mini 5 having a flexible or possibly even foldable display, recent patents suggest that Apple has been working on the technology for the iPhone for a number of years. The technology would arguably be more important on an iPad, allowing users to 'fold up' the large screen of the iPad and put it in their pocket when not in use. We assume that Apple is still experimenting with the technology, and is therefore still a number of years away from release. Smart Connector The iPad Pro models (both 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch) feature a Smart Connector: a set of data and power ports on their lefthand edge, when held in portrait orientation, which connect to a keyboard case. For what it's worth we think the Smart Keyboard available for the 11.9-inch iPad Pro is a lot better than its smaller cousin, but even that is a better option for long-term typing than the software keyboard on the iPad's screen. If the iPad mini 5 gets a Smart Connector it could have a (probably limited but still handy) Smart Keyboard of its own, as well as opening up possibilities for other powered accessories. iPad mini 5 release date rumours UK: New features It's believed that the 3D Touch pressure-sensitive screen tech which Apple currently deploys in its iPhone 6s and 6s Plus only isn't ready to make the move to the iPad line - observers contend that it won't pop up in a spring iPad Air 3 launch - but we think this is only a matter of time. It's possible this would be something Apple can roll out in the mini 5 in the autumn, but we may have to wait until a future update. Cult of Mac is among the sites to predict that the next generation of iPads - the iPad Air 3 primarily, but any changes are sure to make it across to the mini line-up when they are next refreshed - could be waterproof and dust-resistant. For more thoughts on new features to expect in the iPad mini 5, be sure to check our (regularly updated) roundup of iOS 10; the iPad mini 5 will come with iOS 10 pre-installed, and this is sure to add a raft of new features and some tweaks to the interface design. With iOS 10, we see the inclusion of a few features to be included. Be sure to check our dedicated iOS 10 article for the latest developments.  iPad mini 5 release date rumours UK: Tech specs It's believed that the iPad mini 5's thinner design would be made possible by a new, smaller battery, says Cult of Mac: while the mini 5's battery unit may have a lower capacity than the 5,124mAh component in the mini 4, superior battery technology mean it will be able to match its predecessor's real-world battery performance.  Apple isn't expected to up the camera quality in the iPad mini 5, so expect 8Mp on the rear and 1.2Mp on the front. We'd like to see a better front-facing camera, though, particularly for FaceTime. It will be interesting to see if the iPad's chassis has a camera bump. The processor should be improved to an A9 processor over the A8, so we'll see a speed bump and improved graphics for the iPad mini 5, and we could also see an improvement when it comes to the display's resolution. We're certain Apple will scrap the 16GB model and will instead go for 32GB, 64GB and 128GB models of the iPad mini 5. We base these assumption on the recent drop of the 16GB model on the iPhone 7 line, and we're sure to see it continue through Apple's product line.  iPad mini 5 release date rumours UK: UK price The iPad mini 4 was released on 9 September 2015 at $399 USD / £319 GBP / $569 AUD / $439 CAD for the 16GB Wi-Fi only model. The 64GB and 128GB models were £399 and £479 respectively with cellular connectivity adding another £100 on top of the listed price. Since its release, the mini 4 can no longer be found in a 16GB variant, with the Wi-Fi 32GB found for £379, 128GB at £469, and the Cellular variant at £499 for 32GB and £589 for 128GB. We expect the mini 5 to be released at the same price point, with the iPad mini 5 coming in at £379 for the base model. Given Apple has already axed the 16GB model, we don't expect it to make an appearance in 2017. We would be slightly surprised to see only 32- and 128GB models with the mini 5, where we see Apple offering a 32-, 64- and 128GB variants. As soon as we know more about its price and storage option sizes, we will update this article. Macworld poll: How often do you update your iPad? One more thing before you go. The fact that you're reading this article suggests you're in the market for a new iPad, but is this your first iPad ever, or are you a regular updater? Let us know about your tablet-updating habits by entering our poll: iPad mini 5 release date rumours UK: Features wishlist We've looked above at the new features we think are likely to appear in the iPad mini 5. But what are the features we'd like to see? Here's our iPad mini 5 wishlist. iPad mini 5 new features wishlist: 3D Touch Given the better integration of iOS 10 and 3D Touch, we see the feature being included on the iPad mini 5. Apple's mobile operating platform also integrates well with Live Photos, which is another feature we expect to see included. An obvious one to start with, but we are highly enamoured of the 3D Touch pressure-sensitive screens on our 6s-generation iPhones and would love to see the feature ported to the iPad mini line-up. We'll take Live Photos too, if you're offering. iPad mini 5 new features wishlist: No headphone port We're going out on a limb here, and we know this isn't a fashionable point of view: after the release of the iPhone 7, there might be a removal of the headphone jack on iPads too. While the iPad mini 4 is already wonderfully slim and light, removing a port streamlines the design on the outside and makes space on the inside: the mini 5 could be even slimmer, or perhaps squeeze in a little more battery capacity. When it comes to implementing new features and entering new market segments, Apple is widely felt to be the slow-turning ocean liner of mobile tech, but it's a fast and usually prescient mover when it comes to ditching soon-to-be-outdated technologies. iPad mini 5 new features wishlist: Fast charging As a general rule, the more portable a computing device is, the more dependent it is on battery power - yet conversely, it'll be relying on a smaller battery unit. The iPad Pro is the least likely iPad to see prolonged usage on the go (most of our Pro use has been desk- or sofa-bound, within easy reach of a power supply), but it has easily the best battery performance of any iPad we've tested. Which is a roundabout way of saying that battery performance is a massive priority for the iPad mini 5, and efficient and convenient charging is an important element of that. We'd like Apple to implement its own version of Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology, so that you can give the mini 5 a quick blast of power in the coffee shop before proceeding on your merry way. We've grown used to the ultra-fast charging offered by the Apple Pencil's little battery, and would like to see something of the same experience (although based on new technology) brought to the iPads themselves. iPad mini 5 new features wishlist: microSD card slot Aside from being an extraordinarily long shot (Apple has never produced an iPhone, iPad or iPod with removable storage, and realistically never will), it might sound odd to ask Apple to streamline the external design by removing a widely used port, and then in the next section ask Apple to clog up the design with an additional card slot. But let's put it this way: if we're obliged to have one non-essential external port, I'd take this over the 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple's storage policies have long been frustrating. The substantial step up in price when you select a higher storage allocation, when we know that storage is incredibly cheap; the removal of the 'sweet spot' 32GB option, so that many buyers fall between the stools of not enough (16GB) and more than you need (64GB); and the refusal to countenance either upgrades or removal storage, so that whatever you buy is what you're stuck with for the lifetime of that product. iPad mini 5 new features wishlist: Full Apple Pay With the inclusion and integration of Apple Pay with macOS Sierra and the Apple Watch, we see its inclusion with other Apple products even more likely. The iPad mini 5, would be a product which would benefit from having Apple Pay integration. We therefore expect to see it included if and when the iPad is released. Like the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3, the mini 4 cannot use the full, in-store version of Apple Pay. (You can buy things online using Apple Pay and verify the payment using your iPad mini's Touch ID, but you can't beep an iPad on the contactless hub in a shop.) This is because it doesn't have an NFC antenna. There probably won't be a huge number of people queuing up to pay in-store using their iPad mini, but the gap in portability between the smallest iPad and the largest iPhone is getting perilously small. (It could be argued that the iPhone 6s Plus has more in common with the iPad mini 4 than with the iPhone 5s.) Given the iPad mini's suitability as an ereader, there ought to be a solid niche of commuters who'd appreciate the small convenience of using an iPad mini to pay for Underground journeys, and we suspect that it would be a popular move for a variety of other reasons. iPad mini 5 new features wishlist: Waterproofing We mentioned just now that the iPad mini is a terrific ereader, and you know what that means: poolside use. We think the mini line-up needs waterproofing just as much as the iPhones. Apple has a peculiar attitude to waterproofing. As people are increasingly noticing, the Apple Watch and two most recent iPhone generations are actually reasonably resistant to water immersion, but you wouldn't know it from the technical specs for these products; unlike pretty much all other tech firms, Apple doesn't send its devices off to get IP-rated. (An IP - or Ingress Protection - rating consists of two digits. The first rates its ability to withstand solid intrusions on a scale of 0 to 6; the second rates fluid resistance on a scale of 0 to 6. So the Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone, which is rated as IP68, is top of the class.) Waterproofing for most companies is a way of bragging about products' capabilities, but Apple seemingly prefers it to be a nice surprise when your iPhone 6s takes a dip and then doesn't die a watery death. But we'd like to be on rather firmer ground when we take an iPad mini 5 to the beach. iPad mini 5 new features wishlist: Pink option That's self-explanatory, isn't it? I like the pink iPhone colour option. Don't judge me. That's it for now. Check back regularly for the latest iPad mini 5 feature rumours, as we'll be updating this very article as new evidence and speculation emerges, and when the first leaked photos appear.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Who's playing at the Apple Music Festival 2016? And how do I get tickets for the Apple Music Festival (formerly iTunes Festival)? Last year Apple rebranded its iTunes Festival to the Apple Music Festival. On Monday 22 August the company announced Apple Music Festival 10, a ten-day festival of "exhilarating nights of live music" in London that will run from 18-30 September 2016.  The '10' branding refers not only to the ten nights of live show, which will be held at the Roundhouse in Camden, London, but also the tenth year Apple has run a version of the festival. The headline artists were announced by Julie Adenuga, the London voice of the Apple Music radio station Beats 1. (Apple Music Festival announcements are generally made over Beats 1.) Read on for all the details about the Apple Music Festival 2016, including the Apple Music Festival 2016 lineup, Apple Music Festival dates, and how to get tickets for Apple Music Festival 2016. Apple Music Festival 2016 lineup: Who is playing at Apple Music Festival 10?  The headline artists who will be playing at 2016's Apple Music Festival are as follows: Alicia Keys, Bastille, Britney Spears, Calvin Harris, Chance The Rapper, Elton John, Michael Bublé, OneRepublic, Robbie Williams and The 1975 will all be taking to the stage in Camden from 18 to 30 September 2016. Here's the schedule:  18 September: Elton John 19 September: The 1975 20 September: Alicia Keys 21 September: OneRepublic 23 September: Calvin Harris 25 September: Robbie Williams 26 September: Bastille 27 September: Britney Spears 28 September: Michael Bublé 30 September: Chance The Rapper Apple has also released statements from some of the artists. Britney, for instance, said: "I'm so excited to go back to London, which is a special place for me to visit, and I'm really looking forward to performing at the Apple Music Festival. It's also their 10th birthday! It's going to be a great party." We're excited too, Britney! Content continues below Apple Music Festival 2016 dates: When and where is the Apple Music Festival being held?  All ten nights of Apple Music Festival 2016 (formerly iTunes Festival) will be held at the Camden Roundhouse in London from Sunday 18 September to Friday 30 September 2016. Think of it as a send-off to the summer. Apple Music Festival 2016: How to watch Apple Music Festival online Obviously the best way to watch Apple Music Festival 2016 is to get tickets and watch it in person - we discuss how to get tickets to Apple Music Festival 2016 in the next section. But if you can't get tickets, it's still possible to watch the concerts remotely. "The live performances will be made available live and on-demand to Apple Music members in 100 countries on their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, PC, Apple TV and Android phones," said Apple. Apple Music Festival 2016: Who can buy tickets for Apple Music? You can only apply for tickets to the Apple Music Festival 10 if you're a UK resident. Last year, you had to apply for tickets through iTunes so it's preferable to have a UK Apple ID and iTunes account. Apple Music Festival 2016: How to get tickets for Apple Music Festival 2016 Apple tries to limit tickets to UK residents only. In previous years, you have to apply for tickets to specific gigs via an online ballot. If you're lucky and you are selected, you then pay for your ticket. Apple has said only: "Fans based in the UK can apply to win tickets by entering prize draws on Apple Music, as well as through select media partners." Tickets will be non-refundable and very limited in number. In previous years the London Evening Standard has run competitions to win tickets, so be on the lookout for London-based offers like this if you're unsuccessful in the official ballot. You can only apply for free tickets to the Festival if you are an Apple Music subscriber. If you aren't, you'll have to sign up to the service in order to be in with a chance of going. You can sign up for a free 3 month trial here if you are a first time user.  Signing up to Apple Music is also necessary in order to watch the shows online. Sorry, Spotify fans. Apple Music Festival 2016: How to get more information about Apple Music Festival 2016 If you'd like to get more information about Apple Music Festival 2016, visit the Apple Music Festival website. Apple is likely to make further announcements and updates on the Apple Music radio station Beats 1. And there should also be plenty of discussion of the festival on social media; Apple is encouraging fans to use the hashtag #AMF10.

We gather the rumours and whispers about Apple and make our pedictions for the year ahead. by Martyn Casserly | 02 Dec 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Apple Watch 3 iPhones iPads Apple TV Macs Software & services Mergers & acquisitions But don't expect… 2016 was an interesting year for Apple. It saw the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, albeit controversially without headphone jacks, and a return to the 4-inch form factor in the popular iPhone SE. The MacBook Pro line received its first major revision for a number of years, including the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Plus there was the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and an apparently Brexit-related unwelcome hike in prices across the board. So, what does 2017 have up its sleeves for Apple fans? Well, here at Macworld we’ve donned our prognostication hats, investigated every rumour and trend we could find, all to bring you our predictions for 2017. It looks like it could be a big year. Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Watch 3 Apple released the second generation of its Watch in September of 2016 which added GPS, internal upgrades, and water proofing to the design. This was accompanied by the WatchOS 3 update that increased performance and functionality for not only the new models but also the original range.   We expect to see Apple announce the third iteration of its Watch in September 2017, hopefully for around the same price as the current models which start at £369, although that is far from certain after the increases we saw at the end of 2016. There's little in the way of firm evidence suggesting what the Apple Watch 3 will look like, but it's fair to say that you should expect a model that's very similar to the current version. Some experts have postulated that there could be a Watch S release in March of 2017 that would include additional storage space, but this remains a rumour at best. Several news sites have also specualted on the possibilty of a round display, much like the one found on the Moto 360 Android Wear device. It's widely expected that the Watch 3 will include a front facing camera that could be used for selfies or FaceTime calls, as Apple holds a patent for such a device and Watch OS 2 introduced support for FaceTime audio calls. The new model is also likely to feature a Micro-LED display, which would be lighter, thinner, and brighter than the LCD panels currently used.  Another common thought is that Apple will finally introduce 3G or 4G capabilities to the Watch, in order to make it more independent from the iPhone. We're not convinced by this. Apple likes its devices to be closely tied together, and the battery life problems that come with cellular capabilities might make it an unattractive option at this time. It's still early days for the Apple Watch, so we fully expect this to be a quiet evolution rather than revolution. Thinner, lighter, faster and longer battery life is the mantra, and we'd be very happy with that. For a more in-depth look at the latest rumours on the Apple Watch be sure to check out our Apple Watch 3 Rumours article. Content continues below Read more about Apple Watch: Apple Watch accessories round-up | Best Apple Watch straps | Apple Watch tips | Apple Watch 2 Review Apple predictions for 2017: iPhones 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so many are expecting Apple to pull out all the stops and release something quite special. iPhone SE 2: The first model to appear will be the iPhone SE2 or SEs, replacing the existing (and rather popular) SE that was introduced in March 2016. Expect the new model to be released in the same timeline and feature the existing, classic design, but with upgraded internals such as the A10 chip found in the current iPhone 7 and a more powerful camera. In all honesty we'd love to see the original SE remain an option, and a price cut could make it a very attractive proposition, but this would make Apple's iPhone range quite complicated so it's more likely that the little powerhouse will be retired.  iPhone 7S or iPhone 8: There has been much discussion over what the new iPhone will be called. Normally Apple would continue its tick-tock rhythm of a new design one year followed by the S version which upgrades only the internals. But the iPhone 7 featured a minimal change to the design of the 6 and 6S, which leads many to think that Apple is saving the big changes for its 10th Anniversary model - the iPhone 8. Perhaps the biggest expected change to the design of the iPhone 8 is the removal of the Home button to allow an edge-to-edge glass display. But what of Apple ID and the fingerprint sensor? Well, there have been several reports that Apple intends to include technology that allows the screen itself to act as a fingerprint sensor, thus removing the need for a physical button. This would be a truly remarkable innovation and give iPhone users display sizes on par with many premium Android devices but in a compact format. MacRumours also asserts that Apple is intending to use a flexible OLED display rather than the LCD panels that have appeared on previous iPhones. This could make the devices lighter while also offering more vivid colours and contrasts.   Image created by ConceptsiPhone Another feature often found on Android phones is that of wireless charging, and it looks very likely that this will be included on the iPhone 8. Some rumours even suggest the Apple will include long-range wireless charging, with Bloomberg Business reporting that the company wants to impliment the game changing technology that could charge an iphone from several feet away, and could have it ready for 2017.  The Jet black colour introduced with the iPhone 7 has been very popular, but its tendency to scratch easily is thought to have prompted Apple to return to a glass back and front design for the iPhone 8. There might also be new Deep Blue and Space Black colour options if the reports on various Japanese sites are to be believed.  One interesting idea that's gathering pace is that the new model will include Augmented Reality software, which overlays relevant information on any place or thing that you point the camera at. While we've yet to see proof of this, it would be a very cool addition. So with a new edge-to-edge design, software enabled fingerprint detection, long-range wireless charging, better display, plus the usual internal upgrades, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus really could be a worthy way to mark a decade at the top. Roll on September 2017. For the latest rumours and an in-depth roundup read our iPhone 8 release date rumours article. Apple predictions for 2017: iPads iPad Air 3: There was no new iPad Air in 2015 or 2016 so some Apple fans are hoping for an update to that model soon; but we suspect that the 9.7in iPad Pro has now displaced the iPad Air line. In fact we're not convinced that Apple will release another Air-branded product at all, as signalled by the 13-inch MacBook Air's tiny update this spring and the retirement of the 11-inch version. If Apple does surprise us and announces an iPad Air 3 then we'd hope for a faster processor, better camera, and 3D Touch (although KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo doesn't think 3D Touch will make an appearance, apparently due to production issues). But our bet would be on the Air 2 being the last of its family line. Read more about the iPad Air 3: iPad Air 3 rumours iPad mini 5: Given that the iPad Mini 4 was last updated in September 2015, it's clear that Apple isn't too focussed on its smaller tablets. This could change in 2017 though as rumours suggest that March could see the introduction of an iPad Mini Pro with upgraded components, a new thinner, tougher alluminium chassis, and the inclusion of a Smart Connector to match that of the other iPad Pro devices. Read more about the iPad mini 5: iPad mini 5 release date & new feature rumours Apple predictions for 2017: iPad Pro 2 With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arriving in November 2015, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016, it's hard to guess the plans for this line. Our suspicion is that Apple will be patient and update both in spring 2017, but much will depend on how effectively they have dealt with the stagnating iPad sales problem we've observed in the past few earnings calls. One way to stimulate interest could be the introduction of a new size, which is what analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is suggesting. He has stated that Apple will offer three Pros in 2017, but not a Mini as you might think, instead a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and new 10.5-inch variant. He makes sense of this by explaining that the 9.7-inch Pro will be a lower powered version than it's bigger brothers - possibly the existing Pro being kept as the base model and sold at a cheaper price. Other rumours doing the rounds argue that there will be a 10.9-inch version instead of the 10.5-inch one Kuo is backing. This could also feature a design change that eliminates the bezels and makes use of the software fingerprint detection technology that is expected to appear in the iPhone 8. There's no doubt that iPads are in a transitional period at the moment, but Apple seems to be pushing the Pros as the way ahead, so expect some interesting products in March. Read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review | iPad Pro 2 rumours Apple predictions for 2017: Apple TV It might have escaped the attention of many people that 2017 actually marks the 10th anniversary of Apple TV. With this in mind some think that Apple could celebrate the occassion with an update to its little black box. Whether this is true or not remains a mystery, as there have been very few credible rumours about any new developments inside the Apple campus. Then there's also the fact that the usual gap between iterations of Apple TV tends to be two or three years. It was curious though that a large section of the recent WWDC event was given to the software updates in tvOS. Maybe something is cooking in the labs after all? We'll keep researching and reporting our findings, so check back regularly.

The once futuristic device now looks a little long in the tooth, having been bypassed by generations of Intel chips that never made it into the chassis. Will Apple update the Mac Pro in 2017 or has it given up entirely on this professional Mac workstation? At this point we really don't know. Rumours of release dates and potential upgrades have come and gone, but nothing has appeared. Some are bouyant that March 2017 will be the event where new Pros are announced, but we'll just have to wait and see. Read more about the 2016 Mac Pro: 2016 Mac Pro release date rumours & specs  | Mac Pro 2016 preview  | iMac vs Mac Pro, best pro Mac desktop MacBook Air: With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook and the new, lightweight 13-inch MacBook Pro the writing seems pretty much on the wall for the old MacBook Air. Apple has already retired the 11-inch model in 2016, and once the 12-inch MacBook gets an update in 2017 to hopefully add an additional USB-C port and upgrade the god-awful keyboard, there won't be much room left for the Air brand.   All many of us wanted for the 13-inch model was to get a retina screen and a spec bump, but we suspect that will never happen and the MacBook Air, like the iPad Air, is on the way out. Read more here: New MacBook Air release date, specs & rumours. MacBook Pro: With the MacBook Pro having only just been released as 2016 draws to a close, we won't expect much to change until very late in 2017. The massive redesign has already caused quite a reaction, so we'd rule out anything significant happening in the next iteration. Instead we think there will most likely be a shift to Kaby Lake chips, which in turn could open up higher RAM options. Other than that all we really want are the prices to come down. Apple predictions for 2017: 12in Retina MacBook update Apple launched its incredibly thin and light 12in MacBook back in March 2015, and the MacBook's first birthday saw a solid if unspectacular update - various sensible specs boosts, and a rose gold colour option. The third iteration of the 12in MacBook is likely to appear in spring 2017. Rumours are thin on the ground right now, but some of the wilder speculation has suggested that it might feature a 'Force Touch keyboard' - a keyboard, in other words, that doesn't actually move in response to your key presses, instead simulating presses through haptic feedback just like the Force Touch trackpad. Sounds pretty bizarre - not to mention difficult to use for touch-typing - but that's the sort of thing you tend to hear this far ahead of a launch. We think it's more likely that Apple will install the second generation of its butterfly keyboard that appeared on the new MacBook Pro instead. Read more in our 2017 MacBook rumour round-up. Mac mini: Ah Mac Mini, where did it all go wrong? After being hobbled in 2014 by what can barely be considered an upgrade, Apple has left the Mini to fall fallow. Now we don't know whether 2017 will see a resurrection of its fortunes, but all here at Macworld are rooting for the little guy. Read more in our new Mac mini release date rumours article. New iMacs: The iMac range last saw updates in 2015 that moved the high-end models over to Intel's Skylake processors, and the 21.5in models to Broadwell chips. What 2017 holds in store for the range is still uncertain, as Intel's chipsets seem to be slightly out of step with Apple's demands at the moment. Bloomberg has reported that new iMacs are on their way, so it seems the two companies have worked it out, but details are as yet unknown as to what upgrades the devices will be running. Read more in our new iMac release date rumours article. Apple predictions for 2017: Mac processor updates Despite Apple's adventures into processor design it's unlikely we'll see the company rolling out its own chips in its desktop and laptop machines unless it can make them fully compatible with the current Intel line-up. Wonderful though it would be to run iOS apps alongside OS X software, Apple would need to give developers several years' notice to update their applications to run on any new architecture, so expect to still be buying Intel-driven machines for at least the next 12 months. Apple predictions for 2017: Force Touch Keyboard A Force Touch keyboard could be in the works, too - as a supplement to the Magic Trackpad 2 - if a recent patent filing is anything to go by. The switchless design would allow Apple to produce even thinner MacBooks, and also to take into account the force with which a key is pressed, which will be a boon for anyone making music on their Mac. In the opposite direction it should allow for haptic feedback, which could possibly be used to signify to vision-impaired users that they're correctly striking a particular key. Apple predictions for 2017: Software & services iOS 11 Apple traditionally announces new version of iOS in June, followed by the release in the autumn. So far the only strong rumour about the new operating system is that it will include an improved 'natural-sounding' Siri as Apple works to improve the behaviour and repsonse of its voice interface. Another strong possibility is the inclusion of a Dark Mode with black backgrounds rather than the bright white normally found on iOS, and there's an outside chance that your Contacts could become active in iOS11, meaning you can see when people are available to chat. Read more about the latest rumours in our iOS release date rumours UK article. Plus you can revisit the changes Apple made in iOS 10 by watching the video below. Apple predictions for 2017: macOS X Like iOS 11, the new version of Apple's Mac operating system will be unveiled at WWDC 2017 in June, and then roll out in the autumn. So far there are no real rumours about what Apple will include in the new update. Siri integration was at the centre of the 2016 release, so it's possible that those features will be enhanced and improved upon for the 2017 update. As always, check back regularly and we'll keep you up to date on any new developments. Also check out our OS X 10.13 Rumours page. To refresh your memories on what Apple included in macOS 10.12 Sierra read more here: macOS Sierra new features and release date or watch the discussion video: Apple predictions for 2017: WatchOS 4 WatchOS is developing nicely and in 2017 we expect to see the introduction of Sleep Tracking, which would further bolster the fitness focus of the Apple Watch. No other news as yet, but we'll keep digging In the mean time you could read about the improvements made in watchOS3 here: watchOS 3 new features or listen to our discussion about it. Apple predictions for 2017: tvOS Last and probably least of Apple's four software platforms, tvOS nevertheless got a decent update at WWDC 2016 which we think will probably carry it through 2017. You can read all the gory details in our article New tvOS features, but we also discuss the new features in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Pay Alongside these headline developments, there will be a whole series of speedbumps along the way as Apple extends and refines its Apple Pay offering. We anticipate that Apple Pay will be accepted in a wider range of headline stores.  Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Music Apple Music - which is now available on Android - will inevitably expand. With 15 million subscribers in 2016 Apple Music made a decent start, but is it good enough to continue this momentum and can it really compete with the likes of Spotify? As for Beats 1, we’re not convinced this is making the impact Apple hoped for, but the we probably aren’t the target market for it. We'd like to see more radio channels tuned to less trendy music choices. There are also rumours that streaming on Apple Music could be enhanced, with high-resolution better quality audio for that service - up to 96kHz/24-bit, according to a report on Macotakara. Since the 3.5mm headphone jack is limited to CD quality sound this appears to back up the motives for Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as the Lighting port can offer HD audio. Apple Music may also prove to be the one thing that keeps the iPod on the shelves in 2017. If you'd asked us what we thought of its chances at the close of 2014, we'd have said 'slim', but 2015 saw Apple deliver the first proper update to the iPod touch in three years, and it’s now providing another entry ramp for the firm’s £9.99 a month music subscription service. That alone means it makes sense to give it at least 12 months to prove itself. The same can’t necessarily be said of the nano and shuffle, which are each available in just one configuration and, without streaming abilities, offer no ongoing revenue source. Apple Music saw a major redesign at WWDC 2016. We discuss the changes in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Mergers & acquisitions Apple has got quite a lot money, and armchair pundits love to spend the company's money for it. Buy Tesla! Buy GoPro! Buy Sonos! From time to time these suggestion-cum-predictions come true, as with Apple's acqusition of Beats in 2014, but it hardly needs stating that the company isn't in a hurry to divest itself of that cash cushion. Any merger & acqusition activity is likely to be comparatively conservative: rather than going for the big names that crop up in prediction articles like this one, Apple is far more likely to pick up smallish but promising firms on the way up and take their products in house - just as it did with Siri. We do know of a few big deals that Apple has considered recently, though. The Financial Times reports that in May 2016 Apple sat down with Time Warner, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and spoke seriously about an acquisition deal. The deal never got beyond the exploratory phase, but this does strongly suggest that Apple is in the market for an acquisition that will give it a foothold in video content - something that would prove valuable in the event that its rumoured TV-streaming service comes to pass. With Time Warner apparently out of the picture, many analysts believe that the next target could be Netflix, but we're still in the realm of the mega-deal, so don't bet your live savings on the deal happening. Apple's Gliimpse acqusition On 22 August 2016 Fast Company reported that Apple had made an intriguing new acquisition: Gliimpse, a startup that enables users to collect and collate personal health data. It's not known at this point how much the acqusition cost Apple, but the company has confirmed the deal, albeit with its usual boilerplate statement that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally [does] not discuss [its] purpose or plans". Gliimpse was created in response to the bureaucratic difficulties in the US related to health documentation: the lack of an overarching authority or standardised system makes it exceptionally difficult for patients to access and usefully analyse their own data. And this makes it an obvious fit with Apple's recent health-related announcements. With the launch of HealthKit and CareKit, the company intends to revolutionise the health and medical care sector, and has a track record of providing umbrella services - in music, fitness and mobile software most successfully - that make complex markets easier for consumers to approach. Related fact: one of Gliimpse's founders, Anil Sethi, started his career at Apple in the 1980s. Apple's Turi acquisition At the start of August 2016, Apple acquired a Seattle artificial intelligence company named Turi, according to a report by GeekWire. The site's sources peg the deal at approximately $200m, although both Apple and Turi have declined to comment on the matter. Turi's specialities, artificial intelligence and machine learning, are hot right now and the acquisition represents Apple's way into an increasingly crucial area of the tech sector. Google is big on artificial intelligence, as are Facebook and Amazon, but Apple itself has discussed the subject in numerous recent product launches. iOS's QuickType keyboard uses artificial intelligence to predict what you're trying to type; iOS also uses it to suggest apps it reckons you're likely to use and contacts you'll want to speak to, and the new automated album creation tool in Photos uses deep learning techniques to analyse faces, places and objects and create coherent compositions. watchOS 3's Instant Apps feature is dependent on being able to predict which apps you'll want to use next. But Apple's products are only going to get smarter over the coming years, as Turi's tech is integrated into the portfolio. Apple's Tuplejump acquisition Further to it buying Turi, Apple followed up the next month, September 2016, by buying Tuplejump. Like Turi, it is a machine learning company that allows better data management for businesses. According to TechCrunch, Apple's interest in the acquisition was down to Tuplejump's focus on open source ways of applying machine learning and analytics to big data. This again points to Apple's increasing interest in improving its artificial intelligence products such as Siri.  Apple's $1bn investment in Didi Chuxing After its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, Apple invested a huge $1bn in the uber-competitor, Didi Chuxing - a Chinese company that forced Uber out of its local market. The company is valued at $35bn, and with a further $1bn investment from Apple, it seems that there is certain weight behind the movement in China - this came come in a form of advertising of Apple products in China, to Apple-product integration within taxis. Given the boom of the Chinese market, it seems that investors are happy with this move. Apple predictions for 2017: But don't expect… The Apple Car, was the hot rumour of 2016, but now it seems that Apple has scaled back it's ambitions and now thought to see working on a software solution rather than the hardware. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research. We'd love to see it on the roads in 2017, but industry chatter suggests 2020 is a more likely date. If they're right, it might not be worth holding back on an interim upgrade to your existing run-around next year. And if you were hoping for an actual television set from Apple it's time to give up on that idea too. We won't see an Apple car this year, but you can expect the rumours to continue.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date Design New features Specs Macworld poll - What do you want from your future iPhone? When will the new iPhone 8 be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? (Or will the next generation of Apple smartphones be called the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus?) And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus? The iPhone 8 rumour mill is heating up, a month after the launch of the iPhone 7. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7 alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus during a special event on 7 September, but we're already looking ahead to the next generation. In this article we round up all the rumours about the iPhone 8: the iPhone 8's UK release date (and onsale date), iPhone 8 UK price, iPhone 8 specs and new features. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started. For advice on the current iPhone range, read our iPhone buying guide and best cheap iPhone deals UK. Or, if you'd like to look even further into the future (covering tech developments that come perilously close to the realms of science-fiction), read iPhone 9 and beyond: From graphene to motion charging. Updated, 20 December 2016, with reports of plastic screens and 'new sensing technologies' that could move Touch ID to the side of the iPhone 8; on 14 Dec, with predictions of a red iPhone 8; on 7 Dec, with new evidence that suggests Donald Trump might just succeed in getting iPhone 8 manufacture moved to the US; on 29 Nov, to discuss growing evidence for wireless charging; on 22 Nov, with further augmented reality news (including a new Apple patent for augmented reality maps); and on 25 Oct, with a report that predicts the iPhone 8's redesign will be "a big f**king deal" iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Release date Some pundits have predicted that the iPhone 7 will sell comparatively poorly because of its perceived lack of major new features and design changes (on a relative scale, of course - it'll still outsell its main rivals many times over). But, they say, everything will change in 2017, when the iPhone 8 blows everyone away with a wide and radical range of enhancements. Pundits are increasingly looking ahead to 2017 for a big iPhone launch. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse have forecast that the iPhone 8, to be released on the iPhone's 10-year anniversary in 2017 (skipping the 'S' generation in recognition of its major updates) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Kulbinder Garcha, one of the company's analysts, was sufficiently confident about the iPhone 8's performance to predict sales of 250 million units in fiscal 2018 (despite launching in the calendar year 2017, the iPhone 8's sales will be reported in 2018), compared to 215 million in 2017. Garcha may be confident, but we're not so sure. Going three years between substantive updates to what remains by far its most profitable line in order to make a big launch match a big anniversary feels like a strange and risky strategy for Apple (we don't subscribe to Nikkei's theory that the company will follow a three-year cycle from now on), and with the Android sector pushing boundaries in a lot of ways this would inevitably result in accusations of stagnation - even more so than now.

It might not get pretty, if some researchers are to be believed. Content continues below One analyst, Andrew Uerkwitz, has predicted that the 2017 iPhone refresh will be the company's "last growth hurrah", before spiralling into a "decade-long malaise" as the market turns increasingly to lower-cost and second-hand phones. "The risks to the company have never been greater," Uerkwitz said to MarketWatch. Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak echoed Uerkwitz's sentiments. "Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever," he said. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Apple's release schedule Before we think about new features you should expect in the iPhones of the future, let's talk about the likely release date schedule. Apple's latest batch of smartphones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, were released in the autumn of 2016. (Read more: iPhone 7 review and iPhone 7 Plus review.) After that point it gets harder to predict. Based on the past few years of Apple launches, the generation after that logically ought to be an S update: the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus, launched together in autumn 2017 (with the potential of an iPhone SE 2 in spring of 2017, or moved back to launch with them in the autumn). The iPhone 8 - as well as the iPhone 8 Plus - would then finally be unveiled in September 2018. Sept 2016: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus But it may not be that simple. iPhone 8 release date rumours: The end of the iPhone 'S' convention It's possible that Apple won't continue the S generation strategy for much longer. Many of us have pointed out that this 'tick-tock' system is a risky policy, tacitly acknowledging that iPhone generations alternate between major and minor updates - to be especially harsh, you could say worthwhile and superfluous updates. When the average user hears that the new iPhone hasn't even been considered worthy of a full version number upgrade, they'll be put off from spending money on the new offering. Not to mention that an S update is more confusing for buyers: iPhone 6 followed by iPhone 7 would have been clear and easy to understand; but it's less obvious which out of the iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus is the more advanced model. On this principle, therefore, we could see the iPhone 7 in autumn 2016 and the iPhone 8 the year after. At this point, nobody knows - but as soon as we hear more, we'll update this article. And in October 2016 a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory. According to Business Insider, an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". The sourced added that the iPhone 8 would be "different" from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and have a better camera - neither of which are particularly out-there predictions. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Can Donald Trump persuade Apple to build iPhones in the US? Donald Trump spent much of his recent presidential campaign complaining about Apple and its offshore manufacturing operations, and promising he would make the company build its iPhones in the US. (The only major Apple product currently made on American shores is the Mac Pro.) Now, as President-Elect Trump, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump claimed to have spoken on the phone with Tim Cook - implying, indeed, that Cook initiated the call - and reached what sounds like a degree of understanding you might not expect from two men with such different temperaments and political leanings. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, of course: labour costs are lower and there is, according to Cook, a shortage of relevant skills in the US. Moving manufacturing to America would lose Apple a lot of money. But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking." What Trump does not claim - and past behaviour suggests he'd be singing it from the rooftops - is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. He may understand where Trump is coming from, and Trump may have given him the hard sell, but it would be a huge step if Apple actually does move any kind of significant proportion of its device manufacture to the US. Foxconn's US expansion There was another twist in this tale when it emerged on 7 December that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is indeed pondering an expansion of its (currently relatively small-scale) US operations, in a move that is apparently expected to involve $7bn of investment and create 50,000 jobs. Strangely, nobody involved made much of a deal about this. But eagle-eyed journalists spotted that paperwork being shown off to publicise SoftBank's US investment deal (which Donald Trump has made a huge song and dance about) also featured Foxconn's logo, and appeared to suggest that the second figure in each pair of numbers referred to that company. (Picture credit: CNBC) Foxconn has since confirmed that it is in talks about expanding its US operations, although it has declined to comment on the figures given. "While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials," the firm said in a statement, according to Reuters. Now, what new features and tech developments can we expect in the next few generations of Apple smartphone? iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Design iPhones are that lethal combination of expensive and fragile that results in so much consumer heartache. The result is that each iPhone owner has to make their own deal with the devil: either wrapping it in a robust case, thereby masking the handsome design that they paid all that money for in the first place, or risk pavement damage every time they take the thing out of a pocket. But design changes may mean this is not the case in the future. Here are the design changes we expect in the iPhone 8. Read next: How to repair a cracked iPhone screen iPhone 8 design: 10th-anniversary redesign will be 'a big f**king deal' The year 2017 (June the 29th, to be precise) marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and some suggest that Apple will want to come up with a real blockbuster of a redesign to celebrate. Noted tech blogger Robert Scoble has posted an exhaustive list of predictions for next year's iPhone, and he expects big things. "It's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone," he writes. "It's the first product introduction in Apple's new amazing headquarters. It's a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply." (Those are Scoble's asterisks.) Design-wise, he expects that the iPhone 8 "will be, I am told, a clear piece of glass (er, Gorilla Glass sandwich with other polycarbonates for being pretty shatter resistant if dropped) with a next-generation OLED screen (I have several sources confirming this). You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." He also says to expect "battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone". But the range of features Scoble is expecting is overwhelming. You really need to read the post for yourself. Scoble isn't the only one predicting a big redesign for 2017. French site nowhereelse.fr has shared a leaked image (below), which appears to showcase the exact dimensions of the iPhone 7. These dimensions are identical to the ones found on the iPhone 6s, measuring 67.12mm wide and 138.3mm tall. Through this image, it would appear that there also won't be any change to the camera (there have been rumours about a dual camera system as you'll discover later in this article). The image has the OnLeaks stamp on it, and OnLeaks has been reliable with Apple leaks in the past. iPhone 8 design: Glass front and back, with stainless steel option 9to5Mac has got hold of a report from the ever-quotable and usually reliable Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities - a report that predicts, based on the popularity of the scratch-prone Jet Black iPhone 7, that the iPhone 8 will have a (more scratch-resistant) glass front and back. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests, an all glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design," 9to5mac says. iPhone 8 design: New colour options There have been various rumours about new colour finishes, focusing on two possibilities: dark blue, and red. According to a report from Macotakara, the iPhone 7 will come in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and a new Deep Blue. This seems entirely possible. Samsung offers blue flagship phones that seem to be among the more popular options, so Apple might decide to follow Samsung's lead. Following the reports from Mac Otakara, designer Martin Hajek has published some gorgeous concept images of the Deep Blue iPhone 7. See more over on Martin's website. (Shortly after the Deep Blue rumours emerged, a second colour rumour came to light on the same blog. Macotakara now said that Space Black would be introduced instead of Deep Blue to replace the current Space Grey option. And while the names were different - black and Jet Black, in fact - Apple did indeed replace Space Grey with black colour options. Does this leave Deep Blue for the next generation?) More recently, Macotakara has been reporting a new colour rumour, predicting that the 2017 iPhones will be available in red. iPhone 8 design: Apple Watch-style Digital Crown Some of the more out-there concept illustrators have considered the idea of Apple giving the iPhone 7 a rotating control, like the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch. But the rest of us thought it was a crazy idea. But it might just be so crazy that it actually happens, if a new Apple patent is anything to go by. The patent, spotted like so many of these things by Patently Apple, is illustrated with images of an iPad but is described in sufficiently broad terms that it could easily apply to an iPhone too. The patent suggests that the rotating control could to adjust volume, resize text and various other functions, and all of this makes a certain sense; but does anyone honestly think it's something Apple would really do with its elegant clean iPhone? Our strong suspicion is that this is one of those patents Apple and other tech companies periodically take out in order to mislead rivals and cover moonshot concepts that are extremely unlikely to lead anywhere. iPhone 8 design: No more bezels above and below screen Apple has been awarded a patent that covers the embedding of light sensors within the layers of a display, leading to speculation that the firm intends to remove the bezels from its next iPhone. Indeed, the patent - US Patent 9,466,653 - specifically describes the tiresome current necessity for bezels in the background section: "In a typical device, a light sensor is laterally displaced from an active display region of the display along a front face of the device. Additional space is therefore provided in common devices at the top, bottom, or side of the active display area to accommodate the light sensor." Instead, the patent proposes to integrate the sensor within the display: "The light sensor is a display-integrated light sensor that is integrated into the layers of the display. The light sensor may [be] interposed between the cover layer and another layer of the display such as the touch-sensitive layer, the light-generating layers, or another display layer." This is Fig. 11 of the patent's illustrations, showing "a display-integrated light sensor attached to a thin-film transistor layer of a bottom emission organic light-emitting diode display". Of course, another hardware element that's currently built into the bezel at the bottom of the iPhone is the Home button. Which leads to our next section...  iPhone 8 design: No more physical home button (and Touch ID built into the display) Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster (a well-known industry pundit, but one who has come in for a fair amount of ribbing after regularly predicting that Apple would launch a television), suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, thanks to the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s. He felt that the new tech provides Apple with a way to eliminate the home button, instead using the additional space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. The issue with Munster's theory is that the Touch ID would need to move, as it is currently situated beneath the home button on Apple's iPhones and iPads. However, as we discuss below, Apple has been investigating ways to build the Touch ID sensor into the screen itself. Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true, but may yet happen on the iPhone 8.  In the continuing march of miniaturisation, one of the elements of the iPhone design that's proved resistant to shrinkage is the bezel below the screen - it can't get much smaller than it already is because it needs to house the Home button. Which is why a recurring theory is that Apple will extend the screen down past the Home button, or even incorporate the Touch ID sensor that lives in the recent iPhones' Home button into the touchscreen. Technology that would facilitate such a development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company called Sonavation. The tech would enable Apple (which is known to use Gorilla Glass in its iPhones, even if the supplier is apparently not permitted to say this publicly) to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that appeared to back up the theory that it's looking into ideas like this. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed by a number of Apple's engineers in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the accompanying illustrations (although you should bear in mind that patent images are almost universally ugly, and shouldn't bear much resemblance to what the finished design would look like): The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept, not to show what it would look like in practice. iPhone 8 design: Touch ID screen patent granted An update to this rumour: Apple has been granted a patent - a different one - that also appears to refer to a Touch ID fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more intriguingly for our purposes, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". iPhone 8 design: Touch ID sensors on the side of the device Korea Herald cites "a source familiar with the matter" when reporting that Apple is exploring "new sensing technologies" that could substantially change the way Touch ID works. "The upcoming iPhone may use new sensing technology," explains the site's source, "which enables the phone to respond when users touch any side of the device. But Apple may not adopt this technology." The source doesn't specify whether the new sensors are connected to Touch ID, but it seems likely: all the talk of removing bezels and physical Home buttons and expanding the screen is going to necessitate finding a new location for the fingerprint scanner. If the iPhone becomes able to sense and analyse fingerprints on any edge, that would even remove the need for a specific Touch ID 'action' - you'd just need to pick the phone up. iPhone 8 design: Changes to Home button Some rumours suggest Apple is working on keeping the Home button and adding more features to it. There are two patents that have sparked these rumours, so they're both something Apple has at least considered. The first is a dynamic home button that is sensitive to gestures: you'd be able to swipe across it, or lean a thumb in one direction to scroll the screen of a game, for example, that way.  The second is pretty far out there. Essentially the concept is this: the Home button on the iPhone would be able to 'pop up' on a little spring and turn into a sort of mini-joystick for playing games. There are plenty of iOS games that would benefit from a hardware controller (this explains the enduring popularity of Bluetooth gaming controller accessories) and this sounds like a lot of fun. But gamers remain only one section of the iPhone's audience, and it seems like a risky idea to potentially compromise the resilience of everyone's iPhone Home button (which has famously been very prone to breakage in the past) for a feature that would benefit only some users. Best iPhone (and iPad) games iPhone 8 design: A larger, longer earpiece While this may not be the most exciting rumour to hit the internet, the latest rumours suggest that the next iPhone is to feature a longer earpiece cutout. The rumour, first covered by Mac Otakara, states that in addition to a longer earpiece cutout, Apple is moving the ambient light sensor from the left-hand side to the right-hand side. The source is apparently manufacturers of LCD protective films on Alibaba.com that are apparently no lonoger receiving orders related to the upcoming iPhone.  While the rumour is unconfirmed and should be taken with a pinch of salt, but if true, it could mean that the iPhone 8 may not be compatible with iPhone 7 cases and screen protectors, even if the design is broadly the same. iPhone 8 design: Curved wraparound screen According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has often correctly predicted upcoming Apple products - the analyst think a forthcoming iPhone could feature a curved 5.8in AMOLED screen. If this rumour is to be true, there would be an understandable shift from Apple to get rid of the headphone jack and produce a smartphone which is immediately distinguishable over its competitors.  We're into the realm of patents here, which we would generally warn readers means we're talking about developments that could easily end up appearing in a shipped product several years down the line or not appearing at all - Apple, like most tech companies, routinely applies for far more patents than it's ever going to use. But this one has actually been granted (it was applied for a few years back) so it could be reasonably close to reality. Patent 9,146,590 refers to an "electronic device with wrap around display". And essentially it describes a curved screen that allows for more screen elements to be displayed without making the device significantly bigger. (Remember that the illustrations rarely represent what the designer has in mind. In theory the display could wrap entirely around the device, or at least extend over one edge like the Note Edge.) While the patent talks about a "flexible display assembly", it's important to note that this isn't a patent for a bendable screen: the flexible portion of the display is attached to the interior surface of the curved transparent housing, which "provides a rigid support structure that prevents deformation". Samsung Display could be set to make flexible OLED displays for the iPhone 8. The rumour stems from claims that Samsung is reaching out to display tech companies in South Korea that they're hoping will lend a hand with building the displays, as the order from Apple will be huge. Samsung may even be intending to invest billions in an new factory in which it'll manufacture the displays. At present, iPhones use LCD displays, but the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED so it's certainly possible that Apple intends to bring the tech to the iPhone. We're not talking flexible in the same way as the patent above, though. It'll simply mean that the screen could curve around the design of the iPhone 8 more accurately, hinting further at an edge-to-edge display. It'll also likely be used to improve 3D Touch. iPhone 8 design: Plastic screen The Korea Herald report we linked to earlier also discusses the screen, and the site's "source familiar with the matter" predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a display that is curved and OLED - both rumours that we've heard before - and made of plastic, which is a new one to us. "The OLED versions of the new iPhone will all have curved screens as Apple ordered only plastic OLED - not glass - from Samsung Display," reports the source. "Samsung is capable of supplying a little less than 100 million units of curved OLED displays to Apple." iPhone 8 design: Sapphire iPhone screens are already far tougher than your average piece of glass (they're made of a proprietary material called Gorilla Glass), but they do sometimes crack or even shatter when dropped. Sapphire screens would be more resistant still, and Apple is already using sapphire in the display of the Apple Watch: it's possible that the company is now ready to import this material into its smartphone line-up. Rumoured plans to rely on an Apple-backed sapphire plant in Arizona (which had the capacity to manufacture 200 million 5-inch iPhone displays per year) fell through. But more recent reports suggest that long-term Apple supplier Foxconn is gearing up to build its own sapphire plant in Taiwan at a cost of $2.6bn. In August 2016, it was reported by Patently Apple that Apple filed patents for a curved glass iPhone with virtual buttons on the sides. If accurate, this could be somwhat like the rumoured OLED bar on the expected new MacBook Pro, but time will tell. The patent images also show a curved glass screen similar to that which we have now seen made popular by Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge and S7 edge. This has helped to fuel the rumours that Apple is planning a major redesign for the iPhone 8 to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Either way, it'll have to be signifcantly different to Samsung's efforts to avoid Apple being accused of plagiarism. Then again, most smartphones of the past decade have aped the original iPhone, so we're sure that wouldn't prove problematic for Apple - particularly since these patents show its legal right to product the devices in this way. Read more: What is Sapphire glass, and why is it a good idea for the iPhone? iPhone 8 design: Project Phire Corning, the company that makes Gorilla Glass, responded to the looming threat of sapphire glass in early 2015 with the announcement of an ultra-hardened composite material codenamed Project Phire. James Clappin, president of Corning Glass Technologies, told investors: "We told you last year that sapphire was great for scratch performance but didn't fare well when dropped. So we created a product that offers the same superior damage resistance and drop performance of Gorilla Glass 4 with scratch resistance that approaches sapphire." Apple never discusses the materials it uses for iPhone screens, but it's great news for consumers that suppliers are jousting to provide the best and most durable screen glass. Read more about Project Phire here. iPhone 8 design: Graphene Sapphire glass is already being used on the non-Sport models of the Apple Watch, and Project Phire appears to be in a reasonably advanced state of development, but we're getting closer to the realms of science-fiction. Graphite, the material used in standard pencils, is made up of stacks of sheets of carbon, each one only a single atom thick. This is why it's so good for writing: the layers naturally slide off on to the paper. But graphene is a different matter. Graphene is what you get if you're clever enough to isolate one of the layers in graphite, leaving you with a substance that's effectively two-dimensional. It's the thinnest substance known to man, about a million times thinner than a human hair, and for that matter quite possibly the strongest (it's 100 times stronger than steel) and a phenomenally good electrical conductor - 1,000 times better than copper. Oh, and it's virtually transparent, too. All of which makes graphene an exciting prospect for tech manufacturers. Most obviously, it would make for a tremendously durable coating material for the screen (and would lend itself to bendable displays, too) or indeed any part of the device; but it could really appear in almost any of the sections of this article. Graphene would be a superior replacement for silicon in processor chips, or could be used to make more efficient batteries and solar cells. It's marvellous stuff. We're also pleased to report that graphene is British - sort of. It was discovered by the Soviet-born physicist Andre Geim at the University of Manchester, where it continues to be studied. (Entertainingly, Geim is the only scientist so far to be awarded both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel prize.) If you'd like to read more about graphene, I strongly recommend the New Yorker's article on the subject. iPhone 8 design: Viscoelastic material Let's move on from the screen and talk about new durable materials for the rest of the iPhone. How about a bit of drop-resistance? Based on patent activity, Apple is devising a viscoelastic material that would absorb impacts. The material would cover Apple devices and make them survive drops far better. The patent could make sense in all of Apple's mobile devices and laptops, but the iPhone is the obvious area to begin. iPhone 8 design: Flexible iPhone In January 2015 Apple was awarded a patent that suggests that the company is investigating the idea of a flexible iPhone (and we're not talking about the Bendgate kind). The patent suggests that, by making the iPhone flexible, Apple could unlock a new range of controls: the user could open an app by bending the device in a particular way, for example, or use the flexibility to control a game. It's an intriguing if seemingly far-fetched concept. Additionally, a flexible iPhone flexible ought to be more resistant to impacts and therefore more durable. But we'll discuss a key element in the idea of a flexible iPhone - a screen that can bend without breaking - in the screen tech section. iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: New features That covers design. But what new features should we expect in the iPhone 8? iPhone 8 new features: Smart connector Could the iPhone 8 get a smart connector, like those used on the 9.7in and 12.9in iPad Pro collection? Of course, as with any rumour/leak it's best to take it with a pinch of salt but according to a report from Mac Otakara, a forthcoming iPhone will feature a smart connector. Mac Otakara claims "the possibility is great" that earlier leaked images are "the real thing", and even went on to claim that the next iPhone could be as thin as 6.1mm, although there was no source provided for this information. More recently, Logitech (or Logi?) has launched the Logi Base, the first accessory to utilise the iPad Pro smart connector for charging capabilities. As first reported by AppleInsider, the Base uses magnets to easily line up the iPad Pro with the charger, providing users with something close to wireless charging. It also means that you can pick up the iPad and walk away without needing to unplug it. While it's specific to the iPad Pro, it gives you an idea about what a smart connector on an iPhone could be used for.  iPhone 8 new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), but Apple has been offering the feature for some years now in the form of the Apple Watch's inductive charging... and this is significant. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate - but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This was obviously too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus which appeared only two months later, and didn't make it into the iPhone 7 either. But the technology may appear in the iPhone 8 generation. Indeed, Foxconn - one of the large manufacturing firms that builds iPhones for Apple - is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones (it would make a neat point of differentiation for the iPhone 8 Plus) if the tests prove satisfactory. The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in one of his Apple Insight research notes that Apple will bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the Apple Watch. Perhaps the iPhone 8 Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 8 buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers slightly more detail of Ming-Chi Kuo's predictions, clarifying that Pegatron is expected to be "the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger". Wireless charging sounds amazing, but we should stress that at the moment inductive charging has a very short range; so you wouldn't be able to just sit at your desk and have your iPhone (in your pocket) charge from the plug several feet away. (Bloomberg reckons Apple is working on longer-range wireless charging, potentially charging at a distance of about 1 metre using near-field magnetic resonance, but this seems more of a long shot.) Rather, you'd place the device on a wired mat. Convenient, but not quite as space-age as it might have sounded when we talked about 'wireless charging'. If you can't wait until the iPhone 8 to start charging your iPhone wirelessly, read How to wirelessly charge your iPhone. iPhone 8 new features: Face-detection and iris-recognition In December 2014, USPTO awarded Apple a patent relating to a "personal computing device control using face detection and recognition". Current iPhones and iPads can be unlocked using just your fingerprint, thanks to the Touch ID sensor. But with this patent, future iPhones and other devices could be unlocked using facial recognition: effectively, your face becomes your password. More recently, DigiTimes has predicted - citing that old favourite, "industry sources" - that Apple is likely to launch iPhones equipped with iris-recognition technology in 2018, which should line up with the iPhone 8's launch. This rumour was reiterated at the end of August when Digitimes reported that Taiwan-based Xintec is expected to provide iris scanners to Apple for the iPhone launching in 2017, and that this would help boost the company's revenues significantly next year. Once this technology becomes widespread - and you should expect other firms to launch phones with the feature before Apple, with DigiTimes predicting that Samsung for one will get there in the second half of 2016 - you'll be able to unlock your iPhone by scanning your eye. Is that really more convenient than scanning a fingerprint, though? It's more excitingly futuristic, admittedly. iPhone 8 new features: Augmented reality and VR In the Facebook post by Robert Scoble we mentioned earlier, one of the more surprising and detailed predictions concerns augmented reality and VR. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming to a phone, and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts: "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand. Apple's purchase of Metaio is going to prove very key. I won't be shocked to learn that Peter Meier, CTO there, is in charge of the next iPhone strategy and has been for years." Scoble isn't the only pundit predicting that Apple - and the iPhone in particular - are about to plunge into the world of augmented reality. Business Insider claims that the company is already working on ways to integrate AR elements into the iPhone's Camera app. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised, according to Kris Kolo, director of the VR/AR Association and a board member of Flyby Media, an AR startup that was acquired by Apple earlier this year," writes the site. Business Insider further predicts that the iPhone's camera app will be able to recognise "and manipulate" faces in augmented reality. And we've spotted a recent Apple patent application that appears to back up all this speculation. Patent 9,488,488, for 'Augmented reality maps', describes the use of a mobile device to view live video of whatever is in front of the user, and to then superimpose images related to nearby places of interest on top of the video. "A user points a handheld communication device to capture and display a real-time video stream. The handheld communication device detects geographic position, camera direction, and tilt of the image capture device. The user sends a search request to a server for nearby points of interest. ... The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with data related to each point of interest. The user then selects a point of interest to visit. The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with a directional map to a selected point of interest in response to the user input." Read more: Apple VR and augmented reality rumours iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Specs It's hard to predict precise specs this far in advance, but it's possible to draw some broad conclusions about where Apple is headed. Let's start with... iPhone 8 specs: Screen A report by the Wall Street Journal prophesies that Apple has big things up its sleeve for the next iPhone's screen, after turning out smartphones with lower resolutions than their rivals for some years. (If you compare the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, you'll see that Apple managed only a 760 x 1334 resolution on its 4.7-inch screen, in comparison to the 1440 x 2560 5.1-inch screen that Samsung had to offer. Comparison possibly isn't the right word to use when the difference is as pronounced as that.) The iPhone 8 will sit in Samsung's shadows no longer, according to the WSJ, which says Apple has asked suppliers to "submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung". If this is true - and if the suppliers are able to match Apple's stipulation without pushing up price, weight or dimension, or reducing battery life or fire safety, to a degree that Apple finds unacceptable - then this would imply more than a tripling of the pixel count from one iPhone generation to the next. What's more, word is that screens are getting bigger in 2017. In November 2016, Barclays Research - via MacRumors - released a report predicting that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would have 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens respectively, compared to the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The analysts based the prediction on the testimony of sources within Apple's Asian supply chain. It's still early days, though: the analysts warned that the design "didn't sound 100% locked down", so Apple may yet change its mind. If you're wondering how Apple will fit in that extra screen real estate - will the phones be bulkier than the current handsets? - then fear not. It's understood that the larger screens will fit in bodies with the same dimensions as the current generation of phones, thanks to a bezel-free design. This has been on the cards for a while. On 5 March 2015, indeed, Apple filed a patent that would allow for a bezel-free device. An image render and concept by Marek Weidlich shows us what the iPhone might look like if it were to have no bezels. The conceptual idea looks great and would show that Apple is still innovating in the smartphone space. Similarly, according to a Wall Street Journal source, the iPhone 8 may feature an edgeless display - but what is that, exactly? According to the publication, Apple is to redesign the iPhone for the 10th anniversary and that the changes "could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen" without a physical Home button. John Gruber also commented on the upcoming redesign, claiming that Apple is to remove the bezels surrounding the display, providing users with an iPhone that looks almost like a sheet of glass. If Apple kills off the bezel, it will need to find a new place to put the Home button. On which topic, it's believed that Apple is investigating including the fingerprint scanner into the display of a smartphone or tablet. In fact, Apple filed a patent describing a Touch ID display back in January 2013.  This technology means that you could place your finger on the display to scan it, instead of the Home Button. We're not sure if this technology was an original variation to the Home Button scanner found on the iPhone 5s, or if it'll be combined with the Haptics & Tactile technology to remove the Home Button on a future iPhone and replace it with a virtual onscreen button. The Barclays Research report we mentioned earlier also predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a curved screen. This broadly fits in with earlier predictions. Some while back Nikkei predicted that autumn 2017 will see a massive triple iPhone launch, and that the flagship model of this trio will feature a curved OLED screen that curves down over the sides. This is something we've already seen on rival devices, such as Samsung's S7 Edge and Note 7; it enables more screen space to be squeezed on to a device without making it any bigger, and you can also have notifications designed to be seen or activated on the edge of the screen. "There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides," said Nikkei's source, who was said to be "familiar with Apple's plans". A company named Applied Materials, which already works with Apple, has dropped strong hints about ramping display demand from the company heading towards 2017, and this has been taken as evidence for the iPhone 8 incorporating an OLED screen. "Applied Materials reported an almost fourfold leap in orders for equipment to make displays, an early sign producers are retooling their manufacturing to meet Apple's demand for a new kind of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen," reports Bloomberg. This appeared to be confirmed on 29 October 2016 by Tai Jeng-wu, the president of Sharp, which makes smartphone displays for Apple. Tai, who was speaking to students at his old university, said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS [low-temperature poly-silicon] to OLED panels. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." The OLED iPhone rumour has been knocking around for a while; in December 2015 it was predicted that OLED would come to the iPhone line in 2018 as a result of a partnership between Apple and Japan Display. Talking of Japan Display... that company uses a new technology that it calls "full active LCD", and some pundits believe that only one of the new iPhones next year will get OLED, while the other(s) have screens based on full-active LCD. The technology, which Japan Display describes as using "a new high-density wiring layout and new processing and module assembly technologies" is capable of making the bottom bezel of an iPhone "as narrow as the other three sides". Japan Display aims to start mass production by the end of March, 2017, according to Fool.com - in time for the iPhone 8 launch, then. iPhone 8 specs: Processor As everyone knows, the iPhones contain proprietary processor chips that you won't find in other smartphones: there's an A9 in the iPhone 6s, and we should get an A10 chip in the iPhone 7, for example. But while these are made to Apple's own design and specifications, several other companies are involved: they contain technology licensed from ARM, and are manufactured, at present, by Samsung and TSMC. But that could change by the time 2018 comes around. Intel has declared its intention of expanding its smartphone business, and is hot favourite to displace TSMC from the iPhone contract, according to the Nikkei Asian Review - an aim that may be more feasible thanks to the company's recently announced partnership with ARM. TSMC's ties with ARM have given it a competitive edge when it comes to securing the contract in the past. "Intel is definitely the most formidable challenger for TSMC," said an anonymous chip-industry executive. "There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel so it's really likely that Apple could shift some orders there. The move is also in line with Washington's policy to encourage US companies to make more products at home." iPhone 8 specs: Camera The iPhone is one of the most widely used cameras in the world. What's in store for this vital element of the iPhone of the future? Lucky iPhone owners of the future may get their hands on a feature currently offered only by premium video cameras. In March 2015 Apple was granted a patent for a "digital camera with light splitter". Its project is to create a light splitter system (which for now exists only in high-end video camera) small enough to fit in an iPhone. In essence, a light splitter system consists of a cube that splits received light into three colours: red, green and blue. The cube provides three image sensors, each of which receives one colour component. In recent iPhones, the camera system is such that its pixels capture the three component colours which end up occupying only a single image sensor; this means that they can fill only one third of the image sensor and colours are not as accurate as they could be. The light splitter system would be a big coup for Apple. Its iPhone would be able to capture high-quality pictures with more precise colours, especially at night. Apple seems to be keen to improve the camera capabilities of its iOS devices, and one patent published by USPTO in May 2014 suggests we could soon see iPhones that are able to capture "Super-resolution" photos thanks to optical image stabilisation, which is already a feature of the iPhone 6 Plus. The patent describes a system that takes a series of photographs at slightly different angles and stitches them together to create a 'super resolution' photograph. Apple doesn't suggest a device would capture every photo this way. Instead, the user would have the option to turn super-resolution mode on, much like HDR and Panorama modes. Several rumours suggest that Apple plans to introduce a feature like this with an iPhone in the near future, with reports pointing to a 'DSLR-quality' capability that would represent the biggest camera jump in iPhone upgrade history. iPhone 8 specs: Battery life One rumour holds that Apple will take the battery developments it deployed in the 12-inch MacBook - whereby contoured, layered battery units are stacked inside the chassis in order to take up every possible inch of space - and use these to squeeze more battery volume inside the iPhone. (According to Wired's write-up, Apple actually claims to adjust its battery contours on a machine-by-machine basis, by photographing the inside of the chassis and modifying the battery stack to fit all the tiny imperfections - which, if it's true, is amazing.) Smartphone battery life is one of those things that everyone says is important, and once again Apple will hear many requests for improved battery life in the iPhone 8 - but you do wonder how much of a compromise the average Apple fan would be willing to make in return. What if, in order to achieve a superb battery life, the iPhone 8 was twice the weight, or cost significantly more? What if the screen was less powerful or the processor scaled back? Mirroring these thoughts somewhat, Jony Ive discussed battery life briefly in an interview with the Financial Times' 'How to spend it' supplement recently. And he gave fairly heavy hints that Apple doesn't think battery life is a high enough priority to make compromises in other areas worth it. "Talking of performance, when the issue of the frequent need to recharge the iPhone is raised, [Ive] answers that it's because it's so light and thin that we use it so much and therefore deplete the battery. With a bigger battery it would be heavier, more cumbersome, less 'compelling'." In December 2015 Apple gave its critics an early Christmas present by unveiling a battery pack for the iPhone 6 and 6s that is, without wishing to be unpleasant and apologies for the language, pretty gosh-darn ugly. (To be fair, we've not yet got our hands on a review sample, so we may be won over by its feel, performance, usability and so on.) In a single surprising step the company put its famed sense of taste and design nous in doubt (coming after the suspect decision to put the charge port for the Magic Mouse 2 on its bottom), and simultaneously reminded everyone that iPhone battery life is generally felt to be subpar. Is this a tacit acknowledgement that battery life is a problem for the iPhone range? Can we therefore expect the iPhone 8 to see improvements in this department as Apple looks for a more full-time and less bulky solution to the issue? We might (battery technology is improving all the time), but this probably isn't the mea culpa some iPhone users were looking for. When discussing the new case, Tim Cook emphasised that it wasn't for everyone (at £80 you'd hope not), and that he felt that even those who did need the case would only use it in relatively extreme scenarios when power wouldn't be available for a long time: when hiking, for example. I would agree that Apple is aware that battery life is a concern for a lot of its customers, but it knew that long before it released its battery pack. And battery life remains a question of compromises, such that increasing it always necessitates either making a device thicker, heavier or more expensive, or choosing not to make it thinner, lighter or cheaper when you could have done. I still believe that most people would rather have a thin, relatively cheap iPhone than a fat, more expensive iPhone with an extra two hours of battery life. And now anyone who would be willing to make that compromise now has an officially sanctioned alternative: spend the extra money, make your phone fatter and uglier, and get the battery pack. In a crazy sort of way, the ugliness of the battery pack almost makes sense as a demonstration of what drastically improved battery life actually looks like. "You want twice the battery life? Even if that means your iPhone has a massive lump on the back? Yeah, DIDN'T THINK SO." iPhone 8 specs: LiFi A boring but important rumour about the iPhone 8's specs relates to LiFi, a new wireless standard that boasts 100x faster download speeds than conventional WiFi connections. LiFi uses visible light communication (VLC) instead of radio waves like conventional WiFi routers. Intrigued?

Here are our predictions of the new Mac mini's release date, specs and UK price. by Karen Haslam | 30 Nov 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Price Specs and features Design What is the Mac mini? When will Apple release a new Mac mini in the UK? And what new features and design changes can we expect from the updated Mac mini in 2017? A new Mac mini was expected to launch in 2016, since the line wasn't updated at all in 2015; but Apple (as usual) is giving nothing away. Nevertheless, based on past experience and the specs of current Macs, we've got a fair idea of what to expect from the new Mac mini, and when to expect it. We've got all the new Mac mini hints and rumours for you right here. Read on for the next Mac mini's likely release date, specs, design changes and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information is unearthed, so check back regularly for the latest Mac mini update rumours. And remember to check our Mac buying guide for current buying advice.. Updated 30 November: Apple has officially made the Mac mini (Early and late 2009, and mid 2010) vintage and obsolete - we still feel a Mac mini update is due in 2017 - read on to see the rumours. New Mac mini 2017 rumours: Release date When will the next Mac mini come out? Apple last updated the Mac mini on 16 October 2014 after a two-year wait: the previous model came out on 23 October 2012. Mac mini fans are now waiting for the next iteration of the smallest and cheapest Mac. There were rumours suggesting that Apple will do a low-key update to its Mac range by the end of November 2016. It seems Apple disliked the idea and instead, we would expect the mini to be updated during the March 2017 event. If we still don't see a replacement in March 2017, it's safe to assume that Apple have killed off the product line. New Mac mini 2017 release date rumours UK: Apple's October Mac event Apple's 27 October Mac launch event was broadcast live on Apple's website. While the company did announce three new versions of the MacBook Pro (two with a new Touch Bar), the rest of the Mac range, including the Mac mini, seemed to be pushed to the side. There was no mention of any other Mac updates, and the event finished rather quickly when looking at the length of previous Apple events.  Does this spell the end of the Mac mini range? As mentioned above, while we assumed that Apple would stick to its two-year upgrade cycle for the Mini, it seems not to be the case. We speculate that if it doesn't get announced at an event in March 2017 (when Apple usually updates the MacBook), we think that Apple will kill off the Mac Mini line entirely. We explain why in more detail below.  See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook Air release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release New Mac mini 2017 release date rumours: Previous theories One popular theory for a while was that the new Mac mini might make an appearance at WWDC 2016, which started on 13 June 2016 - but in the event, Apple didn't announce any new Macs at all. (Although Mac fans can console themselves with all the news about the macOS Sierra operating system, and what that means for your current machine. You can install macOS Sierra on your Mac mini right now, if it's a 2010 model or later.) Content continues below The next generation of Intel chips was made available to OEMs in Q4 2016 - they're called Kaby Lake, and it's possible that the new Mac mini could feature processors from this batch. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll talk about processors, and other specs, in a later section of this article.

Apple, to paraphrase a colleague, is generally very good at killing its darlings: at knowing when it makes sense to drop a much-loved product or product feature - one which is often still popular and/or profitable - and switch focus to something else that has more of a future. Think the iPod classic or the optical drive. That's why rumours that it's going to drop the headphone port from the iPhone 7, or switch its digital music business entirely from downloads to streaming, seem so plausible. There are a couple of candidates to be the next iPod classic. The MacBook Air is one. But the Mac mini, which hasn't been updated since 2014, is rarely mentioned at events, and feels surplus to requirements now that the Apple TV is making its claim as a media centre device (although for storing a large number of films the mini remains an excellent choice, offering 500GB as standard and up to 2TB as a configuration option), will be expecting a P45 more than most of Apple's product line-up. The design of the Mac mini hasn't changed significantly since it was first launched and is starting to feel a little dated, and the device doesn't have a clear selling point (or at least, Apple isn't doing a good job of communicating one). So it wouldn't surprise us if Apple quietly retired the line at its next Mac launch event. It's either that or give it a radical overhaul. If Apple does kill off the mini, we'd have to start asking questions about the 'mini' branding in general, and wondering if the iPads are going to be reorganised: there's already a sense that the 'Air' brand is on the way out, across both MacBooks and iPads. But that's a story for another day. New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Price How much will the next Mac mini cost? There are currently three models of the Mac mini available; the one that's best for you will depend on your budget and computing needs. The cheapest model currently costs £479, the middle model is £669, and the priciest model is £949 - this is a price increase since its launch, due to Brexit. Of course, you'll still need to factor in the price of a monitor, keyboard and mouse. (For advice on that, see our roundups of the Best Mac monitors, Best Mac keyboards and Best Mac mice.) However, we don't anticipate Apple reducing the price with the new model when it launches, so you can expect similar pricing. Hopefully better specs for your money, though, of course. Which leads us on to... New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Specs and features The Mac mini is Apple's most budget-focused desktop system and as such features relatively low-end components. But what specs upgrades should we expect from the next Mac mini? Processor: The Kaby Lake question It's unlikely that Apple will include an AMD processor in the next generation of Mac minis... unlikely, but not out of the question, given that AMD's new CPUs are set to come out this year. We'd rate the chances of an AMD chip appearing in the 2017 Mac mini as slight. However, we do expect Kaby Lake, the latest generation of Intel chips. Intel has now started shipping its Kaby Lake processors. But the key word there is 'started': the Kaby Lake processors that would be suitable for a Mac mini may not appear for some months, assuming Apple decides to plump for a Kaby Lake chipset at all. According to MacRumors, in fact, mini-appropriate Kaby Lake chips may not roll out until very late 2016 or even early 2017, so any Mac mini launched before then would be limited to Skylake, the previous generation of Intel processors. That would still represent a significant power boost over the current Haswell processors. Kaby Lake supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2, as well as 4K video. The chips are manufactured using a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake. The next generation, Cannonlake, will switch over to a more accurate 10nm process. As we discuss in our iMac rumour roundup, Intel has laid out a roadmap for its next four generations of processor. After Skylake and Kaby Lake, Intel will release Cannonlake, then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019. Graphics Our iMac predictions also include new graphics chipsets: Polaris 10, by AMD, which is particularly interesting because it may make the next iMacs VR-ready. But the current range of Mac mini models feature integrated graphics, and we expect this to remain the case in the next generation. RAM Right now, the entry-level Mac mini features just 4GB RAM as standard, which we think should be ramped up to 8GB in the new entry-level model. Storage The other big change we hope to see in the new Mac mini is the addition of more flash drive options. Currently the 2.8GHz model comes with a Fusion Drive, or you can add 256GB flash storage to that model, or the 2.8GHz model. While the 500GB hard drive in the current entry-level model (and the 1TB hard drive as standard in the £569 model) might appear attractive to some, flash memory is so much faster that we believe it is well worth the compromise of storing additional files on an external hard drive. However, it seems unlikely that Apple would do away with the hard drive storage option altogether, as many workgroups choose the Mac mini as a server and will need the extra capacity and lower prices that HD storage makes possible. Read next: New iMac rumours | New Mac Pro rumours USB-C It's felt like the USB port has been on borrowed time ever since Apple launched the first-gen 12-inch MacBook - with its lone USB Type-C (or, more commonly, just USB-C) port for both data and charging - in 2015. Like the optical drive circa 2012, it seems likely that bog-standard USB 3.0 is no longer in Apple's thoughts, and (unless the market rejects USB-C comprehensively, which despite some qualms about there only being one port on the MacBook, hasn't happened yet) it's surely a matter of time before the rest of the Mac line-up switches across to the newer tech. USB-C offers more advantages than just being reversible and thereby easier to connect when you can't see what you're doing; in theory, it offers twice the data throughput of USB 3.0 and the ability to deliver far more power. The latter factor enabled Apple to use USB-C as a combined data and power port and further slim down its laptop design. Our feeling is that the Mac mini won't be next on Apple's update list, however - our money's on the revamped MacBook Pro. As a budget-focused (and somewhat neglected) line, the Mac mini isn't likely to get the love and cutting-edge componentry of more favoured products. And power delivery - and the ability to remove extraneous ports and slim down the chassis - is far less of a concern for a static machine like the mini than for a portable like the MacBook. New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Design It's possible that the Mac mini will get a new design. We're not expecting a major visual or build redesign, but it is certainly possible that it could get thinner and smaller, especially since it no longer has to accommodate a CD drive. Right now the dimensions are 3.6cm high, 19.7cm wide, and it weighs 1.22kg. How about a Mac mini that has similar dimensions to an Apple TV? (That's 9.8cm wide, 2.3cm high, and a weight of 0.27kg.) There was some speculation that the reason for the long delay prior to the Mac mini update in 2014 was that Apple was looking at redesiging the Mac mini along the lines of the Mac Pro. This was probably intended as an April Fool's Day prank, but we like this render of a flat Mac mini, as seen on Apple User. Even better, how about a Mac mini that's also an Apple TV? Adding Apple TV functionality to a Mac mini would be a great way of getting the Mac mini into people's living rooms as a home entertainment device. New Mac mini 2017 rumours: What is the Mac mini? Not the no-brainer it might sound like to keen mini-heads: plenty of otherwise tech-savvy folk aren't aware the Mac mini even exists. Indeed, sometimes it seems like Apple itself isn't aware of its presence. That would certainly explain the long gap before the 2014 model was launched. The Mac mini is Apple's smallest desktop Mac and also its cheapest Mac, at £479. It's a full-blown OS X or macOS Sierra desktop that fits into a self-contained chassis no bigger than a set-top box. It's an inexpensive living-room Mac that lacks the power of even some MacBooks and comes with no keyboard, mouse or display, but one that works perfectly as the centre of your digital home - not least because it comes with HDMI sockets, so that plugging it into a modern TV is a doddle. There used to be a Mac mini with OS X Server available for £849 but Apple removed that option from the line-up in October 2014.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Sep 2, 2016 at 7:07PM InvenSense (NYSE:INVN), a maker of motion sensors for smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and other devices, lost about 25% of its market value over the past 12 months due to slowing sales of mobile devices worldwide.  Image source: Getty Images. That pressure caused InvenSense's revenue to fall 43% annually last quarter, compared to a 20% decline in the previous quarter and 59% growth in the year ago quarter. The company's heavy dependence on Apple and Samsung, which respectively generated 40% and 16% of its sales last year, also makes it a riskier play than more diversified suppliers. The company's cash position also plunged 44% sequentially to $23 million last quarter. That's why I previously declared that InvenSense was far too risky for most investors. If you're looking for better supply chain plays in the mobile market, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) might be much safer long-term plays. STMicroelectronics STMicro makes a wide variety of semiconductors for connected cars, smart appliances, and various Internet of Things gadgets. In a devastating blow to InvenSense last year, Apple installed STMicro's motion sensors instead of InvenSense's into the Apple Watch.  STMicro has two key advantages against InvenSense -- it's bigger, enabling it to leverage economies of scale against smaller suppliers, and it's better diversified. Last quarter, 42% of its revenues came from its automotive business, 33% came from microcontrollers and digital integrated circuits, and 22% came from the MEMS (micro-electrical mechanical systems) business which competes against InvenSense. Revenue rose year-over-year at its automotive segment, fueled by content share gains in connected cars, but fell at its other two businesses, due to softer demand for networking applications and mobile devices. But overall, STMicro's revenues fell just 3% last quarter, compared to a 5% decline in both the previous and prior year quarters. Analysts expect STMicro's revenue to stay flat this year, then rise 4% next year on stronger demand for automotive chips and higher demand from connected and mobile devices. By comparison, InvenSense's revenue is expected to fall 24% this year before possibly rebounding 14% next year. STMicro's motion sensors power the Apple Watch. Image source: Apple. STMicro's net income fell 34% last quarter, but it's expected to finish the year with 5% earnings growth and post an average of 49% annual earnings growth over the next five years. That gives it a very low 5-year PEG ratio of 0.8, which is lower than the "undervalued" threshold of 1. InvenSense's earnings are expected to fall 78% this year but possibly rebound to an average of 20% growth over the next five years, giving it a much pricier PEG ratio of 3.4. STMicro also pays a forward annual dividend yield of 3.1%, while InvenSense has never paid a dividend. Texas Instruments Like STMicro, Texas Instruments (TI) is a better diversified supply chain play than InvenSense. The company generates most of its revenue by selling analog and embedded chips for the industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communication equipment, and enterprise systems markets. Apple is one of Texas Instruments' top customers, but its orders only accounted for 11% of its top line last year. TI's revenue rose 1.2% annually to $3.27 billion last quarter. Analysts expect the company's sales growth to stay almost flat this year but rise 4% next year. TI stands out from the competition for two reasons -- its massive margins and its shareholder friendly practices. By using a lower-cost 300-millimeter analog manufacturing process, TI's gross margin hit 61.2% last quarter, up from 58.2% a year ago. By comparison, STMicro and InvenSense respectively had gross margins of 33.9% and 41% in their most recent quarters. Image source: Texas Instruments. Those beefy margins, along with buybacks, boosted its net earnings by 17% annually last quarter. Over the past 12 years, TI has reduced its share count by 42%, and raised its dividend every year during that period. It currently pays a forward yield of 2.2%, and has pledged to return 100% of its free cash flow to investors through buybacks and dividends. Analysts expect TI's earnings to rise 9% this year and grow at an average rate of 10% over the next five years. That gives it a PEG ratio of 2.3, which is higher than STMicro's PEG ratio but still lower than InvenSense's. The bottom line It's generally safer to invest in bigger and more diversified chipmakers like STMicro and Texas Instruments than smaller players like InvenSense, which are too exposed to single customers and lack the scale to remain competitive. STMicro and TI probably won't produce huge returns over the next year, but they also won't be hit as hard by news of weak sales of iPhones or other mobile devices.

Ireland’s FDI policy has been in train for nearly 70 years. It has shaped its economy not simply through cutting deals and sustaining low tax, but developing its education and outreach through its diaspora. It wasn’t just sentiment that brought big US companies ‘home’. The decision (available only by presser), by what amounts to the EU’s Civil Service, that Apple (a private company with approximately £600 billion in its savings account) must pay Ireland some €13 billion in unpaid taxes for the decade 2004 to 2014. As Jolyeon Maugham notes what has followed has been a domestic debate: …about whether to appeal against the decision couched in purely parochial terms: should we keep the windfall? or should we act to protect the advantages that come from tilting the playing field in our direction? The Commission believes (long commentary here) that Ireland has advanced Apple state aid, by recognising a virtual headquarters – that has no geographical base –  as Apple Sales International is the last known and substantial whereabouts of its humungous profits before they hit the bank. Broadsheet have transcribed a fascinating exchange between Professor Richard Murphy and Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes, which illustrates the tensions between Ireland’s national interest and that of the single market. First Murphy: It is the right decision, yes it is because if we believe in fair markets, if we believe that that’s the way we should organise the world, then everybody has to compete on a level playing field. And, as any economist will tell you, we need transparency. Well, this was a secret deal, it was done without people knowing. Then Hayes: …most of the cases on this top-level are being taken against small members states of the European Union – Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland. Countries that have, traditionally, certainly in the case of Ireland, have no industrial revolution, have since the 1960s got to open its doors towards inward investment and now we’re being asked, in terms of the entire corporate tax structure in Europe, to take these cases on. Aside from the problematic politics, there is a legitimate objection to the idea that Ireland is solely responsible for the collection of tax on up to 60% of Apple’s global profits, and that’s the one lodged by Seamus Coffey: …even for Apple stores it’s not clear that the customers were buying from ASI.  Apple Retail UK Ltd which runs Apple stores in the UK had £900 million of sales in 2014 (accounts here).  The shops might have bought the devices from ASI but the customers bought them from Apple Retail UK Ltd. Only the Irish branch of Apple Sales International had the capacity to generate any income from trading, i.e. from the distribution of Apple products. Therefore, the sales profits of Apple Sales International should have been recorded with the Irish branch and taxed there. And this is the contradiction.  We have “specific provisions in the Irish tax law” in the first extract saying the profits are not subject to Irish tax and the factual position set out by the Commission that only the Irish branch has substance.  The Commission are going for substance over law. [Emphasis added] So what about the prospects for a resolution? David McWilliams takes a relaxed view, saying that Ireland has nothing to fear from pushing for a challenge (remember, for all the hysteria at the moment, the ruling may not be published for weeks or months yet): Before we assess this unique opportunity given to us on a plate by the EU Commission, rest easy, because we win either way. If we lose the appeal, Ireland gets a windfall of €13bn, or about €2,600 per person. This is enough to wipe out our budget deficit for years to come, spend on what we will, or use in another way, which I will explain a bit later. If we lose, we will be seen by corporate America as its only friend in Europe. This is exactly where we want to be. It is not pretty, nor heroic, but it’s realpolitik. When you have no capital base, you have to borrow someone else’s. He expands upon that point in this interview on CNN: “Ireland wins both ways” when it comes to #Appletax decision by EU Commission says economist @davidmcw https://t.co/LgHUsjIKUQ — Connect the World (@CNNConnect) August 30, 2016 McWilliams’ framing is interesting, if a little extreme. He is clear that in this fight, Irish economic interest is far better served by staying much closer to Boston rather than Berlin since this is where most of the country’s capital originates. That it cannot control the outcome (Ireland, in this case, is merely the grass beneath the feet of two fighting elephants) may be a pragmatic virtue in the sense that in launching an appeal Ireland gets off the hook with its US investors. The Commission statement makes it clear that it is not questioning Ireland’s tax structure, at this stage at least. So, so long as this US-EU argument does not escalate, its current FDI policy should not be adversely affected. Fintan O’Toole argues that Ireland should just take the money and hang the consequences. He provides a nice range of policy suggestions that the €13 billion could usefully pay for… More likely the government will appeal the ruling, and the money put into an escrow account until it’s made its way through the European Court system. But money deferred until several days after tomorrow is not as appealing to the electorate as money today. And if there is one set of TDs in the Irish government who understand that better than most it is the independent populist members of the cabinet. The Irish Times reports rumours of a split, quoting a pithy Michael Noonan likening acceptance of the money to “eating the seed potatoes.” Final word to Maugham… If you agree with the proposition that it’s a good thing for big multinational companies to pay tax on their profits then you should be interested in how this strange state of affairs came about. It wasn’t Ireland, or Germany, or France, or the UK that delivered it. It was the European Commission. The reality is that the smaller you are, the more difficult it is for you to generate tax receipts. You’re less important a market. And you’re less able to absorb the risks attached to widening your tax base or increasing your tax rates. Or to face down threats of retaliation. On the other hand, the bigger the market you are, the greater the heft you have. As we have seen in the Euro crisis, what makes sense at the centre of Europe does not always work in the same way at the edge. Ireland would do well to play this one with it’s own longer national interests at the centre. It remains to be seen if the electorate is in any kind of mood for such a shortcut.

The EU insist it cannot be spent on tax reliefs for citizens or even current spending like employing more Garda or Nurses. No it MUST be used at the EUs behest to pay off any debts Ireland owes to the EU or or major capital works Do the people of Ireland realise the extent to which they are now indentured to a Commission that they do not elect and have no power to dismiss? terence patrick hewett It is pretty hard to see the extent of the fallout from this: certainly for Brexiteers and the City of London: Christmas has come twice already before December 25th. mickfealty My betting is on Apple. As highlighted by Seamus Coffey above, the ruling has been arrived at on the basis of substance rather than law. If Ireland doesn’t take the case, Apple certainly will. In which case the cash money now being dangled so deliciously in front of readers by Fintan and others is very unlikely to materialise. Kevin Breslin I think the Republic of Ireland at the end of the day will probably get a lot more than the measly £42 million the UK has settled upon from Apple. And the Irish people did decide on the Fiscal Compact, the British people had no direct say on how the UK manages its debt or international treaties and didn’t before they joined the EU either. http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2012/06/irelands-referendum-fiscal-compact The fact is people are sceptical about Brexit, just as people are sceptical about the EU, there are people who are going to be sceptical about both to be fair. And there’s really nothing that actually helps to manage Brexit as a result of this. For years and years Eurosceptics blamed the UK for everything, they’d blame it for Princess Diana’s death if they actually approved of her, and took next to no responsibility for its own decisions or mistakes. We have a very fractured Conservative party, leading a very fractured United Kingdom, scrutinized by a very fractured Labour Party. The Conservatives big problem is that it cannot manage conflicting demands of the grumblers within it for the type of Brexit they want, the Labour Party cannot deal with those wanting the 1950’s back and those wanting the 1990’s back. At the same time, companies relying on EU networks are being told they aren’t getting them as everything is going to change, and people who despise migrantion or the net contribution or certain regulations are being told nothing is going to change. The EU may have internal dialogue over finding some equilibrium in order to do things, but the UK being outside the EU needs to have that internal dialogue too as is going to find the toughest country it has to negotiate with is itself. Right now it really is losing that battle miserably as individual Tories demand their place as Brexit king or queen. chrisjones2 Well the case may take so long to decide, will the EU still be there when it ends? Even if it is will Ireland be in it? mickfealty Harumph. Declan Doyle It’s an odd world when those who occupy cabinet positions and are genuiinely concerned about the common good are dismissed as ‘populist’ but the parties who make the dodgy deals or land us in the economic schit are apparently pragmatic. Thomas Barber One door closes and another opens – http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/08/30/apple-ordered-to-pay-11bn-after-european-union-tax-investigation/ “Britain flutters eyelashes at Apple following European Commission tax ruling” Reader Kevin Breslin: I think the Republic of Ireland at the end of the day will probably get a lot more than the measly £42 million the UK has settled upon from Apple. Presumably because the profit was funnelled through Ireland leaving the UK (and Germany, and France, and Italy…) with nothing to tax. All of the above were actually in the EU at the time in question of course, which didn’t help them. Note that the commission has almost nothing to say about this profit shifting; their interest was in the extra sweeteners applied by Ireland instead. Ireland’s advantage lay in their ability to make a deal that suited both them and Apple. That seems to be coming to an end. Whether profits can be routed through a non-EU country in the future is an interesting question, isn’t it? mickfealty Ruling applies between 2004-14: ie, no longer a runner. Ireland can cut Corpo Tax to zero if it keeps within the ‘fiscal space’. But you point to a wider incentive for the Irish government not to follow Fintan’s advice and take the money now and run. Very different, of course, if the Commission wins, and Ireland is forced to take the money. mickfealty Really? I thought I’d laid plenty enough detail out there to give context to that remark. Perhaps you could reciprocate? terence patrick hewett “German activists have launched the country’s largest-ever civil lawsuit in protest of a planned free trade agreement between the EU and Canada. They argue the trade pact violates the constitution and the rule of law.” NGOs launch massive lawsuit against EU-Canada trade deal http://www.dw.com/en/ngos-launch-massive-lawsuit-against-eu-canada-trade-deal/a-19515611 As all this unfolds or in the case of the EU – unravels, the UK is being presented with and an amazing opportunity to create a massive trading zone: they can hardly believe their luck. chrisjones2 Its a genuine view….. Italy has the wobbles….the EU is beset with problems and has no strategy. It may easily fail chrisjones2 “Flutters eyelashes”? We have our fishnets on as well mickfealty I think India already was considered to have the same status as Ireland in this regard, though I’ve not looked into that in any great detail. Some 60% went via the Republic to the virtual headquarters. On the profit shifting, I suspect that’s because it’s hard to define where profit is due in a globalised chain. Easier to step on the last real place the profit moved through before it goes to the virtual HQ. All part of our old friend, “the political trillema of the world economy”: https://goo.gl/ApW5wC. Declan Doyle No context really at all. It was more like a subconscious hit and run type of comment. Dump the populist tag in the middle assuming the reader will make a negative association and therefore enforce the illusion that the governments position is both reasonable and logical. The only context given was an assumption based on an assumption; that being an assumption that the independents will assume the people will somehow be less bothered by the issue of the windfall in a few days or further down the line. Clever, all the same. Sherdy But will Britain have similar access to the EU market post-Brexit as Ireland has? mickfealty Calling for the Dail to reconvene is a good out. But their populism dictates they require cover after years of making easy hay at the expense of others will similar responsibilities. Declan Doyle Nothing easy about fighting against a system that is corrupt to the core and backed by a media which has lost all integrity. In fact, it would be much easier to play the game, join the club and get fat on the profits. Recalling the Dail in this situation is the right thing to do on a million different levels. The question now is how many of the ‘populares’ can be either bought off, or blackmailed into submission. JohnTheOptimist Ireland and Britain are in cut-throat competition for mobile FDI. Both have done much better than continental EU countries. Each has some advantages. Britain’s main advantages are its size, worldwide connections and pro-business environment. Ireland’s low-tax regime for businesses is its main advantage, although there are others. Britain would dearly love to undermine this advantage. and sees the Apple controversy as an opportunity. It has already said it would welcome Apple moving to Britain. I have no problem with Britain wanting this – bad-mouthing your competitors and trying to undermine their advantages is what all countries do. Ireland probably does the same. However, the role of SF in all this needs is interesting. You’d think that as a nationalist party they’d be going flat out to defend Ireland in this controversy and do everything possible to support the main pillar in Ireland’s economic success in recent decades, this economic success being by far the best argument in favour of a United Ireland, which SF claim to want. But, quite the opposite. Judging by their antics in Dublin yesterday (leaving apples outside FG head office), SF are clearly on the side of Ireland’s competitors in trying to undermine the low tax policy. Seems bizarre. The most likely explanation is the continuing influence of MI5 on SF’s policy-making process, following its takeover by said organisation in the 80s and 90s. Katyusha Not really surprising. SF are a left-wing quasi-socialist party as well as a nationalist party. They can hardly position themselves as standing up for the poor and downtrodden if they’re defending a multinational skimping on its tax burden. While it may not be accurate, there’s been a lot of talk about the taxpayer having to foot the burden that Apple evaded. SF want to portray themselves as on the side of those who have been cheated by the government, by big business and, in other cases, the EU. It doesn’t matter if that narrative is correct. All that matters is that it sells SF can hardly condemn Fianna Fail as corrupt, greedy and willing to sell the country to the highest bidder if they are defending the kind of “special treatment” that earned FF that reputation, and they need to portray Fine Gael as heartless and spineless in implementing the EU austerity program, willing to take on the EU when the interests of big business are threatened but not the ordinary citizen. The economic recovery has bypassed the most vulnerable in society; as such, SF do not have to defend the means by which it was achieved. FG’s “Lets Keep the Recovery Going” slogan is still used as a joke by SF months after the election. They need to differentiate themselves from FF and FG; defending their policies would not be a good move. When SF are trying to undermine the low-tax policy, they are not so much on the side of Ireland’s competitors as trying to undermine their own competitors. You might as well vote FF if you’re going to get the same policies. If you want low business tax rates and special measures to attract FDI, why would you vote SF over FF? Another thing. This debacle has little to do with Ireland’s low corporation tax rate. If Apple paid the same 12.5% rate that is apparently the corporation tax rate, I don’t think there would be a problem. At least there would be a level playing field for everyone. Paying 0.005% tax looks brazen and blatantly unfair. Kevin Breslin Well again they didn’t opt for Switzerland, didn’t opt for the American Tax havens, didn’t opt for the Channel Isles, Monaco, Iceland, Liechtenstein … you know the old reliables outside the EU. Apple picked an EU country for a reason. Kevin Breslin If Apple win, there will be tax reform in Ireland and the EU. If the EU wins there may be a rethink from multinationals investing in Ireland, but the state may get a windfall to boost local industries … in effect the money will materialize, it is a question of where. http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/apple-tax-row-government-should-tell-eu-to-fk-off-michael-oleary-35010094.html However, a former IMF deputy director has said that the Irish government should think deeply about whether an appeal is the right option. “I think they should hold the horses and reflect on this for a number of reasons,” Donal O’Donovan said on the Sean O’Rourke show on RTE “First of all, what grounds do they have for thinking that they will win the appeal? “The Commission, on this highly controversial subject, presumably thought long and hard before it came out with its ruling, and it must be fairly confident that it can withstand this and win in a European court. Otherwise, the damage to the commission would be enormous in terms of credibility and they wouldn’t want to take that risk. “It is not impossible that there could be a deal out of this, if we worked on it, that might allow us to spend some part, perhaps a good part, of the €13-19bn on infrastructure: schools, hospitals… I just wouldn’t rule that out,” he added. Earlier, Mr O’Dea was adamant that Revenue collected the full amount of tax due from Apple in accordance with Irish tax law. “If the two Apple companies concerned had been resident in Ireland of course there would be a basis for having charged the amounts mentioned or alleged by the Commission,” he said. “However, the two companies concerned were not resident companies in Ireland for tax purposes. So they were not chargeable on the worldwide profits, they were actually chargeable on their branches here in the state… He agreed that “while somebody may be owed €13bn, Ireland isn’t owed it”. “I’m not here to defend the international tax planning by multinationals, but I am here to reassure listeners that Revenue gave no deviation from the law, gave no preference to this company and collected the full tax due,” he added.

Walt Mossberg says that Jobs called him the night he said he was handing over control of Apple to Tim Cook and told him about his plans for a television set. “I think we figured out a way to do it, and it’s going to be fantastic,” Jobs said. Sadly, Steve Jobs died less than two months later and Apple has yet to make any significant moves towards releasing a TV. Rather than focusing on a TV set the company has been trying to create a TV service but has yet to land the deals it wants. It's also said to be working on developing a new TV guide. Mossberg recounts getting a call from Jobs after Apple announced his resignation. “I think he wanted to talk to me because he was feeling a little sentimental. And also because he wanted me to know that he wasn’t going away”, says Mossberg. “He was going to still be involved. Their press release made some vague nod toward that. But he wanted me to know that he was going to be involved in big strategic things, and also that he was going to reserve one particular thing for himself.” “I said, ‘well, what’s that?’” “He said, ‘Well, it’s television ... I think we figured out a way to do it, and it’s going to be fantastic. I want you to come out, in a few months, and I want to show it to you.’” Mossberg believes that Jobs was talking about a TV set, not just a set top box. “He was really weak. Hearing nuances in speech was difficult. But he was really excited,” Mossberg said. “If you would have asked me five minutes after we hung up, I would have said he was going to reinvent the whole TV set. It would be Apple-esque, meaning it was high quality, and very easy to use. But he was thinking about more than hardware — that was clear, too.” Read More Follow iClarified Comments (11) Add Comment Neil - September 1, 2016 at 4:01pm Hi James.

Here's what investors need to know about the device's possible launch. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Sep 3, 2016 at 5:35PM Another product expected to make its debut alongside Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) rumored iPhone 7 at the tech giant's product launch event on Wednesday is the Apple Watch 2. Though a Wednesday unveiling for the device is less certain than the closely followed iPhone, recent purported leaks about a new version of the Apple Watch support the possibility of a launch and provide some hints about what changes the new version may feature. Apple Watch. Image source: Apple. Leaks Little is known about Apple's next version of its Apple Watch. While Apple teased its newest operating system for the device, WatchOS 2, this summer at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, the company didn't specify any features that would be unique to its next version of the watch or even say when a new hardware would be unveiled. In addition, Apple Watch leaks are simply hard to come by, since the device ships in much smaller volumes than the iPhone. This means the company can more easily keep product leaks under wrap. Of course, Apple's sprawling global supply chain makes it nearly impossible for at least some leaks not to slip. And this is what has happened with Apple Watch 2 just about a week before the device's expected unveiling. As MacRumors reported on Sept. 1, a British Apple-certified accessory and repair reseller for iOS devices, Byte, recently posted new photos and a video of what looks to be Apple Watch 2 parts. Based on the photos, the device looks as if it will feature thinner display technology and a 35.7% larger battery than the original Apple Watch battery. Beyond these purported hardware leaks, the Apple rumor pros over at MacRumors expect Apple Watch 2 to include a GPS, a faster processor, and improved water resistance. But changes to the watch's exterior are unlikely, according to MacRumors. Why a Wednesday unveiling is likely While the ever-active Apple rumor mill doesn't seem certain that Apple Watch will make its debut on Wednesday, the best reason it could is simply that the device is due for an update. Apple CEO Tim Cook at an Apple product event. Image source: Apple. The first version of the Apple Watch was first unveiled in September 2014. Deliveries of the device, however, didn't begin until April last year. This puts Apple at well over a year since its last Apple Watch hardware update -- a long product cycle for a new Apple product. The iPhone, for instance, is consistently refreshed every year; and the company even introduced a new, lower-priced iPhone midway through its annual cycle earlier this year. The Apple Watch serves an interesting role in Apple's business. Probably accounting for about 2% to 3% of the company's revenue, the device won't do much either way for Apple's overall business. But that doesn't mean investors should forget about the segment. Investors are looking to see whether the company can grow its newest product category to meaningful levels in the same way it did with the iPad, which now represents 11.5% of the company's total revenue. If Apple Watch sales -- or at least a broader wearable segment if Apple chooses to launch more wearable technology in the future -- can grow to around 10% or more of revenue, the new category could both help Apple grow its business and diversify its hardware offerings.

In the time since Serbia last qualified for a major tournament, Ireland have been to two European Championships. The 2010 World Cup, when they failed to advance from a group featuring Ghana, Australia and Germany, was Serbia's last appearance. The qualification campaign for Euro 2016 was hindered by a debacle against eventual qualifiers Albania when a drone was flown into Belgrade's stadium, sparking a riot and ultimately leading to three deducted points. As Ireland get ready to face them on Monday, they are a different proposition, however, as they bring through players who claimed the Under-20 FIFA World Cup title in 2015. Why weakening WhatsApp encryption is a terrible idea This week, officials from the French and German governments became the latest voices to call for a weakening of the encryption technology which secure messages sent on popular services like WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage. A common refrain when governments make these calls is: “Well, I’ve nothing to hide, so why shouldn’t they?” The problem with this way of thinking is that it lacks an understanding of just how important the technologies those companies have put in place to protect their customers are, and how weakening them puts everyone at risk. Not appealing the Apple ruling is accusing Revenue of going rogue To borrow a phrase, what a load of political crap. No, I don’t mean the motivation attributed to the European Commission by Apple boss, Tim Cook, who may have got to the phrase just before me, and who may be expressing a reasonable point of view. I mean the antics of our very own Minister for Transport, Shane Ross and those other members of Government who continue to fret about the impact of hugely significant issues of national interest on their own little backyards. There is no choice here for a signed-up member of the Cabinet. Electric Picnic Spotlight: Inventing Lana Del Rey Lana Del Rey arrives in Ireland with headline status ahead of her slot closing the festivities on Electric Picnic's main stage on Sunday night. However, tracing the origins of the songstress has become one of the greater myths or mysteries of modern pop music.  Lana Del Rey's 'Video Games' lit up the blogosphere when the original version appeared online in late June 2011 - the crooning vocals launched her career, while the accompanying cover art made flower headbands essential festival clobber for years to come.  But word soon started to spread that all was not be quite as it seemed, and the emerging artists was, in fact, from a major label but was being pushed as a DIY YouTube phenomenon. Shane Stapleton: Brian Cody sees predictable Premier arsenal coming If one thorn of experience is worth a whole wilderness of warning, Tipperary should come into this game looking as though they’ve been blindsided by a cactus. Beaten, bruised and bullied, their recent history with Kilkenny suggests that Cody's men would be right to walk out of the dressing-room with chests out: “we don’t lose to Tipperary.” This season has 2011 stamped all over it: Tipp cantering through a woeful Munster, but then eking out an All-Ireland semi-final win; Waterford collapsing in a provincial final, but then putting up a stirring resistance against the unrelenting Cats.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 4 September 2016 | MYT 5:59 PM EU scrutinising around six other 1990 Irish tax opinions DUBLIN: The European Commission is scrutinising around six tax opinions multinationals received in Ireland in the early 1990s, the same period in which it said one granted to Apple amounted to illegal state aid, Ireland's Sunday Business Post said. Last week, European Union antitrust regulators ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in taxes to the Irish government after ruling that Ireland granted undue and selective tax benefit to the company. Apple denies that Dublin gave it any tax breaks, a view shared by Ireland's Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which assesses and collects taxes, and the Irish government, which on Friday agreed to join Apple in appealing the decision. The Commission is now actively scrutinising multiple tax opinions given to multinationals in Ireland and focusing on around six that could lead to Apple-style investigations, the Sunday Business Post said, without quoting any sources. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has, along with the Revenue Commissioners, said the opinions given to Apple were done in accordance with the law of the time and that any other company could and would have received the same advice. No companies received preferential treatment, they said. The Commission has two outstanding cases involving two more U.S. firms, Amazon and McDonald's, both in Luxembourg, and is expected to press on with a crack down on other similar deals, officials and experts said last week. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Government , tax breaks , Amazon and McDonald s Related Stories M'sia grants tax break for Medini, a showcase zone near S'pore You May Be Interested Petronas and 28 others certified by Iran to bid for oil and gas contracts India's banks slash lending rates after low-cost deposits, Modi nudge Doubles 'goddess' Goh is now single Another viral video of another Ipoh 'daredevil' Traffic crawl along major highways Quality homes below RM400k Others Also Read The Health Ministry is vigilant against Zika Analysts negative on Felda deal Fund Managers' pick Property Related advertisement Latest News Foreign net outflow from Malaysian equities at RM3b in 2016 Cypark remains an Add for CIMB Research Ringgit kicks off the new year on a soft note AmInvestment retains Buy on CIMB as more upside seen Breakfast briefing: Tuesday, January 3 Most Viewed in Business EPF not to be blamed for leaving FGV Ringgit kicks off the new year on a soft note Ringgit expected to remain volatile in 2017 Felda Global Ventures confident of emerging stronger in 2017 Discounted airfares to dominate airlines sector this year PNB appoints Zarinah, Awang Adek, Yaakub and Soedirman as new board members KLCI off to cautious start for 2017 as Maybank, Axiata weigh Malaysia's property market still resilient despite challenges Oil prices rise as markets eye OPEC, non-OPEC production cuts Promising 2017 outlook for construction advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Harry McCracken 09.03.16 6:00 AM Apple is holding its big product launch for 2016 on September 7. Unless the company has managed to keep something wholly unexpected under wraps—which would be great!—the key news will involve new iPhones and the second-generation version of the Apple Watch. But to me, Apple's events are usually at least as interesting for what they tell us about the company's overall ambitions and strategies as they are for the straightforward details on the features, prices, and availability dates of new products. Along with my colleague Mark Sullivan, I'll be at the event to cover it live for FastCoNews. As I get ready to head to the Bill Graham Auditorium next week, these are some of the questions I'm contemplating: 1. Can Apple Make The Lack Of A Headphone Jack A Selling Point? Over the past few months, I feel like I've spent about 40% of my waking hours reading hot takes about the new iPhones reportedly ditching their headphone jacks in favor of earphones that connect wirelessly or via the Lightning port. And you know what? I don't think I've seen a single piece that fiercely argued that it would be a great move. The prospect has inspired many a rant, and even Six Colors' Jason Snell, who calmly tried to figure out why Apple would do it, ended his post by saying he hoped it wouldn't. Even if you assume the no-headphone rumor is true—as all evidence seems to suggest it is—it's impossible to form a definitive opinion about its upshot until we know what Apple is giving us instead—whether it involves wired Lightning earphones or wireless "AirPods," and what comes inside the box when you buy a new iPhone. With wireless earphones in particular, factors like audio quality, battery life, and general usability could make all the difference. But the transition away from the conventional headphone jack is also a test of Apple's powers of persuasion. There's a time-honored tradition of the company doing away with stuff and generating fury that quickly dissipates. (When the company retired the old-style iPhone connector in 2012, Farhad Manjoo, then of Slate, went from calling it "bogus" to dismissing it as "a small problem" that shouldn't discourage anyone from buying an iPhone 5 in less than a month.) Will this techno-kabuki play out in the same way again this time? Maybe. But it's more likely to be swift and painless if Apple makes a coherent case onstage for what it's doing. For now, we can entertain ourselves with highly suspect images of alleged AirPods: 2. Are The Little iPhone And The Big iPhone diverging? When Apple introduced the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, they were very nearly the same phone in two screen sizes. (Other than its big-boy display, the 6 Plus's only advantages over the 6 were its camera's optical stabilization—nice, but not that huge a deal—and longer battery life.) The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have stuck to exactly the same formula. I don't expect the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, or whatever they're called, to be radically different devices. But if the 7 Plus has a dual-lens camera and its smaller sibling doesn't, it might reposition both phones in a subtle fashion. The 7 Plus could end up looking like the best iPhone, not just the one with the larger display. We'll learn at the event whether Apple intends to promote it as such. If it does, it could leave the smaller phone—currently the most iconic flavor of iPhone—standing in the big one's shadow. 3. Just How Good Can iPhone Photography Get? If the new big-screen iPhone has a dual-lens camera, it won't be the first of its kind. (For instance, I recently reviewed the two-lens Honor 8, and found that it had a really good camera for a $400 phone.) But maybe what Apple has done with the concept goes beyond earlier attempts. Last year, it acquired an Israeli company that created technology that uses multiple lenses to produce images that supposedly rival those shot by a big, bulky SLR camera. An iPhone that fulfilled that promise would offer something that even the best current smartphones do not. Camera modules from LinX, a company acquired by Apple 4. What’s The Trajectory Of Apple Watch Hardware Upgrades? After almost a decade's worth of iPhones, Apple's philosophy when it comes to smartphone evolution is clear: It likes to make 'em thinner, faster, and better at taking photographs, and to do a sweeping industrial-design makeover every other year. With the Apple Watch, however, we've only got the first-generation version to go by. The most obviously dramatic change Apple could make in an updated watch would be a built-in LTE connection—an addition that would free the wearable gadget from having to rely on an iPhone for internet connectivity, but also appears to be a generation or two away. GPS and a barometer are more plausible 2016 upgrades. But I'm also curious to see if Apple will feel obligated to make the new watch look meaningfully different than last year's incarnation. 5. Are There Any New Killer Apple Watch Apps? Even if the new Apple Watch is a lot like the old one from a design and specs standard, it will benefit from Apple's new watchOS 3—a really significant update that will allow for more powerful, easy-to-use apps. What really matters, though, is what developers will do with the new platform. Apple often invites third-party companies onstage at its events to show off new apps that show off its hardware to its best advantage. I'm hoping that might happen this time, and that we'll see software that answers the question "Why would anyone want an Apple Watch?" in a way that makes intuitive sense to more people. iOS 10 on the iPad and iPhone, and watchOS 3 on the Apple Watch 6. Where Is The iPad Headed? Chances are that this event will be relatively quiet when it comes to news involving Apple’s tablets. The current wisdom is that the company won’t be announcing any new iPads this year, and iOS 10, though dense with new features, skews toward stuff that seems designed more with the iPhone in mind than the iPad. (For 2017, Apple is reportedly working on more iPad-centric updates to iOS, including building more support for the Pencil stylus into the operating system so that any app can take advantage of it.) Apple is likely to have so much news to discuss at its event that it won't devote meaningful time to the iPad unless it has something important to say. But as an iPad Pro fanatic, I hope it has a tidbit or two to tide us over until 2017. 7. What’s The Short-Term Apple TV Strategy? At first, Apple was supposedly going to launch a subscription TV service by the end of 2015. Then the offering reportedly got delayed until 2016. Or maybe it's just on hold, period. The most logical scenario involves such a service happening, but not just yet. That leaves a great big hole in the promise of the Apple TV. I'm curious what Apple will do to keep the box interesting and evolving in the interim. (Me, I still think it could make for a powerful beachhead for the company's smart-home efforts, such as HomeKit.) 8. Did Apple Forget To Mention Anything At WWDC? Back in June at its developer conference, Apple previewed upgrades to iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS—four new operating systems with a vast number of new features between them. In theory, we already pretty much know what they offer. But Apple has been known to hold back some news—especially involving features tied into new hardware, such as the "Live Photos" that debuted with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. With any luck, there will be a surprise or two along those lines on the 7th. I could go on. (Maybe I will, on Twitter.) I'll be happy if I come out of the auditorium feeling smarter about any of these subjects—and happier still if it turns out we knew less about what Apple had in store for the event than we thought we did.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile iPhone 7 to Get Huge Internal Upgrades – High CPU Clock Speed, Superior Water Resistance and More By Omar Sohail Posted Sep 3, 2016 187Shares Share Tweet Submit The latest report coming in delivers news to lift the heart, if you’re really interested in knowing about the hardware specifications of Apple’s iPhone 7 that is. Let us tell you from before that you’re in for a treat. iPhone 7 Processor to be Clocked at 2.40GHz, Along With IPX7 Certification and Loads of Improvements From the Camera Thanks to TSMC’s 16nm FinFET node, Apple’s A10 SoC is going to running a processor at a high clock speed. Taking a look at the comparison, the A9 was running a dual-core 1.84GHz, so we should obviously be expecting a dual-core CPU this time around, but with a dramatic increase in the processor’s frequency. Thought the 16nm FinFET node is definitely responsible for this increase in clock speed, the improved CPU design is also a contributing factor to this. Not only this, but remember the time we said that the iPhone 7 was going to feature better water-resistance than its predecessor. Well, we were right all along with because the latest report states that the IPX7 rating is the same as the one given to the Apple Watch. To bring you up to speed, this rating means that the hardware will be able to withstand immersion in water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. We’ve already seen in previously torture tests that the impressive rubbing tubing surrounding iPhone 6s was able to prevent the body of water from seeping inside the chassis and wreaking havoc, and this time, it’s going to be even more robust than before. Another improvement that we’ll be seeing is from the camera department. Apart from sporting an OIS chip (something that was missing from iPhone 6s), the better performing sensor with a wider aperture will be able to let in more light, and separate the focused object from the background, resulting in a shallow depth of field. While all of these specifications sound very impressive, the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack is not something I am looking forward to. Advertisement Steve Wozniak also shares my concerns, but at least the company is going to be bundling accessories that will allow us to plug in our 3.5mm earphones and headphones inside the upcoming smartphone. What did you think of these upgrades? Tell us your thoughts right this second.

FIle photo: ARD Published on Sunday, 4 September, 2016 at 10:45 (AFP) European authorities' decision to slap Apple with a huge bill for back taxes was not a decision "against the United States", European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said Sunday as world leaders gathered in China for a major economic summit. The 13-billion-euro demand for payment from the American electronics giant has raised hackles in the US, with the White House decrying what it described as a "unilateral" approach to rewriting global taxation norms. Speaking to reporters before the Group of 20 leadership summit in Hangzhou, Juncker said the decision was not aimed at the US. "It would be absurd to choose this territory of state taxation to attack the USA," he said, adding that most of the commission's punitive measures were against European companies. "We are basing our decisions on facts and on the legislation. "We are applying the rules," he said. "We are basing our decisions on facts and on the legislation." Brussels said Apple, the world's most valuable company, avoided virtually all tax on its business in the bloc by illegal arrangements with EU member Ireland, which gave the company an unfair advantage over competitors. Apple and the Irish government have said they will appeal against the European Commission ruling, with the iPhone maker warning it could cost European jobs. Ireland has attracted multinationals over many years by offering favourable tax deals to generate much-needed jobs and investment. But after a three-year investigation, Brussels said the arrangement with Apple broke EU laws on state aid. Growing investigations The findings come amid growing tensions between Washington and Brussels over a series of EU anti-trust investigations targeting other giant US companies such as Google, Amazon, McDonald's, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. Tax avoidance has moved sharply up the political agenda since EU governments adopted tough austerity policies to balance public finances, fuelling public resentment that the rich paid relatively little tax. Speaking before the summit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama would seek to address tax avoidance with world leaders in Hangzhou. "We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair -- more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States," he said. But, he added, "we need to make sure that there aren't entities or countries acting unilaterally in ways that exacerbate inequities in the global tax structure".

Last week’s ruling that the American tech giant must settle the massive tax bill with Ireland has gone down badly in Washington, with the US Treasury warning that the move risked damaging “the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU”. However, speaking on Sunday at the start of the G20 summit, in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, Juncker rejected the idea that European authorities were unjustly singling out US companies and said the ruling was “clearly based on facts”. Commission investigations on taxation had mainly focused on European targets, he said, according to Reuters. “This is not a decision against the United States of America,” Juncker told reporters. “It would be absurd to choose this territory of state taxation to attack the USA,” he added, according to AFP. “We are applying the rules … We are basing our decisions on facts and on the legislation.” Europe, Apple, and the money burning a hole in Silicon Valley’s wallet Read more Both Apple and Ireland have said they will appeal against the EU ruling, which the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, labelled “total political crap”. “They just picked a number from I don’t know where,” Cook said after Tuesday’s announcement. “In the year that the commission says we paid that tax figure, we actually paid $400m. We believe that makes us the highest taxpayer in Ireland that year.” Relations between Washington and Brussels have been tested by a series of anti-trust inquiries focusing on US technology firms such as Apple and Google that some have branded anti-American. Speaking before President Barack Obama’s arrival in Hangzhou on Saturday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said: “We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair … [But] we also need to find a system that is fairer to companies who are looking to do business around the world. “And the US government is not going to hesitate to speak out in support of US companies that are looking to do business around the world. That’s good for the US economy, that’s good for US workers, but also benefits the international economy.” The US wanted to ensure “that there aren’t entities or countries acting unilaterally in ways that exacerbate inequities in the global tax structure”, Earnest added.

Modern Readers Breaking World, Tech, Sports, Business News Business Life Sports Technology World Viral January 3, 2017 Emergency update for security exploits comes to OS X September 4, 2016 By Mark Kesler The flaw that got iOS users in a tizzy last week also exists in the OS X world, but Apple, thankfully, has got it under control with a new emergency update. And if you own a Mac, this is one update you should be downloading ASAP. Following the launch of said security update for the iPhone last week, Apple has rolled out that very same patch, fixing the same exploits that were originally spotted and squashed on the iPhone toward the end of August. The update was released on Thursday, and is now available for all owners of Macs with newer versions of the OS X platform. The exploits, had they not have been fixed, had the potential of being “weaponized” against the Mac’s operating system OS X, according to the security experts who had identified the breaches. But with the update having rolled out, it has taken care of vulnerabilities on OS X El Capitan and Yosemite, which were Apple’s 2015 and 2014 versions of OS X respectively. Older versions of the platform, meaning Mavericks and earlier, didn’t get the fix. As Apple is close to releasing its newest OS X iteration, support for devices running editions from at least three years ago is nearing its end, thus justifying the reason why the update is only available for newer versions of OS X. Quotes from researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto and mobile security provider Lookout suggest that the three exploits were designed to transform a United Arab Emirates activist’s iPhone into a surveillance device. The former institution had traced the hack to the NSO Group, an Israeli crew that supposedly peddles spyware and exploits to governments. Two out of the three vulnerabilities squashed by the emergency update affect the kernel, while the third works on Apple’s Safari browser. “The Trident vulnerabilities used by NSO could have been weaponized against users of non iOS devices, including OS X,” said Citizen Labs in a statement. “We encourage all Apple users to install the update as soon as possible.” This comes on top of a succinct summary of the update Apple published on its support site earlier this week.

Source: AAP 4 Sep 2016 - 6:00 PM  UPDATED 4 Sep 2016 - 6:00 PM Tweet EU ruling that Apple must pay a huge tax bill to Ireland is clearly based on facts and existing rules and isn't a decision aimed against the United States, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says. Last week, European Union antitrust regulators ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($A19.1 billion) in taxes to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid. Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook last week described the ruling as "total political crap", but France and Germany have come out to back Brussels on the decision. Juncker said EU Commission investigations on taxation had mainly targeted European companies. The decision comes amid a co-ordinated global initiative to crack down on tax evasion by multinational companies, spearheaded by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The ruling against Apple has pushed the issue into the limelight and raised the risk of significant push-back from the US, analysts say, where some MPs are saying the result represents a European encroachment on the US potential tax base. In separate comments to Reuters on the sidelines of the G20, Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, called Apple's tax planning "outrageous" but, like Juncker, said the decision was based on enforcing current regulations. Saint-Amans said he believed it would be unlikely to serve as a precedent for enforcement on future income earned by multinationals. Juncker's remarks appeared designed to reassure US politicians who have bickered for years over the treatment of off-shore income but now fear that the European Commission move would mean more profits earned by US corporations flowing into European tax coffers. "This is not a decision against the United States of America," said Juncker.

Smartphone manufacturers are looking to upgrade screens to the vivid, higher resolution and more responsive AMOLED technology used in Samsung S7 or LTPS screens used in the iPhone 6S, and Chinese display manufacturers are well-placed to ride the wave of change, Oriental Patron’s equity analyst Chloe Liu said in a report. Apple is among the companies taking part in the trend, with its iPhone 8, due to be released in 2017, expected to be the company’s first phone to use an AMOLED display screen, according to Liu. The news is part of a rosy picture for China’s smartphone sector, with top vendors like Huawei “rapidly” gaining global market share, while international competitors Samsung and Apple lose ground, Liu said. South Korea and Japan currently supply the bulk of panels for Chinese smartphones, but as those companies race to upgrade their LTPS production lines to AMOLED to catch up with Apple’s demand, there is likely to be a shortage of both types of screen this year and next, she said. The gap provides an opportunity for display panel suppliers such as BOE, Tianma, Truly and China Star Optoelectronic Technology to move in on their competition, Liu said. China’s number one smartphone vendor, Huawei, is expected to use LTPS in 62 per cent of its phones and AMOLED in 13 per cent of its phones by the end of the year, up from 46 per cent and 1 per cent respectively last year, she said. Overall, Liu expects AMOLED screens will be used in 30 per cent of smartphones in the China market in 2020, up from 9 per cent in 2015, while LTPS use is expected to grow from 28 per cent to 40 per cent in the same period. UOB KayHian, Oriental Patron and Morgan Stanley all tipped smartphone display manufacturer TCL Display to be one of the big winners from the technology upgrade. China’s third biggest module manufacturer will be helped by the growing global market share of China’s smartphone sector, which accounted for 44.1 per cent of total global shipments in the second quarter of this year, UOB KayHian’s analyst Jason Tsang said in a report. “This is positive to TCLD as it focuses on providing its modules to Chinese smartphone manufacturers,” Tsang said. TCLD’s sister company China Star Optoelectronic Technology, which plans to start mass production of LTPS in 2017, will help TCLD to “increase its bargaining power and obtain orders from top China smartphone vendors”, Liu said. Display panel producer Truly is also likely to gain from the technology upgrade, with mass production of LTPS scheduled to begin this year, and AMOLED production kicking off in the second half of next year, Liu said. Overall, Liu is expecting Chinese smartphone vendors to gain global market share from this year onwards “due to their increasing reputation and attractive price to performance ratio”. Smartphone shipments from China to emerging markets are expected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 16.6 per cent from 2014 to 2019, Tsang said. China, the biggest smartphone market in the world, accounts for 32 per cent of world sales, according to Morgan Stanley. Leading vendor Huawei increased its market share in China to 9.4 per cent in the second quarter of this year, up from its 7.4 per cent last year, while second-biggest vendor Apple slipped to 11.8 per cent from 16.2 per cent in the same period, according to Oriental Patron.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Apple > iWorld > iPhone FLASH SALE: SpyShelter Firewall      30% OFF! iPhone 7 Storage Versions Confirmed by Foxconn Worker in New Leak GO Apple will offer the iPhone 7 in 3 storage configurations Sep 4, 2016 07:51 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to take the wraps off the new iPhone 7 on Wednesday, and we already know pretty much everything about the new model, although last-minute leaks seem to point to some unexpected tweaks that could see daylight as well. And new information that has emerged today comes to confirm the storage options for the new iPhone lineup that we’ve told you about, as Apple is making changes that would make a little bit more sense since no microSD card support is offered. The 16 GB version of the iPhone will be discontinued, so the entry-level model will come with 32 GB of storage, which is quite an important change, given the fact that iOS and the pre-installed apps already eat up at least several gigabytes on each device - and iOS 10 is very likely to take even more space. Previously, the 16 GB iPhone had some 11 GB available because of the pre-installed software. Three storage options for the iPhone 7 According to today’s leak, which reportedly comes straight from a Foxconn worker (Foxconn is one of the main Apple partners for the production of iPhone models), the iPhone 7 will come in three different storage versions, namely with 32 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB. The 64 GB version is thus being pulled too. As a result, the top-of-the-range iPhone 7 will come with 256 GB of storage, and there are rumors that this particular configuration will also be offered in an exclusive color. Apple is planning two new dark versions of the iPhone, including a glossy Piano Black, which could only be available with the Plus model featuring 256 GB of storage space. Without a doubt, this storage upgrade comes in handy to iPhone buyers since no microSD card support is being offered, but also because Apple is also upgrading cameras, and photos will eat up more space on devices. More information on these new storage versions and color options will be provided by Apple itself on Wednesday, during the official iPhone 7 unveiling. #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone leak#Apple leak#iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Last-Minute iPhone 7 Leak Reveals Waterproofing, Exciting Hardware Upgrades Apple Starts the App War, Will Remove Outdated Titles from the Store Fake iPhone 7 Videos Flooding the Internet Ahead of Public Launch Forget the Apple Watch, Here Comes the iWatch New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Alleged iPhone 7 storage versions new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments First iPhone 7 Jailbreak (iOS 10.1.1) Now Available for Download more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Launches New 2TB iCloud Storage Plan For $19.99 By Uzair Ghani Posted Aug 31, 2016 8Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has launched a brand new 2TB iCloud Storage plan for $19.99 a month. The new plan is available to utilize immediately. Apple Launches 2TB iCloud Storage Plan Ahead Of iPhone 7 Launch Apple silently launched a brand new iCloud Storage plan, giving users a whopping 2TB of cloud storage space for just $19.99 a month. Interestingly, this move comes ahead of Apple’s September 7th event where the company is expected to reveal its brand new mobile hardware lineup. The new plan makes a lot of sense as well as the iPhone 7 is all set to get a camera spec bump that obviously equates to bigger photos. Apart from that, macOS Sierra users will find the new storage tier appealing as the new desktop operating system comes packed with a new feature called iCloud Desktop. This feature is bound to gobble up iCloud Storage space as we naturally tend to drop new files straight onto our desktop rather than somewhere else. Top things up with macOS Sierra backing up pretty much everything in the cloud to save offline space, you’ll probably end up asking for more space. If you’re tied well into the Apple ecosystem and wish to buy the new storage plan right away then make sure to follow our guide posted here: How To Buy iCloud Storage Space On iOS, Mac, Windows. Advertisement Uninterestingly, however, apart from the addition of a new 2TB plan, the base free storage still sits at 5GB. Quite frankly, that is more than inadequate. But we sincerely hope Apple makes the big move to bump that base storage up to something more respectable. Anything above 20GB would suffice rather easily. Wrap Up As we move into the future, it’s somewhat clear that we will get even more reliant on cloud storage than ever before. And while some users may go against the idea of having their documents sit in the cloud for safekeeping due to security reasons, but one can’t deny the convenience that comes with the perk once you have proper security measures in place. iCloud Drive offers a ton of great perks to users as it ties in perfectly with the entire Apple ecosystem. And if you’re planning to use macOS Sierra and iOS 10 more vigorously than OS X El Capitan and iOS 9, then you might want to start your preparations early by giving your cloud storage option an upgrade first. You’re going to need it quite badly.

Customers line up in Chicago to buy the latest iPhone. It’s “iPhoneapalooza” time again. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 115.82 -0.91 -0.78% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 69.12 -0.14 -0.20% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 749.87 -15.28 -2.00% Apple is expected to unveil details of the new iPhone 7 at an event on Wednesday. Once again, resale sites have reported a surge in trade-ins of old iPhones ahead of the announcement. Though prices offered for trade-ins will start dropping closer to the big day, consumers can still lock in high enough prices to break even — or earn a profit — by trading in their old gadget and upgrading to a new phone. The iPhone 7 16-gigabyte version will likely cost around $22 a month on a two-year contract, depending on the carrier, $199 with a two-year wireless contract for the same version or $299 for a 64-gigabyte version, in-line with previous iPhone launches, experts say. With most offers, it’s possible to sell an old iPhone to a resale site or online retailer for more than the cost of the new phone, although you will need to sign a two-year contract. And note that those who bought an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus last year and still have time left on their current contract would likely have to pay an early termination fee. The resale market became more lucrative for consumers with the added competition last year after Apple (AAPL)  and Wal-Mart (WMT) entered. Resale site Glyde offers $409 for a 16-gigabye iPhone 6S (or $326 for a 6) and $447 for a larger 6S Plus (or $355 for a 6 Plus). Another such site NextWorth offers up to $350 for the 16-gigabye 6S in pristine condition (or $245 for a Plus), and up to $364 for the 6S Plus with the same memory (or $285 for a 6 Plus). And rival Gazelle offers up to $300 for the 16-gigabye iPhone 6S and up to $200 for the iPhone 6 (and a maximum of $325 for the 6S Plus).

The rocket exploded prior to launch while it was being fueled. Now that the investigation into the disaster has concluded, SpaceX is set to resume flying rockets and their cargo into orbit. The next scheduled flight is set for the second week of January, when a Falcon 9 carrying 10 satellites will take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Since taking over, how has Apple performed? Photo: Getty Images. For gift cards only, Amazon (AMZN)  will give you around $331 for a 16-gigabye iPhone 6S or $400 for a 6S Plus, while Apple will give you up to $225 for an iPhone 6 and $250 for an iPhone 6 Plus (Apple doesn’t currently offer trade-ins for the 6S models online). At Walmart stores, the value for an iPhone 6S 16-gigabye is roughly $275 to $300, depending on the carrier; for the 6S Plus, a 16-gigabye has a trade-in value of $325 to $350. “We expect around a 15% decline in pricing for old iPhone models around the expected September launch,” says Glyde spokesman Matthew Reardon. “If people have a replacement phone they can use between now and the launch, it’s a great time to sell.” But for consumers who have second thoughts about upgrading, some resale sites allow you to hang on to your phone after agreeing to a trade-in deal. NextWorth gives customers a 30-day grace period between signing a contract and handing over their phone; resale site Gazelle offers a 45-day grace period. (Glyde has no grace period as it’s a peer-to-peer seller.) See also: This isn’t a normal iPhone upgrade — and Apple will be just fine Analysts predict that the new iPhone 7 will still come in two screen sizes — 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches in width to compete with the larger Androids — and possibly come without a headphone jack, have a significantly improved camera and may even be waterproof (for those who have dropped their previous phones in the pool or the toilet bowl) and may even ditch the 16 gigabyte version, as apps and photos eat up memory on the device. (Apple did not respond to request for comment.) As Apple’s new-device releases become more frequent, the company must work harder to convince people to upgrade each year, says Brian Colello, technology analyst at research firm Morningstar. While the smartphone market is getting saturated in the U.S., the iPhone 7 will likely have a big impact, analysts say. A lot of shoppers have been waiting for Apple to deliver a bigger screen and that alone will spur an impressive upgrade cycle. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook is hoping that the upgrades and fanfare surrounding the iPhone 7 upgrade will put pressure on Samsung. Thus far, resale sites have been reporting a surge of trade-ins for all of the most recent models. Resale site Decluttr.com says there has been 73% increase in sales in the past month alone, and is predicting an influx of iPhone 6 and 6s models following Apple’s press conference on Wednesday.

The 13-billion-euro demand for payment from the American electronics giant has raised hackles in the US, with the White House decrying what it described as a "unilateral" approach to rewriting global taxation norms. Speaking to reporters before the Group of 20 leadership summit in Hangzhou, Juncker said the decision was not aimed at the US. The White House has described the EC decision to slap Apple with a huge demand for back taxes as a "unilateral" approach to rewriting global taxation norms ©Daniel Leal-Olivas (AFP/File) "It would be absurd to choose this territory of state taxation to attack the USA," he said, adding that most of the commission's punitive measures were against European companies. "We are applying the rules," he said. "We are basing our decisions on facts and on the legislation." Brussels said Apple, the world's most valuable company, avoided virtually all tax on its business in the bloc by illegal arrangements with EU member Ireland, which gave the company an unfair advantage over competitors. Apple and the Irish government have said they will appeal against the European Commission ruling, with the iPhone maker warning it could cost European jobs. Ireland has attracted multinationals over many years by offering favourable tax deals to generate much-needed jobs and investment. But after a three-year investigation, Brussels said the arrangement with Apple broke EU laws on state aid. The findings come amid growing tensions between Washington and Brussels over a series of EU anti-trust investigations targeting other giant US companies such as Google, Amazon, McDonald's, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. Tax avoidance has moved sharply up the political agenda since EU governments adopted tough austerity policies to balance public finances, fuelling public resentment that the rich paid relatively little tax. Speaking before the summit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama would seek to address tax avoidance with world leaders in Hangzhou. "We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair -- more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States," he said. But, he added, "we need to make sure that there aren’t entities or countries acting unilaterally in ways that exacerbate inequities in the global tax structure".

EU antitrust regulators last week ordered the tech giant to pay the staggering sum to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through the country was illegal state aid. Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook dismissed the ruling as 'total political crap' and vowed to fight the landmark ruling - the biggest tax bill imposed on a firm outside the US. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said the decision to make Apple pay £11billion in unpaid taxes was not an attack on the US Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook last week dismissed the ruling as 'total political crap' and vowed to fight the landmark ruling - the biggest tax bill imposed on a firm outside the US He said: 'When you are accused of something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you. That's how we feel. 'Apple has always been about doing the right thing, never the easy thing.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next SIMON WATKINS: Let's take a lesson from Ireland and... Apple crunch: The US and EU in court showdown over ruling to... Share this article Share France and Germany have spoken out in support of the decision. Today Mr Juncker said the ruling was clearly based on facts and was 'not a decision against the United States of America', pointing to the fact that EU Commission investigations on taxation had mainly targeted European companies.   The European Commission claimed the Irish government gave Apple a 'sweetheart deal' to funnel its profits through the country without having to pay the appropriate level of tax  The decision comes amidst a coordinated global initiative to crack down on tax evasion by multinational companies, spearheaded by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Mr Juncker's comments appeared designed to reassure US lawmakers who fear the move by the European Commission would mean more US profits flowing into EU tax coffers.  The Apple tax bill dwarfs the previous EU record for a state aid case - €1.3 billion for the Nurburgring race track in Germany. In October Brussels ordered US coffee giant Starbucks and Italian automaker Fiat to each repay up to €30 million in back taxes to the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 33 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!

If anything, the European Commission’s finding that Apple owes more than $14 billion in taxes should push the US to fix its own tax policies, under which its biggest companies stash most of their cash overseas to avoid domestic taxes. As highlighted by the presidential election, globalization and its negative effects on the US are a concern across party lines. Lack of funds for infrastructure and the deficit are also pressing issues. Those problems are exacerbated when America’s largest and most profitable companies reduce their contributions and use accounting schemes that shift money to little countries offering special tax breaks. You can’t begrudge companies for pursuing options made available to them by policymakers. But the disproportionate benefits they’ve received and the influence they wield over those policymakers feed the growing cynicism about international trade. Fixing this tax problem is necessary to begin restoring faith in the benefits of globalization. The US fretted that the European Commission crackdowns on Apple and others are a departure from standard practice and will “undermine the multilateral progress made towards reducing tax avoidance.” Given the glacial pace of that progress, and the unacceptable status quo, one might be glad the Europeans are shaking things up and being more assertive. That should push the next US president and US Congress to expedite tax reform in 2017. This is urgent. Apple‘s case signals that other governments are closing loopholes and collecting taxes that have been evaded for years. At stake are taxes on an accumulated $2 trillion that Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, big pharmaceutical companies and others earned and stashed in foreign countries. If the US continues dawdling on reforms as foreign countries tighten their rules, the US will lose out. Companies get credit on their US tax bill for taxes paid abroad, so it becomes a question of which country will collect, and how much. In other words: Taxes collected overseas are taxes the US won’t get from its top-tier companies. Since companies like Apple and Microsoft owe much of their success to the schools and infrastructure in the US, where they are headquartered and do most of their product development, they should pay more US taxes. This is not about gouging companies. It‘s about collecting what they owe -- their fair share to support countries in which they operate. Reforms should level the playing field and eliminate elaborate breaks that pencil out for only the richest and most sophisticated companies. Taxes on foreign earnings shouldn’t be permanently deferrable. In Ireland, Apple was not only deferring US taxes on foreign earnings, it allegedly was avoiding the 12.5 percent tax due in Ireland. Apple disputes the findings and is appealing, but the European Commission said the company attributed sales to an office that existed only on paper and paid almost no taxes. This enabled its effective tax rate on an Irish subsidiary to decline from 1 percent in 2003 to 0.005 percent in 2014, according to regulators. As elected officials pursue reforms in the US, they should also resist pressure to give Apple and others a sweetheart deal to repatriate foreign earnings and finally pay US taxes on them. These companies have been getting sweet deals for years. Fixing this problem would benefit everyone. Shareholders and global companies would get more certainty, taxpayers would see more fairness and the US would have better standing, more revenue and a stronger defense of globalization‘s positive effects.

The Group of 20 meeting of leaders of the United States, China, Germany and other major economies “must urgently find a solution” to excess steel production, said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. He called on Beijing to accept a monitoring mechanism for overproduction that Beijing’s trading partners blame for low prices and job losses. Juncker also rejected U.S. criticism of the order for Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple. An EU panel ruled the company’s low taxes were improper government aid. “Free trade must be fair trade,” Juncker said at a news conference with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council. The toughly worded comments reflected the political pressures on governments at a time of weak global economic growth that is fueling demands to protect local industries. Another prominent issue at the summit is G-20 member Britain’s June vote to leave the 28-nation European Union, a move seen by some analysts as the first in a wave of moves by other nations to retreat from free trade. China, the G-20 host, has made trade a headline issue for the meeting in Hangzhou, a scenic lakeside city southwest of Shanghai. Chinese officials have said they will propose a plan to boost commerce through closer cooperation on regulation, finance, tax and other issues. China hopes its status as G-20 host will bring it more influence in management of the global economy. Chinese leaders say they want the G-20, launched to coordinate the response to the 2008 financial crisis, to take on a longer-term role overseeing global economic management. Germany, South Korea and other governments say they also want to use the meeting to discuss climate, energy and possible reforms to the global tax system to reduce tax evasion. The two-day meeting began Sunday on a diplomatic high note following a joint announcement by President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that their governments had submitted documents committing them to carrying out the Paris climate agreement. But U.S. and other officials say they plan to bring up Chinese industrial overcapacity and other potentially thorny issues. Washington has imposed import duties of up to 500 percent on Chinese steel to offset what regulators say are improper subsidies. China, the world’s biggest steel producer, has committed to reducing its production capacity by 100 to 150 million tons by 2020, a pledge Xi repeated Saturday. “This is a global problem, but with a specific Chinese dimension we have to address,” said Juncker. “We are really insisting on the need to take this seriously.” Juncker defended the EU’s tax order on Apple against U.S. criticism. An EU panel concluded Apple received improper aid because it paid lower rates than other companies. Ireland has made its low taxes part of its strategy to attract investment. Juncker rejected suggestions the EU was targeting an American company. He said previous tax orders have affected European companies, including a January ruling that covered 35 companies, most of them from Europe. “This is not a decision against the United States of America,” said Juncker. “We are basing our decisions on facts.” Tusk affirmed the EU’s stance on Britain’s possible departure, saying there would be no talks with London over future relations until it formally begins the withdrawal process. Uncertainty over the status of trade, immigration and other critical issues has disrupted business activity and prompted anxiety among investors. “We need to protect the interests of the members of the EU that want to stay together, not the one which wants to leave,” said Tusk. Speaking at a joint news conference with Obama, British Prime Minister Theresa May said her government was going ahead with its departure and was looking to create new trading opportunities. “There will be no second referendum, no attempt to turn the clock back or get out of this,” said May. The two leaders tried to downplay the impact on U.S.-British relations but Obama suggested London might have to wait to make a post-EU trade deal. He said Washington is focused on finishing trade deals with Asia-Pacific governments and the EU.

REUTERS/Francois LenoirMore HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - An EU ruling that Apple Inc must pay a huge tax bill to Ireland was clearly based on facts and existing rules and was not a decision aimed against the United States, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Sunday. Last week, European Union antitrust regulators ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in taxes to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid. Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook last week described the ruling as "total political crap", but France and Germany have come out to back Brussels on the decision. Juncker said EU Commission investigations on taxation had mainly targeted European companies. The decision comes amidst a coordinated global initiative to crack down on tax evasion by multinational companies, spearheaded by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The ruling against Apple has pushed the issue into the limelight and raised the risk of significant push-back from the United States, analysts say, where some lawmakers are saying the result represents a European encroachment on the U.S. potential tax base. In separate comments to Reuters on the sidelines of the G20 on Saturday, Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the OECD Center for Tax Policy and Administration, called Apple's tax planning "outrageous" but, like Juncker, said the decision was based on enforcing current regulations. Saint-Amans said he believed it would be unlikely to serve as a precedent for enforcement on future income earned by multinationals. Juncker's remarks appeared designed to reassure U.S. lawmakers, who have bickered for years over the treatment of off-shore income but now fear that the European Commission move would mean more profits earned by U.S. corporations flowing into European tax coffers. "This is not a decision against the United States of America," said Juncker.

Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year — enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Hopes to serve as model Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Jackson said. Although much of Apple’s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States — and not only for the sprawling new corporate campus it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, and its 270 retail stores around the country. One of Apple’s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Apple’s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it was paying for California Flats’ energy, but Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it was less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expected the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” Doubling capacity In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Walmart. Electric utilities have begun to respond by creating products and services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute’s director of utility innovation. One such product is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply. Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats. ATM analogy Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Jackson of Apple likened to using an ATM. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-­carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores. Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers’ alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company’s director of sustainability. But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant’s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G’s partners. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,’ ” Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable — and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” More Business articles »     RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Business stories Business PakTech to complete $5.6 million remodel of Cottage Grove factory by March Business ‘Gig economy’ keeps growing Business Tech-addict parents to kids: Don’t do as I do Business Collectibles company cultivates community Business Blinking credit cards may increase security Business Business datebook     Opinion Editorial Piercy’s vindication Eugene’s mayor is the only official elected citywide, but the office has little actual power.

For decades, businesses like Apple that generate significant revenue abroad flocked to Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, where they counted on amenable fiscal regimes to reduce their taxes, even if they had minimal operations on the ground. Last week European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager sent the strongest signal yet that she won’t abide these strategies when she demanded Apple pay an estimated $14.5 billion in back taxes. “Every global company that is exposed to EU taxes in individual nations now has to look back and ask whether any of their agreements are subject to similar attacks,” said Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business. “This is the first signal of a long play that’s going to take place over many, many months.” Every time an iPhone or iPad is purchased in London, Paris or Milan, Apple books the profit at a subsidiary in the Irish city of Cork. The process is part of a decades-long arrangement with the Irish government that’s allowed the company to pay lower taxes on these European sales. The European Commission ruled that Ireland gave Apple illegally favorable tax treatment, letting it pay an effective tax rate on European profits of 1 percent in 2003 and down to 0.005 percent in 2014. Later in the week Apple CEO Tim Cook called the figures “total political crap,” and the company and Ireland vowed to appeal. Apple’s Irish tax arrangement was considered “the most brazen” among multinational U.S. technology companies, said Aisling Donohue, a partner at tax and business advisory firm MGPartners in Ireland. While other companies should be concerned, they aren’t likely to face as much scrutiny, she said. Still, Vestager’s move is part of a broader push to close loopholes that European regulators think give foreign companies an advantage. Google parent Alphabet Inc. has also been a beneficiary of Ireland’s tax regime, using the “Double Irish” mechanism to save billions in tax on its international earnings. Ireland is phasing this out, although companies have until 2021 to adjust. Amazon.com used a similar process to effectively send profit through Luxembourg. In Europe, the e-commerce giant told authorities that the intellectual property behind its web shopping platform was immensely valuable, justifying the billions in tax-free revenue it collected there since moving its technology assets to Luxembourg a decade ago. In the U.S. it played down the value of those same assets to explain why it paid so little in taxes for licensing them. That prompted investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, and Amazon changed its policy in 2015, largely eliminating the practice. “You can’t bank on achieving the savings in post-tax profits that you might have once expected,” said Jolyon Maugham, a British trial lawyer specializing in tax cases at Devereux Chambers. “That makes the pursuit of such strategies rather more difficult to justify.” About six months ago Netflix told an investor that the company will likely pay higher international tax rates than other large U.S. technology companies currently pay. Netflix, which recently began expanding aggressively abroad, said it views other U.S. tech companies’ international tax strategies as unsustainable, according to a person familiar with the situation. “Multinationals with aggressive tax planning strategies can expect to pay more tax,” Sarah Jane Mahmud, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a recent research note. “EU reforms will require income to be taxed where generated through, among other things, new restrictions on use of controlled foreign companies.” While $14.5 billion represents the EU’s estimate of how much Ireland should claw back from Apple, the final amount, which also will include interest, is still not set in stone.

With yet another iPhone in the pipeline, could it be time to make the change to Google’s operating system? These questions and answers may help you decide The recent Nougat version of Google’s Android operating system, honoured by this statue at the company’s California campus, has many new features.

Plenty of owners of older iPhones will be eager to upgrade, but what if you’re losing faith in Apple’s flagship device? According to research firm Gartner, Android accounts for 86.2% of new smartphone sales, with impressive handsets from Samsung, Motorola and Google tempting people away from iOS. Considering making the switch? Here are answers to some of the questions you might have. Will I be stumped by an unfamiliar interface? You will have to learn a few different conventions on Android, but the basic vocabulary of tapping and swiping is the same, as is the structure of apps and folders on your home screen. The major difference in Android is a few extra onscreen buttons. The universal “back” button takes you to the previous page or app, while the “overview” button pops up previews of all your running apps, so you can switch between them. There are Android phones with cameras as good as the iPhone’s – or better Will I lose all my contacts and bookmarks? No; you can keep them by copying them from iCloud into your Google account. Apple has a guide for exporting your address book as a vCard file via the iCloud website. Safari bookmarks can be synced with Google’s Chrome browser: search the Chrome web store for “iCloud Bookmarks” to find the necessary plug-in. Syncing your iOS calendar with Google Calendar is even easier; on your iPhone, go to Settings, Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then select or set up your Google account and turn on the switch next to Calendars. Will people still be able to message me? If you use WhatsApp or other popular messaging apps, these are all available on Android too: your friends won’t even know you’ve switched. There is one potential gotcha, however. iMessage is an Apple-only feature that automatically routes text messages over the internet where possible. After you’ve switched to Android, it’s possible that incoming text messages to your phone number will continue being diverted to the iMessage network, meaning you won’t receive them. To ensure your settings update, visit Apple’s help page and remove yourself from iMessage manually. Will all my favourite apps be available? There are few big-name apps that don’t support Android, from games and social apps to productivity tools, even if new releases sometimes still come earlier to iOS. Certain genres still suffer on Android in comparison to iOS. For example, music-makers should be warned there is still no real alternative to Apple’s GarageBand on Android or the many professional-grade audio tools that exist on iOS. There is also no direct equivalent to Apple’s iMovie, although there are a growing number of video-editing tools on Android that handle parts of that app’s features. Will I lose access to my music? Not at all. In the early days of iTunes, its downloads could only be played on Apple hardware. Anything you’ve bought since 2009 will be in the unrestricted M4A format though, which can easily be converted into MP3s that will play on any Android phone. Streaming services such as Spotify and Deezer are available on Android, as is Apple Music, so you can sign in on your new phone and access all your old playlists. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Android Nougat allows you precise control over app notifications. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Are Android phones worse for photography? Apple might think so, but there are Android phones with cameras as good as the iPhone’s – or better. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 has a wider lens aperture than the iPhone 6 and 6S, for example, plus optical image stabilisation for steadier shots. If you’re worried about losing the photos from your iPhone camera roll, you can export them on to your computer or install the Google Photos app on iOS to upload them to your Google account. Will I be vulnerable to viruses and hacking attacks? Android gives app developers a lot of freedom, which means you can apply cool customisations that aren’t possible on iOS, such as third-party widgets on the home screen. But yes, this means Android phones are more vulnerable to malware attacks. In theory, a malicious app could snoop on your banking details, lock up your data or run up huge bills by silently calling premium-rate numbers when you’re not looking. Don’t panic, though – such outbreaks are rare and a little common sense goes a long way. Don’t install apps from unfamiliar sites – stick to the official Google Play store and, ideally, stick to established apps with plenty of positive user reviews. Will Android work properly with my Mac? If you prefer to use iTunes on your desktop, then switching will demand a certain adjustment of your habits – there’s no comparable “central control panel” for Android. Your settings and content are managed from within the relevant apps and websites. However, if you want to drag and drop files manually from your desktop on to a connected Android phone, you can do it using Google’s standalone Android File Transfer tool for the Mac. It works the other way too, so you can keep copies of your on-device photos and music or take your pick from the many backup apps on Google Play, both free and paid-for. Will I have to get by without Touch ID and Night Shift? Apple’s Touch ID sensor is a great piece of technology, but there are plenty of Android phones with similar thumbprint scanners, the Nexus 5X and 6P for example, which can be used in the same way to unlock the phone and authorise purchases from Google Play. Android 7.0 Nougat: 11 tips and tricks Read more As for Night Shift, the feature in iOS 9.3 that tints the screen at night to help your brain wind down and sleep better, Google is working on something similar but it hasn’t yet been officially baked into the operating system. Google Play offers a selection of apps that can do the same thing. Twilight is one highly rated option that’s free to download – so you don’t need to lose sleep over switching. Will my accessories still work? Bluetooth accessories such as headphones and speakers should work perfectly well on Android, while health and fitness trackers tend to support both Android and iOS with their apps. Anything with a Lightning connector, however, is sadly a no-go: the plugs and sockets are patented, so you can’t hook them up to a non-Apple device. It’s a similar situation if you’ve splashed out on an Apple Watch. Despite speculation that Apple might open the watch up to work with Android smartphones, it remains iOS-only for now. The good news is that if you can’t live without a smartwatch, there’s a good range of Android Wear devices out there for less than £100. What if I want to switch from Android to iPhone? Many of the reassurances above apply just as well the other way, from apps to music. Apple has also launched an Android app called Move to iOS that migrates your photos, messages, contacts and bookmarks to an iPhone.

Sep 4th 2016, 7:00 AM 23,512 Views 77 Comments Share91 Tweet Email3 Source: Rollingnews.ie/PA IT WAS AN unexpectedly large sum. The European Commission’s ruling this week that Apple was granted illegal state aid by Ireland to the tune of over €13 billion has sparked a trenchant defence by the Irish Government and a recall of the Dáil. Yet how should Ireland respond? TheJournal.ie asked two prominent Irish economists about the decision, and the possible implications for Ireland’s relationship with the EU and our entire industrial strategy. Should we appeal? UCD Economics Professor Moore McDowell says we have nothing to lose in appealing the European Commission decision, although he admits it will bolster Apple’s case. “First of all, Apple are going to appeal, and so there’s no question of us getting our hands on the money for four to six years. Those who are rubbing their hands thinking they’re going to get their hot sticky little paws on €13 billion – there is no chance of that in the short run. Brian Lucey, Professor of Finance at the School of Business in Trinity College Dublin, says Ireland should let Apple fight its own battles. “It’s Apple’s problem, so let Apple appeal,” he told TheJournal.ie. If they win fine, if they don’t, fine. I mean, I didn’t vote for Tim Cook. Nobody did. “Yeah, there’s 5,000 people employed [by Apple] in Cork, but there’s 2 million people employed in the country. And they’re often short-term relatively low-wage jobs.” Whether Ireland and Apple can win their joint appeal against €13 billion in back taxes being paid to the Irish exchequer is another thing, of course. Tim Cook and Laurene Powell at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York earlier this year. Source: AP/Press Association Images Will we get the €13 billion? McDowell says the decision is suspect, in that European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager was going beyond her competition brief in calling Apple’s tax arrangements state aid. “The EC claims that this falls within the boundaries of state aid to a particular firm, which must harm some other firm,” he said. So which other firm, which other competitor of Apple is being harmed? Can you name one? Because there isn’t one. “She’s talking about fair and transcendent and uniform tax policy. That’s not the brief of the Competition Commissioner. What competition is affected by this? Also, this 0.0005% number – how is that reached? Last year, Apple claim that they paid €400 million in Ireland. Now, did they or didn’t they? “The denominator, I think, is worldwide profits of Apple. But the only thing that is relevant in Ireland is what is taxable in Ireland, not worldwide profits.” Professor Brian Lucey said there were “at least three” other competitors of Apple back in 1991. Of course there were competitors to Apple in 1991, what about all the other digital computer manufacturers, across the board? “The Commission is questioning whether the structure was there so only Apple could use it. The process was through tax, but the outcome was a state aid issue. The state aid is the issue, not the tax issue.” European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager speaking on Tuesday. Source: Virginia Mayo/PA Other ‘bad’ Apples? The magnitude of the money involved has concentrated Irish minds on whether there are other ‘Apples’ out there, and whether Ireland’s entire FDI strategy is now under threat. “That’s a very good question,” McDowell says. What about Big Pharma?  They’re producing lots of little Viagra products down in Cork, in Ringaskiddy, and are sending them to other countries. It’s a joke, but true, if you want to get your Viagra, you get it in a little pillbox. “The active ingredient, which it charges a high price for, is made down in Cork. So the Commission could now come in and say ‘let’s look at this as a common tax policy’, and look at where the sales of company are being made – in France, say – and tax them there. “The Commission is claiming Revenue did special sweetheart deals with Apple only. In other words, this applies only to you, Mr Apple, and to nobody else – don’t say a word to anybody. It applies to only one firm. But if, on the other hand, they were saying ‘here’s the tax law in Ireland, anyone can take advantage of it or not as the case may be – if Mr Pfizer and Mr Pernod Ricard wouldn’t get the same answer as to Apple, then it’s not state aid to a particular firm. “In that case, it’s not favouring one over other, it’s just making it more attractive to locate in Ireland, and that’s what’s pissing off the Germans and the French.” The moral argument Professor Brian Lucey said: ”Is this the only one? I really don’t know. “It really is interesting. I haven’t heard anyone say there is or there isn’t. The Commission say Apple are shuffling profits through Ireland, and it’s seen to be coming through Ireland.” Pfizer HQ in New York. Source: Mark Lennihan/PA Regime Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has claimed that Ireland is being forced to tax Apple’s global profits, in effect doing the job of a just international tax regime. “Of course there should be an internationally agreed tax regime,” Professor Lucey added. But there should be an internationally agreed regime on lots of things. That’d be nice. “So of course there’s a moral issue, and if we’re not going to be part of the solution to the trillions of dollars that are flushing around the world from multinationals, then we’re part of the problem. So we should get on and do it. “I mean, even Tim Cook was accepting there was an argument about the morality of the global tax regime.” Moore McDowell. Source: Rollingnews.ie Shirty McDowell believes the moral idea of fairness is subjective, however. “Personally, I don’t like seeing people being ripped off as much as the next man,” he said. But when [Vestager] talks about fair taxation, your definition of fair taxation might be different from mine. But surely people paying 40-50% tax in Ireland have every right to think that Apple should be taxed the 12.5% headline corporate tax rate? “If I were in that position [of paying marginal tax rate of 50% as a sole trader], I’d feel very shirty about it, absolutely,” McDowell said. “I’m not disputing that. But say we take the €13 billion and run, when the €13 billion has been spent, are you going to spend another €13 billion? This is a one-off. On Friday, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan painted the European Commission decision as an attack on Ireland’s 12.5% tax regime, which Taoiseach Enda Kenny says featured in his first meeting with Ireland’s European partners after the 2011 election. McDowell agrees, calling it a ‘second front’ on tax harmonisation. “They tried to form a Common Corporate Tax Base, and ran into a brick wall,” he said. Vestager is getting into the business of defining a Europe-wide tax policy. She is definitely supported by German and French politicians. “She’s not on a solo run, but she’s using this as a device to, like Churchill, open up a second front… with a view to forming a common community tax base for corporation tax in the EU. It’s the first step in having a single corporation tax across the community. That’s what the game is about. McDowell added: “There are two forms of competition, between different firms within one country, and regime competition between countries, which is what the Germans and the French and the Commission are really concerned about. “And it’s the 12.5%. They want to challenge it in general because it’s a threat to their own corporate taxes.” An EU flag in front of London's Big Ben. Source: PA Absolute refusal Professor Lucey believes Ireland should be playing the long game, in terms of getting on good terms with our European allies in the wake of Brexit, which is likely to rob Ireland of its main ally in London. “We’ve kind of pissed off a lot of people in Europe in the way we’ve been dealing with tax,” Lucey said. “The blunt, absolute refusal to engage in any discussion on the 12.5% corporate tax rate has, at best is being seen as fast and loose. At its worst it’s seen as, you know, straight-up tax havening by our European partners. And we’re going to need our European partners to be on our side in post-Brexit negotiations. “We’ve been able to shelter behind the UK in a lot of issues. We won’t be able to do that any more, we’ll have to stand on our own two feet. “And we’ll find it’s a cold enough place if we keep cocking a snook at them. There’s a longer game here, and it’s not about if we squander it or whether there’ll be egg on our faces.” Will foreign firms flee Ireland? Central to the Government’s defence of its appeal has been the thousands of jobs – the precise amount is unclear – dependent on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). “I think that’s complete nonsense, Lucey adds. “First of all, this arrangement with Apple lapsed in 2013, 2014. And what has happened since then? “Apple has launched a huge expansion of its business down in Cork. So this has nothing to do with Apple’s decision to continue what Cook called a 27-year-old relationship. Source: Brian Lucey “All of the evidence on the decision of companies to engage in FDI suggests that there’s a constellation of issues, not just on tax.  We’re a pretty good place to do business, we’re in the common market, we’re English-speaking. It’s not an awful place to live. Politicians have grown up with idea that only FDI will save us from the poorhouse. And they’re trapped in a rhetoric and a mindset that’s demonstrably false. “We’ve been working on the basis that FDI is the only game in town for about 60 years now, but the real rise in national income in Ireland came in the early 90s, when Europe really got its single market cranking. “They helped us with structural funds, but also that we had to cop on and govern ourselves properly, in terms of explaining where the money is going.” Moore McDowell thinks Ireland has few advantages apart from its 12.5% corporation tax regime, however. “If there was a single European corporation tax regime, then you have to ask yourself what advantages does Ireland have any more as a location for industry? Speaking English won’t help you sell pills in Paris. Would it destroy us? We were here before they thought up the 12.5% and I’m sure we’ll be here after it. “But the reputation of Ireland as being a place where you can do business…. would be certainly dented.” Read: ‘We stand fully behind our corporation tax regime’: Government to appeal Apple ruling Read: FactCheck: How many people actually work for foreign companies in Ireland?

Dual rear cameras? Pressure-sensitive sensors? This year, as every year, the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco will be crammed to the rafters with press and Apple well-wishers waiting for the pomp, circumstance and technical revelations of another iPhone launch. But this one, on Wednesday, is more important for Apple than it has been for a while. After the huge success of 2014’s iPhone 6 – which introduced a completely new design with larger screen sizes, attracting more people switching from rival Android phones than ever before – 2015’s iPhone 6S has been a bit of a damp squib in terms of consumer buzz. And encroaching competition from China means Apple faces arguably the most competitive market conditions it has ever seen. Not that sales have been anything to sniff at. Apple still shipped millions of iPhones over the last two years – more than 225m last year and more than 230m expected this year, according to analysts Gartner. But enthusiasm for the 6S has been at a level markedly below the model it replaced. Overall iPhone sales have been down by between 5m and 10m a quarter year-on-year since the 6S launched, despite the contribution of the newer, smaller iPhone SE, which has been popular in Europe. That was in the face of the overall smartphone market increasing in size by 200m devices, reaching 1.4bn phones sold to end users in 2015. As a consequence, Apple’s share of the smartphone market fell in the last three quarters to 11.7%, according to data from analysts IDC. Apple’s arch-rival Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer, stayed relatively constant with a share of roughly 23% in the same period; it was the likes of China’s Huawei, which jumped from just over 5% to closer to 8.5% year-on-year, that saw the gains. IDC’s Francisco Jeronimo says: “The biggest challenge facing Apple is the decline in the smartphone market we’re going to see as device penetration hits 80-85%.” At that point, he says, it’s not about attracting buyers who are purchasing their first smartphone – “it’s about convincing existing users to upgrade and attracting buyers from other brands”. The rising stars of the Chinese smartphone industry, including Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi, have turned from making cheap and cheerful products to producing desirable phones featuring refined functions found on much more expensive rivals. It is these companies, many contend, that are eating into Apple’s bottom line. Apple is not alone in being undercut by comparable devices costing as little as one-third the price: Samsung has managed to maintain pace, but previously big-name Android manufacturers such as HTC, Sony and LG have struggled to stay competitive. Jeronimo says: “I wouldn’t be surprised to see Apple overtaken by Huawei as the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world in the next two years. Apple is just not investing as much money at the point of sale as Samsung in the face of Huawei’s rapid rise.” Perhaps market share isn’t the be-all and end-all, but it has affected Apple’s bottom line: the company has posted two straight quarters of year-on-year declines in revenue. So what does Apple have in response to the growing competition? Reports indicate the company will be more or less sticking to the tried-and-trusted iPhone 6 design externally, with an aluminium back, curved sides and glass front. The 6 and 6S were almost indistinguishable when placed side by side, and if rumours are to be believed, the same will be true of the iPhone 7 (or whatever it ends up being called). Instead, Apple is expected to improve the technology inside the device – as it and everyone else does every year. The iPhone’s familiar home button may see its first big change since the introduction of a fingerprint sensor in 2013 by becoming pressure-sensitive, according to Bloomberg. Dual rear cameras have also become relatively common in the last year, with manufacturers such as Huawei and LG launching several phones sporting two lenses on the back. Apple could do the same, providing extra functions and improving low-light performance. Perhaps, though, the rumour that has caused the most commotion is that Apple will be ditching the long-lived headphone jack. The ubiquitous 3.5mm socket, which is common to smartphones, tablets, computers, games consoles, televisions and hi-fis alike, could be going the way of the dodo, leaving only Apple’s Lightning port in its place – and rendering almost any set of older wired headphones obsolete without an adapter. Jeronimo says: “For Apple, it’s about managing the expectations of its massive installed base – no one in the industry has larger – and encouraging them to spend more within the Apple ecosystem and on services, as people upgrade more slowly and smartphone innovation becomes more and more incremental.” More analysis Topics iPhone iPhone 6S iPhone 6 Apple Samsung More… Huawei Xiaomi Smartphones Telecoms Mobile phones Computing iPhone 7 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

By Roger Baird September 4, 2016 07:00 BST EC Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said firms had a responsibility to society to pay their taxesReuters When European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told US tech giant Apple to pay €13bn ($14.5bn) in back taxes, the experienced Danish politician probably calculated the roof would fall in. And that is what happened. Vestager, 48, disclosed that earlier tax arrangements struck between Ireland and Apple in 1991 and 2007 broke European rules on state aid. The competition commissioner said selective treatment towards Apple, which employs almost 6,000 staff in Ireland, allowed it to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005% in 2014. Vestager added: "This decision sends a clear message. Member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies. No matter if they are European or foreign, large or small." Apple and Dublin have both stated they will appeal the ruling. Apple chief executive Tim Cook raged: "It's total political c**p. They just picked a number from I don't know where." The US Treasury Department warned: "The Commission's actions could threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU." However, a stream of comments on social media, across Europe and the US congratulated the commissioner on her stance. Governments across the world carry higher debts since the financial crisis, a result of rescuing key industries and having to pump cash into their economies to keep them afloat. This means that national treasuries are constantly searching for additional revenue. US firms have $1.2tn of cash stashed in low-tax regimes outside the US, which has one of the world's highest corporate tax rates at 39%. The US is looking at plans to allow these firms to repatriate this cash, bringing it under the American tax system. This explains US anger at the EC's order for Apple to hand over €13bn in back taxes to Ireland, which they see as cash destined for US coffers. But Vestager, a mother of three daughters, was not afraid to step into choppy waters and fight for a share of this cash which she believes belongs to Europe. She said: "Europe is a wonderful place to do business, with a single market of potentially 500 million customers. Vestager always rode her bicycle whenever she went to see the Danish Queen Reuters "We see many companies who pay their taxes, who contribute to the societies they are part of. Where they use the roads, the infrastructure, hire skilled employees educated in their national education systems. These companies pay their taxes, and they expect other companies to do the same." Vestager took up her five-year post as competition commissioner in 2014, taking over from Spain's Joaquin Almunia. The straight-talking Vestager left the Danish government where she had been the economy minister and deputy prime minister for three years for the centrist Social Liberal Party. Many colleagues insist Vestager was the model for the fictional woman prime minister Birgitte Nyborg in the hit Danish political drama Borgen. An independent-minded personality Vestager always rode her bicycle whenever she was called on to meet the Danish Queen Margrethe II. She graduated from the University of Copenhagen's master of economics programme in 1993 before working as an economist in the Danish finance ministry. Vestager was first elected to parliament in 2001 and became political leader of the Social Liberal Party in 2007. She later served as minister of education from 1998 to 2001. At her selection hearings before the European Parliament in October 2014 before being confirmed in the role Vestager dropped strong hints about how she planned to approach the job. She explained: "I will listen to everyone, from the largest multinationals to the representatives of small firms. From states to citizens. But the analysis of my staff and my own judgement will not be swayed by anyone." The European commissioner has a full in-box. Online giant Amazon and fast food chain McDonald's face similar EC probes over taxes in Luxembourg, while coffee chain Starbucks has been ordered to cough up around €30m to the Dutch state, though it is also appealing that decision. The EC is also understood to be scrutinising the European tax arrangements of online search giants Google. I will listen to everyone, from the largest multinationals to the representatives of small firms. From states to citizens. But the analyses of my staff and my own judgement will not be swayed by anyone - European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager The Institute of Directors chief economist James Sproule told IBTimes UK that Vestager's decision has sent shockwaves through business and political circles around the world. Sproule said: "Britain's taxation laws are likely to be beholden only to Parliament and the Treasury once we leave the European Union, and there's no question that the Apple decision will have been noted not just by the British Government as they make plans for Brexit but by the world's largest firms as well. "If and when our taxation rules are written here, these rules should be transparent and business-friendly. That could well give the UK a competitive advantage over not just those in the EU but, if we get them right, those further afield too." Governments and business will keep a stern eye on the battle Vestager is waging against some of the biggest firms in the world for the right to decide who sets corporate tax bills.

While many people think Apple is moving to embrace a more services-oriented culture in response to slowing iPhone sales, the reality is much different,” Neil Cybart writes for Above Avalon. “It’s time to dispel the myth that Apple is becoming a services company.” “Apple Services was thrown into the spotlight this past January when it became apparent that Apple would soon report its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. In an effort to get Wall Street to focus on something other than slowing hardware sales growth, management began to weave a new Apple narrative involving terms such as “installed base related revenue” and “installed base related purchases.” Apple’s goal was to provide Wall Street with a different way to think about Apple’s business,” Cybart writes. “However, many company observers misinterpreted the change in narrative as Apple looking to pivot into a services company.” “The Apple Services myth was born. We have gotten to the point where seemingly every report chronicling iPhone sales declines quickly turns to Apple’s supposed push into services,” Cybart writes. “Apple isn’t turning into a services company. The narrative that Apple management tried to sow earlier this year with Wall Street wasn’t meant to foretell a shift to new recurring revenue streams. Instead, Apple wanted to give investors a different way to think about Apple hardware sales. Apple can still grow the installed base despite year-over-year hardware sales declines.” Much more in the full article – recommended – here. MacDailyNews Take: Services revenue is just a side benefit for Apple executing properly. That Apple’ services business alone will be ‘Fortune 100’ size next year is meaningful for providing perspective on the immense size of Apple’s overall business. If you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next. — Steve Jobs Note: Apple’s services business includes revenue from Internet Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services. The Milwaukee-based life insurer Northwestern Mutual is currently 100 on Fortune’s list with $28.111 billion in annual revenue and 5,530 employees.

Because even if everyone who currently has a mac upgrades to the nee machines to be announced, Apple can’t possible climb any higher than 10-15% of market share due to cost. Businesses face a choice: Equip hundreds, or even thousands, of employees with a $250 Windows desktop or a $1,500 mac desktop, and they are going to go with economics more often than not. However, if they equip them with ipads, then its a different story.

Their view of technology is one of decreasing reliance on the local device and increasing reliance on services. It’s obvious in their promotion of the iPad, lack of promotion of Macs, Macs becoming smaller, thinner, less ports, etc. It’s not a bad plan, from a consumer electronics company. Apple is handing over the general purpose computing and high performance computing arena to people like ASUS, Dell, HP, ACER and so on. I’m looking at a new ACER laptop right now with a 21″ Curved Display, 7th generation intel core I7, and 2 (count’em) two GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards. (Yes, I said Laptop). Look at the current Razer Stealth and it’s more powerful than the projected upcoming MacBook Pro. Apple is on a different path. Some of us are going to have to choose. Do we go with computing versatility (no matter how painful losing the Mac OS is), or do with stick with the very non-techie appliance world of Apple. I also don’t think Apple realizes that I’m not invested in the iPhone or AppleTV or iPad or WatchOS, or Services. I’m invested in the macOS. Take that away, and I have no more loyalty to Apple. If all I wanted out of a computer was what the 90% want, Apple would be fine. But I want more. And I’m in the minority. The other thing that they should consider however is that those of us in the minority, tend to influence the purchases of others. Choose the right path Sunday, September 4, 2016 - 12:46 am · Reply If you want to choose Windows or Linux, go for it. More macs for the rest of us who understand Apple’s path and realise that the path less trodden is the more exciting, more adventurous path than the one so trodden by Windows users that the path is severely deteriorating. Rob Friday, September 2, 2016 - 5:24 pm · Reply God let’s hope not KingMel Friday, September 2, 2016 - 5:49 pm · Reply Apple has to continue to sell hardware/devices in order for its services sector to continue growing. The hardware feeds the services. The services feed the hardware. Neither one can grow substantially in the face of a decline in the other. Thus, this Apple is becoming a services company is total BS. What is true is that the Apple ecosystem is maturing and Apple is gradually finding ways to monetize the services side of that ecosystem. As a result, services revenue is growing in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue. Nothing surprising there. tommyr Friday, September 2, 2016 - 9:12 pm · Reply At this point they’re barely a computer company anymore….Tim’s destroying their computer business. FAST.

Last week, European Union antitrust regulators ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in taxes to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid. Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook last week described the ruling as "total political crap", but France and Germany have come out to back Brussels on the decision. Juncker said that the EU Commission investigations on taxation have mainly targeted Euroopean companies.

 Political? Mais oui, of course, EU insiders say of Apple case Reuters Sep. 3, 2016, 2:57 PM 197 facebook linkedin twitter email print An Apple logo is seen in the window of an authorised apple reseller store in Galway Thomson Reuters By Alastair Macdonald and Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission denies that its shock demand that Apple Inc. hand 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland is, in the pungent phrase of Apple CEO Tim Cook, "total political crap".     But, say senior EU officials involved, the decision certainly has a strong political element, even if Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager says she is confident her case will stand up to Cook's appeal on its legal merits alone.     Brussels' political target is less corporate America than eurosceptics at home who threaten to pull the EU apart if it fails to show alienated voters it can act in their interests.     "Being political should not be confused with politicized," said a spokeswoman for Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. For him, fighting tax avoidance had been a "top priority" since before he took over the EU executive two years ago, she said.     "The drive towards fairer taxation is in President Juncker's political guidelines," she said. At the same time, Vestager is an "entirely independent" enforcer of EU competition law, she added.     Efforts under way, including in the United States, to clamp down on tax avoidance are political in the sense that all states, with budgets under strain, face pressure from voters to claw back cash from other people, preferably wealthy companies, tax experts and government officials say.     For European Union institutions, the struggle is less for money -- Apple's cash will go to Ireland if Vestager wins her case. What Brussels is fighting for is the EU's very survival against eurosceptics like the Brexiteers who persuaded Britons to quit the bloc in June.     Those populists, on left and right, from the UK Independence Party to France's National Front or 5-Star in Italy, have scored with voters by accusing the EU and the executive Commission of cosying up to big, global business against the little people.     "Apple shows how you fight against populism," a senior EU official familiar with the Commission chief's thinking told Reuters, describing a two-pronged strategy directed by Juncker.     One part of the strategy is a push for new global tax rules, led by EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Pierre Moscovici, a French Socialist former finance minister. The other part rests on punishing the worst past abusers to deter others. Vestager says the goal is to change corporate culture so that businesses anxious for their reputation stop trying to pay as little tax as possible and choose to pay "the right amount". On Juncker's political goal, he won government backing in Paris and Berlin. And many European media also welcomed the Apple move. Le Monde, leftish voice of establishment France and critic of Juncker's low-tax policies when he was premier of Luxembourg, said he had shown "the zeal of the newly converted". "Europe is changing," it wrote. "Bravo, Monsieur Juncker."     SHOWING VOTERS EU CARES     "The EU’s message is clear," Juncker wrote for a G20 meeting in China this weekend. "All companies must pay their fair share.     "This is first and foremost a question of fairness. It has urgent practical implications as well. We cannot let down our schools, hospitals and public services that need this money."     The $14.5-billion demand which angered the United States and worried Apple's peers was engineered for shock and awe, the EU official said. Juncker sees Vestager as what the EU president calls his "Rottweiler", he added. Apple and the Irish government say Vestager is rewriting the iPhone maker's quarter-century of history in Ireland. Apple denies that Dublin gave it tax breaks amounting to illegal state aid.     What has changed is the politics. The financial crisis has impoverished Western governments just as footloose young tech firms became hugely rich without paying much tax anywhere. U.S. Senate revelations about Apple in 2013 fueled public anger and, with some irony, prompted the EU to start inquiries.     Juncker's own history has also played a part. A conservative prime minister of Luxembourg for 19 years, he helped transform it from industrial rustbowl to a financial hub its bigger neighbors saw as helping businesses deprive them of revenues.     Weeks after taking over the Commission in late 2014, he faced calls to resign when deals between Luxembourg and global corporates were splashed in world media as the LuxLeaks affair.     He denied involvement but, aides say, the uproar helped galvanize Juncker for a tax crackdown he had already promised.     Driving his pledge to run a "political Commission" to reconnect with voters alienated by out-of-touch, technocratic elites in Brussels was a fear that his five-year term was, in his words, the "last chance" to save the Union from break-up.          LEGAL UNDERPINNINGS     "It's political in the sense that, if the Commission is prioritizing the allocation of its resources, then clearly tax evasion and tax avoidance are very high on the political agenda everywhere," said Sophie in 't Veld, deputy leader of the centrist group in the European Parliament. "This is something that citizens are rightly and understandably concerned about."     That political approach, Brussels officials stress, does not mean capricious or lacking legal basis. Vestager is clear she must win in court on some untested points of law against the best tax attorneys Silicon Valley and Washington can buy, and against EU member state Ireland.     Asked about Cook's comments to an Irish newspaper about the EU's "political" motives, she said: "I don’t think the courts will hear any kind of political opinions or feelings or what’s in your stomach or whatever. They want the facts of the case."     LISTEN, THEN BITE     Some EU officials think the anger of Cook and U.S. officials at the historic scale of the tax demand may partly stem from underestimating Vestager's uncompromising character.     Tall, courteous and soft-spoken, she is a woman who takes trouble to greet captains of industry by the lift and escort them back to her office, often then serving them coffee herself. It may wrong-foot those used to more confrontational politicians and executives. She is a listener rather than a talker.     "There are some people who are very loud ... but ... it is very important to have a very, very, very open ear to those who are not loud," the former economy minister and liberal party leader told Reuters on taking office two years ago.     People who work with her say she listens closely to career officials on her staff -- much more than did her Spanish predecessor Joaquin Almunia, a professional economist.     One U.S. tech giant to feel a change of approach after 2014 was Google, with whom Almunia worked for years to reach a compromise over concerns about its market dominance. Since last year, Vestager has hit Google with three separate charges.     She also put an end to hesitation in Brussels by launching a price fixing case against Russian gas giant Gazprom last year.     Most current state aid tax cases, including Apple, were launched by Almunia but competition experts question whether he would have come to Vestager's radical conclusion. Almunia's own predecessor Neelie Kroes, now at another Silicon Valley darling Uber, said this week the Dane had gone too far against Apple. Some observers believe Vestager, a professional politician since her student days, may be tempted to use cases to raise her profile and further greater ambitions. She says not.     Predecessors have also taken on Washington, among them Mario Monti, later Italy's prime minister, who blocked a mega-merger between GE and Honeywell in 2001 despite U.S. support for it, and Kroes, who slapped heavy fines on Microsoft in 2008. There may be more to come, Vestager says. Her 800 staff are looking at about 1,000 inquiries where firms may have gained an edge by cutting tax deals with governments seeking investment. A pastor's daughter, Vestager summed up her political credo in the 2014 interview with Reuters: "I was brought up with a very strong value," she said. "That you should always protect the few and the small against those who want to misuse their muscle." (Writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Jon Boyle) Read the original article on Reuters.

No, but it’s a sweet breeze Do you need this latest Dyson contraption? Especially at $500? At first glance, the price sounds high, and there are certainly lower-cost fans in every store, but Dyson fans have never been a bargain. Just like a Mercedes and a Kia will both move you down the road, a Dyson and a cheaper fan will both keep you cool. The difference is in the details and the air purifier with a 360-degree HEPA filter. A quick check of Amazon shows HEPA air purifiers run between $100 and $300, so if you add the cost of a similar-sized Dyson fan without an air purifier ($320), the combined fan and air purifier is not really overpriced, especially when you consider the Wi-Fi connection and app. The Pure Cool Link connects to your home’s Wi-Fi network and can be controlled by a smartphone app from across the room or across the internet. The air moving out of the fan is like a cool breeze. It’s louder at the higher settings but is good white noise while sleeping. To set the Pure Cool Link to one of the 10 fan speeds, you’ll need to use the included remote control or the smartphone app. DALLAS MORNING NEWS GOOGLE DUO FREE Messaging app uses your phone number Google’s Duo is a simple video messaging app that accomplishes the task of doing one thing very well. Think of it as Apple’s FaceTime — Google Duo is designed for one-on-one mobile video calls and nothing else. Those who use Google’s Hangouts app, which also allows for video calling, may look at Duo and miss features such as group calling. That’s a valid criticism. Duo differentiates itself in two key ways. One, it’s tied to your phone number rather than your Google account, meaning that you don’t need a Google account to use it. Second, Duo is encrypted, so that Google itself can’t see the content of your conversations. Duo does have one feature that could be particularly useful for video calls on the go: If the person calling you is on your contacts list, Duo’s “Knock Knock” feature gives a video preview of who’s on the other side. This can be disabled, but it’s useful if you get a call and want some intel about who’s on the other side and the kind of mood they are in.

An anonymous reader quotes Softpedia: Anthony Di Iorio, founder of Jaxx, a crypto-currency wallet, claims that an Apple representative revealed to him the six crypto-currencies allowed on the App Store, during a private phone conversation... Di Iorio had this conversation with the Apple employee after the company removed his Jaxx iOS app from the store. The Apple employee told Di Iorio that they had to remove his app because it featured support for Dash, another blockchain technology, touted as an alternative to Bitcoin. During the conversation, Di Iorio asked what crypto-currencies Apple approves of, so he'd know what to remove from Jaxx's iOS version and get his app back on the App Store. Di Iorio says that Apple is comfortable approving apps on its App Store that handle only six crypto-currencies: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, the DAO and Ripple. Reaction to Apple's list of approved crypto-currencies wasn't positive, at least on Twitter. Most users criticized Apple's decision to limit the list to only six, which they considered might thwart the evolution of other, lesser-known crypto-currencies. Vitalik Buterin, who helped create Ethereum with Di lorio, tweeted "For the record: despite being a beneficiary of this instance of (private) regulatory protectionism, I oppose it." apple business handheld ← Related Links → QtCon Opens In Berlin Here's Why Apple Rejected Your iOS App Ask Slashdot: Time To Get Into Crypto-currency?

Related articles Apple ordered to pay taxes by EU... ON THE LEFT: Barbados a big part... BEHIND THE HEADLINES: Barbados,... To put it bluntly, the Irish government, as a matter of deliberate national tax policy, decided to attract multinational companies to its shores by establishing itself as an international financial centre in which such companies pay a lesser tax than they would pay if all their profits were repatriated to their home countries. But the government of Ireland says that Apple does not owe them any taxes. In this country we well understand the position. In return for smaller rates of corporation tax, and similarly to Ireland, our country gets other spin- offs in terms of foreign exchange, provision of high paying jobs, increases in tourism from necessary business travel, and a host of other collateral benefits. In a real sense we have common interests with the Irish. In the case of Apple, some 6 000 jobs have been created, millions of dollars in taxes have been paid and both Apple and the Irish government have no problem with the arrangement.  In fact the Irish finance minister has said that he disagrees profoundly with the commission’s decision, and he went on to say that the Irish tax system was founded on the strict application of law as enacted by parliament without exception. Here in Barbados we can identify with this situation because we have had some of the international bodies like the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development either blacklisting us or vehemently disagreeing with us because we have done a similar thing as the Irish in creating favourable tax regimes to attract some of the world’s multinationals to establish subsidiary companies here. So that any attack on clean jurisdictions like Ireland must concern us. It is true that these organisations cannot directly dictate our tax policy and deliver rulings identical to the Irish decision, but the frontal assault that has been mounted on countries like Barbados can have a similarly hurtful impact on our tax and economic policy, since non- compliance with the directives could mean that offshore companies might stay away from blacklisted countries. In the face of this kind of action, if we are to protect and grow our offshore sector, local authorities both in the government and private professional sector must maintain cutting-edge positions in this area and thus be able to anticipate and plan for tsunami-like events which can devastate a vital aspect of our economy. In the Apple situation, the irony is that the United States which has frowned on offshore centres now finds itself violently disagreeing with the European Commission, with one official describing the decision as awful and in direct violation of many of the treaty obligations of many European countries. Independence has given us our freedom to associate with any country which shares our interests, but as modern society becomes more complex we have to clearly identify our interests. Our national development scholarships must identify areas of specific study, critical to our offshore sector so that we can challenge rulings and directives which, if left unanswered, can undermine our economic interests. Our voice must be loudly heard in defence of our interests wherever and whenever those interests are in play.

A dual-camera system for iPhone, a new and improved Apple Watch 2 with GPS, new wireless headphones, and much more. Here’s what we expect to see at Apple’s iPhone event next week… iPhone 7 & 7 Plus | Same design. iPhone 7 will mostly be the same physical design as iPhone 6s apart from repositioned antenna lines. As you can see in the image below, the antenna lines will be redirected along the edge of the device leaving a smooth backside free of the antenna lines visible on the back of current iPhone models. Dual-camera system. One of the big hardware upgrades that Apple will surely highlight on stage is the dual-camera tech it’s expected to introduce with far better zoom capabilities. It looks like the new dual-camera could be limited to the larger 5.5-inch models, while one report claimed the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 models will get optical image stabilization, a feature previously limited to the larger 5.5-inch Plus models. Both models will get new 12 megapixel cameras according to the latest supply chain reports. Redesigned Home button. We reported back in June that sources indicated Apple was working on a designed Home button, and since others have backed up our report that the new Home button with haptic feedback-like features could be included in the iPhone 7. No headphone jack. Apple is removing the headphone jack and forcing you to use wireless or Lightning headphones or adapters.  32GB-256GB. It looks like most iPhone users will get a storage upgrade this cycle with several reports pointing to a 32GB base model and a new higher-capacity 256GB model on the high-end. New Space Black color option. We reported previously on Apple’s considerations for a new darker color for iPhone 7. Now with some fresh component leaks adding to our report, it’s looking even more likely that Apple will offer a new color option. And if the part leaks are accurate, it will likely be a darker Space Black-like model. One recent report from supply chain analysts KGI noted both a darker space black and a glossier piano black finish will be offered making for five total color options alongside the current silver, gold, and rose gold.  iOS 10. Currently in beta, you can expect an announcement for the public release of iOS 10 at the event, which means the new and improved Messages features alongside a very long list of other new features will arrive for all. I’ll let Jeff walk you through 75 of them in the video above. Apple Watch 2 | GPS. One of Apple Watch 2’s standout features will likely be the inclusion of a new GPS chip, offering more freedom from the iPhone by enabling the device to offer an enhanced standalone fitness experience and other GPS features. Same design. Apple Watch 2 will include largely the same design according to the supply chain reports, but that doesn’t rule out some new strap and model configurations that could breathe some new life into the current lineup. Apple has reportedly experimented with titanium and other casing materials that could in theory be introduced without changing the overall design of the device, but it’s likely Apple won’t have any other major design changes in store for the second generation Watch. Improved battery life. The watch is also said to include improved performance and battery life, according to the latest component leaks claiming to show a larger battery for the device and other tweaked parts. watchOS 3. One thing we know Apple Watch will be getting is watchOS 3, with notable new features including improved performance, a new Control Center feature, quick access to watch face switching, improved messaging and more. Check out our hands-on with the beta release above.  Accessories | Beats Wireless Headphones. Apple’s Beats PR team this week leaked what appeared to be plans for a new line of Beats headphones to launch alongside iPhone 7. That followed hints at three new wireless Beats models in the works from recent trademark filings. AirPods? Will new Beats wireless headphones be the only thing Apple has for the first iPhone without a headphone jack? We reported earlier this year that it has truly wireless, cord-free earbuds in the works, and later leaks have speculated that hints at “AirPods” branding could be connected to the product. Whether to not Apple will have these ready in time to launch with the iPhone 7 remains to be seen. Lightning EarPods or an Adapter? Another thing we’re expecting to see is either an adapter or Lightning EarPods bundled with the iPhone 7. Even if Apple has its cord-free earbuds ready for launch, it will likely sell those at a premium and offer an adapter or new EarPods with a Lightning connector in the box. macOS Sierra: Apple will announce the release of macOS Sierra next week, currently in developer and public beta. What can you expect? Above Jeff walks us through a ton of new features in the release that Apple will possibly briefly highlight on stage when announcing availability. The highlight feature of the release is the debut of Siri on the Mac, but it also introduces a new universal clipboard, redesigned Apple Music features, and more.  tvOS 10: Along with macOS Sierra, iOS 10, and watchOS 3, Apple will likely release GM seeds of tvOS 10 for the fourth-generation Apple TV next week. Zac gave us a preview earlier this year showing us the new Dark mode feature, YouTube Siri search, HomeKit, & more. There have been several reports that Apple is continuing behind the scenes work on a new video service with the most recent report claiming it was developing a universal TV guide feature for Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad. But there hasn’t been any indication yet Apple will have anything beyond tvOS 10 to show next week. Macbook Pro Concept by Martin Hajek New MacBook Pro? (Wildcard) Apple is planning new thinner MacBook Pros for release in the coming months. We’ve reported extensively on the leaks surrounding the new models, which feature a new OLED touch screen panel above the keyboard. Is Apple planning another event between now and the holidays to announce the new MacBook Pro, or could it possibly be planning to give us a glimpse at the new Macs next week ahead of a release later in the year?

SAN FRANCISCO — When Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone two weeks ago, it appeared to have a critical and commercial hit, selling an estimated 2.5 million units. Then the big, fiery letdown. The South Korean electronics giant suspended sales and announced a recall, after discovering batteries of some phones exploded while they were charging. The major recall of a well-received product in a fiercely competitive market is a blow to any manufacturer. But it is particularly stinging for Samsung, which is in a pitched battle with LG and Apple, both of which are expected to announce new smartphones next week. Samsung has capitalized on a recent decline in interest in Apple's iPhone, last quarter posting its strongest profits in two years on sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Rivals are circling. In addition to Apple and LG, the company faces increased international competition from Android rivals HTC, Lenovo and Huawei. In a cooling smartphone market worldwide, the Note 7 situation could make an Android user consider an iOS device, but more likely could “make me want to go to another Android maker like LG," says Tuong Nguyen, principal analyst with research firm Gartner.  "It’s a pretty tough time in the industry because all the vendors are struggling with keeping consumers regularly updating their devices and anything that puts a hiccup in that is noteworthy," Nguyen says. While Samsung increased its global sales of smartphones by about 6% in the second quarter of 2016, overall sales of mobile phones worldwide contracted by 0.5%, according to Gartner. Samsung is the global leader in smartphone sales, selling 76.7 million in Q2 2016; Apple is No. 2 with 44.4 million sold. For Samsung, the timing couldn't be worse, say analysts. "It’s a supply-chain issue, a quality-control issue and that, ultimately, makes it a marketing problem," says Paul Teich, an analyst at Tirias Research. "Samsung got a bad bunch of batteries — and you’re only as good as your components." Hunting down the defective batteries and the recall process is an expensive undertaking, says Teich, who recently purchased a Note 7, which he calls a "beautiful piece of work." In an email message to USA TODAY, Samsung said it has discovered a "small number" — earlier, it said 35 — of defective phones worldwide. “Samsung is taking a proactive approach to address customer needs around the Note 7,” said Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics America. “We are encouraging customers to exchange their Note 7 by taking advantage of our Product Exchange Program." The program (1-800-SAMSUNG) lets Note 7 owners exchange their current device with a new one as early as next week; or exchange their Note 7 for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge and replacement of any Note 7-specific accessories with a refund of the price difference between devices. The timing of the recall is "not coincidental," says Teich, who suggested Samsung rushed the Note 7 to market before Apple announces what is expected to be a new iPhone on Sept. 7. "Maybe it was an error of expedience" on Samsung's part, he says. Samsung's misstep, no matter how adroitly it manages the situation, "gives Apple a perceptual advantage" headed into its event in San Francisco next week, says Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. But the recall is unlikely to significantly impact iPhone 7 sales, notes Angelo Zino, an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Wait till next year CNET Shara Tibken 04/09/2016 SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Post-mortem on George Michael proves inconclusive IS claims responsibility for Turkey attacks as manhunt intensifies © Provided by CNET Looking for big iPhone changes? Wait till next year If you're looking to be wowed by a new iPhone design, you might have to wait until 2017. This is supposed to be a year of big changes for the iPhone, but all rumors so far point to minor tweaks in Apple's iPhone 7, which CEO Tim Cook is set to unveil Wednesday before a few thousand people at an event in San Francisco. And the biggest change -- the removal of the headphone jack -- is something that could tick off a lot of people. Every other year, Apple releases an "S" model of its popular phone, where the S often stands for "same old design." That was the case last year with the iPhone 6S, which looked identical to 2014's blockbuster iPhone 6. The only noticeable design update: a new "rose gold" color option. Besides getting rid of the headphone jack, other changes in the new iPhone device might include more storage (the low-end model may start with 32GB instead of 16GB), a better camera and better water-resistance. Those features may be enough for people to upgrade from a current iPhone and for people who want the newest iPhone. But for others, who now have to buy their phones outright for about $649, or for those who are fine holding on to older models for more than the typical two years, Apple's iPhone 7 may be a tough sell. "We believe the new features...and minor design changes are unlikely to either drive enough existing users to upgrade sooner or attract more switchers than before from Android devices," Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz noted. Apple declined to comment ahead of its event. The iPhone is the most popular device Apple has ever made and remains its biggest moneymaker. Apple gets more than two-thirds of its sales from the iPhone, and in July the company confirmed that it had sold its billionth iPhone since Steve Jobs introduced the gadget to the world in 2007. The device has spawned entire new industries, like apps, and it's changed the way we live. But there are signs the iPhone phenomenon is slowing down. In April, Apple reported its first ever drop in phone sales, and that trend continued the following quarter. People just aren't as excited by phones anymore, and it's unlikely the iPhone 7 will change that. Since Cook took over as CEO five years ago, Apple has spent more research-and-development money on things like the rumored Apple Car; its R&D expense this year should rise nearly 30 percent from 2015, estimates Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart. But based on speculation around the iPhone 7, not much of that R&D has gone into Apple's most important product line, at least not yet. Apple could be saving its biggest changes for 2017 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Even so, Apple watchers wonder just where the iPhone's design can go next. Will the only innovations we'll see going forward involve making the phone faster and more battery efficient? Is there really more Apple can do? "How much can you actually change a design nowadays?" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. "If you look at what is out there, other than taking the TouchID away and making it part of the screen, I don't see what else they can do."  Thinking different Other handset makers have tried to come up with innovative designs. Apple's archrival, Samsung, which builds its phones around Google's Android mobile software, has started using curved glass in its newest designs, giving users an "Edge" where they can read quick notifications. Samsung has said its Edge devices are more popular than its regular phone models, and the Galaxy S7 Edge, launched in March, has helped Samsung widen its lead over Apple in the phone market. (About 22 percent of smartphone shipments in the second quarter came from Samsung, compared with 12 percent for Apple, according to IDC.) Motorola's Moto Z and Moto Z Force phones have two rows of gold pins on the back that let you magnetically connect different back plates, cases or modules. LG has also toyed with the modular phone concept with its G5. It looks like a regular phone until you press a side button to juggle off the bottom of the device and attach other modules, like one that boosts audio and extends battery life. Then there's the crazy Runcible, a circular smartphone designed by Monohm, a company founded by Apple and Sony alums. CNET editor Aloysius Low called it "stunning" and said it "stands out amid a constant drone of rectangular devices." Will a round phone become mainstream? Probably not. But that design is similar to what Apple, Samsung and others are trying to do with their smartwatches. Samsung's new Gear S3, unveiled last week at the IFA electronics show in Berlin, is available in an LTE model so you can use it even when your phone's not around to connect to the internet. Apple, for its part, may unveil the Apple Watch 2 at its September 7 event. It's unlikely the watch will be a standalone version with its own cellular connectivity, even though that's something Apple is reportedly working on for future models. Like the iPhone 7, the Apple Watch isn't expected to have a big design overhaul but just tweaks that make it faster and more useful. With Apple standing still on designs for the past few years, that creates more room for rivals to "think different," a slogan Jobs popularized as part of ad campaigns to convince consumers to buy Apple products as the company was near bankruptcy. The popularity of Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge has shown that people are ready for innovative designs in their phones. Features as seemingly simple as waterproofing have customers raving, like the Galaxy S7 user who survived a shipwreck in the Philippines because of his phone's water resistance. Let's hope the most noticeable difference in the iPhone 7 isn't a new glossy black option. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Done Editing Tags 162 Comments Share this article 28 28 28 The Apple invite went out on Monday, August 29, to registered customers. Just about every media outlet on the planet is reporting that Apple will unveil the latest in its series of popular smartphones next week. And while the tech giant refuses to confirm specifics, there seem to be some details tech writers are converging on. For starters the date and name: Apple sent out an invite on Monday saying a keynote will be held in San Francisco on Wednesday, Sept. 7, a date which some have interpreted as tacit admission a new device will be released that day called the iPhone 7. We now go to people smarter than me: This'll be the fifth year straight that Apple has held an early September event to announce new products. As usual, one of those should be the next iPhone. This new generation is believed to be extremely similar to last year's model, with only minor visual differences — such as fewer antenna lines — and one big drawback: the removal of its headphone jack. Not everyone is happy about the missing headphone jack, assuming that turns out to be accurate. But leaving it out helps make the phone more water resistant and slimmer. Some industry watchers are saying Apple will include a pair of wireless ear-buds already sync’d to the phone, and that there might be a wireless headphone adapter for those with older sets. Forbes has a headline up saying they have confirmed some of this. But it’s mostly speculation on the nitty-gritty, including a new type of virtual home button and a dual camera system to capture crisp shots in all kinds of lighting conditions. We might also hear about a new Mac or Macs of some kind, possibly a new iWatch, and new OS’s all around. Much of which is overdue according to some analysts. Beyond that, my calls to Apple HQ in Cupertino, California, asking for details were met only with uproarious laughter and not much else. 162 Comments Share this article 28 28 28 162 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

The iPhone/Apple Watch payment system is already easy to use. But it won't become a daily habit until it's available everywhere. [Photo: courtesy of Apple] Ruth Reader 09.03.16 6:00 AM Apple Pay is nearing its second birthday, and mobile payments are far from ubiquitous. The credit-card replacement, which lets you use an iPhone or Apple Watch to pay at retail stores, only touts a user base numbering in the "tens of millions," according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Meanwhile, a survey from 2015 indicates that among a pool of 500 Americans, 42% prefer to pay for in-store purchases with a debit card; another 38% are more likely to reach for a credit card. Extrapolated out, that means some 256 million Americans were using plastic at the register last year. Meanwhile, Nilson reports there were 9.49 billion credit, debit, and pre-paid cards in circulation globally in 2014. Apple has focused on partnering with banks and big-name merchants in an effort to make Apple Pay accepted in a wide spectrum of locations. Storefronts include Crate & Barrel, Whole Foods, Macy’s, Walgreens, and scads of other places that represent regular shopping choices for average Americans. In total, Apple Pay is accepted at three million locations in the U.S.—a big jump from just 200,000 locations at launch in 2014. But while payment services like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and PayPal provide a good user experience, none of them are universally accepted. Given the current environment, what would it take for people to ditch plastic for mobile? The key to getting mobile payments to take off in the U.S. may be a matter of focusing on two daily activities: eating and going places. Dining Out Right now, while a growing number of retail outlets large and small accept mobile payment methods, mobile payments for restaurants are still in their infancy. That’s not to say there isn’t interesting activity going on. Quick-service joints like Chipotle, Starbucks, McDonald’s, and Burger King have created their own mobile apps geared toward rewarding repeat customers with payments built in. This same approach has been so successful for healthy salad shop Sweetgreen that the company is currently beta-testing cashless stores. Quite a few of these apps allow customers to hook up their Apple Pay account to the app, rather than having to input credit card information. But Apple Pay is also forging ahead in quick-service restaurants as a payment method in its own right. It lists McDonald’s, Panera, Dunkin Donuts, Subway, and Peet’s Coffee among stores that accept Apple Pay. Others like Johnny Rockets, Au Bon Pain, Baskin Robbins, and Chick-fil-A are said to be coming soon. This a good start, but in order for people to stop reaching for their wallets, Apple Pay really needs to be accepted broadly in all restaurants. That’s difficult, because restaurants that want to push their own loyalty apps may not be keen to accept Apple Pay. However, people aren't going to download an app for every restaurant they dine at. That’s why startups like Velocity, PaidEasy, and TabbedOut have created mobile apps that let diners pay for dinner with their phone at a variety of restaurants. But with a plethora of payment apps knocking at their doors, restaurant owners might be feeling the onset of fatigue around mobile payments. And a restaurant-specific payments app is another app that no one wants to download, especially because none of these apps has access to all restaurants. This is why much of Apple’s recent focus is on its partnership with OpenTable, the reservation-making app with 37,000 restaurants on its platform. The company began testing mobile payments in 2014. However, so far, it hasn’t made much headway. Earlier this year, the company told me that roughly 450 restaurants are hooked into its payment method, 100 of which are in New York. Meanwhile, getting customers set up with OpenTable payments isn't exactly easy. Users have to navigate into their profile, and then their settings, to open payment settings and turn on Apple Pay. Once that’s configured, there’s no way to tell which restaurants allow OpenTable as a payment method. So while partnering with apps might seem promising, it's not necessarily the best way to work mobile payments into restaurants. In other parts of the world where mobile payments are more common, restaurants have changed their point-of-sale technology to accommodate digital payments. Restaurants in Europe have been bringing cordless payments terminals tableside for decades, while those in the U.S. have largely skipped out on this movement. That could in part be because Europe long ago switched over to using chip-based credit cards requiring a PIN number (no one is about to hand over both their credit card and their PIN to a server). The U.S. has been slower to adopt this technology. In the last year, credit card companies pushed merchants to accept chip cards by refusing to accept liability for fraudulent purchases made on point of sale systems that didn't accept them. This change to chip cards could have ushered in a new era where restaurants accept credit cards or mobile phones at the table, rather than forcing servers to scurry off to some dark corner to process the bill. But alas, chip cards in the U.S. only require a signature, not a PIN code, which means there’s no impetus for investing in wireless terminals that might also accept Apple Pay. People can still sign for their bill at the table. Transportation Another factor that would help mobile payments take off is if you could use them to pay for more modes of travel. Already in London, iPhone owners can use Apple Pay to purchase fares on the tube. This functionality hasn’t yet come to the U.S., though the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is planning to allow customers to start buying tickets with Apple Pay in September, according to Boston Business Journal. New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority also released a bid for proposals to incorporate mobile payments into the subway system this year, though the contract allows for a 69-month long implementation. Even if everything runs according to schedule—unlikely given the MTA’s track record with construction—payments won’t hit turnstiles for at least six years. In the meantime, Apple is looking at other modes of transportation where digital payments can make headway. Ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft already accept Apple Pay, but there’s still room to grow in the field of car travel. In March, Exxon Mobil integrated Apple Pay into its Speedpass+ app, so iPhone users could pay for gas and car washes with Apple Pay at 6,100 locations. Legacy systems have a way of lingering. While refueling is something all drivers must do, it’s not a daily activity (I hope not, for your sake anyway). A more likely daily expense is parking. To that end, there are apps that connect drivers with parking garage spots, including SpotHero and Parking Panda. PaybyPhone, an app that lets people pay for metered parking, also accepts Apple Pay. But again, more is more when it comes to mobile payments. That means that every gas station a driver pulls up to has to accept mobile payments in order for people to make the behavioral jump. The same goes for parking or any other daily purchase. If a consumer has to think about using Apple Pay versus plastic, mobile payments will never break into the public consciousness. How long could all this take? A very long time—even with the given pace of innovation. Legacy systems have a way of lingering, and new systems for restaurants, public transit systems, and gas stations are likely to roll out slowly. In the meantime, the next big step for Apple Pay becoming more widely accepted will be building it into Apple's own browser. The company's new versions of iOS and macOS, available soon, will let online merchants accept the payment system inside Safari. So even if Apple Pay is nowhere near being available at every store and restaurant, it will soon span multiple platforms: at brick-and-mortar establishments, in apps, and on the web.

Apple will attempt to reboot sales of the iPhone this week after an unprecedented recent decline that has left the tech giant grappling with falling revenue for the first time in over a decade. The company is seeking to entice consumers with a new version of the popular device that features a high-powered camera as its key selling point amid fears that the smartphone market has reached saturation. The iPhone 7 is unlikely to come with the radical design changes that have defined the handset since Steve Jobs shook up the telecoms world with the first model almost a decade ago. Instead, Apple will make several tweaks to the phone that it hopes will maintain the company’s reputation for invention when it is unveiled in San Francisco on Wednesday, less than one week after a long-running tax row with Brussels erupted into a public war of words after the European Commission ordered Ireland to recoup €13bn (£11bn) in taxes from the company . Apple, which last month marked five years since chief executive Tim Cook replaced Mr Jobs, is struggling to stem the rare slide in revenue, with the sale of new products such as last year’s Apple Watch. Its share price has fallen by a fifth since its peak in 2015. The iPhone 7 is expected to include a new “dual-lens” camera system capable of taking photographs that can rival those of high-end cameras, and the removal of the traditional headphone port in favour of wireless headphones . The company is aiming to encourage regular upgrades of its phones as well as focus on making more from the more than one billion devices running its software by selling services such as music subscriptions and online storage as well as peripherals such as the Apple Watch and headphones. “I think you’ll see more focus on the software and services; they need to take their loyal user base and drive revenue in different places,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight. Mr Wood said that Wednesday’s event could include a heavy focus on music, with the removal of the headphone jack – a staple of the iPhone since it was first launched – being used as an opportunity to sell higher-margin headphones and a more expensive high-quality version of its Apple Music streaming service. Apple’s $3bn (£2.3bn) purchase of Beats, the headphones and music streaming company founded by rapper Dr Dre, in 2014 has so far been used mainly as a springboard for Apple Music, with Apple’s glitzy launch events featuring little mention of the high-end headphones division, but analysts believe there could be potential for greater cross-selling. “You can almost guarantee they’ll introduce a portfolio of headphones for the new [iPhone] experience,” Mr Wood said. This week, Mr Cook is also expected to unveil a new version of the Apple Watch with a faster processor and location technology. Although the device has outsold its competition since it was released last year, sales have still been muted in comparison to those of Apple’s other hit products. Apple has not revealed how many Apple Watches it has sold to date, but analysts pin the figure at around 15m – roughly the number of iPhones sold in a month.

Ireland is the third party, but our government has done something quite remarkable in response, which deserves greater comment than has been made in recent days: Ireland has aligned itself firmly with Apple, even though we are a member state of the European Union that the commission represents. It’s almost ironic that a country that proudly declares its military neutrality has picked one side so firmly in what is effectively an economic war – and, in doing so, has picked the side of which it is not part.

It was 60 seconds that encapsulated how Apple viewed itself then - and now: the plucky outsider sticking it to the Man. On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook tried a similar tactic, only this time it wasn't IBM that was in his sights, but the European Commission. Margrethe Vestager's decision to force Apple to pay Ireland €13bn in unpaid taxes was strongly criticised by Cook, whose open letter suggested "the European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process". He was in a similarly combative mood in an interview with the Irish Independent's technology editor, Adrian Weckler, on Thursday when he dismissed the Commission's ruling as "total political crap". But efforts to portray the brand as the underdog failed abysmally according to Cult of Mac, an Apple-obsessed website with 765,000 Twitter followers. "While railing against the EU's massive assessment of €13bn in back taxes owed by Apple," the site notes, "Cook ignores the facts of the matter - and seems tone-deaf about painting the world's biggest company as an underdog. "The discrepancy between what Apple pays and what smaller companies must pay is the big story here - not the way Cook frames it, as plucky underdogs Apple and Ireland against the monstrous European Commission. EU member states are compelled by law to follow approved taxation laws. Turning this into a story about Ireland's place in the EU is sleight of hand on a grand level." Apple's estimated $200bn cash reserve means it can comfortably afford to meet the EU's demand, but what about the impact such a ruling will have on its brand and that carefully nurtured outsider image? Michael Cullen, editor of Marketing magazine, believes it's bound to cause damage. "It's likely that this story will rumble on and on," he says. "Any appeal taken by Ireland and Apple could take years and that's a lot of time for the company to be in the news for the wrong reasons." Cook, who become CEO in 2011 following the death of founder Steve Jobs, will be hoping that next week's launch of the new iPhone 7 will generate the sort of positive publicity the company has long been used to. Yet, with most of the expected new features already leaked - not least the removal of the headphone jack - there's something of an air of ennui. "Apple launches don't attract quite the sort of excitement they used to," Cullen says, "and many of those who admire the company might feel that it's been a while since they introduced something completely new rather than simply improve on the products they already have." The iPhone is the firm's most important product in sales terms - accounting for almost two thirds of its revenue - and it's rumoured that it will be thoroughly reinvented next year in time for its 10th anniversary (it was released in 2007 in the US, and the following year in this country). With that in mind, some would-be buyers of the iPhone 7 may hold off upgrading. There's already plenty of evidence that customers hang on to their existing phones longer than Apple might like. The most recent sales figures make for stark reading for bigwigs at Apple's HQ in Cupertino, California. In the second quarter of this year, Apple reported that the company's iPhone sales slowed for the first time ever since the product's launch - down 16.3pc (from 61.17 million units sold in Q2 2015 to 51.19 million in Q2 2016). As a result, Apple also reported a quarterly sales decline for the first time since 2003. "There's no doubt about it; Apple's iPhone business is in a slump," noted America's leading business magazine, Forbes, in June. "Although Apple is still the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, Wall Street has soured on the company as its main growth engine slows. Apple's stock is trading down more than 20pc over the past 12 months. The real question is whether the slowing growth signals a sustained decline in iPhone sales or only a temporary setback for the company." It's not the only setback the company has faced. Its heavily hyped smart-watch has largely failed to excite since its launch in April last year, with sales far lower than originally projected. US-based business magazine Quartz gave the product a withering appraisal on its first anniversary. Writer Mike Murphy noted: "I wear it every day, possibly out of determination to get something out of the $400 I spent on it, but when someone asks me if I think they should buy one, I usually tell them no." It was Apple's first entirely new product in five years -the first since the death of Steve Jobs and the first to be entirely conceived and developed under Cook's tenure. That it has failed to connect in the way the iPod or the iPad did is likely to have been a major disappointed to Cook while also giving fuel to the fire of those who feel the company desperately misses the messianic zeal of Steve Jobs. As Walter Isaacson's award-winning biography demonstrates, Jobs was an obsessive perfectionist who demanded everything of his staff. He worked out early on that in order to survive and thrive in Silicon Valley one needed to innovate constantly - to merely rest on laurels was verboten. He was also a brilliant marketeer who had a genius for grasping the emotional pull of his products. A feature-length documentary from earlier this year, The Man in the Machine, made by the respected filmmaker Alex Gibney, zeroed in on Jobs' unerring ability to arouse passions whenever he was launching a new product - whether that was the Macintosh in 1984 or the iPod in 2001. He was so gifted at talking his 'babies' up that it became common for Apple's most ardent fans to queue overnight in order to be among the first to own such and such a product. "I do think a revision is overdue," Gibney said at the time of the film's release. "And I think also we're beginning to understand partially as a result of what we're seeing with Facebook and also Google - but also with Apple - that these companies have enormous power over our lives. They exert enormous influence, and I think we're beginning to reckon with the idea that it may not all be that good and we better understand what they're about. That we've bought into a kind of myth that they're automatically all good and that's not necessarily so. "We're all a little bit less innocent. I did intuit the idea that somehow by using Apple products I was sticking it to the Man, without realising I was working for the Man. And so I think I've come to view the products themselves differently." While Apple was seen as the innovative upstart in the late '70s and the brave challenger in the 1980s, it had a rough 1990s following Jobs's forced departure at the hands of the Apple board. His return in 1997 - facilitated by Apple's acquisition of the NeXT computer firm, of which Jobs was a founder - immediately helped turn its fortunes around and for the best part of a decade between the iPod launch in 2001 and the unveiling of the iPad in 2010, the company could hardly put a foot wrong. But there were rumblings of discontent about the way the company operated, particularly when it came to labour practices in Foxxconn, the giant Chinese firm that makes most of its products. The revelation that it had been compelled to erect safety nets around the perimeter of its factory in order to put a halt to the spate of suicides caused by desperate staff jumping to their deaths caused shock-waves around the world. There have been other threats too, especially from rival firms whose game has been upped significantly. While the iPhone felt ahead of the pack in 1997, challengers like Samsung are now delivering handsets that are routinely cited as being comfortably the match of the latest iPhone, if not better for certain features. Despite its troubles, the brand is still seen as aspirational according to Michael Cullen and that appears to be borne out in the annual CoolBrands survey conducted by a UK ad agency: it's been number one for four consecutive years, ahead of the likes of Ray Ban, Sonos and Spotify. The price point of its products - from its MacBooks to iPad Pros - reinforces that aspirational ideal and the firm appears to be content to ignore a mass market by offering more ­affordable devices. It's little ­wonder, then, that Apple's iOS ­operating ­system accounts for just 20pc of the global market. Android is so far ahead that its lead looks unassailable. It will be intriguing to see if Cook tackles the EU head-on at Apple's launch day on Wednesday, or if he will let the new iPhone and the much trumpeted iOS 10 do the talking. One thing is for sure, Apple appear up for the fight - that's been the case since Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak founded the company 40 years ago. THE WOMAN WHO TOOK A BITE OUT OF APPLE She was the inspiration behind Borgen - the cult Danish political TV drama -  but this week Margrethe Vestager (48) became famous in her own right when she delivered the Europe Commission's verdict on Apple's fast and loose tax arrangements with Ireland. The EU Competition Commissioner ordered Apple to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to €13bn - plus expenses - in a verdict that shook the financial world and drew a shaky Irish Government into a fresh crisis. In Borgen the main character is Birgitte Nyborg, a feminist leader of a political party who finds herself becoming Prime Minister of Denmark. Nyborg actress Sidse Babett Knudsen reportedly spent a few days shadowing Vestager before she began shooting the drama. Vestager, the mother-of-three daughters, served as an MP from 2001 until 2014, representing the Social Liberals. As Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Minister she rode her bicycle to meet the Danish Queen. She was regarded by political commentators media as the most powerful person in government. But this weekend her influence is global.

Here's what investors need to know about the device's possible launch. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Sep 3, 2016 at 5:35PM Another product expected to make its debut alongside Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) rumored iPhone 7 at the tech giant's product launch event on Wednesday is the Apple Watch 2. Though a Wednesday unveiling for the device is less certain than the closely followed iPhone, recent purported leaks about a new version of the Apple Watch support the possibility of a launch and provide some hints about what changes the new version may feature. Apple Watch. Image source: Apple. Leaks Little is known about Apple's next version of its Apple Watch. While Apple teased its newest operating system for the device, WatchOS 2, this summer at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, the company didn't specify any features that would be unique to its next version of the watch or even say when a new hardware would be unveiled. In addition, Apple Watch leaks are simply hard to come by, since the device ships in much smaller volumes than the iPhone. This means the company can more easily keep product leaks under wrap. Of course, Apple's sprawling global supply chain makes it nearly impossible for at least some leaks not to slip. And this is what has happened with Apple Watch 2 just about a week before the device's expected unveiling. As MacRumors reported on Sept. 1, a British Apple-certified accessory and repair reseller for iOS devices, Byte, recently posted new photos and a video of what looks to be Apple Watch 2 parts. Based on the photos, the device looks as if it will feature thinner display technology and a 35.7% larger battery than the original Apple Watch battery. Beyond these purported hardware leaks, the Apple rumor pros over at MacRumors expect Apple Watch 2 to include a GPS, a faster processor, and improved water resistance. But changes to the watch's exterior are unlikely, according to MacRumors. Why a Wednesday unveiling is likely While the ever-active Apple rumor mill doesn't seem certain that Apple Watch will make its debut on Wednesday, the best reason it could is simply that the device is due for an update. Apple CEO Tim Cook at an Apple product event. Image source: Apple. The first version of the Apple Watch was first unveiled in September 2014. Deliveries of the device, however, didn't begin until April last year. This puts Apple at well over a year since its last Apple Watch hardware update -- a long product cycle for a new Apple product. The iPhone, for instance, is consistently refreshed every year; and the company even introduced a new, lower-priced iPhone midway through its annual cycle earlier this year. The Apple Watch serves an interesting role in Apple's business. Probably accounting for about 2% to 3% of the company's revenue, the device won't do much either way for Apple's overall business. But that doesn't mean investors should forget about the segment. Investors are looking to see whether the company can grow its newest product category to meaningful levels in the same way it did with the iPad, which now represents 11.5% of the company's total revenue. If Apple Watch sales -- or at least a broader wearable segment if Apple chooses to launch more wearable technology in the future -- can grow to around 10% or more of revenue, the new category could both help Apple grow its business and diversify its hardware offerings.

However, this move is for a good cause, since this could prevent overheating and power consumption issues.  When it comes to the camera systems of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, the former will sport a standard version of the back camera found in its predecessor, while the latter is rumored to rock a dual-lens camera module that will possibly make the larger variant cost more than the 6s Plus when the latter debuted. The lenses of the module are said to be 12-megapixel, and one will cater to the wide-camera angle technology the device will offer.  In relation to the camera systems of the new iPhones, Kuo revealed that their rear camera flash could be upgraded with four LEDs and the possible addition of a new ambient light sensor. These upgrades would enable users to capture superb quality images.  In terms of the enhancements to their bodies, MacRumors has learned that Apple has enhanced the devices’ form factor by improving their IPX7 water resistance property. Now, users will not have to worry about accidentally dipping their handsets in water or accidentally spilling liquids on them. Related Stories Apple Releasing Three Beats Headpones For iPhone 7, 7 Plus? Will The iPhone 7 Include Wireless AirPods? Another new feature that the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will be sporting is the new audio amplifier that has been added to the handsets in lieu of putting a second speaker at the bottom now that the 3.5mm headphone jack is gone, as per a recent Apple Insider report. Other upgrades fans can expect to see when the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus make their official debut include the wide color displays that are inspired by the wide color technology of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a more pressure-sensitive Home button and improved proximity sensors.  Kuo’s revelations come a day after Apple Insider reported about leaked images of the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus packaging that appear to confirm the rumored 256GB storage variant and the inclusion of bundled wireless earphones, called AirPods.  Meanwhile, a simple mistake by the Apple PR team has outed the inclusion of Beats by Dre headphones for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to the slew of new products the Cupertino giant is going to showcase during its Sept. 7 event.  Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Tuesday, July 24, 2012 - 02:00 July 24 - Apple has become the most valuable company in the world- but its true worth is a matter of debate ahead of the expected release of its next iPhone. Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Everyone wants to bet on the winner- and the easy pick has been Apple. It is- literally- the world's most valuable company. But can it continue to win when it's being chased by a field of competitors like Google and Microsoft? Yes- says Thomson Reuters Analyst Jharrone Martis: SOUNDBITE: JHARRONE MARTIS, ANALYST, THOMSON REUTERS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "It should be trading $300 higher at about $900 a share. Market expectations are still considered very low. The price of the stock has not grown as fast as Apple's bottom line." Apple stock puts the S&P 500 to shame- up 78 percent in the last 18 months... compared to just a 4 percent rise for the broad based index. But wait- options volume is on the rise- up 50 percent this year, in part because uncertainty about Apple has increased. And Apple stock is off its all time high of $644 hit in April. If the huge growth Apple has had in recent years takes a break- some analysts say volatility in Apple's stock price will rise- because hedge funds will likely rush to exit their stock positions- and lock in their gains. REPORTER BRIDGE: BOBBI REBELL, REUTERS REPORTER (ENGLISH) SAYING: The product to watch- The iPhone. The five-year old device accounts for close to half of Apple's revenues- but sales have slowed while consumers wait for the iPhone 5. But that could be just a pause, on the way to an even higher climb for the stock. SOUNDBITE: JHARRONE MARTIS, ANALYST, THOMSON REUTERS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "The stock is considered a buy usually in the weeks leading up to the introduction of a new product and we could see a new iPhone 5 as early as October." Just in time for the holidays. Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S says Apple could pull in $55 billion in revenues in December- the size of the economy of Belarus according to the International Monetary Fund.

Whether you use Apple's iCloud, Google's Gmail, Microsoft's Outlook or Exchange, or something else, it's easy to set up all your mail, contacts, and calendar accounts to sync to your iPhone or iPad. You can enable iCloud when you first set up your new iPhone or iPad, or enable any service at any time in Settings. Here's how! How to set up iCloud mail, contacts, and calendars on your iPhone or iPad How to set up Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts on your iPhone or iPad How to set up Google Sync on iPhone and iPad How to add Outlook mail, calendar, contacts on your iPhone or iPad How to set up Exchange mail, calendar, and contacts on your iPhone or iPad How to set up IMAP/POP, CalDAV, CardDAV on your iPhone or iPad How to set up iCloud mail, contacts, and calendars on your iPhone or iPad Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad. Tap iCloud. Enter your iCloud email and password and tap Sign In. Tap Merge if you'd like all of your data to merge with your iCloud storage. Otherwise, tap Don't Merge. Tap the switches next to the services and apps you want to sync with your iPhone or iPad. By default, most, if not all, of iCloud's services are turned on. How to set up Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts on your iPhone or iPad If you want to add your Google account to your iPhone or iPad's system apps, you'll want to go to Settings > Mail or Calendar or Contacts. Under the hood, Apple is using the open standard IMAP, CalDAV, and CardDAV services to handle syncing Google services; unfortunately, Gmail retro-fitted support for IMAP, and it can be quirky at times—especially if you like Gmail's labeling system. If you want to use the built-in iOS Mail app and its unified inbox, however, and you don't have a paid account, it's your only option. Launch the Settings app from your Home screen. Tap on Mail, Contacts, or Calendar. Tap Accounts. Tap on Add Account. Tap on Google. Enter your login information for your Google account and tap Next after each step. Tap the switch next to each Google service you'd like to sync. If you have existing local mail, calendars, contacts, or notes, you'll have to either tap Keep on My Phone or Delete each time you enable a service. Tap Save in the top right corner of your screen. After you save your account, you can access your settings at any time by tapping the Gmail entry under the Accounts header. If you'd like to change the description from "Gmail" to something more apt, tap the Account button, then tap the Description field. You can also choose to run Google's services in Google's own iOS apps. Gmail - Download now Google Calendar - Download now Other Google apps - Download now How to set up Google Sync on your iPhone or iPad The Google Sync setup is nearly identical to Exchange: You just need to have a paid Google account and enter the following settings. Launch the Settings app from your Home screen. Tap Calendar. Tap Accounts. Tap Add Account. Tap Exchange. Enter your Gmail or Google Account email and password (the description field will automatically update as your email address). Tap on Next. Enter m.google.com as the Server. Leave the Domain field blank. Enter your full Gmail or Google Account email address as the Username. (Yup, just like above.) Tap on Next. Tap the switches next to each service's account that you'd like to sync with your phone. If you have existing calendars, contacts, or mail on your iPhone, you'll be asked to either keep them on your phone or delete them. Tap the option you want. Tap on Save. Success! Your Gmail calendar will now sync with your Calendar app on your iPhone, so any existing or new events made in your Google account or on your iPhone will be visible and updated in both. How to set up Outlook mail, calendar, contacts on your iPhone or iPad If Microsoft Outlook.com — Live or Hotmail if you're retro — is your mail, contacts, and calendar provider of choice, it's easy to set up and access it right on your iPhone or iPad. Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad. Tap on Mail , Contacts, or Calendar. Tap Accounts. Tap on Add Account. Tap on Outlook.com. Enter your Outlook.com username and password and tap Sign in. Tap Yes to allow Outlook to access your information. Tap the switch next to each service you'd like to enable. If you have existing calendars, mail, or contacts on your iPhone, you will be asked if you want to keep them on your phone or delete them. Tap the option you want. Tap on Save in the upper right hand corner. And you're done! You will now get all of your mail from your Microsoft email service to your iPhone or iPad's unified mail inbox. You can also set up Outlook.com as an Exchange account. Just follow the same steps above but choose the Exchange option for account type and use m.hotmail.com as your server. You can also access Outlook on Microsoft's dedicated Outlook app for iOS; Outlook - Download now How to set up Exchange mail, calendar, and contacts on your iPhone and iPad Exchange is Microsoft's corporate email, calendar, and contact service, built on top of the company's lightning-fast ActiveSync protocol. Many companies use Exchange for their email services; if yours happens to be one of them, we've got the guide to help you set it up on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. No matter whether you use Exchange via Microsoft, Google, your company, or a third-party service, it's all set up the same way: All you need to know are your credentials. Launch the Settings app from your Home screen. Tap Mail, Contacts, or Calendar. Tap Accounts Tap Add Account. Tap Exchange. Enter the username and password for the account you want to sync. Tap Next. Enter your Exchange ActiveSync account settings (see your IT administrator or service provider if you don't know them). Tap Next. Tap the switch next to the Exchange services you want to sync. If you have existing calendars, mail, or contacts on your iPhone, you will be asked if you want to keep them on your phone or delete them. Tap the option you want. Tap on the save button in the top right corner. You can go back to Settings and configure how many days of mail you want to sync, along with advanced settings like SSL and S/MIME as well. How to set up IMAP/POP, CalDAV, or CardDAV on iPhone or iPad If you're not using a major online service provider, you can still set up and use any standards-based email, calendar, and/or contacts service you like, including your own! Launch the Settings app from your Home screen. Tap Mail, Contacts, or Calendar. Tap Accounts. Tap Add Account. Tap Other. Select the account you wish to configure. Enter in your service information. If you don't know it off-hand, you'll need to get it from a system administrator or whomever runs your IMAP/PPO, CalDAV, and/or CardDAV account. Tap the Next button in the upper right hand corner, and your device will verify the account. If everything looks right, tap on Done. Your account will now start syncing with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. iOS iOS 10 Review iOS 10 FAQ iOS 10 News Hub iOS help guide iOS Discussion Like us!

By Rene Ritchie, Daniel Bader Friday, Sep 2, 2016 at 3:30 pm EDT 14 Comments "Movie time." Siri, Apple's personal digital assistant blinks into action. The blinds go down. The lights dim. Your home theater system pulses to life. What we're witnessing, aside from a friend showing off his hotly connected new digs, is a demonstration of Apple's HomeKit in action. Originally announced in 2014, HomeKit is now mature and ready for the mainstream. And if we're any indication, it's going to flood the holiday gift lists. The story of Home When HomeKit first shipped, it did so without an app. It also did so without a vast collection of accessories to work with. Apple was taking a gamble: The company believed that if it provided a way to securely, privately, and easily get all the disparate home automation products working together, the industry would follow and customers would be, well, delighted. The first step was updating everything. Many home automation products originally shipped without the ability to secure their connections. That meant using them opened up home networks to hacking. It's annoying if someone takes over your lights and makes them blink. It's a showstopper if someone opens your locks or garage door, or uses your smart plug to gain access to the private files on your computer. So, a lot of products had to be reengineered and relaunched using secure chips, and that took a while. Over a year. A unified app took longer still. By 2015, HomeKit accessories were starting to ship, and the ability to control them with Siri and from iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch was already compelling. The only problem was setup. Each vendor wanted their own app and handled adding and managing accessories in a different way. iOS 9 had brought even more sophisticated automation, including the ability to set triggers and create scenes, but actually doing it wasn't easy or intuitive. Some App Store apps popped up to fill the gap, but there simply wasn't a Home app from Apple to go with HomeKit the way there was a Health app to go with HealthKit. Until now. With iOS 10 comes Apple's own Home app, and it's been designed and built to make home automation accessible to the mainstream. It uses the new big, bright, and beautiful design language Apple is debuting for Music and News, but in a way that's specific to the home. You can add wallpapers to make your rooms immediately, personally identifiable. You can see all your favorite accessories in your home at a glance. You can dive into individual rooms. You can even quickly, easily set up automations based on location change, time of day, the state of other accessories changing, or sensors detecting activity of some kind. Home is even integrated into a new card in Control Center. So, you don't even have to go to the app to get to your favorite accessories. You can swipe up, toggle them, and change things like lighting intensity and color, for example, from anywhere, at any time. That includes from the Lock screen — with one major exception. You need to authenticate with Touch ID or Passcode before you can control any lock, garage door, or similar accessory. Again, if you drop your phone and someone can turn your fan on or off, it's annoying. If you drop your phone and someone can use it to get into your house, it's dangerous. HomeKit, no matter its many new conveniences, remains security-first. So, while it might have taken a while to get here, Home represents a mature, mainstream implementation of a unified interface for connected accessories. And the first one with the type of deep integration only a platform-maker can provide. And it pairs products from companies that may never have cooperated on their own. It's the type of real, practical innovation we wish we saw more often. From the living room to the hotel room The other piece in the rapidly completing HomeKit puzzle is the new Apple TV. Launched last fall with the upcoming tvOS update, it not only lets you use your Siri remote to control HomeKit itself it also serves as a remote hub for your iPhone or iPad. That means, if you're sitting on your sofa, about to watch Game of Thrones, you can simply hold down the Siri button and say "Red Time" to have your blinds close, the fan spin to a stop, the thermostat drop to a hair-raising chill, and lights turn to blood, and not have to reach for a device in your pocket, on the table, or across the room. Since the Siri remote can't authenticate, it can't control locks or doors for the same security reasons mentioned above, but it can do everything else. It can also let your iPhone and iPad do anything from everywhere else. That includes pausing only a moment at the airport to say "Goodnight, Siri", to make sure every connected light is off and lock is secure, to opening a door for family from across the globe. It's also that remote access that makes security so comforting. A connected door bell or front door lock is useful on its own, but when paired with a host of other accessories they become exponentially more powerful. Because your iPhone knows where you are, and can talk to your HomeKit-connected devices, the lights can be on in the front hall by the time you get home (with some music playing in the background, ideally). But that connected doorbell can also send you a rich notification, with a high-resolution screenshot, whenever someone presses it. You can be half way around the world, or sitting on your couch at home, and know exactly what's going on outside your front door. Since both of us have HomeKit accessories already, and are running the latest beta software, we were able to try it while traveling. The reactions back at home quickly ranged from laughter to "cut it out!" — but everyone was delighted. What's next Between us, we have connected lights and plugs, locks and thermostats, and more on the way. There's an ever-growing list of HomeKit-compatible accessories already on the market. What's next is even more exciting. Builders are starting to integrate HomeKit into new construction projects. Just like wiring the home for ethernet or fiber used to be the cutting edge of construction, now that HomeKit compatibility badge is being seen as a competitive advantage. If you're looking for a new place to buy or to rent, why not look for one that's designed to work with the phone in your pocket or the tablet on your table? Our colleague, Serenity Caldwell has just picked up the new HomeKit-enabled Hunter ceiling fan and installing it is her next big project. Our other colleague, Georgia Dow, is looking into HomeKit-enabled security systems. We're all in the process of automating everything, and we're doing it because HomeKit has made it not only secure but easy. iOS 10 and the new Home app ship this fall, and it's clearer than ever that the first big wave of mainstream home automation adoption will follow. iOS iOS 10 Review iOS 10 FAQ iOS 10 News Hub iOS help guide iOS Discussion Like us!

I find myself not using vendor supplied apps anymore (only for initial setup). That said, the integration is not without issues. Using Home app to interact with HomeKit devices are often much slower (most likely because the interaction is relayed to Apple TV or iPad that is used as a hub) and Home app does not sync all the data, such as wallpaper. Still, all in all, iOS 10 finally makes HomeKit more powerful. 0 4 months ago Reply BuhBob My wishlist includes a HomeKit capable Z-Wave controller! 1 4 months ago Reply Timbo8000 It's worth noting that not all types of HomeKit compatible devices are available everywhere. For me, the lack of controllable sockets/plugs in the UK is a real blocker. It seems it's basically bulbs, a thermostat and a few sensors here which can be useful but is very limited.

The last thing I want is to have to have an iOS device on me to be able to turn on the lights. 0 4 months ago Reply iPedro1000 You don't need to. Even though I live alone, whenever I had guests over, they couldn't turn on the lights so it was a problem I needed to solve. Hue has since come out with its own Tap switches and there is a growing number of compatible switches from 3rd parties. So you can have both the convenience of HomeKit and the old fashioned, but still desirable tactile experience of physical switches. I don't think of lights as individual lightbulbs anymore. I have several scenes that involve multiple bulbs and now with HomeKit, multiple devices. Arriving home, I don't just turn on the light immediately in front of me. As I walk up to my door, it unlocks and my home comes to life.. The floor lights turn on, forming a path into my home, the living room and kitchen lights glow reds and blues, the A/C already saw me coming and has been getting my place to my favourite temperature. When it's time to eat, I either press a Hue Tap or say "Hey Siri, set the scene for dinner" and all of my lights dim to blues except for the ones pointing at my table, which now glow white. I have Tap switches spread around where one is always within reach and controls scenes pertinent to that area. If it's easier to just hit a switch, I do. But often, it's just as easy to raise my wrist and tell my Apple Watch: Hey Siri, it's movie time! 0 4 months ago Reply eh-up I don't see Home automation as restricted to lights though. My main point is that if I am to control the house via voice then I should be able to just talk to the house rather than get something out of my pocket and press a button first. I"m waiting to see who brings out an Amazon Echo style of device that works with home automation and is available in UK. I'll build my home automation around that. 0 3 months ago Reply iPedro1000 You can. An iPhone or iPad docked somewhere will respond to "Hey Siri". Just now, with my hands full preparing dinner, I called out to Siri: "Hey Siri, it's too cold in here!" and the thermostat raised the target temp. I also use my Apple Watch for this. Walking around the house, I raise my wrist and say: "Dim the hallway lights" or ask: "Is the door locked?". I'm planning to mount one of my iPads into the wall, attached to a ceiling speaker/mic. When that's set up, it'll act like an Amazon Echo, but far more capable I think. Alexa is pretty dumb and only responds to very specifically structured commands. I like how Siri interprets informal language and figures out what to do with it. 0 3 months ago Reply eh-up I basically want a Siri version of the echo. iPhones and iPads in each room seems a bit drastic and these don't have the mic arrays that the echo does. 0 3 months ago Reply captobie When I first saw the headline I was really excited, because I read "The future of HeathKit is now."

These Are the Six Crypto-Currencies Approved by Apple - Rumor GO Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, the DAO and Ripple Sep 4, 2016 00:25 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Anthony Di Iorio, founder of Jaxx, a crypto-currency wallet, claims that an Apple representative revealed to him, during a private phone conversation, the six crypto-currencies allowed on the App Store. Di Iorio says that Apple is comfortable approving apps on its App Store that handle only six crypto-currencies: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, the DAO, and Ripple. An Apple employee supposedly provided the information Di Iorio had this conversation with the Apple employee after the company asked him to remove support for the Dash crypto-currency from his Jaxx app. During the conversation, Di Iorio asked what crypto-currencies Apple approves of so that he'd know what to remove from Jaxx's iOS version and avoid future problems with his app on the App Store. After discovering Apple's crypto-currencies preference, Di Iorio tweeted out the answer he received to the crypto-currency community. Di Iorio said he planned to remove Dash functionality from Jaxx in a future version. The crypto-currency community doesn't like Apple's strict rules Reaction to Apple's list of approved crypto-currencies hasn't been positive, at least on Twitter. Most users have criticized Apple's decision to limit the list to only six, which they consider might thwart the evolution of other, less-known crypto-currencies. Vitalik Buterin, one of the people who built the Ethereum crypto-currency along with Di Iorio, wasn't very happy about Apple's limited list of digital currencies either, even if the currency he created was listed. "For the record: despite being a beneficiary of this instance of (private) regulatory protectionism, I oppose it," Buterin tweeted. Softpedia has reached out to Apple to confirm the information sent out in Di Iorio's tweets. We'd love to hear your opinions. What other crypto-currencies Apple should support? Di Iorio tweets Di Iorio tweets UPDATE: An earlier version of the article said Apple removed Jaxx from the App Store. This was incorrect. Apple only told Di Iorio to remove Dash support.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (3 Images) #Apple#Bitcoin#crypto-currency#Litecoin#Ehereum subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (3 Images) 01 02 03 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Brave Browser Adds Support for Bitcoin Payments to Reward Your Favorite Sites BTC-E Bitcoin Exchange and Popular BitcoinTalk Forum Suffer Data Breaches Bitcoin Website Issues "State-Sponsored Attack" Warning DDoSCoin: New Crypto-Currency Rewards Users for Participating in DDoS Attacks New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" 3 photos    Apple employee reveals the list of approved crypto-currencies New Mac Apps Free Download Manager: Download manager and accelerator that can handle HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent protocols, while also being able to download YouTube content CheckMark Payroll 2017: Enables you to do-it-yourself payrolls and is the ideal solution for accountants, small businesses and professional payroll services.

It's September, and that means it's time for the next iPhone. Last week, Apple sent out invitations to a September 7 event in San Francisco, drumming up excitement with the tagline "See you on the 7th." Some industry watchers think that's a play on words for the expected name of the new iPhone, the "iPhone 7." Apple has reported two straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines and there are questions about demand for a device that remains the company's main source of profit. Apple hopes faster iPhones with significant camera improvements will prop up sales ahead of an expected larger overhaul in 2017 for the device's 10th anniversary. ALSO READ: * iPhone 7: new images show three versions of Apple's upcoming phone * iPhone 7: Why this year's device may be kinda lame * Apple's events are getting as predictable as the company * Apple v USA - what happened? Weibo New images show a dual-camera iPhone 7 Pro, an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPhone 7. It's set to release a faster Apple Watch with GPS to try to re-ignite interest in that nascent category. Here's a breakdown of what to expect at Apple's event from each product line: New iPhone: - A tweaked design that looks similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, but removes the two inner-most antenna lines on the back of the device for a cleaner look. - The same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as the previous two iPhone lines. - A pressure-sensitive Home button that provides a vibrating sensation in response to button presses instead of an actual physical click, similar to the latest MacBook trackpads. - The removal of the headphone jack in favour of a secondary grille for either an additional speaker or microphone. - An improved single-lens rear camera system on the new 4.7-inch model. - A new dual-lens camera system on the 5.5-inch model, allowing for deeper zooming with less reduction in clarity and better low-light photography. - A faster processor, a successor to the A9 chip in the iPhone 6s. - Support for FeliCa-based payments in Japan, in the works for either this year's model or next year's overhaul. New watch: BECK DIEFENBACH/Reuters An Apple iPhone 6S and Apple Watch displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, in 2015. - A GPS chip for more-accurate fitness tracking. - A faster processor for launching applications and navigating the operating system. - Battery-life improvements to support the power-intensive addition of GPS. Software updates: Ad Feedback - iOS 10 will be available on the iPhone 5 from 2012 and later. The updated software includes an improved iMessage application with support for new animations, stickers, and third-party plug-ins, voicemail transcription, notifications that show more detail, and an application for controlling smart home appliances. - watchOS 3, the new version of the Apple Watch's software, speeds up app launch times, includes a new SOS feature to call emergency services, a new app to monitor breathing, and the ability to use Apple Pay within apps. - tvOS 10, the new version of the Apple TV software, is supported by the fourth-generation model (which comes with Siri) and adds the ability to universally sign in to many content apps, a dark mode for navigating through the system at night, and a redesigned view for Apple Music. - macOS Sierra, the latest version of the Mac operating system, adds support for Apple Pay transactions on the web, Siri voice control, new photo-management and messaging features, and the ability for Apple Watch wearers to automatically login to their Macs. - Coming later: One hardware category that may not be discussed in detail on Sept. 7 is the Mac line. However, Apple will begin shipping some of its future Macs as soon as October, according to people familiar with the matter. Here are the details: - An overhauled MacBook Pro with a "Dynamic Function Row" display that allows function keys to change based on the task at hand, a faster processor, new graphics card options from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a larger trackpad, flatter keyboard, and USB-C port technology. - Updated MacBook Air models with multi-functional USB-C port technology. - A faster iMac with new graphics card options from AMD. - A 5K standalone monitor developed in conjunction with LG Electronics Inc.  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: IFA 2016: Sony targets golden ears with gold plated Hi-Res Audio range Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Fear not, droids won't kill jobs World's first Street View skydive McDonald's hungry for NZ tech Google app scans your photo memories Tech you can expect in 2017 Serena arrives with fiance in tow App for checking moles How to prevent ads tracking you Apple dominates holiday activations Avatar-style robot takes first steps Lesser-known tips for iPhones The big tech takeaway for 2016 Mac buyers' battery freak out What to do with your old phone How to save data on holiday Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented 'Disgusted' residents plot to catch boy racers in the act The most deadly stretch of water in the world: Why this burbling English creek has a '100 per cent' fatality rate Grieving father happy his daughter's murderer is dead War on Melbourne's hipsters gets hairier as cafe vandalism turns nasty Woman seriously burned while trying to start her car in Whangarei United Airlines New Year's Day flight diverts to Auckland Lindy Chamberlain's dingo story wasn't believed but she was released anyway Teenager kicked off bus for carrying $20 note Surfer's close shave with huge wave in Portugal Homeless Hamilton couple 'camped by the river to be together' New Zealand's greatest gifts: Doubtful Sound Bach living: A stunning Malborough Sounds bach Bad weather and slow trade as Kaikoura reopens after quake - but it's a start Southland's Brian Cartwright builds Barbarian V8 Softail motorbike Latin McDonald's rollout cheers NZ digital marketing firm Plexure Reserve Bank stress tests show how banks would react to economic armageddon Dog attacks family trying to dress it in Christmas jumper, leaving three injured Knife-wielding thief demands cigarettes in early morning Tahunanui robbery Ditching sugar is a new year diet that might actually work Record-breaking year of earthquakes: 32,828 quakes hit New Zealand in 2016 special offers Ad Feedback National World Business Technology Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Stuff.co.nz About Us | Contact Us | View Mobile Site Subscribe Text | Follow us on Facebook and Twitter | Newspapers | Magazine subscriptions | RSS - Top Stories Services Stuff Fibre | Newspapers in Education | Advertising | Careers Classifieds Death Notices | Celebrations | Newspaper Classifieds Newspapers Dominion Post | The Press | Waikato Times | Auckland Now | Sunday News | Sunday Star-Times   Marlborough Express | Manawatu Standard | Nelson Mail | Southland Times | Taranaki Daily News | Timaru Herald Other Sites Indexed | Essential Mums | Cuisine | NZ House & Garden | NZ Fishing News | NZ Life & Leisure | NZ Gardener | Fairfax Archives Breaking news?

After three years of struggling, Samsung finally climbed back to the top of the tech world in 2016. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge both received fantastic reviews and sales. Then, the Galaxy Note 7 came out and, according to most, exceeded expectations in every way possible. Unfortunately, the Galaxy Note 7 has been recalled. Android Authority has the news. “By now, you’ve probably heard that Samsung is recalling all Galaxy Note 7 units it has shipped so far due to the risk of malfunction and fire. Samsung has come out with an official confirmation today, but the details about the Note 7 recall are still a bit murky.” The Note 7 recall may be bad news for Samsung and Note 7 consumers, but it has become the best thing to happen to Apple in years. As the Inquisitr noted a few months back, the iPhone 7 has caused controversy and has largely been seen as the boring smartphone that will destroy Apple’s reputation even more. Even if the new iPhone is boring, Apple has nothing to worry about. Here are three reasons why the Galaxy Note 7 recall is a win for Apple. Apple Will Use Samsung’s Problems as iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Promotional Tool One doesn’t need to have ESP in order to predict Apple’s next commercial. “The iPhone 7 may not cause miracles to happen but at least it won’t blow up in your face” may be heard in television and internet commercials in the next month or so. And the worst part about it is that Apple wouldn’t be lying. If Apple really wants to get nasty, they can claim that the iPhone 7 helps productivity, while the Galaxy Note 7 can be used as a weapon. However, in today’s politically correct environment, that may not go down too well with some. Apple has a hit with the iPhone 7, regardless of how good or bad it is. [Photo by Ken Ishi /Getty Images] The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Will Sell Regardless of Quality Isn’t it awful that both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus won’t have a headphone jack? After all, the Verge has called Apple downright hostile for this. Based on leaks, the new iPhones won’t be much different from the 2015 versions. This would have been bad news for Apple investors just one week ago. But now, people waiting for the latest and greatest smartphone won’t have much of a choice. Even if the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus aren’t absolutely perfect, they certainly beat buying smartphones that can blow up on you. Besides, even if the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus aren’t complete overhauls, they are offering new stereo speakers, improved cameras, and improved screens, which are enough to satisfy a lot of buyers. Galaxy Note 7 Recall Is Perfect Timing for Apple The Note 7 Recall couldn’t have come at a better time for Apple. A highly suspicious person might even go out of their way to suggest that Apple planted mini explosives in the Note 7 to coincide with Apple’s iPhone event on Wednesday. Now, people who are returning their Note 7 devices have a new phone to pre-order. If Apple releases the new iPhone earlier than expected, they could buy it right away. You just know they are smiling in Cupertino today. However, even though things are bad for Samsung right now, people can’t completely dismiss the Korean company. The Galaxy Note 7 recall may prove what a responsible company Samsung is and make their loyal customers even more loyal. Even if people don’t trust the Galaxy Note 7, they may just go for the Galaxy S7 Edge, which is still a hot item. Still, Samsung has a lot of PR work to do in the days ahead.

So last week’s ruling from the European commission that the Irish government must recoup €13bn (£11bn) in back taxes from Apple should be unreservedly welcomed. Apple, which the European commission revealed paid an effective corporation tax rate of just 0.005% on its European profits in 2014, is far from the only culprit. Amazon paid just £11.9m in tax in the UK by routing its £5.3bn of British sales through its Luxembourg subsidiary. Google similarly paid just £20.4m tax despite UK sales of £3.8bn in 2013. At the root of the problem is the out-of-date international tax system, developed almost a century ago. Over time, it has become increasingly exploited by multinationals to shift profits to tax havens: in 2012, US multinationals shifted more than a quarter of their profits to avoid tax. In the meantime, the share of government revenue from corporation tax has fallen in countries such as the US and the UK. These arrangements may be strictly legal, but they fail basic tests of economic and social justice. The bigger a company, the more aggressive it can be in lobbying tax authorities. In Apple’s case, it struck a deal with the Irish government that allowed it to allocate its European profits to a shell company not registered for tax in any country. This is not only unfair to smaller companies that have to pay tax; it is bad for economic growth, allowing corporate giants to entrench their position, impeding innovation and competition. Tax avoidance breaks a fundamental social contract: companies that draw on public investment in skills and infrastructure to make vast profits should put something back. Why should Amazon make barely any contribution to Treasury coffers while its vans use UK roads and it employs workers whose education was paid for by the British taxpayer? Even worse, these tech giants extract profit without paying tax in some of the world’s poorest countries. The answer ultimately lies in wholesale reform of international tax rules, so that multinationals are obliged to pay tax based on some measure of economic activity in each country, whether sales, employment or assets. But while there have been some fledgling steps in the right direction by the OECD, the body responsible for international tax rules, we remain a long way from such a comprehensive reform. International tax reform remains subject to lobbying by powerful corporate interests, meaning it is proceeding at a glacial pace. The EU has played a more activist role: it was at the forefront of important rule changes that cracked down on global tax avoidance in the late 1990s and the European parliament has consistently pushed for greater transparency. The commission has developed proposals for reforms that would see companies pay tax relative to the level of economic activity in each EU country. Its proposals illustrate how international co-operation can increase a country’s tax sovereignty. By developing international agreement around the principle, companies pay tax on the basis of their economic activity, taxed in a way and at a rate to be determined by national governments; this system avoids countries getting trapped in a race to the bottom on corporation tax. It takes power away from corporations and puts it back in the hands of the nation state. The great irony is that just as the EU is starting to make inroads on this issue, Britain has voted to leave, based on old-fashioned arguments about national sovereignty that make little sense in the modern world. Global challenges such as tax avoidance, climate change and microbial resistance are borderless and cannot be addressed by nations acting alone. In light of this, perhaps it is unsurprising that some of the most vocal proponents of Britain leaving the European Union have argued that the Irish approach of low corporation tax and sweetheart deals could provide a model for the UK economy post-Brexit. Despite George Osborne’s noises about a new “march of the makers”, the Irish approach is a direction in which we have been quietly heading for some time. His time at the Treasury was marked by steady cuts to corporation tax – at great expense – at the same time as the government cut investment allowances and subsidies for R&D. The government has done precious little to pursue tax avoidance domestically and has been a significant block to international tax reform at the OECD and EU. Theresa May and Philip Hammond have done little to signal that they will deviate from this approach. But it is a blind alley for Britain. As Fintan O’Toole argues elsewhere in this newspaper, the Irish approach was a strategy of last resort for a tiny economy in dire straits. It could not work for Britain. No significant economy has achieved growth by slashing corporation tax: countries that have enjoyed the greatest economic success have done so by creating the conditions in which high-growth businesses can flourish, driving innovation and creating jobs. And the world is changing as we move towards greater tax transparency and companies are more aware than ever of the reputational damage of avoiding tax. Moreover, is this really the future we want for British business in a Brexit world? One that is based on attracting corporate giants with accounting fiddles designed to help them cheat not just our near neighbours, but developing countries, out of their fair share of tax. Not to mention cheating Britons and the state by deliberately reducing the amount they pay to the state, money that will be lost to our roads, schools, hospitals. As O’Toole makes clear, in an age of inequality and financial uncertainty, this approach is not tenable. We are witnessing a rise in populist anger precisely because “elites” are seen to be playing by different rules. Fairness is at the heart of a stable society. It is not at the heart of Apple’s tax deal in Ireland.

Follow him on Twitter at @andywest01. SEPTEMBER 4 — There are always, they say, two sides to a story. It’s certainly possible to draw wildly differing conclusions from this week’s news that tech giant Apple has been ordered by the European Commission to pay the Irish government back taxes of 13 billion euros, after being found guilty of consistently avoiding taxes over the last decade. On one side of the coin, it’s quite easy to be outraged by the revelation that a prosperous and democratic government has colluded with one of the world’s best-known and richest companies to dodge enormous sums of taxes. Firstly, we could allege that the Irish government’s policy of attracting investment by offering low tax rates to multinationals is unforgivably unethical. Tackling tax evasion is difficult enough when faraway island states and small principalities such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Luxembourg and Monaco are determined to bolster their riches by acting as tax havens to the global financial elite. In such an awkward climate, which can only be addressed by large organisations such as the European Union taking a unified stance, the last thing that’s needed is one of the EU’s own member states effectively negating all that hard work by turning itself into a tax haven. Apple can also be easily condemned for sullying its reputation and betraying its position of trust as a much-loved and respected brand by wilfully escaping its financial obligations over such a prolonged period. The American company, which has never been shy to criticise its eternal rival Microsoft for anti-competitive practices, has now been found guilty of doing exactly that by using its size, power and success as a tool to extract an unjust business deal. The digital age has seen Apple become one of the most recognisable and profitable companies in the world. With that kind of success comes responsibility, among the most important of which is paying the same rate of taxes that are demanded of other businesses and, indeed, individual people. But then there’s the other side of the story, in which Ireland and Apple can be presented as an unfairly maligned innocent party. People waiting outside the Apple store in Covent Garden in London August 30, 2016. — AFP picThe Irish government, we can argue, is simply trying to do the best for its people. It is a country which has known much hardship and poverty over the years and faces many natural disadvantages due to its location on the western fringes of the European continent. Encouraging major corporations to conduct their business in a country like Ireland is not easy, and individual governments within the EU have perfect liberty to devise their own tax laws. If that liberty involves lowering corporate tax rates to attract big multinational companies, who can create jobs and prosperity, that is their prerogative — especially when, as in the case of Ireland, those policies have been implemented transparently and with the assent of voters. Similarly, we can say that Apple are only doing what any successful company would and should do to maximise its profitability. Brilliant efficiency is one of the main reasons that Apple has been so successful in producing and selling its hugely popular phones, tablets and computers which have, without any exaggeration, significantly changed the way millions of people all over the world live their lives. Apple is such a massive company because, in a highly competitive environment, it is really, really good at what it does. That includes research and development, design, marketing and all the other aspects of running a business. One of those aspects is accounting, and it would be naïve in the extreme for us to think that Apple would insist on the highest possible standards in everything it does but then not bother to ensure its finance department gets the best deal available for the company. Apple do not set tax laws: they merely take advantage of them. And if doing that means they end up paying lower taxes, we shouldn’t be outraged because it leads to direct benefits for investors, who receive higher dividends, and even consumers, who will be able to buy better quality and cheaper products if the company reinvests its profits into maintaining its high standards. So it’s possible to occupy either side of the fence. You can either condemn the Irish government and Apple guilty as charged, regarding them as callously contributing to the significant global problem of corporate tax evasion by cynically pursuing their own personal concerns ahead of those of the wider international community. Or you can defend them by arguing they are merely looking after their own interests as any government or corporation should, and taking advantage of legal means to become as successful as they can. I guess you could take either position, depending upon your political persuasion. But even as I type the words, the latter arguments in Ireland and Apple’s defence seem to be disingenuous. I’m not even convincing myself. In the modern globalised world, there is increasingly less room for narrow self-interest. Apple knows better than anyone that we are all now connected, with old national and international boundaries counting for increasingly little. In that environment, all major organisations — whether they are political or commercial entities — have a responsibility, not just to look after their own interests but also to do the right thing for the world as a whole. Defining “right” is, of course, very complex, but I don’t think anybody would classify exploiting legal loopholes within that category. The Irish government and Apple can explain and claim and self-justify as much as they want, but could they really look themselves in the mirror and tell themselves they are doing the right thing? Publicly, they are both mounting a strong campaign of denial, eager to tell — and sell — their side of the story. But I suspect their consciences might say something quite different. * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bonne année celebrations in Paris: What a way to spend the first day of 2017!

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health European Commission Rules Ireland Gave Illegal Tax Benefits To Apple Worth Up To €13 Billion Source: European Commission By Eurasia Review September 3, 2016 The European Commission has concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to €13 billion to Apple. This is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said, “Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.” Following an in-depth state aid investigation launched in June 2014, the European Commission has concluded that two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991. The rulings endorsed a way to establish the taxable profits for two Irish incorporated companies of the Apple group (Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe), which did not correspond to economic reality: almost all sales profits recorded by the two companies were internally attributed to a “head office”. The Commission’s assessment showed that these “head offices” existed only on paper and could not have generated such profits. These profits allocated to the “head offices” were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the Irish tax law, which are no longer in force. As a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings, Apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1% in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales International. This selective tax treatment of Apple in Ireland is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it gives Apple a significant advantage over other businesses that are subject to the same national taxation rules. The Commission can order recovery of illegal state aid for a ten-year period preceding the Commission’s first request for information in 2013. Ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in Ireland from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014 of up to €13 billion, plus interest. In fact, the tax treatment in Ireland enabled Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of Apple products in the entire EU Single Market. This is due to Apple’s decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. This structure is however outside the remit of EU state aid control. If other countries were to require Apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules, this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland. Apple’s tax structure in Europe Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe are two Irish incorporated companies that are fully-owned by the Apple group, ultimately controlled by the US parent, Apple Inc. They hold the rights to use Apple’s intellectual property to sell and manufacture Apple products outside North and South America under a so-called ‘cost-sharing agreement’ with Apple Inc. Under this agreement, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe make yearly payments to Apple in the US to fund research and development efforts conducted on behalf of the Irish companies in the US. These payments amounted to about US$ 2 billion in 2011 and significantly increased in 2014. These expenses, mainly borne by Apple Sales International, contributed to fund more than half of all research efforts by the Apple group in the US to develop its intellectual property worldwide. These expenses are deducted from the profits recorded by Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe in Ireland each year, in line with applicable rules. The taxable profits of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe in Ireland are determined by a tax ruling granted by Ireland in 1991, which in 2007 was replaced by a similar second tax ruling. This tax ruling was terminated when Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe changed their structures in 2015. Apple Sales International Apple Sales International is responsible for buying Apple products from equipment manufacturers around the world and selling these products in Europe (as well as in the Middle East, Africa and India). Apple set up their sales operations in Europe in such a way that customers were contractually buying products from Apple Sales International in Ireland rather than from the shops that physically sold the products to customers. In this way Apple recorded all sales, and the profits stemming from these sales, directly in Ireland. The two tax rulings issued by Ireland concerned the internal allocation of these profits within Apple Sales International (rather than the wider set-up of Apple’s sales operations in Europe). Specifically, they endorsed a split of the profits for tax purposes in Ireland: Under the agreed method, most profits were internally allocated away from Ireland to a “head office” within Apple Sales International. This “head office” was not based in any country and did not have any employees or own premises. Its activities consisted solely of occasional board meetings. Only a fraction of the profits of Apple Sales International were allocated to its Irish branch and subject to tax in Ireland. The remaining vast majority of profits were allocated to the “head office”, where they remained untaxed. Therefore, only a small percentage of Apple Sales International’s profits were taxed in Ireland, and the rest was taxed nowhere. In 2011, for example (according to figures released at US Senate public hearings), Apple Sales International recorded profits of US$ 22 billion (c.a. €16 billion[1]) but under the terms of the tax ruling only around €50 million were considered taxable in Ireland, leaving €15.95 billion of profits untaxed. As a result, Apple Sales International paid less than €10 million of corporate tax in Ireland in 2011 – an effective tax rate of about 0.05% on its overall annual profits. In subsequent years, Apple Sales International’s recorded profits continued to increase but the profits considered taxable in Ireland under the terms of the tax ruling did not. Thus this effective tax rate decreased further to only 0.005% in 2014. Apple Operations Europe On the basis of the same two tax rulings from 1991 and 2007, Apple Operations Europe benefitted from a similar tax arrangement over the same period of time. The company was responsible for manufacturing certain lines of computers for the Apple group. The majority of the profits of this company were also allocated internally to its “head office” and not taxed anywhere. Commission assessment Tax rulings as such are perfectly legal. They are comfort letters issued by tax authorities to give a company clarity on how its corporate tax will be calculated or on the use of special tax provisions. The role of EU state aid control is to ensure Member States do not give selected companies a better tax treatment than others, via tax rulings or otherwise. More specifically, profits must be allocated between companies in a corporate group, and between different parts of the same company, in a way that reflects economic reality. This means that the allocation should be in line with arrangements that take place under commercial conditions between independent businesses (so-called “arm’s length principle”). In particular, the Commission’s state aid investigation concerned two consecutive tax rulings issued by Ireland, which endorsed a method to internally allocate profits within Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe,two Irish incorporated companies. It assessed whether this endorsed method to calculate the taxable profits of each company in Ireland gave Apple an undue advantage that is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission’s investigation has shown that the tax rulings issued by Ireland endorsed an artificial internal allocation of profits within Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, which has no factual or economic justification. As a result of the tax rulings, most sales profits of Apple Sales International were allocated to its “head office” when this “head office” had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business, or any other substantive business for that matter. Only the Irish branch of Apple Sales International had the capacity to generate any income from trading, i.e. from the distribution of Apple products. Therefore, the sales profits of Apple Sales International should have been recorded with the Irish branch and taxed there. The “head office” did not have any employees or own premises. The only activities that can be associated with the “head offices” are limited decisions taken by its directors (many of which were at the same time working full-time as executives for Apple Inc.) on the distribution of dividends, administrative arrangements and cash management. These activities generated profits in terms of interest that, based on the Commission’s assessment, are the only profits which can be attributed to the “head offices”. Similarly, only the Irish branch of Apple Operations Europe had the capacity to generate any income from trading, i.e. from the production of certain lines of computers for the Apple group. Therefore, sales profits of Apple Operation Europe should have been recorded with the Irish branch and taxed there. On this basis, the Commission concluded that the tax rulings issued by Ireland endorsed an artificial allocation of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe’s sales profits to their “head offices”, where they were not taxed. As a result, the tax rulings enabled Apple to pay substantially less tax than other companies, which is illegal under EU state aid rules. This decision does not call into question Ireland’s general tax system or its corporate tax rate. Furthermore, Apple’s tax structure in Europe as such, and whether profits could have been recorded in the countries where the sales effectively took place, are not issues covered by EU state aid rules. If profits were recorded in other countries this could, however, affect the amount of recovery by Ireland (see more details below). Recovery As a matter of principle, EU state aid rules require that incompatible state aid is recovered in order to remove the distortion of competition created by the aid. There are no fines under EU State aid rules and recovery does not penalise the company in question. It simply restores equal treatment with other companies. The Commission has set out in its decision the methodology to calculate the value of the undue competitive advantage enjoyed by Apple. In particular, Ireland must allocate to each branch all profits from sales previously indirectly allocated to the “head office” of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, respectively, and apply the normal corporation tax in Ireland on these re-allocated profits. The decision does not ask for the reallocation of any interest income of the two companies that can be associated with the activities of the “head office”. The Commission can only order recovery of illegal state aid for a ten-year period preceding the Commission’s first request for information in this matter, which dates back to 2013. Ireland must therefore recover from Apple the unpaid tax for the period since 2003, which amounts to up to €13 billion, plus interest. Around €50 million in unpaid taxes relate to the undue allocation of profits to the “head office” of Apple Operations Europe. The remainder results from the undue allocation of profits to the “head office” of Apple Sales International. The recovery period stops in 2014, as Apple changed its structure in Ireland as of 2015 and the ruling of 2007 no longer applies. The amount of unpaid taxes to be recovered by the Irish authorities would be reduced if other countries were to require Apple to pay more taxes on the profits recorded by Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe for this period. This could be the case if they consider, in view of the information revealed through the Commission’s investigation, that Apple’s commercial risks, sales and other activities should have been recorded in their jurisdictions. This is because the taxable profits of Apple Sales International in Ireland would be reduced if profits were recorded and taxed in other countries instead of being recorded in Ireland. The amount of unpaid taxes to be recovered by the Irish authorities would also be reduced if the US authorities were to require Apple to pay larger amounts of money to their US parent company for this period to finance research and development efforts. These are conducted by Apple in the US on behalf of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, for which the two companies already make annual payments. Finally, all Commission decisions are subject to scrutiny by EU courts. If a Member State decides to appeal a Commission decision, it must still recover the illegal state aid but could, for example, place the recovered amount in an escrow account pending the outcome of the EU court procedures. Background Since June 2013, the Commission has been investigating the tax ruling practices of Member States. It extended this information inquiry to all Member States in December 2014. In October 2015, the Commission concluded that Luxembourg and the Netherlands had granted selective tax advantages to Fiat and Starbucks, respectively. In January 2016, the Commission concluded that selective tax advantages granted by Belgium to least 35 multinationals, mainly from the EU, under its “excess profit” tax scheme are illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission also has two ongoing in-depth investigations into concerns that tax rulings may give rise to state aid issues in Luxembourg, as regards Amazon and McDonald’s. This Commission has pursued a far-reaching strategy towards fair taxation and greater transparency and we have recently seen major progress. Following our proposals on tax transparency of March 2015, Member States reached a political agreement already in October 2015 on automatic exchange of information on tax rulings. This legislation will help to bring about a much greater degree of transparency and deter from using tax rulings as an instrument for tax abuse. In June 2015, we unveiled our Action Plan for fair and effective taxation: a series of initiatives which aims to make the corporate tax environment in the EU fairer and more efficient. Key actions included a framework to ensure effective taxation where profits are generated and a strategy to re-launch the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base for which a fresh proposal is expected later this year. The Commission launched a further package of initiatives to combat corporate tax avoidance within the EU and throughout the world on 27 January of this year. As a direct result, Member States have already agreed to tackle the most prevalent loopholes in national laws that allow tax avoidance to take place and to extend their automatic exchange of information to country-by-country reporting of tax-related financial information of multinationals. A proposal is also on the table to make some of this information public. All of our work rests on the simple principle that all companies, big and small, must pay tax where they make their profits. The non-confidential version of the decisions will be made available under the case number SA.38373 in the State aid register on the DG Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. The State Aid Weekly e-News lists new publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the EU Official Journal.

Ireland does not want to recoup the taxes as it puts their special deal for multinationals in peril and the government have vowed to fight the decision. The finding was publicized by the European Union’s competition arm in a landmark ruling. The EU stated that Apple had been given preferential treatment by the Irish state and estimated that Apple were only paying one percent taxation far below the 12.5 percent Ireland claimed. The Irish payback was 5,500 jobs in Ireland and the European headquarters of the greatest brand name in the tech industry. That may now be in jeopardy. However, Tim Cook, the Chief Executive Officer of Apple, published an open letter, earlier today on the company's site, reiterating its "committment" Ireland. Cook wrote "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process." He added "The Commission’s move is unprecedented and it has serious, wide-reaching implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe." His open letter ended saying "We are committed to Ireland and we plan to continue investing there, growing and serving our customers with the same level of passion and commitment. We firmly believe that the facts and the established legal principles upon which the EU was founded will ultimately prevail." Read more Irish tech news here Apple were effectively paying taxation on almost all their profits in Europe by routing the payments for their products through Ireland where the tiny tax rate based on givebacks and special deals were allowed. The commission stated that this was achieved by channeling sales through a ‘so-called’ head office in Ireland with “no employees, no premises and no real activities,” Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. This gives Apple a “significant advantage” over other businesses the commission found. Watch back: European Commissioner for Competition press briefing in Brussels on Apple Ireland tax probe ruling. https://t.co/3Aj51kDS5i — RTÉ News (@rtenews) August 30, 2016 “Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules,” said Vestager. “The Commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.” The US authorities however were also not pleased by the massive fine which they saw as an intrusion on American business practices overseas, “As we have said, we believe that retroactive tax assessments by the Commission are unfair, contrary to well-established legal principles, and call into question the tax rules of individual Member States,” the Treasury said in a statement. “The Commission’s actions could threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU. We will continue to monitor these cases as they progress, and we will continue to work with the Commission toward our shared objective of preventing the erosion of our corporate tax bases.

I show you how you can do it today with the Ecobee3 smart thermostat. Stay tuned. The ecobee3 is a smart thermostat that connects to your home Wi-Fi network, allowing you to control the temperature from anywhere that you have an Internet connection. This isn’t new, as there are a few other devices out there that do the same thing. However, what sets the ecobee3 apart is that it has built-in support for Apple HomeKit, as well as Amazon’s Alexa. This means that you can control the ecobee3 thermostat with your voice by using Siri with an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or iPod touch, or an Alexa-enabled device like the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, or Amazon Tap. And with Father’s Day around the corner, this is one you might wanna pay close attention to, because it’s that good. Inside the box you’ll find the ecobee thermostat itself, along with one room sensor with detachable stand. Aside from HomeKit capability, this is another area where ecobee stands out. The sensor is placed in a room that’s separate from where the thermostat is placed, allowing the system to monitor temperature and motion in more than one place. So if your thermostat is on the first floor, but you spend a lot of time on the second floor, the ecobee will still know that you’re home and will keep the temperature right where it should be. Alternatively, it will also save you money when you aren’t home by optimizing the temperature accordingly rather than wasting your resources and cash. You get one sensor in the box as I mentioned, but you can have up to 32 of these in your home if you’re a straight up baller. You’ll also find the Power Extender Kit, screws and drywall plugs, standard and large trim plates, a quick start guide, installation guide, wire labels, and some ecobee stickers inside the box. Since I installed it myself, I made sure to turn off the power to my heating and cooling system, because the last thing anyone is gonna accuse me of is being a handyman and I wasn’t trying to kill myself. Ecobee says it takes about 45 minutes to install, but I was up and running in about 20 minutes, and again - I’m no handyman. First thing you wanna do is get rid of whatever crappy thermostat you’re currently using, and then label your wires if they aren’t already. Mine were already labeled from when I originally installed my older Nest thermostat, so I was able to save a step there. Then you choose the trim plate that is applicable to you, and screw it in place. The ecobee back plate has a built in level which is nice, so you know that you’re orienting everything the way that it should be. From there, you plug the wires for your system into the corresponding holes. Again, keeping the wires labeled makes this a snap. I got everything plugged in, pushed the wires back into the wall, and then connected the ecobee3 thermostat, which just snapped into place without much force. At this point, installation is done, and it’s time to turn the power back on, which will start the boot up process. The touchscreen interface is nice, and it walks you through setup in a nice, intuitive way. During the process you are invited to download the ecobee3 app, which mirrors the interface of the display, making it super easy to control from afar. You also get the option of using your iOS device to quickly get the ecobee3 set up on your Wi-Fi network, as well as getting HomeKit set up as well so that you can control the thermostat with Siri. Both of these just add to the convenience of setup, and makes a novice like me feel like I know exactly what I’m doing when installing hardware on my wall. Once everything is up and running, you’re then able to control the ecobee3 in a few ways. First, directly from the built-in touchscreen. When you approach it, the ecobee3 changes from the view only interface into the interactive one, which is cool. Changing the temperature is as easy as sliding your finger up and down the right-hand side of the display. You can also get a weather forecast right on the ecobee3 as well, and of course, you can change the settings too. You can also use a smartphone app to control the thermostat, which can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play for Android. Finally, you’ve got voice control, which is the most convenient, especially when it’s hands-free. For example, you can use Siri with the Hey Siri command... …or you can use an Alexa-enabled device like the Amazon Echo... This is where most of the appeal lies for me, and having both Siri and Alexa voice control is something that no other smart thermostat to date can do. As someone who’s been building my smarthome around devices that can take advantage of both HomeKit and Alexa, the ecobee3 is the perfect smart thermostat for my home thanks to that flexibility. If you’re in the market for a smart thermostat that allows you to interface with it in multiple ways from connected devices, I think the ecobee3 is the one to get. Now I wanna know what you think. Have you started buying devices that make your home a bit smarter? Leave a comment below letting me know what you’ve outfitted your home with, or if you’re still waiting for the market to develop.

Then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton checks her Blackberry from a desk inside a C-17 military plane upon her departure from Malta, in the Mediterranean Sea, bound for Tripoli, Libya, on Oct. 18, 2011. (AP Photo/Kevin Lamarque, Pool, File) ** ... more > View Comments Print By Douglas Ernst - The Washington Times - Friday, September 2, 2016 Apple’s App Store seems to have been caught protecting Hillary Clinton from political satire games while allowing titles like “Punch Trump” onto the digital retail platform. A new game called “Hide it Hillary” originally was denied access to Apple’s App Store because company gatekeepers said it “includes content that could be considered defamatory or mean-spirited.” The same vetting process allowed titles like “Punch Trump,” “Slap Donald Trump,” and “Smack a Trump” into the marketplace. The conservative website Heat Street reported Friday that “Hide it Hillary,” which is now available on Google Play for Android devices, does not condone violence or even feature the former secretary of state’s image. Instead, users are tasked with putting documents into a “laptop, server, shredder, or closet.” A day after the Heat Street report, the app was available for 99 cents at the iTunes store and had garnered multiple 5-star reviews by Sunday night. “I absolutely believe there’s a double standard with Apple in the sense that they have defamatory and mean-spirited Trump games available for download but none for Hillary,” developers Ansem Omega Solutions told Heat Street. “I can’t imagine we are the first developers to experience this type of bias. In fact, one of the main reasons we chose to develop a Hillary app is because there were no Hillary apps whatsoever in the store 6 months ago when we began developing.” The independent developers said getting approved with Google took less than one hour, while Apple’s denial came after an eight-hour wait. Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign has been dogged for months over her handling of government documents as secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey said July 5 that an investigation into the secret email server inside her New York home revealed a woman who was “extremely careless” with the nation’s most sensitive documents. “From the group of 30,000 emails returned to the State Department, 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received,” Mr. Comey said. “Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional emails were ‘up-classified’ to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the emails were sent.” Mr. Comey ultimately did not recommend Mrs. Clinton be prosecuted by the Department of Justice, and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch publicly dropped the case on July 7.

Jennifer Baker (UK) - Sep 3, 2016 9:23 pm UTC Enlarge Paul Faith/AFP/Getty Images reader comments Share this story Irish ministers confirmed on Friday, after days of talks, that they will appeal against the European Union's Apple tax ruling. Earlier this week, Ireland was ordered by the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, to reclaim €13 billion plus interest in back taxes from Apple. Further ReadingApple could bring home billions in taxes if US passes a tax holiday The issue initially threatened to split the government with independent ministers saying they were reluctant to challenge the decision. On Tuesday, the EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said that a two-year investigation into so-called sweetheart tax deals in 1991 and 2007 had found Apple guilty of receiving illegal state aid from Ireland. It had allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of one percent on its European profits in 2003, down to as low as 0.005 percent in certain years, according to Vestager. Enlarge / Apple's boss Tim Cook has accused the EU of "total political crap" over its tax arrangements with Ireland. Andrew CunninghamApple has vehemently disputed the claim and said it will appeal against the ruling. The Irish government has similarly denied any wrongdoing. Immediately after Vestager revealed her decision, Finance minister Michael Noonan said Ireland must launch an appeal against it. But independent ministers resisted and the cabinet failed to reach agreement on Wednesday. On Friday afternoon a compromise was finally reached during a short cabinet meeting. Ireland will appeal against the ruling that it had supplied illegal state aid worth €13 billion to Apple, but—in a concession to reluctant MPs—an independent review of the tax treatment of multinationals in the country will take place. The Dáil, which is the lower house of the Irish parliament, will meet next Wednesday to approve the plan, Noonan said. "Our appeal will be founded on advice and documentation of the attorney general," added Noonan. He claimed "no preferential treatment" had been dished out to Apple. Further ReadingCook slams EU Apple tax case as “total political crap”—antitrust boss hits back"Apple constructed it's company to use the tax regime. Any company could have done the same. This is an intrusion beyond the competence of the commission," he said. Irish Minister for public expenditure Paschal Donohoe expressed concern about the impact of the decision on jobs and the economy. The nature of the ruling was unprecedented in terms of the consequences for the Irish economy. This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future. We need to maintain the jobs we have and develop jobs for the future. There is a clear intention to emphasise the certainty of the tax code. This government stands fully behind our tax regime. We reviewed how important this policy is. Noonan said: "There’s envy across Europe about how we’ve managed to establish so many HQs in Dublin. We stand by our 12.5 percent tax rate." Apple has also said it will appeal against the decision. Its chief Tim Cook didn’t mince his words on Wednesday, calling the ruling "total political crap." Vestager refuted that claim and said the decision was based on the facts of the case.

Wearable Tech by Scott Stein September 3, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @jetscott Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them The Apple Watch has been around for a good long while now. It was unveiled almost exactly two years ago, and has been on sale since April 2015. Since then it's been finding its way onto a lot of wrists and frustrating a lot of people at the same time. Those frustrations -- and declining shipments -- haven't fallen on deaf ears. Back at WWDC in June, Apple already showed the world the next version of the Watch's operating system, WatchOS 3. It's about as close to a complete reboot as you could imagine. The function of the side button totally changes (it's now an app dock) and apps will now totally live on the Watch (instead of "streaming" from a tethered iPhone). There are also new social fitness features, better watch faces...and it's faster. 27 Apple Watch: A hands-on tour of Apple's first smartwatch (pictures) By itself, WatchOS 3 will give existing Apple Watch owners a good reason to pull their watches out of the drawer and give them a second chance. But with strong signs (price cuts on current models, plus published reports pointing to the announcement of an Apple Watch sequel on September 7) it's time to look at what Apple could bring to the table with new hardware. There's a lot of room to grow. The current model is an imperfect product, in a landscape of imperfect watches and fitness trackers. It's still not a must-have. And it lacks a few key features that are already in other smartwatches and fitness trackers. (One of those missing features is built-in cellular connectivity that would allow you to go iPhone-free, but it's apparently not on the docket for 2016.) I don't know what's coming, but here's what I would like to see. Apple Watch 2: The final rumors Sorting through every Apple Watch rumor we've heard ahead of Apple's official announcement. by Brian Tong 1:43 Close Drag Better battery life. Even if it means a few more hours, or hopefully an extra day, the Apple Watch could use a battery boost. Mine lasts a day and a half, roughly. But many fitness trackers last a week or more (Fitbit Blaze and Charge 2 last around five days), and some smartwatches like those from Pebble go for up to seven solid days or more. Samsung's upcoming Gear S3 is bigger but offers more battery, too. The new Apple Watch could go a similar route with a battery-boosted model. Apple's history suggests that the sequel would also be slimmer. More serious water resistance. Being swim-friendly would be great. The Apple Watch is water-resistant enough to run it under water or dunk it in a tub, but it's not recommended for showering and definitely not for swimming. Bumping water resistance at least up to IP68 (the same as the new Samsung Gear S3) would be welcome. Even better, go for 3ATM or better, which would allow swimming and swim-tracking. Pebble, Misfit and Withings, among others, already can do it. Smarter automatic fitness. Fitness trackers now tend to engage in automatic activity recognition. Fitbit, Pebble, Samsung and others can track exercises and even sleep automatically. The Apple Watch should be able to recognize and record exercise modes automatically, too. Some of WatchOS 3's Fitness features, like a new meditative Breathe mode and socially-connected fitness options, help a bit. Most people buy wrist-tech to track fitness. The Apple Watch -- for a lot of people -- is a essentially a fitness tracker, but it needs to be even better at what those dedicated trackers do. And, maybe, Apple can apply machine learning to offer up better fitness insights; it's an area that some fitness trackers and apps have dabbled in, but few have mastered. There is a lot of room for improvement should Apple debut a new watch.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET GPS and barometer. Speaking of fitness, the Apple Watch could use GPS to track runs away from the iPhone. Many other fitness watches already do this, and so does the Gear S3. Rumors also report that the next Apple Watch will have a barometer, which could allow stair-climbing data like the Fitbit does. Sleep-tracking. A better battery could mean doing things the Apple Watch hasn't touched yet. Sleep is an obvious omission. Most fitness trackers now log sleep. Apple Watch should, too. Another bonus to tracking sleep is the ability to gather a more accurate resting heart-rate measurement, something Apple Watch also doesn't do yet. Lots of new watch faces. More specifically, a watch-face store. Sure, that's not a Watch 2-specific feature, but the Apple Watch has had a glaring lack of third-party watch faces compared to the Android Wear, Samsung Gear or even Pebble platforms. Watch faces are fun. Apple can obviously marshal big-name designers and brands to make watch faces, so where are they? Improved touch control. On the iPhone, I don't often use 3D Touch, the pressure-sensitive technology that allows gentle presses on the screen to activate different functions. But I could see it being useful on the Apple Watch. The original Apple Watch has Force Touch, not 3D Touch. The difference is that the Apple Watch's entire surface is less pressure sensitive: you can't gently press on certain parts and expect the level of fine control which 3D Touch allows. The Watch could use expanded pressure-sensitive design for a more elegant way to look at and launch apps, for instance, or act as a smart-home remote. Price cut. Apple Watch has already been heavily discounted at many retailers for as low as $250 in the US, but an even lower official price for the Sport model (say, $200) would be a lot easier to justify for many people, and would be a better competitor versus the Fitbit, Pebble and Withings devices of the world -- many of which now cost $150 or less. Or Apple could simply drop the price of the first-gen Apple Watch models and keep them around, like Apple does with previous-year iPhones. We'll know more soon enough.

Health IT Apple’s move to tighten digital health criteria could have bigger impact than FDA By Stephanie Baum 1 Comment / Sep 2, 2016 at 12:42 PM Shares647 A couple of months ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration acted to shore up criteria for digital health companies with final guidance articulating the difference between the “low-risk” digital health apps and devices for general health management and those apps and devices that needed FDA 510(k) clearance. Now Apple has set down some rules for digital health companies aspiring to use the technology giant’s iOS network. MedPage Today’s online publication iMedicalApps highlighted some of the changes including: Drug dosage calculating apps have to come from the drug manufacturer, a hospital, university, health insurance company, or other approved entity. This means individual developers can not make a medical app with drug dosages by themselves (Apple has actually been enforcing this for the past year already). No more marijuana related apps. Apps that encourage people to place their iPhones under a mattress or pillow while charging (such as those that monitor sleep) will no longer be allowed. If your app has potential to cause any physical harm, Apple could reject it. If your app provides inaccurate data or information that could be used to diagnose or treat patients, your app will get increased scrutiny. As iMedicalApps points out, the changes by Apple could have a more tangible impact than those made by the FDA, and it raises the stakes for developers. There is no way the FDA can regulate the hundreds of thousands of health and medical apps and the updates made to them. The screening process is what has to change — and it seems like Apple is finally stepping up to the plate to do this. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Different groups, both public and private have sought to establish a regulatory framework to reign in the mobile health app “Wild West.” Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission offered some guidance for digital health developers. Happtique tried and failed utterly. Social Wellth took up the cause, in a collaboration with HITLab called Xcertia. Social Wellth also works with payers, such as Cigna, to provided a set of curated apps for Cigna customers. In an effort to lead by example after having dismissed unproven digital health apps as this century’s digital snake oil, the American Medical Association is working with Health2047 to validate such tools. Other healthcare companies have cultivated app/API marketplaces for their customers such as electronic health record providers and health systems so they can screen these tools themselves. With this latest effort from Apple, the private sector appears to be well positioned to have a bigger impact on digital health as gatekeepers.
