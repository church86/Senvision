Microsoft announced the new Surface Pro for 2017 at an event in Shanghai, and the product is already up for pre-orders in the US and other countries. On the India site for Microsoft, Surface Pro (2017) is still listed as ‘coming soon’, and its India price has not been announced. Microsoft’s new Surface Pro is squarely aimed at the iPad Pro, so let’s compare the two devices. Surface Pro (2017) vs iPad Pro: Display, Dimensions and Design The Apple iPad Pro was launched in 2015, this is for the 12.9 inch version, which is a closer competitor of the new Surface Pro if you’re going just by the size. Apple did launch a smaller version of the iPad Pro in March 2016, which has a smaller 9.7-inch display. In terms of design, the new Surface Pro continues with the same look that we’ve come to expect from the series. Microsoft claims they have added over “800 new custom parts and used 99% of the space inside the device”. The company also claims to have improved the Surface Pro hinge that now has full 165-degree range of motion, and lets users go into a special ‘Studio Mode’ which has inspired the company’s Surface Studio desktop. Microsoft’s new Surface Pro has a 165-degree hinge, meaning it can be almost flat on the table. The new Surface Pro’s dimensions are 292 mm x 201 mm x 8.5 mm, and it weighs starting at 768 g for Intel m3 version going up all the way to 784 g for the Intel Core i7 processor version. Apple’s iPad Pro with 12.9-inch has the following dimensions: 305.7 mm x 220.6 mm x 6.9 mm, so yeah the iPad is a shade thinner than the new Surface Pro. But remember this one doesn’t have any hinge on the back. Apple expects you to rely on their custom covers for the same. Apple’s iPad Pro is also lighter at 713 grams for the WiFi-only version and 723 grams for WiFi + Cellular model. On the design front, Apple iPad Pro sticks with the design that we’ve come to expect of the iPad. It has the round home button with Touch ID on the front, and a metal chassis. The iPad colour scheme remains at Space Grey, Rose Gold and Gold. You’re getting Surface Pro 2017 in Platinum colour but Microsoft is introducing new colours later.  A new Surface Keyboard has also been launched, which is covered in the company’s next-generation Alcantara material. Microsoft calls this Surface Keyboard as “its most luxurious ever,” though this cover will add another 310 grams to the Surface Pro device. Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro adds around 337 grams in weight to your device. Apple’s iPad Pro comes with support for Apple Pen. There are two display sizes in the iPad Pro series: 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch. On the Display front, Apple’s iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen which is LED-backlit with 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution, which comes to 264 pixels per inch (ppi). Apple has added fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, anti-reflective coating and this is a fully laminated display. Apple iPad Pro has support for the Apple Pen on the display as well. With the new Surface Pro, Microsoft has kept the display size at 12.3-inch and calls it the PixelSense Display with a resolution of 2736 x 1824 pixels, which comes to 267 ppi. Microsoft’s Display comes with support for Microsoft’s new Surface Pen as well as the Studio Dial. With the new Display, Microsoft says it has 50 per cent more pixels than a 12-inch MacBook, and that they have provided a colour-switcher, so users can go from SRGB format to an enhanced colour format. Apple’s iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen which is LED-backlit with 2732 x 2048 pixels resolution, which comes to 264 pixels per inch (ppi). Processor, RAM, Storage The Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch comes with 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage options. Apple’s iPad Pro comes with A9X chip with 64‑bit architecture, and there’s an embedded M9 co-processor as well. The device reportedly comes with 4GB RAM of RAM, but this is something Apple never confirms officially. With the new Surface Pro, Microsoft is introducing three processor variants, which are all 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processors. The Intel Core M3, Intel i5 and i7 processor variants will be available with the Surface Pro.  It also comes TPM chip for enterprise security. RAM offered on the new Surface Pro is 4GB RAM, 8GB RAM or 16GB RAM. For graphics, Microsoft has will be using Intel HD Graphics 615 (m3), Intel HD Graphics 620 (i5) or Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (i7) depending on the processor. Microsoft has also introduced a new Surface cover. The new Intel i5 processor on the Surface Pro come with a fanless architecture, says the company. On the storage side, Microsoft is giving users the following SSD options 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB. Ports, Connectivity Now with Apple’s iPad Pro you’re only getting the Lightning Connector port, and a headphone jack. So you can’t really plug in a USB stick or whatever else. Apple’s iPad Pro comes with WiFi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac; dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz); HT80 with MIMO and Bluetooth 4.2. There’s also Cellular LTE version of the Apple iPad Pro.

Microsoft claims Surface Pro will last up to 13.5 hours of battery life. Now this is claimed for video playback and the testing was done with a “preproduction” device with Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB storage and 8 GB RAM. Even then, 13 and a half hours puts the Surface Pro ahead of the rivals. Apple’s iPad Pro has a built‐in 38.5‐watt‐hour lithium‐polymer battery with up to 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi‐Fi, watching video, or listening to music. This goes to nine hours for surfing the web on cellular data network. Apple’s iPad Pro starts in India at a price of Rs 65,900 officially for the 32GB version. (Source: AP) According to Microsoft, the new Surface Pro’s battery will last 50 per cent more than Surface Pro 4, and and 35 per cent more battery life than an iPad Pro.

News Reviews Tech Tips Galleries Buying Guides Videos Talking Points SEARCH HOT GADGETS Oppo F3S Redmi 4A iPhone 7 Asus Zenfone 3s Max Moto G5 Plus Nokia 3310 Motorola Moto M PM Modi launches BHIM-Aadhaar app, now pay at shops using fingerprint HTC U with Snapdragon 835, Edge Sense to launch in April OnePlus 5 spotted again, launch date set for Q2 2017 Jio's new Dhan Dhana Dhan offer: Top 5 things that you need to know Home > Technology > Apple settles patent dispute with Nokia Reuters Last Updated: MAY 24, 2017 Email Author Apple has settled a patent dispute with Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia and agreed to buy more of its network products and services, sending Nokia shares up 7 per cent. The deal means Nokia will get bigger royalties from Apple for using its mobile phone patents, helping offset the impact of waning demand for its mobile network hardware. Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia's digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France's Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. "There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel," said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an "accumulate" recommendation for Nokia shares. "I have not given any value so far for Nokia's digital health business, but might apply an option value to it." Industrial deal Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told the company's annual general meeting later on Tuesday that the deal would help expand network sales beyond telecom operators to global internet and technology giants. Also Read: iPhone 8 rumour roundup: All new bezel-less design, OLED display, 3D cameras and more "(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centers," he said. "It's a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it." Under the patent license agreement, Nokia will receive a "significant" upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. "It's interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure," said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped to their highest since February 2016 and were up 6.7 per cent at 5.89 euros by 1509 GMT (11:09 a.m. ET). A previous patent license contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. "(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners," Nokia's Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. Quick resolution Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution of the dispute between Apple and Nokia. Also Read: Nokia 3310 may not be a smartphone but for Rs 3310 it is one hell of a phone "Nokia told analysts in April don't calculate on any license revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia's legal expenses," said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. "For Nokia, it's good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact," said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala."The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros." Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the US company's patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia's overall revenue, more than 90 per cent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia's patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world's dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents. Nokia's total sales in 2016 were about 24 billion euros.

Credit Suisse recommends Apple shares because the premium-priced iPhone 8 will drive earnings above expectations.More Investors should buy Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares because the premium-priced iPhone 8 will drive earnings above expectations next year, according to Credit Suisse, which reiterated its outperform rating. "We remain convinced that the iPhone product cycle will be significant in terms of driving multi-year unit growth, and maintain our conviction on Apple's ability to introduce new higher pricing tiers with improved mix," analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note to clients Tuesday entitled "8 Super-cycle – rising demand, rising price." Garcha cited how the iPhone installed customer base has doubled to nearly 700 million users since 2013. "Given this, as well as a high retention rate, we see the 8 Super-cycle will unleash pent-up demand," he wrote. As a result, Garcha raised his fiscal 2018 Apple earnings-per-share estimate to $11.62 from $10.77 compared with the Wall Street consensus of $10.44. The analyst also reaffirmed his Apple price target of $170, representing 10 percent upside to Monday's close. "Apple has historically raised iPhone prices along with key updates," he wrote. "Given its affluent user base, a significant feature upgrade, limited price elasticity shown so far, as well as Samsung's higher pricing points of the Galaxy S8 devices, we believe our pricing assumptions could prove conservative at $670/$770/$900 for three tiers of the new phones." Consequently, Garcha projects Apple's iPhone average selling price will rise to $704 in 2018 compared with $647 in 2016. The company's shares are up 33 percent year to date through Monday compared with the S&P 500's 7 percent return in the same time period.

India has offered to allow Apple Inc to import mobile handset components intended for use in local manufacturing tax free, a top government official said on Tuesday. The tax concessions will be subject to the condition of increasing local value addition over a period of time. Apple Inc wants to expand its contract manufacturer’s facility in the southern Indian tech hub of Bengaluru, a federal minister said on Tuesday, as the iPhone maker seeks a bigger share in one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets. Cupertino, California-based Apple last week started making iPhone SE at its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron’s plant in Bengaluru. Apple, which sold over 50 million iPhones in the March quarter, down 1 percent year-on-year, is looking for new markets as its sales in China have weakened. Among a set of tax concessions, Apple had initially sought a 15-years tax holiday for all components that it would import for setting up a manufacturing facility in India. A panel of ministries rejected that demand and has offered a phased programme to increase the share of local production in the manufacturing, Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and IT said. “We have offered them tax exemptions on those components which could not be manufactured in India,” Sundararajan told Reuters, adding that local manufacturing component would have to be increased gradually. Apple has agreed to increase local share in production over a period of time, but there was a difference between the plans of the two sides, she said. Apple was not immediately available for comment. India wants Apple to raise value addition share in phases of 3,5,7 and 10 years as the local capacity builds up, part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to boost manufacturing. Industry estimates the phased manufacturing programme could increase local value addition in mobile phones manufacturing to 40-50 per cent in the next three years. Earlier, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the federal minister for Electronics and IT said government officials were in touch with Apple and other mobile phone manufacturers about expanding facilities and setting up new plants. “It will be a little early to say that India and Apple have agreed on the common ground,” said the official, adding India was ready to work out a road-map to encourage manufacturing. Industry estimates total value of mobile phones produced in India touched near 900 billion Indian rupees ($13.90 billion) compared with 540 billion rupees in the previous year. “We are waiting for Apple to come back,” said Sundararajan.

Initially, Huawei plans to target the premium-priced consumer market, competing with Lenovo, HP and Dell, which together sell more than 50 percent of all PCs. To a lesser extent, it will also go up against Apple’s high-end, but shrinking, Mac computer business. Huawei’s Matebook X is a fanless notebook with splash-proof screen and combined fingerprint sign-on and power button, priced between 1,399 and 1,699 euros ($1,570-$1,900). Its Matebook E 2-in-1 hybrid will run from 999 to 1,299 euros while the Matebook D with 15.6-inch display is priced at 799 to 999 euros, it said. Overall, PC market sales volumes dropped 8.3 percent in 2015 and a further 3.7 percent in 2016, according to research firm Gartner, which has predicted a flat outcome this year and increasing market consolidation through 2020. “From Huawei’s perspective, we see opportunities in the PC market’s decline,” Cheng Lei, senior marketing manager for the PC business, said in a phone interview of the cost-savings and design and manufacturing benefits it gets from its smartphone business. Huawei, the world’s top maker of wireless and fixed-line telecoms equipment, emerged two years ago as the world’s No. 3 smartphone maker after Samsung and Apple, displacing Lenovo, which remains focused on its computer business. Huawei’s new PCs all run seventh generation Intel microprocessors, Microsoft Windows 10 software and in-house developed software to automate data transfers between Huawei smartphones and its new computer models, Lei said. Huawei said it aimed to offer the new PCs in 12 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and the Middle East in early June. On Monday, HP, the No.2 PC maker behind China’s Lenovo and ahead of No.3 Dell, introduced three new consumer models with mostly similar hardware specifications that boasted short-term pricing discounts and a bundle of popular third-party software. Long-term play In recent years, the big three PC makers have grabbed most of the growth and market share at the expense other, declining brands, thanks to their diversification and strong position in the commercial PC market. Lenovo and HP each hold around 20 percent while Dell has a 15 percent share globally. Business PC replacement demand remains stable, Gartner data shows, offsetting shrivelling consumer PC demand in recent years as users rely on bigger-screen smartphones and tablets and cloud data storage instead of new PCs for their basic computing needs. “If you are in a good position in the business market, you will have more opportunities to increase share,” said Gartner consumer and small business devices analyst Mikako Kitagawa. Huawei plans to keep its PC portfolio simple at first, by focusing on premium consumers while putting off any decision on a move into commercial PCs. “We are now quite confident and will try to expand in new segments in a couple of years,” Lei said. “Our investment in the PC industry is not short-term,” the Huawei executive said. “We will have a long-term investment, not only in marketing but in R&D (research and development).” But Huawei, which has a history of subsidising its entry into new product markets with profits from its network business, two months ago pledged to scale back on heavy marketing in its phone division in favor of more profitable overall growth. In March, Huawei reported flat net profits for 2016 of just over $5 billion on revenue of more than $75 billion. Huawei also must contend with a slowing smartphone market. Last year, phone shipments fell 1.6 percent, Gartner estimates, and while they are tipped for modest growth of 3.5 percent in 2017, they now count on replacements instead of new users. A year ago, Chinese smartphone rival Xiaomi offered its first laptop aimed at mid-priced consumer users, priced around $525, in one of the most competitive segments of the business. Gartner’s Kitagawa said PC-dependent firms had struggled to continue to invest as unit volumes decline and profits shrink compared with the industry levels of 10 or 15 years ago. “The new vendors already expect they aren’t going to make a lot of money,” she said. “They have a different mentality”.

The deal means Nokia will get bigger royalties from Apple for using its mobile phone patents, helping offset the impact of waning demand for its mobile network hardware. Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia’s digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France’s Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. “There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel,” said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an “accumulate” recommendation for Nokia shares. “I have not given any value so far for Nokia’s digital health business, but might apply an option value to it.” Industrial deal Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told the company’s annual general meeting later on Tuesday that the deal would help expand network sales beyond telecom operators to global internet and technology giants. “(The deal) involves a business collaboration … in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centres,” he said. “It’s a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it.” Under the patent licence agreement, Nokia will receive a “significant” upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. “It’s interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure,” said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped to their highest since February 2016 and were up 6.7 percent at 5.89 euros by 1509 GMT. A previous patent licence contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. “(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners,” Nokia’s Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. Quick resolution Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution of the dispute between Apple and Nokia. “Nokia told analysts in April don’t calculate on any licence revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia’s legal expenses,” said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. “For Nokia, it’s good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact,” said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. “The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros.” Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the U.S. company’s patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia’s overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia’s patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents. Nokia’s total sales in 2016 were about 24 billion euros.

This is perhaps why other companies look at Apple as a measure to which they can make their products to look good. The latest addition to the ever increasing number of companies following Apple’s footsteps is Huawei. The company just announced its very first laptop in the market; the Huawei MateBook X. Huawei is known for its high-end smartphones as well as tablets and hybrid devices. Now, the company has dipped its toe into the mainstream electronics market by introducing the MateBook X. Apart from taking the look of the MacBook, the MateBook X does have a few tricks up its sleeve. Starting with an Intel Kaby Lake processor The one thing that a MacBook does not have is a good processor. Right now, the most that one can have on the laptop is an m7 chip. Not to say that the Intel m7 processor is a bad one but it does not compare to a full-fledged Intel processor. The Huawei MateBook X, while sharing some design styles, sports the latest Intel Kaby Lake chip. Not only that, the laptop can have as much as an i7 under its hood. In addition to the new processor, it also packs an 8GB RAM as well as 512GB of flash storage. Bigger display Another spec of the MacBook that users have much gripe on is its 12-inch display. While this is more than enough for most applications, it is still rather easy to run out of space. The good thing is, the MateBook X does offer a bit more headroom with its 13-inch panel. Apple MacBook (via apple.com) The 2160×1440 IPS panel has an aspect ration of 3:2, similar to a Surface Pro, and has a brightness of 350 nits. In terms of color space, it can recreate 100 percent of sRGB color. More ports to connect with MacBook users all know how it is to live a dongle life. It is not a secret that the laptop only has one USB Type-C port that doubles as its charging port. Therefore, anyone who uses the said port for charging will not be able to use it for other purposes. The good news is, the Huawei MateBook X has two USB Type-C ports. On top of that, it comes with its own MateDock that splits one of the USB 3.0 ports to two USB Type-A and an HDMI port as well as a VGA port. Enough juice to last a day of use All of these impressive hardware specs will be for naught if there is not enough juice to power them all. Nowadays, most users choose devices that last at least eight hours as a matter of convenience. And this is where a MacBook flourishes. The good news is, the Huawei MateBook X is not the one to be left behind. Packing a big enough 41.4Wh lithium-ion battery, the Huawei laptop can last for up to ten hours of video playback. Huawei MateBook X (via huawei.com) MacBook-esque features For users who are very concerned about security, the MateBook X does have fingerprint scanner embedded underneath the power button. This feature not only prevents non-registered users from gaining access to the device, it can also identify who the user is. Price and release date For anyone looking to buy the Huawei MateBook X can do so starting at $1,399. It comes with an Intel i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of flash storage. For those looking for more, there an i7 option for $1,899. Unfortunately, Huawei is yet to announce the official release of the laptop. Nevertheless. Consumers can expect the laptop to become available anything before the end of this year. For more updates on the Huawei MateBook X, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Since last year, the Internet has been clamouring for a replacement that never came. Instead of releasing a completely new product for the Surface Pro line, Microsoft has another thing in mind. Last May 23, Microsoft unveiled the much awaited update for the Surface Pro 4. Everyone was surprised to learn that instead of introducing a new product to the market, the company has decided to re-launch the older model but with a few internal upgrades. More powerful than the iPad Pro Since the very beginning, there has been that unspoken rivalry between Apple and Microsoft. When Microsoft released the Surface Pro line, Apple retaliated with the iPad Pro. Since then, the two companies have been fighting back and forth. One of them even releasing an ad that ridicules the other’s product. According to Microsoft, the new Surface Pro 4 is more powerful and efficient that ever before. The company claims that the updated tablet is more than twice as fast as the Surface Pro 3. In comparison to the iPad Pro, the new Surface Pro’s processor runs 1.7 times faster than the former’s A9X chip. Apple iPad Pro (via apple.com) More to increased processing power, Microsoft also managed to improve the tablet’s battery life. Now, users can enjoy up to 13.5 hours of continuous use on the Surface Pro 4. That is 50 percent more juice than the older model and 35 percent more compared to the iPad Pro. More processor and memory options The one thing that most Surface Pro users loved about the tablet is the fact that it can be tailored based on their liking. For entry-level users, there is a corresponding range of specifications to suite one’s needs. Starting with the m3 Intel chip and a 4GB RAM, a buyer can opt for this cheaper but capable setup. However, for those looking for more oomph factor, there is an option for an i7 processor and as much as 16GB of RAM. Storage size starts at 128GB and can go as far as 1TB. More inputs to choose from The iPad Pro relies heavily on the touch screen inputs as well as the Smart Keyboard. On the other hand, the new Surface Pro 4 has a few more tricks up its sleeve. Apart from the seemingly standard keyboard, touch screen, and pen inputs, users can also use either a mouse or the new Surface Dial. For those who are new to this, the Surface Dial is a very handy tool, especially for digital artists. It can be used in various applications ranging from selecting pen input styles to colors and sizes. Surface Dial, Surface Pen, and Surface Pro 4 (via microsoft.com) In addition to the Surface Dial, Surface Pro 4 owners can also connect a wireless mouse to the tablet for that complete mobile office feel. The Surface Pen also received a few handy upgrades from Microsoft. Now, it is made to be more precise with its 4096 pressure points, new tilt functionality, and an impressive 21-microsecond latency. Easily connect third-party products It is not a secret that Apple is quite picky when it comes to third-party products. Almost all of its products feature proprietary connectors and none of those industry standard ports like the microSD slot. Most newer iPads, including the current iPad Pro, has the Lightning port connector that serves as a charging port and data port. Apart from that, the only other connector it has is the 3.5mm headphone jack for audio. On the other hand, the Surface Pro 4 has a few more industry standard ports for its users. The tablet has a microSD slot, a USB 3.0 port, a Mini DisplayPort, and the run-of-the-mill 3.5mm headphone jack. Users will be able to easily add extra storage space to the tablet just by inserting a microSD to the slot. And for anyone who like carrying around cheap external hard drives, the USB 3.0 is more than capable of supporting fast data transfer. Surface Pro 4 (via microsoft.com) Lighter and quieter than the previous model Microsoft not only upgraded the internal hardware for the Surface Pro 4 but is also made it quieter and lighter. The same 12.3-inch form factor is now only 1.7 pounds. Also, Microsoft managed to forgo with fans so it runs quieter than ever. The only ugly bit As one would put it, it is not all rainbows and unicorns for the Surface Pro 4. It should be noted that for anyone looking for a Thunderbolt 3.0 connectivity will be disappointed to know that it still does not have one. Instead, the tablet still uses the same USB 3.0 interface as the with original model. Fortunately, it still runs on a full-fledged Windows 10 OS instead of the new Windows 10 S version. New Surface Pro 4 is cheaper than ever Finally, another thing that Surface Pro fans will be happy about is the fact that Microsoft has introduced further price reductions to the Surface Pro 4. Originally, the tablet starts at $899. Now, the new Surface Pro 4 can be had for only $799. This is quiet a good steal since the iPad Pro with the same storage will cost $100 more. A beefed-up Surface Pro 4 will set anyone back a hefty $2,699. On the positive note, this setup includes an Intel i7 chip, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of flash storage. According to the recently concluded Microsoft event in China, the Surface Pro 4 will be released starting June 15. The Surface Pen will be available in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the LTE version of the new tablet will arrive in store shelves later this year. For more updates on the Surface Pro 4, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

It has a little funkiness to it. Tech Industry by Chris Matyszczyk May 23, 2017 12:19 PM PDT @ChrisMatyszczyk Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image These could Jony Ive's words, no? Microsoft/Twitter screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET It's not a big deal. It is, as CNET editor Dan Ackerman calls it, "a small upgrade." However, when Microsoft presented the new Surface Pro on Tuesday morning, it offered a video that was every bit as slick as Microsoft rarely was in the past. How slick? Well, all it needed was Jony Ive's voice-over uttering the words: "Beautifully crafted." Here, we don't have a voice-over. Instead, Microsoft chooses to set the mood with graphic visuals -- simple, Apple-style -- and an overlay of sound that has a little more edge than we're used to seeing from Apple. (Or from Microsoft, until recent times.) The promise of 13.5 hours of battery life would sound almost ludicrous if someone was saying it. Seeing it written in restrained, sophisticated type makes me wonder if it could be true. In presenting how the Surface Pen and the Dial work with it, Microsoft labors the point not at all. It just lets you feel and perhaps experience a modicum of interest or even excitement. This more sophisticated approach surfaced last year when Microsoft made Apple look decidedly pedestrian, as it launched the Surface Studio, a machine that so moved professionals -- to complain about Apple, that is. More Technically Incorrect Apple asks holdouts to switch to iPhone because, well, because Dear Apple, Americans aren't in love with 'America First' Apple's biggest launch of the year may have been last week Slowly, the Surface brand had gained momentum and feels like a credible competitor to MacBooks and iPads. The computer itself is, indeed, a small step. The mood Microsoft is setting, however, is allowing small steps to accumulate into one big one. Credibility is hard to achieve, especially after years of losing so much ground. This presentation, however, is another step in a very credible direction. Especially when Apple's attempts to boost its laptop offerings have been, well, a touch labored. Then again, Apple is rumored to be ready with a strike back in June. And just in case you'd forgotten how painful Microsoft product launched used to be, I offer you a reminder of how the Surface brand came into the world -- with an ad that may turn out to rival the worst of all time.

Even Alphabet, the parent company of Google, can be bought 1.3 times by Apple with the market capital at the latter's disposal. Not only players from the technology field, Apple is way bigger than companies from other sectors too.

Apple launched its smartphones pretty much every year in September. Google, on the other hand, just likes to play with our feelings, making it difficult to realize when new devices or updates will be released, by throwing launches all over the calendar. Google has ditched the Nexus brand over the new Pixel brand which was launched early in October and it’s making his appearance as the new Apple’s iPhone competitor who launched the month before. It’s unusual for Apple to have a new competitor in such a short time. We just hope that Google sticks to a regular schedule from now on. iPhone 7 It was launched in September 2016 with not so many changes, the reason is probably to keep all the good stuff for 2017. But it does have some new interesting things added, like a better processor, camera set-up and the most exciting, waterproofing! Rumors about 2017 There will be some changes regarding the iPhone’s style. It’s said to be the FIRST OLED display iPhone ever! The style shell will be made from either curved glass or clear Zirconia ceramic and the Touch ID Home key will be hidden under the display glass. How amazing is that? How amazing is that? By Samsung’s exploding Galaxy Note 7, the iPhone has never received so much attention on the market since its iPhone 7 release in September. But things are not the same now. Google’s Nexus line is soon to be forgotten and replaced by the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones with Android Nougat. Similarities Both declare to have the best cameras. Both declare to be the smartest smartphones ever built. Both have conservative designs. Both will definitely receive updates when they’re ready. And, of course, they are both quite expensive. It is indeed, a very difficult choice to make when it comes to buying one of these two devices. However, the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera is otherworldly, an excellent choice for those who are in love with photography. For various PC problems, we recommend to use this tool.

Both designs are simple, clean and tidy and attract the eye. Apple’s elegance is outstanding, being thinner and a little bit lightweight, with a familiar overall aesthetic with the metal surround and black panel.Google’s Google’s style, however, strive for an industrial appearance with the brushed metal look and glass back panel design with the Touch ID fingerprint scanner incorporated on the back of the device, while Apple’s is incorporated in the Home key. In this area, Google could have done better! While Google’s Pixel only offers IP53 splash proofing to protect your device, Apple offers for the first time on an iPhone, full IP67 water and dust resistance. The final battle: Battery life The iPhone 7’s battery life doesn’t compare to its larger Plus model sibling. The same thing goes for The Pixel and Pixel XL. But how does Pixel compare to the iPhone 7? Well, Pixel has around 20% more longevity in the battery department than Apple’s device, especially with heavy use. Based on these facts, it’s up to any of you to form an opinion and choose what you think suits you better!

The government has, however, said that Apple will have to abide by India's indigenisation road map. "Apple has big plans for manufacturing in India as part of their next phase of expansion," IT secretary Aruna Sundararajan, who had a meeting with executives from the company recently, said. The company has started assembly of phones at a factory in Bengaluru, which is being run by Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron. While this seems to be a major achievement for India's indigenisation programme for electronics manufacturing, the company is currently assembling here only one phone model — iPhone SE. The model is not a large selling one and Apple wants a greater engagement with its global suppliers for a bigger play. "We have had a structured dialogue with Apple's representatives," IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Sundararajan said Apple has sought 15-year duty-free imports for components in India as part of an indigenisation road map. "They said high localisation cannot be achieved immediately, and will need to be covered over a period of time." However, the government has suggested India's own targets regarding the development of local suppliers. Questions sent to representatives at Apple India went unanswered.

Most of the details were kept confidential, but the companies said that deal involved an undisclosed up-front cash payment from Apple as well as additional revenue during the multi-year term of the agreement. Nokia and Apple have had a licensing arrangement in place since 2011, but last December the two companies got into a legal battle over which patents Apple was actually using versus which ones were covered under their agreement. Maria Varsellona, chief legal officer at Nokia, called the new deal “a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple. It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers.” Under the new agreement between the companies, Nokia will provide network infrastructure product and services to Apple, while Apple will go back to carrying Nokia’s digital health-related products online and in Apple stores. The two companies are also looking at collaborating on more digital health initiatives. “Regular summits between top Nokia and Apple executives will ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers,” the two companies said. Apple has taken the tack of settling far-ranging lawsuits with major deals before. In 2015, the company signed a seven-year deal with Ericsson that resolved an international investigation and four lawsuits revolving around Apple’s use of Ericsson technology in its iPhones. Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said that the company is “pleased with this resolution of our dispute, and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia.” Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Posts Related Posts Apple Nokia patents About Author Kelly Hill Twitter LinkedIn Editor, Big Data, Analytics, Test & MeasurementKelly Hill currently reports on network test and measurement, as well as the use of big data and analytics.

Trending in Apple Here’s what pros want from Apple’s new modular Mac Pro and display February 25, 2016 AAPL: 96.76 0.66 Apple working on stronger iCloud backup encryption and iPhone security to counter FBI unlock requests Benjamin Mayo - Feb. 25th 2016 2:36 am PT @bzamayo AAPL Company iOS Devices iPhone iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus Comments (28) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In a conference call with reporters last week, an Apple exec said it was reasonable to expect the company to continue strengthening the security policies of its products in light of the Apple/FBI battle. In complementary reports today, The New York Times and Financial Times are detailing that Apple engineers are now actively developing new encryption methods for iCloud backups and iPhone hardware, so that Apple couldn’t even hack itself … if it was asked to again like in San Bernardino iPhone backdoor/unlock case. Not only would this counter the orders by the FBI in the current court case for future iPhone owners, it would also close a security hole in iCloud backups that various law enforcement institutions have exploited thousands of times before … Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial Right now, although iCloud backups are encrypted, the keys for the encryption are also stored with Apple. This means that law enforcement can ask for this data to be provided from Apple’s servers. In the San Bernardino case, Apple gave FBI iCloud backups for the iPhone until October 19th. It could have used the same technique to get access to even more recent backups, but the local county police in cooperation with the FBI reset the Apple ID password, which meant the phone could no longer authenticate with the backup servers. The Financial Times report explains that Apple is developing a new backup strategy, where the keys would be tied to the local user device in some way. Apple could not decrypt these backups by itself and hence could not comply with law enforcement requests, uncovering no private user data. It’s unclear what impact this will have on user convenience — according to the report, such measures may mean that users who forget their iCloud authentication password may be permanently locked out of their data as well. Apple refused to comment on rumors and speculation beyond its public statements on the Apple/FBI case. Similarly, for hardware, NYT says Apple is re-evaluating its iOS security with the mindset that it needs to be even impervious to Apple itself. This tenet had not been fully considered in the current iPhone security model, as the FBI request compelling Apple to create special OS software was unprecedented. With this now a real possibility, whether it passes through court or not, Apple does not want to risk a similar set of circumstances from arising again. Although this would likely require hardware changes, leaving the existing 800 million iOS devices exposed, future iPhones and iPads which include the new security measures, would be truly secure … to everyone. The San Bernardino furore would not be a furore because what the FBI would want would be technically impossible. In a TV interview, Tim Cook called the software the FBI is ordering Apple create ‘the equivalent of cancer’. One potential hardware solution would be for system storage to be configured to wipe itself when new firmware was applied, without a valid passcode. This would mean that Apple could still flash the firmware to resolve user technical issues but it would require explicit user authentication in the form of their passcode. If a passcode was not present, the device could still be wiped afresh but so would all private user data. Apple’s willingness to make devices in this manner may cause a new round of legal disputes; governments or even countries may want to ban devices that cannot be decrypted. In terms of the current legal battle, Apple has until Friday to post a formal court rebuttal. Tim Cook said he is willing to take the matter all the way to Supreme Court, if necessary.

Benjamin Mayo - 1 year ago Reply Yeah, that’s what I meant. Thanks :) Fixed. Fred Simpson - 1 year ago Reply LOL. Marketing PR by Apple that tracks its smartphone users location while accessing your contacts and everything else to know about you then resells your info to third parties. Data mining thats where the big bucks are. Back to standing up for privacy rights available 24/7 on all channels. I see a Geraldo special in the offspring here Brandon Stiefel - 1 year ago Reply I think you’re thinking about Google, not Apple. alanaudio - 1 year ago Reply This shows how inept the FBI’s handling of the San Bernardino case has been. If they had not chosen to make it into a public confrontation with the intention of trying to create a precedent, Apple would not be putting so much effort into rapidly hardening the security of it’s products. If this had truly been about simply extracting data from that company iPhone, they could have arranged to have done so with Apple’s co-operation at the outset, but the FBI have made that impossible by tampering with the evidence without understanding what they were doing – or alternatively they deliberately changed the ID passcode with the full knowledge of what they were doing so that they could force Apple to do something that goes against Apple’s stated principles. The result of all this is that there will inevitably be a rapid transition from devices with encryption that is difficult to defeat, towards devices with encryption that is impossible to defeat. In addition there is going to be a great deal of interest in encryption solutions from outside of the US, where there can be more certainty that the encryption hasn’t been crippled by FBI interference. It’s also worth noting that other smartphone manufacturers have been surprisingly reluctant to support Apple in any meaningful way. If they knew that their operating systems had no FBI back door you would think that they would be extremely vocal about wanting to ensure that no smartphones are required to have these back doors because they would be next. On the other hand, if they have already conspired to create such a back door within their OS, they wouldn’t like Apple getting away with not having one. I note that we are not reading stories about the FBI having a large backlog of Android or Windows smartphones that can’t be unlocked. giuseppe1111 - 1 year ago Reply “Creating a rescue firmware to prevent ONLY auto reset, no interface needed, no iOS integration (iOS could be even disabled by that firmware), firmware installable only by request of doj AND using the usual AppleSignature procedure OR in an apple corporate lab” is a violation of your constitutional rights? Don’t be silly. At the very end, Apple is NOT taking care of you or your data but only of its corporate profitability. Desn’t want to create a compliance division for justice matters. A great move btw to mobilize all those people and columnists on the web to protect a mere “money” problem. Ron Cardi (@ROYG_B) - 1 year ago Reply “At the very end, Apple is NOT taking care of you or your data but only of its corporate profitability” Giuseppe111, that is exactly my concern. Are we 100% sure that Apple doesn’t have any conflicts of interests? I’m a bit wary of putting my total trust in any company who’s #1 priority is maximizing profits. Having to create a backdoor would affect their marketing strategies, would require a lot of time, money, and talent; might affect existing and currently in development iOS features, etc etc. And that’s not even considering the nightmare of possibly dealing with hundreds if not thousands of requests from the U.S alone. If Apple creates a backdoor for the US, there’s no doubt other countries would request the same. That would require more time, money, and talent that I’m sure they would prefer not to waste resources on. But while all that might be legitimate concerns from a business and financial perspective, it’s not a priority for the general public and their safety. TLDR: Are there truly no safe solutions that Apple, Google, etc. can take their time to develop over the next couple of years? There’s not much transparency so it’s hard to say. A Wolf at the Door (@MathieuLLF) - 1 year ago This is precisely accurate. People are trying to paint the FBI/government as some evil entity, but the reality of the matter is the government is elected into power to represent the people, whereas a corporation like Apple will always have it’s own financial interests as priority. For Apple to create software that could get the data they’d need to set up a huge operation/team of people dedicated to extracting data for law enforcement everywhere and this would cost Apple more money. This isn’t something they’d want to do. Honestly, I’m on the fence on this whole issue, I can understand both the government’s and Apple’s point of view. Jake Becker - 1 year ago Please show concrete sources and proof that the #1 priority of Apple is profit. sewollef - 1 year ago @A Wolf at the Door: “People are trying to paint the FBI/government as some evil entity, but the reality of the matter is the government is elected into power to represent the people”. Partly true. The FBI was elected by no-one. Their operatives – both undercover and out in the open – are elected by no-one. The dumbasses that reset the Apple ID on the phone in question were elected by no-one. One thing you should remember, whatever you think about Apple’s motives, only 2 weeks ago a 15-year-old schoolboy hacked the FBI’s personnel servers and effectively stole the personal details of all FBI agents – including undercover agents. A 15-year-old. Are you seriously taking the FBI’s side in this issue, with all we know about their utter incompetence at protecting even their own private details? Bruno Fernandes (@Linkb8) - 1 year ago Reply You sir don’t know the first thing about this issue and the two rubes that have responded to you are equally clueless. It’s unfair to expect the general public to know the ins and outs of the technical aspects of this case, but at the same time it’s scary to see so many people buying into the “just the tip” sweet whisperings of the FBI. You show a complete disregard for history and for even the slightest idea of how this slippery slope will play out in the future. Putting your head in the sand or covering your ears while yelling ‘nya nya nya” isn’t going to help anyone. Ron Cardi (@ROYG_B) - 1 year ago Bruno, you say we’re clueless and don’t fully understand what’s going on and yet you don’t share any information whatsoever. I brought up a concern about potential conflicts of interest and Wolf at the Door says “I’m on the fence, I can understand both the government’s and Apple’s point of view” and you come in here with that BS of what’s not helping anyone. Your attitude is not helping anyone. Dan (@sometimesilie) - 1 year ago Reply If the government could truthfully say (call it what you want, mistakes, intentional overstepping), “we have not once abused our power, overstepped boundaries, or illegally acquired or used data,” they might have a stronger case. Code has already been ruled “speech.” The government could not torture (well, they’re not supposed to) or force you into saying/writing something you are strongly opposed to and forcing you to sign it. They may be worrying about corporate profitability, and good for them. I purposely switched to an iPhone because of their standard encryption which is so hard to accomplish on the two previous Samsung Galaxy phones I’ve owned. I would much rather fight terrorists than my own government. tabitha206 - 1 week ago >or force you into saying/writing something you are strongly opposed to and forcing you to sign it. Ever heard of a tax return? The government humors you with rights until the really don’t want you to have them, and the Supreme Court backs them up. Ever heard of “a compelling government interest”? It’s what they say when they uphold laws that clearly and openly violate your enumerated rights. The bottom line is more or less that you have no rights. At least none that you can count on. Jack Thomas (@JackThomasAZ) - 1 year ago Reply “…the FBI reset the Apple ID password, which meant the phone could no longer authenticate with the backup servers.” FBI = F*#^ing Bunch of Idiots. Upsidedownworld (@frohll) - 1 year ago Reply Im pretty sure doubling down against the government and rubbing it into their face is a pretty stupid idea. How about channeling your efforts into some sort of quiet resolution to save all faces. What a bone head move by management. Kevin Wilson (@bearsfan4life09) - 1 year ago Reply This could have happened but our FBI choose to make this public I think folks are not seeing the big picture. Most likely this would have been a hush deal had they dealt with Apple offline not taking it to media outlets and making information public so now the company has to stick up for exactly what it says privacy. Second everyone of us USA folks on here talking all this stuff about just do it do this and that let them have the crap unlock it and what not are the same folks that were like oh yes please we agree with the patriot act then years later once folks found out the act was being abused which this backdoor deal will be too! everyone was all up in arms. Oh the government is listening to our cell phone calls and spying on what I do online and what not.. Oh Eric Snowden you are god for bringing down the NSA and sharing details with every country on what we have been doing. This is what happens when folks do not understand what is going on and just say yes because someone says terrorist had this phone. 3 years from now we will have another insider hacking their own job and supplying back door info to everyone and again everyone will be engaged and rallying, congress and senate will use it for their advantage to re-election and what not, just remember it all started with this case just like the madness after sept 11th ushered in the Patriot Act and everyone being for it and what the NSA and other branches were doing. IJS… Dan (@sometimesilie) - 1 year ago My *guess* is that the government went loudly public on this one because they were able to throw around the term “terrorist attack” and get the most public support. The government has been breaking laws and getting away with it by creating a private court system where only the government’s side is heard. Snowden helped make us aware of it, but 51% of people polled STILL trust our government and think Apple should comply.

Once iOS 8 got released, Apple no longer has the Encryption keys for people’s phones. What OBAMA says why he’s sticking with a Blackberry is really just a false sense of security. Security hype that’s not really true. If the iPhone was so insecure, what’s the FBI problem? They should have been able to crack it open long ago, right? Or send it to the CIA or NSA or whoever and have it cracked? Who cares what some old late 2013 Article says. Doesn’t make it a fact. John Smith - 1 year ago Reply Interesting. This sounds like a public statement that Apple intends to carry out an action specifically to obstruct law enforcement, even when they have a court order.

If the FBI and DOJ are consistent, they will simply outlaw the manufacture and sale of an undecryptable iPhone. Dan (@sometimesilie) - 1 year ago Reply This currently isn’t within the powers allowed by the Constitution. Remember, the federal government ONLY has the power allowed by the Constitution. All other powers are reserved to the states. The states need to step up and take back the power that has been stripped away. I’d think a smart state – apparently not California – would create laws that specifically would protect encryption and un-decryptable (?) devices, and then invite Apple to move there. Outside of that, how long would it take Apple to move their “headquarters” to a new country should the US take this too far?

For some models, like the Sport collection, Apple is including two bands in the box—“Small-Medium” and “Medium-Large”— while others, like the Modern Buckle straps, allow customers to pick from various strap sizes. There will be some exceptions: the gold model with Sport band is only listed as coming with one strap that “Fits 130–200mm wrists”. The Modern Buckle bands use Small, Medium, and Large straps, while the Leather Loop, Milanese Loop, Link Bracelet, and Classic Buckle all have two different sizes for the 38mm and 42mm models. The Sport collection, as mentioned above, has Small/Medium and Medium/Large bands bundled in the box, but those vary in size for the 38mm and 42mm Sport models. So your decision might not only depend on what size face you want, but also what strap will fit you best.  Head below and click the image for the full size guide: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Apple will also have the majority of these bands, apart from the 18k gold options, available to purchase separately ranging from $40 to $449.  Jordan Kahn @JordanKahn Jordan writes about all things Apple as Senior Editor of 9to5Mac, & contributes to 9to5Google, 9to5Toys, & Electrek.co.

Most of my male friends have wrists of about 155mm. I know this because we all measured ourselves when we found out about the Apple Watch. I think this must be skewed towards tall, white Americans. Claude Tremblay - 2 years ago Reply Great story. Pictures are fine with Safari Neil Shapiro - 2 years ago Reply I am trying to find out how the link-style bands can be sized. The pictures seem to show a push button on the inside of each link. So, can links be removed by the end-user easily? That really is a factor in deciding whether to pre-order or get one in the store. I can’t find any info on this. Bill Haddock - 2 years ago Reply Will you have XL bands? I need one that is 9″ Joshua Glowzinski - 2 years ago Reply Yes, my band is 9.3 inches. But, good news for me, you and all the other Godzilla wristers out there. So, I saw today that Apple is selling just the bands. One says, I believe 42mm, which, let us just round it to 8.5 inches. Ok, then that would have to mean that is the size of just the band from tip to tip. They could not give a length for just the band, that counted the watch, right? So, then let’s take the dial itself. Let us just make it 1.5 inches. Well then, that would mean that the largest band they currently sell, which is for the leather one, would be 10 inches. That has to be right. Does it not? So, what I did was this. I had the dial parts printed out. I traced the large dial on a piece of paper. I drew a line that was 4.2 inches on the top of the watch head and 4.2 on the bottom. I tried it on my wrist and it fit very well, with a good amount of extra. Now, I am kind of a moron. Writing, art and comedy are my thing. But, that just seems as if it has to be correct. Why would they sell a watch band and give you the size that was plus the dial of the watch? How would they know which watch you wished to put it on. hahahaha Sorry, I had to say it. Someone reply and tell me if I am like zoned out. Eric C. Rice - 1 week ago WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE BAND YOU HAVE? kkritsilas - 2 years ago Reply Even if I were to order an Apple watch (which I am not inclined to do), the only bands that I can have are the classic leather, leather loop, and sport band, none of which I would have been interestested in (I have an 8″ wrist, which works out to 200 mm). The link bracelet may fit, I would have to try it on. Apple needs to know that there are people out there whose wrists are big enough that none of their bands will fit. There is a previous poster who has a 9″/225 mm wrist. None of the bands will fit, so he cannot wear an Apple watch, no matter how must he would want one. Kostas Rich Williams - 2 years ago Reply My buddies and I are ordering Extra Large custom bands for wrists 215mm and up.

Maria Varsellona, Chief Legal Officer at Nokia, described it as a meaningful agreement between the former adversaries. As per the agreement, Nokia will provide select network infrastructure product and services to Apple. Conversely, the Cupertino-based company will once again stock Nokia’s digital health products in its online and retail stores. The two companies also agreed to further explore how they can help each other in the digital health space. What’s more, executives from both companies plan to hold regular summits to ensure their relationship remains peachy. Details of the agreement are to remain confidential although the two did reveal that Nokia will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple. The Finnish company will also receive additional revenues (royalties) over the course of the agreement which should begin to show up on their earnings report in the second quarter of 2017, we’re told. Although the latest spat between Apple and Nokia kicked off this past December, the two electronics makers have a long history of courtroom squabbles. The two sides locked horns in 2009 with regard to nearly a dozen iPhone patents. A year later, Nokia dragged the iPad into the dispute. Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said they were pleased with today’s resolution and look forward to expanding their business relationship with Nokia.

Trending in Apple Here’s what pros want from Apple’s new modular Mac Pro and display Yesterday AAPL: 153.80 -0.19 Opinion: Is Microsoft leading Apple in PC innovation, or is it all gimmickry? Ben Lovejoy - May. 23rd 2017 8:12 am PT @benlovejoy Feature AAPL Company MacBook Opinion View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit 9to5Mac founder Seth Weintraub tweeted this morning a suggestion that Microsoft was hitting all the laptop checkboxes of late – and that Apple will not. Microsoft continues to hit the laptop checkboxes that Apple refuses to: Touchscreen, LTE, Cray battery life, etc Will Apple respond? (No) — Seth Weintraub (@llsethj) May 23, 2017 Others noted that Microsoft has held its third event this year, and second this month, while we still await the first Apple event of the year. Does this mean that Microsoft is leading the way in innovation at present, and Apple is being left behind – or is the Seattle-based company engaging in meaningless gimmickry … ? NordVPN The two companies clearly have fundamentally different philosophies when it comes to the laptop/tablet divide. Microsoft strongly believes that a single device can meet both needs, unveiling the latest Surface Pro model just today. Apple’s position hasn’t changed since Steve Jobs used the analogy of a truck and a car. More and more people would only need a tablet – the car in this analogy – while those with more demanding needs would need a Mac – the truck. Apple has for some time pushed the idea that the iPad can, for many, be a perfectly good alternative to a laptop, with Tim Cook particularly vocal on the topic. The iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones. But the company has repeatedly ruled out the idea of a converged device, stating that it would be too compromised. In particular, the company has stuck by Steve’s line that a touchscreen computer is a terrible idea. We’ve done tons of user testing on this, and it turns out it doesn’t work. Touch surfaces don’t want to be vertical. It gives great demo, but after a short period of time you start to fatigue, and after an extended period of time your arm wants to fall off. It doesn’t work, it’s ergonomically terrible. Touch surfaces want to be horizontal, hence pads. Phil Schiller said that Apple had got as far as testing touchscreen MacBooks, and not changed its mind. Our instincts were that it didn’t, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years. We’ve absolutely come away with the belief that it isn’t the right thing to do. Our instincts were correct. I must admit that I questioned this the first time I saw the original Surface Pro. Superficially, this seemed to be a device I’d wanted for a long time, offering a highly portable laptop while at the same time allowing you to detach the keyboard to use it as a tablet. Then I picked one up – and instantly changed my mind. As a laptop, it was reasonably portable; as a tablet, it was way, way too heavy. That hasn’t changed much through its various incarnations. Additionally, I agree with Apple that a user interface designed for use with a mouse or trackpad is a terrible UI for a touch device, and vice-versa. You either end up with ridiculously small touch targets, or you make the entire UI like a child’s toy to make it suitable for touch. As a device, then, the Surface is to me a gimmick rather than a decent machine. The tablet functionality is something that wows you in the store but you’ll rarely use in practice. Try using one as an ebook reader or to view movies and you’ll very quickly want an iPad instead. But that doesn’t mean that I entirely disagree with Seth. I do think that there is room for compromise here. My most-used mobile device is my 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and that has a Brydge keyboard attached to it much of the time. It’s a tablet, but I use it as a laptop. That effectively means that I have something of the Surface Pro experience – only in a far more usable form. I’m using what is, with the keyboard attached, a touchscreen laptop in all but name. And when I don’t need the keyboard, I end up with a thin, light tablet. Even in laptop mode, there are times when a touch interface is useful. Granted it’s horrible for editing, compared to a trackpad. Selecting a sentence on an iPad is a frankly frustrating experience. But it’s not a black-and-white issue for me. There are times when a trackpad does the job best, and times when touch is more convenient. I would, ideally, like to have the choice of both when using a MacBook. So yes, I agree with all of Apple’s reasons for the stance it takes, and I’ll take a MacBook Pro plus iPad Pro over a Surface Pro every time, but I do think there’s scope for a MacBook that supports a trackpad as a primary pointing device and a touchscreen as a secondary one. Then there’s the Surface Studio. Yes, it’s a niche product. Yes, it’s very expensive. No, it’s not for most people. But there’s no arguing with two things. First, it’s a thing of beauty. It has been really well thought-through, and is as Apple-like in its styling and build quality as any device I’ve ever seen. Second, for its target market – essentially anyone who spends much more time drawing than typing – it is a really great solution. For them, it’s not a gimmick, it’s an effective tool. If that thing had an Apple logo on the back and ran macOS, it would set the graphics world alight. And there’s one point I think few could dispute: iPad innovation seems to have badly stalled. Why on earth do we have a 12.9-inch iPad Pro with an icon density designed for a 4-inch iPhone? Seriously, why? Why do we have iPad screen sizes clearly suitable for windowing where we’re limited to a clunky side-by-side layout and a handful of apps that support picture-in-picture? In short, why hasn’t iPad software kept pace with the hardware? I get the superficial appeal of a single OS for everything from iPhone SE to 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but Apple needs to get over this. There is no reason at all why it can’t develop padOS to really let us use the iPad to its full potential. And while I’m asking why-oh-why questions, there’s the laptop LTE issue Seth raised. I really, really wish Apple would include either a SIM slot or a virtual SIM in MacBooks. Yes, I know I can use my iPhone as a hotspot, and I appreciate that for occasional use that’s a more affordable option than a separate plan. But it’s a clunky approach. If I want to do it for any length of time, it hammers my iPhone battery, so I end up connecting it with a cable to keep it charged. For those who want to have an always-online Mac, and are willing to pay the data costs, an embedded SIM is a far, far better approach than using an iPhone as a hotspot. At least give us the choice, Apple. So that’s my take: Microsoft isn’t leaving Apple behind. On the big question – separate platforms versus a converged device – Apple is right and Microsoft is wrong. But Microsoft is innovating in some ways that Apple isn’t, and the Cupertino company desperately needs to free the full potential of the iPad. What’s your view?

The company had long been seeking a range of incentives in return for setting up an iPhone plant in the country. Apple had originally wanted the concessions before beginning production, but decided to go ahead with or without them. Local production of the iPhone SE started earlier this month … NordVPN Reuters now reports that the government has given in to one key demand as the company seeks to expand local manufacturing. India has offered to allow Apple to import mobile handset components intended for use in local manufacturing tax free, a top government official said on Tuesday. The tax concessions will be subject to the condition of increasing local value addition over a period of time. The government has not agreed to the 15-year deal Apple wanted, but instead offered an open-ended approach. A panel of ministries rejected that demand and has offered a phased program to increase the share of local production in the manufacturing, Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and IT said. “We have offered them tax exemptions on those components which could not be manufactured in India,” Sundararajan told Reuters, adding that local manufacturing component would have to be increased gradually. Apple plans to gradually increase local manufacturing in four phases, at 3, 5, 7 and 10 years but has not yet formally accepted the deal offered by the Indian government, says the report.

The companies said they have moved from adversaries to business partners, settling all litigation. Nokia will provide network infrastructure services to Apple, Apple will stock Nokia’s Withings products once again in Apple Stores and pay ongoing license fees to use Nokia’s intellectual property. Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial The original lawsuit allegedly covered many elements of smartphone handset design and functionality, with Nokia’s patent portfolio spanning display technology, antennas, chipset, user interface and more. Apple posted a statement from Apple COO Jeff Williams in a press release on its Newsroom. Williams said Apple wants to expand its relationship with Nokia in the future. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. Although details about the agreement are confidential, the release says that the two companies will meet regularly to review their business relationship to “the benefit of both parties”. Apple will again stock Nokia’s digital health products in retail stores and the Apple Online Store, currently sold under the brand ‘Withings’ although this will change later this year. The release also hints at future collaboration between Apple and Nokia in ‘digital health initiatives’. Nokia stock is up significantly today, rising 6.70% at time of writing, from this news with investors likely encouraged by the cash settlement. The company  says it will receive an upfront payment from Apple in addition to ongoing license fees. It will inform investors about the state of its business in light of the agreement at its next quarterly earnings results.

Apple saw its global share fall from 14.8% to 13.7%, but market leader Samsung was hit harder … NordVPN Samsung saw its own share fall from 23.3% to 20.7%. Oppo saw the largest percentage gain, growing from 4.6% to 8.1%. Other winners were Vivo (4% to 6.8%) and Huawei (8.3% to 9%). Sales of iPhones were flat, which led to a drop in market share year over year. Similar to Samsung, Apple is increasingly facing fierce competition from Chinese brands Oppo and Vivo, among others, and its performance in China is under attack. While Chinese brands sell most phones in their home market, they are also starting to do well in other emerging markets, says Gartner. The top three Chinese smartphone manufacturers are driving sales with their competitively priced, high quality smartphones equipped with innovative features. Furthermore, aggressive marketing and sales promotion have further helped these brands to take share from other brands in markets such as India, Indonesia and Thailand. Apple is fighting back with a new ad campaign aimed squarely at Android users. The campaign partly tries to persuade Android users that iPhone is a more capable device, but is mostly geared to showing how easy it is to make the switch.

As such, ‘The Bell’ (via Korea Herald) is reporting that Apple has agreed a deal with Samsung to supply OLED panels for the ‘iPhone 9’. The report claims the phones will include larger 5.28-inch and 6.46-inch OLED displays … Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial For the iPhone 8, we are expecting a radical new form factor made out of stainless steel and glass, with the design focusing on a near bezel-less 5.8-inch OLED screen on the front face. It seems logical that Apple would continue to use OLED in the generation after that as well, although the suggestion of entirely-new screen sizes is surprising. The report said the iPhone 9 is expected to come in two OLED models — 5.28- and 6.46-inch display sizes. Samsung’s OLED shipment is also likely to be more than double at 180 million units. “Other details such as screen design and functions could be adjusted considering the phone is still under development.” The very specific claims of 5.28-inch and 6.46-inch screen dimensions are interesting in that, if true, Apple would be introducing another change in iPhone form factor in 2018. Contrast that scenario to the iPhone 7, which uses the same general chassis design as the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. For this year, we are expecting Apple to announce two iterative updates to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus alongside the radical new ‘iPhone 8’. Whilst these ‘7s phones’ will use LCD panels this year, the notion of two new OLED panel sizes for next year could mean that Apple transitions to an all-OLED iPhone lineup as soon as next year. For iPhone 8, Samsung has reportedly signed a deal with Apple to make more than 70 million OLED screens in 2017. The report from today says that Samsung’s OLED shipments to Apple could ‘more than double’ to 180 million units in 2018. We would definitely take any reports about 2018 iPhones with a lot of skepticism at this point, but note that early reports about next-next-generation phones have turned out to be accurate in the past.

Trending in Apple Here’s what pros want from Apple’s new modular Mac Pro and display Yesterday AAPL: 153.80 -0.19 Apple’s HR head Denise Young Smith moving to newly created Inclusion and Diversity VP role Jordan Kahn - May. 23rd 2017 8:22 am PT @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Update: Apple’s official statement below: “Our inclusion and diversity efforts are critically important to Apple’s future. Denise’s years of experience, expertise and passion will help us make an even greater impact in this area.” Apple’s head of Worldwide Human Resources Denise Young Smith will now run diversity programs for the company under a newly created VP position, according to sources familiar with the move. The executive shuffle will see the creation of a new VP role for Apple’s Inclusion and Diversity team with Smith reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook. Sources say Smith has long had a passion for diversity initiatives at the company and the newly created position reflects an increased focus on the company’s efforts. Smith’s new role going forward at Apple will officially be Vice President for Inclusion and Diversity. She confirmed the new title today on her LinkedIn profile and the change has also been made official at Apple internally. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Denise Young Smith is Apple’s vice president of Inclusion and Diversity at Apple. She reports to CEO Tim Cook… Since joining Apple in 1997, Denise has served in several key HR roles. Most recently as Vice President of Worldwide Human Resources and Talent. Sources say the position will mean Apple will be without a permanent VP of HR as Luca Maestri, the company’s SVP and CFO, steps in to fill the role temporarily. In recent years Smith has been in the media to address issues of diversity at Apple and also relayed diversity news to employees, and she’s been involved in running the diversity programs before her official title change. Apple’s previous head of diversity and inclusion Jeffrey Siminoff held a director role from 2013 until January 2016 before leaving to Twitter. He reported to Denise who reported to Tim Cook, but now the Inclusion and Diversity team headed by Smith will report directly to Cook, making the new VP position the first to do so. Smith has been at Apple for over 20 years and was first promoted to VP of worldwide HR back in 2014 from her previous role as head of HR for just Apple’s retail stores, a role that Steve Jobs handpicked her for during the early days of Apple’s retail efforts. She replaced Apple’s then HR head Joel Podolny who switched to focusing full-time on developing Apple University. Prior to that she served as Senior Director of Human Resources for Worldwide Operations and Corporate Employee Relations at Apple from 1997 to 2000. Apple first started publicly reporting diversity data in its annual Diversity Report back in 2014 and released its latest report last August. Since then it has launched a number of initiatives as CEO Tim Cook continues to be outspoken on various topics publicly. Earlier this year Apple reportedly resisted a shareholder proposal to boost diversity at board and senior management level, but it’s clear the company isn’t standing still and has its own plans to increase efforts as it introduces the new position for Smith. Apple has yet to update its Executive Profiles page where Smith is currently still listed with her old HR position.

Trending in Apple Here’s what pros want from Apple’s new modular Mac Pro and display Yesterday AAPL: 153.80 -0.19 Which iPhone upgrade program is the best? Michael Potuck - May. 23rd 2017 2:34 pm PT @michaelpotuck iPhone How To View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit While Apple has a relatively small number of iPhone variants to choose from compared to many smartphone manufacturers, the amount of ways to buy an iPhone can be overwhelming. With most carriers in the U.S. moving away from two-year contracts and subsidized devices, full-price or installment plans are the primary ways to purchase an iPhone. Since all installment plans or iPhone upgrade programs from the major U.S. carriers and Apple offer 0% interest, these options can be a good fit for a lot of consumers. While many of these plans are relatively similar, they all have their differences. Follow along for a detailed breakdown to find out which iPhone upgrade program is best for you. AirPods Whether you need to buy an iPhone immediately or are planning on waiting until the fall for Apple’s 10th anniversary release, it’s useful to have a good handle on purchasing options. If you know you’d like to stick with your current carrier no matter what, you have the option of using the carrier’s iPhone upgrade program/installment plan or using one of Apple’s options. If you’re open to switching carriers, you’ll of course have the most choices. Overall, the Apple options provide the most flexibility and potentially the best overall value. AT&T and Verizon’s options offer convenience and no extra fees for upgrading yearly, while Sprint and T-Mobile both charge extra for yearly upgrades. Here’s a detailed comparison of the different upgrade plans from Apple and the major U.S. carriers: Apple Apple definitely influenced the industry when it first made its iPhone Upgrade Program available starting with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. With Apple’s plan having a 12-month upgrade option at no cost, AT&T and Verizon shortly followed suit. Now all the major carriers offer a yearly upgrade option (although some charge an extra fee). Other benefits of Apple’s options are getting an unlocked device (easily using with another carrier), and having the option for AppleCare+ bundled in for about $5/month. Another use case that can be a good fit for Apple’s options are users who have a family plan with extended family, but don’t want to put hardware costs on the monthly bill. Also, when the iPhone 7/7 Plus launched, iPhone Upgrade Program customers received a better chance at getting a device. Keep in mind Apple’s programs require a credit card (no debit cards), although this could change in the future. One other limitation is that Apple only offers its installment plans for its newest iPhones. AT&T and Verizon Both AT&T and Verizon offer 0% interest, a yearly upgrade option and most of the same fine details. At first glance AT&T’s prices may seem cheaper, but that’s because they market their prices starting with a 30-month installment plan, while all the other carriers price based on 24-month payoffs. Some benefits of choosing to go with AT&T or Verizon’s installment/upgrade plans include the convenience of the cost being added to your bill and some customers may be pre-approved. Sprint and T-Mobile While you may be saving some money on your service with Sprint or T-Mobile, both of these carriers charge extra fees for yearly smartphone upgrades. Sprint charges $5/month for 12-months to opt-in for yearly upgrades. T-Mobile charges between $9-$15/month for its JUMP program that provides yearly upgrade options and an extended warranty. Conclusion With the detailed comparison charts above and your personal preferences in mind you should be able to figure out which upgrade program is best for you without breaking a sweat.

While the reports are generally fairly general, the latest report released this week includes a notable change from previous versions… Sony A6500 Apple’s latest “Report on Government and Private Party Requests for Customer Information” covering the period between July 1 and December 31 last year includes one declassified national security letter during the six month period, which The Verge notes is a first for this disclosure report. Here’s how Apple describes the report: Apple is very seriously committed to protecting your data and we work hard to deliver the most secure hardware, software and services available. We believe our customers have a right to understand how their personal data is managed and protected. This report provides information regarding requests Apple received from government agencies and private parties from July 1 through December 31, 2016. And here’s how Apple frames the disclosure about the declassified national security letter it received last year: Table 7 provides information regarding United States National Security requests received, including orders received under FISA and National Security Letters (“NSLs”). To date, Apple has not received any orders for bulk data. We report all the national security orders we have received, including orders received under FISA and NSLs, in bands of 250. Though we want to be more specific, this is currently the narrowest range allowed by the government. You can see the disclosure on table 7 of the full report here or specifically below: The report only details the number of declassified national security letters received, of course, and not what the letter relates to for obvious reasons. Apple and the FBI very publicly disputed at the beginning of last year over the issue of cracking an iPhone 5c used in a high-profile shooting, but almost all other requests are handled quietly out of the public spotlight. For example, Apple’s report says data from devices was provided in 72% of the requests made during the six month period detailed which includes 21,737 device requests.

The tablet form factor is sleek and doesn’t draw attention to itself, and the iPad usually lays over whatever screen the gym equipment offers. This works well because I usually ignore the heart rate trackers and progress indicators on exercise equipment and just rely on my Apple Watch for workout data. I glance at my wrist to check my progress and view metrics while using the iPad for entertainment. Over the weekend I used a hotel gym that offered exercise machines with large screens and an easy-to-use interface, however, that made me think of how the iPad could be used for more… Sony A6500 The tiled layout on this machine’s display looked sort of like Microsoft’s old Metro design with colorful text boxes and large type to present information. Touch targets were easily tapped and the page scrolled vertically to reveal more information. The first tiles showed active workout data with additional tiles previewed on the right side with news and weather widgets, shortcuts to video and music services, and more. The fitness tiles weren’t totally populated with my workout data since I wasn’t using the machine’s heart rate sensor, but the rest of the information displayed was useful and presented in an attractive way. The machines I used appear to be from a company called Technogym, and they’re not cheap. You can buy a basic treadmill without a fancy display for a couple hundred dollars, however, and bring your own display with the iPad you already own. You could get a best of both worlds experience from iPad if Apple created a Workouts Dashboard experience. iPad could read fitness data from Apple Watch in real-time and present it on the dashboard layout, and quick access to video and news services could populate additional tiles. My colleague Benjamin Mayo likened the concept as I described it to him as CarPlay for workouts, which I like. Having Apple Watch and iPad talk to each other for the sake of relaying fitness data could open up new roads for creating a whole category of highly interactive workout apps for iPad. There are already health and fitness apps for iPad, and you can do lots of fitness tracking with Apple Watch, but only the iPhone can communicate with the Apple Watch for capturing that health and fitness data for now. Of course none of this seems too likely to happen this year. iOS on the iPad has other opportunities to improve in ways that make the platform better for productivity, and privacy concerns could be to blame for the missing Health app on iPad already. Still, I love the idea of tuning the iPad to be a dashboard for Workouts data for the Apple Watch in a way that incorporates how I already use the screen for entertainment while exercising. It sure beats the screens on most gym equipment and the data would surely be more accurate. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news!

The specific wireless technology is called millimeter wave which could ultimately improve cellular performance for iPhones and other connected devices. Sony A6500 Business Insider notes that Apple has been granted an application for an experimental license by the FCC to test the new 5G wireless technology. “Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum. These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks,” Apple wrote in its application. The application allows Apple to test the new technology from two locations in California including one near its current 1 Infinite Loop headquarters in Cupertino and the other in nearby Milpitas, CA. The report also notes that Apple’s application specifically states that it believes testing will take no longer than one year. That should indicate that Apple has no plans to ship 5G technology in any products this year given the lead time in product development. Separately, cellular network providers would need to support 5G network speeds. T-Mobile has laid out its roadmap for supporting 5G in the future while AT&T has also discussed its path to 5G. It makes sense of course that Apple would be involved in testing faster wireless technology ahead of time given the dependency on cellular networks that iPhones and some iPads have.

The tax concessions will be subject to the condition of increasing local value addition over a period of time. Reuters Apple Inc wants to expand its contract manufacturer's facility in the Indian tech hub of Bengaluru, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the Union Minister for Electronics and IT, said on Tuesday, as the iPhone maker seeks a bigger share in one of the world's biggest smartphone markets. Cupertino, California-based Apple last week started making iPhone SE at its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron's plant in Bengaluru. Apple, which sold over 50 million iPhones in the March quarter, down one percent year-on-year, is looking for new markets as its sales in China have weakened. Among a set of tax concessions, Apple had initially sought a 15-years tax holiday for all components that it would import for setting up a manufacturing facility in India. #Apple#Bengaluru#Electronics#Information technology#Iphone#Mobile handset#Newstracker#Ravi shankar prasad#Tax concessions#Tech hub#Wistron Published Date: May 24, 2017 08:07 am | Updated Date: May 24, 2017 08:07 am Also See Ransomware attack: West Bengal state power company's computers hit; Kerala, AP too affected WannaCry ransomware had 'nearly zero' impact in India, says Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad says 20-25 lakh jobs will be created in IT sector in 4-5 years Top Stories Kashmir human shield row: Farooq Dar says Leetul Gogoi is falsely calling him a 'ringleader' of stone-pelters BJP Weak in TN, Rajinikanth More Than Welcome to Join us, Says Amit Shah Centre’s interference in Tamil Nadu politics undermines integrity of Indian Union, reflects a deeper malaise Europa League: Ajax victory could underline virtues of nurturing homegrown talent in big-spending Europe Why you must disclose your pre-existing ailments while buying travel insurance Moody’s downgrades China: Can Narendra Modi fly India past the falling dragon?

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES The union cabinet is likely to take a call today on winding up of the 25-year-old Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), which currently vets FDI proposals requiring the government approval. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget on February 1 announced scrapping of the inter-ministerial body, which comes under the finance ministry's Department of Economic Affairs. Here's a look at nine macro-economic triggers that may impact the market today Meeting Apple half way India will allow Apple to import some components at zero duty in return for the iPhone maker agreeing to scale up local manufacturing in a phased manner over the coming years, said Aruna Sundararajan, secretary for the ministry of electronics and IT. The ministry is currently in discussions with Apple on its proposal to manufacture in India for which the Cupertino, US-based firm had sought a slew of concessions, including duty waiver for its component manufacturers for 15 years. According to Sundararajan, the government is trying to reach a common ground with Apple so that the company can start full-fledged manufacturing here. The Apple issue has always fallen between different ministries. While commerce ministry had been eager for Apple entry into manufacturing, the finance ministry had opposed any kind of coneceesions to Apple. Interestingly, the government has clarified that US-based electric car major Tesla will not have to source local components if it plans to set up a manufacturing unit in India. Chances of good monsoon brightens The rain disrupting El Niño still has a 50% chance of developing later this year albeit weakly, while prospects of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) — a phenomenon that strengthens monsoon in the country—forming over the Indian Ocean are looking good. “Five of eight international climate models suggest the tropical Pacific Ocean is likely to warm above El Niño thresholds during the second half of 2017,” Australian Bureau of Meteorology said in its latest outlook on Tuesday. “However, virtually all models now suggest less warming is likely to occur compared to their previous outlooks, indicating any event may be weak.” The Bureau predicts the arrival of southwest monsoons in India in the first week of June, deviating slightly from IMD’s predicted date of May 30. Adding to jobless growth India's unemployment rate has registered a slight increase since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government began its term in May 2014, despite the government's professed emphasis on job-creation, shows an analysis of government data. The unemployment rate in 2015-16 was five% of the labour force, up from 4.9% in 2013-14, the year before the BJP assumed power. The 2016-17 Economic Survey, based on data from the Labour Ministry, stated: "Employment growth has been sluggish." Further, the Survey pointed to a shift in the pattern of employment from permanent jobs to casual and contract employment. The Labour Ministry's report on the Fifth Annual Employment-Unemployment Survey (2015-16) said unemployment was 5%. The BJP in its 2014 election manifesto had decried the jobless growth of the UPA government and Modi had promised to create 1 crore jobs with the UPA government. Gaining back old friends Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday promised India's continued support for the development of African nations, reiterating New Delhi's keen interest in furthering its historic relations with a region where China is trying to enhance its influence. Modi said, India is working also with the US and Japan to support development in Africa. Pointing out that Africa-India trade has multiplied in the past 15 years, he said the trade has doubled in the last five years to reach nearly $72 billion in 2014-15. Interestingly, African nations had vetoed India's attempt of broadbasing services exports at the WTO which is crucial for India's IT industry. Trade treatise Common concerns over China's mega 'Belt and Road' initiative should make India and the European Union resume talks immediately on the long-pending free trade agreement, Germany has said ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Berlin. German Ambassador Martin Ney said the issue is likely to figure during talks between Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel next week. Strongly pushing for resumption of dialogue on the India-EU free trade agreement, Ney said the proposed pact has strategic ramifications and both sides should try to finalise it soon when a China-centric trade system is being pushed forward. When the entire world trade mechanism is changing and China has jumped in and leading world in a China-centric model, India needs to work fast to stitch up alliances if it has to survive and flourishin post OBOR world. Zydus Cadila gets US FDA nod Drug firm Zydus Cadila has received approval from the US health regulator to market antihistamine Cyproheptadine Hydrochloride tablets in the US market. The company has received final approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to market Cyproheptadine Hydrochloride tablets in the strength of 4 mg, Cadila Healthcare said in a BSE filing. The group now has around 115 approvals from USFDA and has so far filed 300 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), Cadila Healthcare said. Prospects of the Zydus Cadila is bright and even the pharma pack may have a better show.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 24 May 2017 | MYT 7:30 AM Apple CarPlay to work wirelessly on new cars by mark phelan Apple expects many more vehicles with CarPlay-friendly WiFi systems to hit the road shortly. — Hyundai/TNS Good news for Apple iPhone users: CarPlay, the system that reduces distraction using your smartphone in the car, now works wirelessly on some new cars and more are on the way.  BMW's new 5-series, and most of the automaker's other 2017 models, now offer CarPlay's benefits via their WiFi hot spot. Until now, all vehicles that had CarPlay required the phone to be hardwired into the vehicles' USB port.  CarPlay allows the driver to do web searches for directions, phone numbers, find gas stations, play music, send and receive text messages and use some apps hands-free. It also displays some of the phone's features on the vehicle's dashboard.  iPhone users have wanted the system to work wirelessly, but the phones' Bluetooth connections didn't have enough bandwidth for features such as real-time updating of navigation maps.  WiFi hotspots provide a sturdier connection that can transfer the phones' more data-intensive features to the same screen the BMWs use for navigation and audio.  Apple expects many more vehicles with CarPlay-friendly WiFi systems to hit the road shortly.  Transferring navigation information and music to the car via WiFi uses less battery power than streaming music alone via Bluetooth, according to Apple.  Apple won't identify the next vehicles likely to offer the feature, but any WiFi-equipped new model from an automaker with advanced infotainment is a likely candidate. That should include a number of vehicles from high-volume, affordable brands before the year is out. — Detroit Free Press/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Toyota, tech firms explore Blockchain for driverless cars Partner up!

Problem Solving | 22 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (15) Never Be Late or Forget a Task Again with “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders” by Scholle McFarland [Tonya Engst here. Little is more embarrassing than showing up late for a meeting or missing an important deadline due to forgetfulness. The go-to solution for Apple users is to offload your fallible human memory to Apple’s Calendar and Reminders apps, which are built into macOS and iOS. But even worse than forgetting a meeting or task is messing up due to a misconfiguration or misunderstanding in Calendar and Reminders. Been there, done that. These apps are the focus of the first Take Control book to be published since we sold the series: Scholle McFarland’s $10 “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders.” It’s a classic Take Control title that explains all you need to know about real-world usage of these heavily used but under-documented apps. I helped Scholle develop and edit the book, learning a lot about Calendar and Reminders that I didn’t know along the way. To give you a taste of her advice, here’s a slightly modified excerpt from the troubleshooting chapter, which addresses a few common problems that can prevent you from using Calendar and Reminders successfully. Whether you’re suffering from one of these problems now, suspect that a family member is, or want to avoid future mishaps, read on for Scholle’s solutions to some common conundrums!] How Can I Change the Default Calendar for New Events on My Mac? -- If new events are showing up in the wrong calendar, choose Calendar > Preferences > General and then pick a calendar from the Default Calendar pop-up menu at the bottom of the preference pane. Now, whenever you create a new event, it will appear in this calendar automatically. Note that the default, Selected Calendar, adds new events to whatever calendar you last selected, which can produce some unexpected results. Why Do Events I Add with My iPhone End Up on the Wrong Calendar on My Mac? -- When you add events with an iPhone, you can use Siri or do it in the Calendar app. Either way, events are placed in your iPhone’s default calendar, so make sure you’ve designated the one you want to use. On your iPhone, tap Settings > Calendar > Default Calendar and choose the calendar you want from the list. How Do I Prevent Calendar Spam? -- It started in November 2016. Suddenly, Mac users were inundated with calendar spam — bogus event invitations from counterfeit companies hawking cut-rate Ray Bans, Ugg boots, and other supposed bargains, often in Chinese (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). Calendar spammers take advantage of the macOS and iOS feature that scans Mail messages for calendar invitations and then sends you a notification. What’s worse, if you click Accept, Decline, or Maybe, you notify the spammer that your account is real and ready for more. To prevent calendar spam, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, click the Settings icon (it’s a red gear), and choose Preferences > Advanced. Then, change the Receive Event Invitations radio button to Email To email address. Now, instead of appearing as notifications, calendar invitations will run through your email account, which undoubtedly checks for spam. You can also safely delete messages there without alerting the spammer. How Do I Remove Duplicate Events? -- If you open the Calendar app and your calendar is littered with duplicate events, try this: On the Mac, choose View > Refresh Calendars (or press Command-R). Or, on your iOS device, tap Calendars to see your list of calendars. Swipe down to refresh. If that doesn’t work, check whether you have an On My Mac calendar that is identical to one of your iCloud calendars. Hide it by deselecting it in the Calendars list and see if duplicates disappear. If they do, you can either keep this calendar hidden or delete the calendar altogether by Control-clicking its name in the Calendars list and choosing Delete. How Do I Delete Duplicate Birthdays? -- If Calendar’s special Birthdays calendar shows a birthday more than once, you can remove the extras. First, on the Mac, choose Calendar > Preferences > General. Deselect the Show Birthdays Calendar checkbox and select it again. If that doesn’t work, duplicate contacts are probably to blame. Open the Contacts app and choose Card > Look for Duplicates. If the app finds them, choose Merge. You may need to repeat this step. If some duplicate birthdays still appear in Calendar, go into Contacts and manually delete the stubborn duplicates that the app is unable to detect. Your duplicate birthdays should disappear. How Do I Get Rid of Duplicate iCloud Calendars? -- If identical iCloud calendars appear to be multiplying like bunnies, first try launching Calendar and choosing View > Refresh Calendars. If you are having trouble verifying whether two calendars have completely duplicated events, try making them different colors (Control-click a calendar in the Calendars list to pick a color). Deselect all other calendars in your Calendars list besides these two. Now you can scan more easily to check for non-duplicated events. If you find a non-duplicated event, move it to the calendar you want to keep. If you are sure you need to de-duplicate, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, and see if the duplicate calendars appear in the list there: If duplicates appear on the iCloud Web site: To be safe, go back to your Calendar app and make a backup of each of the affected calendars by selecting them in turn and choosing File > Export > Export to create calendar (.ics) files labeled with their names. Once that’s done, go to iCloud.com and delete the duplicate calendar(s) from the Web site, by clicking Edit at the bottom of the calendar list and then clicking the Remove button next to a calendar. A warning asks you if you’re sure. If you are, click Delete. Now, return to the app and refresh your calendars by pressing Command-R. Duplicates should disappear. If duplicates don’t appear on the iCloud Web site: That means the problem is on your end. Choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and deselect Calendars. Your iCloud calendars disappear from the Calendars list. Then, choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and select Calendars. As iCloud re-populates your calendar data, this time it should get it right. How Do I Move a Calendar to Another Computer? -- Here’s the beauty of cloud accounts such as iCloud or Google: your calendars show up on any other device that’s connected to that account, no effort required. If you use local On My Mac calendars, though, and want to move one to another computer, you must export a copy and then import it elsewhere. To export a calendar so you can move it to another computer, share it with someone else, or make a local backup: Select the calendar’s name in the Calendars list. Choose File > Export > Export. Choose a location and then click Export. The events are exported to a calendar (.ics) file. Here’s how to import a calendar (.ics) file: Create a new calendar that will hold this file’s events, or choose an existing calendar you want to add its events to. Make sure your choice is selected in the Calendars list. Choose File > Import. (You can import a calendar archive (.icbu) file with the File > Import command, but when you do, it replaces all of your current calendar and reminders information, so make sure you get a .ics file here.) Select the calendar file and then click Import. Alternatively, drag a calendar file from the Finder to the Calendar window to add its events to whichever calendar is selected in the Calendars list. How Can I Merge Calendars? -- If you were over-enthusiastic about making calendars, so long as they are stored in the same account (or are all in On My Mac), you can merge them after the fact. Select one of the calendars in the Calendars list and choose Edit > Merge Calendar. Calendars that you can add events to appear in the submenu. If you can’t merge the two calendars you want, instead consolidate them by exporting the contents of one and then importing it into another, as described earlier in this excerpt. Why Won’t My Calendar Show Maps or Travel Time? -- To see travel time related to a calendar event, you must turn on Location Services on the device where you are working with the event: Mac: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy. Click Location Services, and then click the lock icon and enter your administrator name and password at the prompt. Click Location Services. Then, in the list to the right, select the checkbox next to Calendars. iOS: Open the Settings app, tap Privacy > Location Services, and turn on the Location Services switch. Still on the Location Services screen, tap Calendar and ensure that Never is not selected. With these settings on, Calendar can determine your approximate location using information from Wi-Fi networks, and if your device has cellular data turned on, from the cellular network. Apple asserts that this is collected in a way that won’t personally identify you. Why Can’t I See Any of My Reminders on My iPhone? -- If you’re faced with a blank screen when you try to check reminders on your iPhone or another of your iOS devices, you may be saving them to iCloud elsewhere, but not be using iCloud on this one. Tap Settings > Your Name > iCloud. Now tap iCloud and make sure the Reminders switch is On. How Can I Get an “On My Mac” Option? -- If you want to store a calendar or reminders list locally on your Mac, you need to choose On My Mac from the submenu when you create the calendar or list. If you don’t see that choice, and you don’t have an On My Mac heading in the app’s left-hand Calendars list or sidebar, you can solve the problem by turning off all accounts associated with calendars or reminders and then turning them back on. To see an On My Mac option in Calendars: Go to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts. Select each account listed there in turn and uncheck the Enable This Account box. Your account-based calendars disappear from the Calendars list — do not be alarmed! In fact, if they don’t disappear, try quitting and relaunching Calendar. Choose File > New Calendar and a new calendar appears in your Calendars list under the header On My Mac. If you want to view your account-based calendars in addition to your On My Mac calendar, return to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts and select those accounts’ Enable This Account box. To see an On My Mac option in Reminders: Choose Reminders > Accounts to open the Internet Accounts pane of System Preferences. For each account listed at the left, select it and then see whether the Reminders checkbox is selected. If it is, deselect it. Your account-based lists disappear from the Reminders sidebar — this is okay! An On My Mac option appears. Return to the Internet Accounts pane and for each account where you do want to view its reminders on your Mac, select its Reminders checkbox. Solving any one or the above described problems may put your calendaring and remembering system back on track.

I've found the iOS option to have them display, but they only show until the time of the event. Once the event has passed they mysteriously disappear from the iOS calendar. This inconsistency between iOS and macOS calendars is driving me crazy. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 12:56 Hi Simon, Open Calendar on your iPhone, tap the word Calendars (in red) at the bottom of the screen. Then scroll all the way to the bottom. You'll see a Show Declined Events slider. Toggle that on. Declined events show up in your Inbox. (Which is a bit odd.) Go to Calendar's Year view, tap Inbox at the bottom of the screen, and then tap Replied. A list of events--Declined or not--should appear there. Does that work? Reply Simon  2017-05-23 13:21 Thanks, but as I already mentioned I know how to get them to display. That's not the problem. The problem is they only display in the calendar until the time of the event. However, once the event time passes, they mysteriously get removed from the calendar. So you have no way of going back and checking events in the past if you had declined them. This is highly inconsistent. The macOS calendar does not do this. Events there don't just disappear oon their own. To make matters worse, as far as I can tell there's no option to change this behavior. Apple just decided that nobody would ever need to know about a past event if they declined it. And we users are stuck that on iOS. Argh. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:23 Do you still see them in the Inbox, though? I can see my older declined events there. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:26 I do see older suggested events in my calendar (even from more than a year ago), but only if I didn't accept or decline them. (Once you tap Add To Calendar, they become a regular event.) Reply Simon  2017-05-23 13:28 No, only future events are listed there. Both accepted and declined, but nothing from the past. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:29 Actually, I see that the declined events in my Inbox are in the future (there's just no year with them). I'll research this some more. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 12:32 I started using Reminders recently and was just getting into it when one day all my Reminders were gone. They weren't in iCloud and not on my computer. Just gone. Makes me hesitant to rely on it. Any idea what caused my reminders to disappear after working reliably for months? Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:00 There are a few things that might make this happen. Probably the most likely is that Reminders got turned off for an account. Go to Reminders > Accounts and click on the account the reminders belonged to (or take a look at all the accounts if you're not sure). Reminders should be selected in the account's list. If this is what happened, when you select Reminders for the account again, they will reappear. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 13:36 I did what you said and checked Reminders. However, this did not cause the missing reminders to reappear, even after quitting and restarting Reminders. What else can I try? Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:40 A couple of questions: What kind of account were the missing reminders in (iCloud, On My Mac, etc)? Also, are they missing on a particular device or on all your devices (Mac, iPhone, etc.)? Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 14:11 I entered them into the Reminders app on my iMac. I never used them on iCloud or my iPhone. I have checked now and the iCloud and iPhone have similar lists (with no entries except a few completed items). On the iMac it's different--there's just nothing where there used to be several recurring reminders. Reply Peter U   2017-05-23 21:17 Do you discuss time zones in Apple's Calendar app? I moved from Europe to the US 10 years ago and never managed to change the time zone in Calendar (still on Central European time). Changing to Eastern Time messes up all my future (and past) appointments, i.e. moves them to 6 hours earlier. When I am in a different time zone I like to use the LOCAL time in my calendar not the time zone I live in. Not sure why the damn app doesn't understand that. Thanks :) Reply Peter U   2017-05-23 21:21 PS: I meant the macOS Calendar v7.0 (currently still in OS 10.9.5, sorry, different story). Reply Simon  2017-05-23 21:42 I've had exactly the same problem. It appears the problem is Calendar does not offer support for local time. It's hell bent on being smart so as soon as you move, either all your past or your future appointments will shift to weird times in your calendar. It's frustrating. Apparently it was designed by people who cannot imagine life beyond a single time zone.

Though I rarely take the time to do it, I prefer my apples peeled, and I still remove the crusts from my sandwiches if I'm feeling slightly juvenile. As a result, I tend to shy away from recipes that advocate the straight-up chomping of peels and the like. Photos by Claire Lower. But food waste is dumb, and I'm a big fan of re-purposing supposed rubbish, so I decided to test out a few peel and rind-centric snacks, to see if I could find a way to love them. Apple Peel Chips My preferred use for fruit peels is alcoholic infusions, and apple peels make a pretty tasty bourbon, but our friends at The Kitchn advocate making them into cinnamon-sugar apple chips with a bit of roasting. To make the chips, I just tossed some apple peels with some butter — I didn't even melt it, just took some room temp stuff and smeared it all over the peels in a large bowl with my hands — then gave them a healthy sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon until they were well coated. (I didn't measure, but The Kitchen recommends a ratio of one teaspoon granulated sugar and 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon for the peels of four apples.) I also added a pinch of salt, because salt is the friend of all flavours. I then roasted them at 205C until they started browning on the edges, then sprinkled on some more cinnamon and sugar. The outcome? They tasted like dried apple peels with cinnamon and sugar. The tastiest ones were those that had a bit of apple flesh one them; the peel-only strips were fibrous and kind of hard to chew. But still, they tasted like cinnamon and sugar, so I ate them. Cucumber Peel Spread Unless I'm making pickles, I prefer my cucumbers to be peeled. Besides composting, I've used the green, slightly-melonesque strips to flavour water for a spa-like experience, but they actually make a pretty darn good sandwich spread. (I would however recommend removing any wax that happens to be coating your cukes.) The Kitchn adds arugula, prosciutto and mustard to theirs, but honestly a kitchen sponge spread would taste good if you chopped the sponge up fine enough and mixed it with those particular ingredients. I wanted to see if the peels could speak for themselves, so I chopped them up, mixed them with some cream cheese, and seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. Then I made tea sandwiches, because few things are elegantly delicious as a cucumber tea sandwich. The result? Though they lacked the light crunch of actual slices, the flavour was decidedly cucumber and the sandwiches made for a nice light lunch. I would eat this spread again, is what I'm saying. Parmesan Rind Bites I must confess that I hoard Parmesan rinds for flavouring soups, stocks and even pasta sauce, but I have been intrigued by these Parmesan rind puff things for quite some time. According to Richard Blais, all you need to do to get a crunchy, crispy, cheesy snack is cut the tough rind into little squares, then zap it in the microwave for 30 seconds, so I did just that. My first batch didn't go so well. Apparently they had a little too much cheese on them, causing them to melt into little chewy cheesy puddles, rather than crisp up into crunchy little cubes. (I know, I didn't think "too much cheese" was a real thing, but here we are.) For the next batch, I cut super close to rind, removing as much cheese as I could before popping the squares back in the microwave. This batch crisped up just fine. My honest opinion? Though they were cute and crunchy, they were kind of bland, and I'll probably stick to using my parm rinds for soup-flavouring purposes. I do think they would make a good breadless crouton though, if you're into that kind of thing. Carrot and Potato Peel Chips It's actually pretty rare that I have carrot or potato peels, as those are two peels I don't really mind eating. (Also, carrots don't really have "peels" do they? Just outer portions that we peel away sometimes for aesthetic purposes.) Also, if I do have carrot peels, I usually give them to the below face, because how could I not? Please ignore our lack of recent haircut. Angie (the aforementioned face) may have to start sharing her carrot peels, however, because I'm pretty obsessed with carrot chips. To make yourself this crispy, salty, waste-free snack, all you need to do is toss your peels with just enough oil to coat — I used duck fat because I'm me, but you can use vegetable oil — sprinkle on a little salt, and pop them in a 205C oven until they start to brown on the edges (about 15 minutes). Once they're all crisped up, I take them out and toss them with a little more salt, some pepper, and maybe some nutritional yeast if I'm feeling real wild. The upshot? These peels make a tasty, salty crisp that I am unable to stop eating. In fact, I love them so much, I may start peeling all potatoes and carrots for all applications, regardless of whether such is needed. In addition to just eating them straight from the pan, they also make a great topping for soups and salads, but I never get that far.

It's traditionally a software event, so iOS 11, macOS 10.13, tvOS 11 and watchOS 4 should get mentions; but there are strong rumours that we'll see some new hardware too. New Macs, new MacBooks... and maybe a new voice-controlled speaker. Wait, what? Following the success of the Amazon Echo and Google Home, it's widely believed that Apple is going to join the rush of companies producing hub speakers that respond to voice commands. And these devices are not limited to playing music: they can search for information online, tell you the weather or the latest sport scores, set alarms, control smart-home appliances and buy things for you (the last one being right up Amazon's street, of course). Now bear in mind that some reports don't agree with this rumour at all. Tim Bajarin writes: "After talking with Apple executives, I've come away with the impression that they're more interested in turning Siri into an omnipresent AI assistant across devices, rather than designing a single device specifically to serve as a Siri machine." Let's hope Bajarin is wrong, because the rumours suggest the Siri Speaker could be a fascinating product. Here's what we're expecting from Apple's much-anticipated Siri Speaker. Name Siri Speaker seems the best and most widely tipped option at the moment: it's simple and it leverages the brand of Apple's famous and (relatively) popular voice control tech. But there are some other options: Apple Home: All Home-related brands face the problem that Apple has an app called Home - one which controls HomeKit-compatible smart-home devices. Apple may be able to tie the branding together, however. Beats Home: Based on Apple's acquisition of Beats iHome iSpeaker Siri Home Design Google Home and Amazon Alexa have both gone with a cylinder design, and it's believed that Apple is thinking along those lines too. Google Home This belief is mostly based on an Apple patent spotted in May 2017: 'Electronic device with radially deployed components'. It's possible, of course, that this refers to a different product Apple has in mind, or is a deliberate attempt to confuse rivals (not an unknown strategy), or was an olde design that it's since moved on from. Features Notorious (and often reliable) Apple leaker Sonny Dickson has claimed that the Siri Speaker may feature Beats technology, following Apple's acquisition of the company in 2014, and could run a modified version of iOS. It may even feature a touchscreen (a feature notable for its absence from the Amazon Echo and Google Home - although Amazon's Echo Show does include a screen). Like its competitors, the Siri Speaker is likely to offer a range of voice-controlled interactions, from weather conditions to turning on the (HomeKit-enabled) lights. Since it's a speaker, of course, we also imagine music - namely Apple Music and possibly Spotify - will be a big part of the package. Release date The internet hive mind says WWDC 2017, although this may be optimistic. The patent referred to in the previous section has only just been granted (it was applied for in 2015) and there's usually a longer wait than that between patent and product - it's not impossible but would be an impressive turnaround. What's more, when Apple launches a new hardware product we generally expect to see leaked components and factory-line photos from the Asian supply chain: Apple's manufacturing base is so vast and complex that it's simply impossible to keep it sealed up. (Software is different. Even these days Apple often manages to spring surprises there) And we've not seen a dicky bird. Still, WWDC 2016 was when Apple opened Siri up to third-party developers, and it would make sense for this year's conference to see the use of Siri SDK in an upcoming speaker. Previous launch timings make it plausible that Apple could announce the Siri Speaker at WWDC 2017, then release the product in September or thereabouts. UK price As it's not been officially announced yet, we've not got UK or indeed any pricing for the Siri Speaker. Furthermore, this is a new area for Apple, so we haven't got any similar or predecessor product to base our comparisons on. But we can make an educated guess based on the rival devices out there already. Apple has to be competitive, and will most likely price its product close to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The Echo is priced at £149.99/$179.99, with the cheaper Echo Dot available for £49.99/$49.99, while Google Home is £129/$129. With this in mind, we'd expect the Siri Speaker to cost somewhere in the region of £150 in the UK, or $180 in the US. OUR VERDICT We love the concept and if half the rumours are true this is going to be fascinating product; but it's obviously far too early to offer a verdict. Check back for our review once the Siri Speaker launches. Tags: Apple Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too.

If you're going to launch a lightweight laptop, you might as well learn from the best. Which is exactly what Huawei has done for the MateBook X. This super-skinny 13in ultra-portable could easily be mistaken for Apple's MacBook, with an all-metal build and minimal styling. Oh, and lets' not forget a near complete lack of connectivity. Dig a little deeper, though, and Huawei has actually gone further. A few neat hardware upgrades could even give it the edge over Apple's attempt. If you're looking for something perfectly portable for working on the move, this could definitely be worth a look. After spending some time with one ahead of the official launch, here's what I think. HUAWEI MATEBOOK X - DESIGN & BUILD If it weren't for the huge Huawei lettering on the lid, you'd be hard pushed to tell the MateBook X wasn't a MacBook. It's made entirely from metal, with barely any ports at the sides - just two USB-C ports and a 3.5mm headphone port. At least Huawei bundles a dongle in the box, adding a single USB port, along with VGA and HDMI video outputs. At 12.5mm thick and weighing just over 1kg, it's about as thin and light as laptops get. That should make it perfect for taking on the move, especially as the charging adapter is no larger than the one you'd use to top up your smartphone. Open it up and you'll spot a very skinny screen bezel. At just 4.4mm thick, it certainly draws your attention towards the display, and the speaker grille directly below it. Just like a certain fruit-flavoured laptop. There's more than a little bit of flex in that grille, though - not something you'd see in a machine built by Apple. Oh, and just in case there weren't enough comparisons with Apple's ultraportable already, you can buy the MateBook X in grey, gold and rose gold colours. HUAWEI MATEBOOK X - SCREEN & SOUND It might be barely any larger than a sheet of A4 paper, but the MateBook X still has room for a 13in display. With ultra-slim 4.4mm screen bezels, there's hardly any wasted space. It's not quite as minimal as Dell's XPS 13, but it certainly adds a touch of class. The 13in panel has a 2160x1440 resolution, which is a welcome step up from 1080p. It's slightly less than the current MacBook, but from arm's length, it looks sharp enough and packs in enough detail to make pictures and videos really pop. Viewing angles are excellent, and there's plenty of tilt in the screen hinge, so finding a comfortable working position shouldn't be a struggle. I'd want to take one outside to see how brightness and contrast stack up in bright sunlight, but so far I'm pretty impressed. The speakers are even more impressive, thanks to a partnership with Dolby that started in the factory. Normally Dolby chips in at the end of development, but Huawei got them involved from the start to design the dual-driver motors inside the MateBook X. That's why this is the first laptop with a Dolby Atmos Sound System onboard. No, it's not going to bounce sound off your ceilings or create height channels for proper surround sound effects, but the speakers have been tweaked to eke out more detail at the high-end. It seems to work, too, with a clip from Mad Max blasting out a surprising amount of detail. HUAWEI MATEBOOK X - PERFORMANCE & BATTERY LIFE It might be skinny, but Huawei has managed to cram the latest Intel silicon inside the MateBook X - and without needing a fan to keep it cool. That means silent running, even after you've spent all day firing out emails and typing up documents. You'd normally find a Core M in a laptop like this (that's what Apple has used for the Macbook) but Huawei has managed to fit a more powerful Core i7-7500U. Until we get to test one properly, though, it's a mystery if the MateBook X will run at slower speeds than the actively-cooled competiton to avoid overheating. It felt quick enough on the Windows desktop, and loaded browser tabs without any stutter, so it should be plenty powerful enough for everyday duties. Huawei says the battery is good enough for ten hours of working at 50% brightness, meaning you can go all day without needing to plug in. We'll need to put that claim to the test in a proper review, but it sounds promising for such a slim machine. There should be enough room for storing all your stuff on the 256GB PCI-E SSD, but you can upgrade to 512GB if you don't think it'll be enough. It's a similar setup with memory: the standard model has 4GB, but you can step up to 8GB to keep all those Google Chrome tabs ticking over smoothly. HUAWEI MATEBOOK X - KEYBOARD, TOUCHPAD & USABILITY The MateBook X is refreshingly comfortable to type on for such a small laptop, thanks to the full-size Chiclet-style keyboard. Each key has just enough travel, so you can tap away forcefully without them bottoming out. It's not quite as feedback-friendly as the ultra-slim keys on Apple's MacBook, but I could type out sentences without any typos right away. The whole thing is fully backlit, so you can get work done in the dark, and nothing feels particularly out of place - even the half-height arrow keys at the far right side. The wide aspect ratio touchpad felt a little overly sensitive when I took it for a spin, but thankfully you'll be able to tweak it in the Settings menus right out of the box. The whole pad clicks down when you push it, and it recognises the usual array of multi-touch gestures. There's one other handy key at the top right corner: the power button. It's got a fingerprint sensor built into it, so you can use Windows Hello to skip the lock screen right from startup. Neat. HUAWEI MATEBOOK X INITIAL VERDICT The MateBook X is probably the most exciting of Huawei's three new Windows-powered portables. The MateBook E is a relatively minor refresh of last year's convertible tablet, and the MateBook D is a business-centric laptop with a dash of added style. This, though - this feels like it could be Huawei's effort to muscle in against the MacBook Air, or even the Apple MacBook. It's powerful enough, has a high quality screen, and should have the battery life that'll let you take it around all day without having to worry about straying too far from a mains socket. Build quality is a bit of a mixed bag, from what I've seen of the pre-release samples on show at the launch event, but display, sound and performance all look pretty impressive so far. I still can't wait to slip one in my bag and see if it performs as well as it looks.

(AFP) HELSINKI: Nokia has settled its legal battle with Apple with a new patent license agreement and also signed a business deal with the US giant, surprising investors who had expected the dispute to drag on. The companies said on Tuesday that Nokia would receive an upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter, without giving details. Analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped as much as 8 percent to their highest since February 2016 and were 6.5 percent higher at €5.88 by 0848 GMT. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said in a joint statement from the companies. A previous patent license contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to €800 million ($900 million) from €950 million previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. “(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners,” Nokia’s Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution, as they had feared a protracted legal dispute. “For Nokia, it is good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact,” said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. “The previous annual rate was €150 million, so I assume this to be more, around €500 million.” Under the new business agreement, Nokia said it would provide network products and services to Apple while Apple would resume carrying Nokia’s digital health products in its retail and online stores. The firms will also look into further collaboration in digital health, Nokia said. Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the US company’s patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. has escalated. Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen said Nokia’s aim to expand its sales of network equipment sales beyond telecom operators to global Internet and technology giants may also have played a part in the resolution of the dispute. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia’s overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia’s patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world’s dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and a large portfolio of mobile device patents.

The SiriusXM® signal is beamed from two broadcast satellites positioned in geostationary orbit above Earth. The beams from these two broadcast satellites combine to span the entire continental United States and some of Canada. Pandora® Compatibility All Civic Si models are designed to provide a convenient interface for Pandora®, a free music service that allows users to open an account online and create up to 100 personalized internet „radio stations” that are based on favorite songs or artists. Users can choose among their stations and listen via computer, and can also download a free smartphone Pandora® app, which allows users listen to the same list of personalized stations via their compatible phone. Although Pandora® is free, phone data charges apply. HondaLink® The Display Audio system with next generation HondaLink that is standard in Si models allows the owner’s digital lifestyle to seamlessly integrate with the car and provides access to a world of cloud-based information. The application-based platform connects customers to online content both inside and outside the car. The connection between the system and the user’s smartphone is made through the Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® wireless interface. A HondaLink phone app provides convenient access for many services including location searches, local weather, messaging, Maintenance Minder alerts, service scheduling by phone, and access to the vehicle Owners Guide. HondaLink Assist An additional new feature on Civic Si is HondaLink Assist, which can help request emergency assistance for drivers. If a compatible phone is paired through Bluetooth®7 HandsFreeLink®, there is a cellular connection and an airbag deployment sensor is triggered, the system is designed to automatically attempt to notify an operator, report the car’s current location, and allow occupants to talk directly to the operator. The operator can then contact emergency services if needed. Siri Eyes Free All Civic Si models integrate Apple’s Siri Eyes Free mode imbedded in Apple CarPlay. Compatible iPhone® users will be able to operate Siri through familiar voice commands by pressing and holding the TALK button on the steering wheel for two seconds when their iPhone is paired via Bluetooth®. Using Eyes Free mode, Siri takes hands-free functionality even further and helps to minimize the potential for distractions by keeping the iOS device’s screen from lighting up. Owners can direct Siri to perform a number of specific tasks while they keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel. Capabilities include: Send text messages and e-mails Read incoming text messages and emails Set up calendar entries, reminders, and alarms Check the weather Turn-by-turn voice navigation Sports scores and stock quotes SMS Text Messaging All Civic Si models have a standard SMS text message function that can read incoming texts aloud over the audio system, and allow the driver to reply with any of six factory preset messages. The system works with SMS-capable cell phones that have an active data plan and the Message Access Profile (MAP), such as the Blackberry, Droid X and others. Apple iPhone models do not support this feature, but Siri Eyes Free CarPlay mode (iPhone 5, 6 and 7 at time of launch) offers the ability to initiate, hear and respond to text messages via voice commands. Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® The Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® interface is designed to offer hands-free operation for many Bluetooth®-enabled mobile telephones. Standard on all Civic Si models, the system wirelessly connects the driver’s cell phone to the vehicle’s audio system. This allows the driver to make or answer cell phone calls without removing hands from the steering wheel. The system is compatible with Bluetooth®-enabled cell phones that have the Hands Free Profile (HFP). A list of compatible phones can be found at handsfreelink.com or honda.com. USB Ports and Power Outlets All Civic Si models have a 12-volt power outlet is positioned at the base of the center stack on the right of the lower storage tray, with a 1.5-amp USB port positioned on the left and a 1.0-amp USB port is positioned inside the console.  Audio and Connectivity Features Features Civic Si Coupe Civic Si Sedan 450-Watt AM/FM Premium Audio System with 10 Speakers (including subwoofer) • • 7-inch Display Audio with High-Resolution WVGA (800×480) Electrostatic Color Touch-Screen and Customizable Feature Settings • • Smartphone-Based Navigation App Compatibility • • Voice Recognition • • Steering Wheel Touchpad Control • • HondaLink® Next Generation • • HondaLink Assist (when paired with compatible phone) • • Apple CarPlay™ compatibility • • Android Auto™ compatibility HD Radio™ • • SiriusXM® Radio • • Pandora® Compatibility • • Bluetooth® Streaming Audio • • Display Audio Interface • • USB Audio Interface 2 2 12-Volt Power Outlet (Front) 1 1 MP3/Windows Media® Audio (WMA) Playback Capability • • Radio Data System (RDS) • • Speed-Sensitive Volume Control (SVC) • • Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® • • SMS Text Message Function • • (See the Specifications and Features section for all data.)

The application, obtained by Business Insider, details Apple’s plans to test 5G internet speeds achievable only with what’s known as millimeter wave technology, or mmWave. This is the same type of technology that internet startup Starry uses to try and deliver gigabit Wi-Fi to homes. 5G is dependent on millimeter wave technology "Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multi-path environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum," reads the application, according to BI. "These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks.” Though 5G remains a somewhat nebulous concept because standards organizations have yet to formally classify it, the successor to LTE is broadly understood to be capable of gigabit speeds that rely on mmWave tech. Because mmWave transmits data at a higher frequency, and thus a smaller wavelength of between 30 GHz and 300 GHz, the technology is capable of reducing latency and expanding data transmission capacity. It also opens up possibilities for cutting down on antenna size and for packing more powerful multi-band antennas into a single device. Generally speaking, we’re talking about internet speeds that are orders of magnitude higher than standard LTE. Of course, there are big technically challenges with mmWave that need to be solved, primarily that the signal has trouble traveling great distances and through a great many surface materials, including glass. Still, Apple seems intent on testing the technology for itself: Apple intends to transmit from two fixed points located at Apple-controlled facilities in Cupertino and Milpitas, CA. These transmissions will be consistent with the parameters and equipment identified in Apple’s accompanying Form 442, and will include the use of a horn antenna with a half-power beamwidth of 20 degrees in the E-plane and H-plane and a downtilt between 20 - 25 degrees. Apple anticipates that it will conduct its experiments for a period not to exceed 12 months. Apple would be handling only the hardware side of testing with relation to the construction of new iPhones — perhaps the company is also looking at a different smartphone modem supplier given its ongoing legal dispute with Qualcomm. On the other end, there’s still a significant amount of network infrastructure work that has to be completed on behalf of telecoms, chipmakers, and standards organizations before your next smartphone sports a new logo in the upper left corner. That might not happen for an other two or three years. AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile have all announced plans to start testing faster versions of 4G LTE that should, in theory, help lay the groundwork for true 5G in the future. On the chip side, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Intel have all announced new hardware to support 5G speeds, while telecom standards organization 3GPP is working to release the first official 5G standards in the second half of 2017 with full-scale tests and deployments slated for 2019.

The companies said that Nokia would receive an upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter, without giving details. Analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped as much as 8% to their highest since February 2016 before paring some gains. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams said in a joint statement from the companies. A previous patent license contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to €800m from €950m previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. “[The agreement] moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners,” Nokia’s chief legal officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution, as they had feared a protracted legal dispute. “For Nokia, it’s good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact,” said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. “The previous annual rate was €150m, so I assume this to be more, around €500m.” Under the new business agreement, Nokia said it would provide network products and services to Apple while Apple would resume carrying Nokia’s digital health products in its retail and online stores. The firms will also look into further collaboration in digital health, Nokia said. Mr Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the US company’s patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm has escalated. Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen said Nokia’s aim to expand its sales of network equipment sales beyond telecom operators to global internet and technology giants may also have played a part in the resolution of the dispute.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Record-Breaking Holiday Season for the App Store CUPERTINO, California — January 6, 2016 — Apple® today announced that customers around the world made this holiday season the biggest ever for the App Store®, setting new records during the weeks of Christmas and New Year’s.  In the two weeks ending January 3, customers spent over $1.1 billion on apps and in-app purchases, setting back-to-back weekly records for traffic and purchases. January 1, 2016 marked the biggest day in App Store history with customers spending over $144 million. It broke the previous single-day record set just a week earlier on Christmas Day. “The App Store had a holiday season for the record books. We are excited that our customers downloaded and enjoyed so many incredible apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, spending over $20 billion on the App Store last year alone,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “We’re grateful to all the developers who have created the most innovative and exciting apps in the world for our customers. We can’t wait for what’s to come in 2016.” Worldwide, the App Store has brought in nearly $40 billion for developers since 2008, with over one-third generated in the last year alone. Largely as a result of the App Store’s success, Apple is now responsible for creating and supporting 1.9 million jobs in the U.S. alone. Nearly three-quarters of those jobs — over 1.4 million — are attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.* Apple has previously reported that the iOS app economy has created 1.2 million jobs in Europe and 1.4 million jobs in China. Gaming, Social Networking and Entertainment were among the year’s most popular App Store categories across Apple products, with customers challenging themselves to Minecraft: Pocket Edition, Trivia Crack and Heads Up!, and staying in touch with friends and family using Facebook Messenger, WeChat and Snapchat. Games and subscription apps dominated this year’s top grossing titles including Clash of Clans, Monster Strike, Game of War – Fire Age and Fantasy Westward Journey, as well as Netflix, Hulu and Match. The launch of the all-new Apple TV® and Apple Watch® have paved the way for entirely new app experiences, changing how people consume content through their television and providing useful information at a glance on Apple’s most personal device yet. Since its launch in October, the new Apple TV’s most popular apps include Rayman Adventures, Beat Sports and HBO NOW. Chart-topping apps for Apple Watch owners include fitness apps Nike+ Running and Lifesum, and iTranslate and Citymapper in the Travel category. *Job creation estimate based on research by Dr. Michael Mandel, Progressive Policy Institute. “App Economy Jobs in the United States,” January 6, 2016 Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

In addition, Apple will work with partners around Italy who deliver developer training to complement this curriculum and create additional opportunities for students. Apple expects to expand this program to other countries around the world. “Europe is home to some of the most creative developers in the world and we’re thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The phenomenal success of the App Store is one of the driving forces behind the more than 1.4 million jobs Apple has created in Europe and presents unlimited opportunities for people of all ages and businesses of all sizes across the continent.” Apple is a powerful engine of growth across Europe and the company’s ecosystem now supports more than 1.4 million jobs, including 1.2 million attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.* The unprecedented growth of the App Store® has helped developers in Europe earn over €10.2 billion from selling their apps around the world. In Italy, over 75,000 jobs are attributable to the App Store and the developer community is vibrant. IK Multimedia launched its first app in 2009 and since then has had over 25 million downloads. Musement, launched in 2013, is now available in seven languages and 300 cities across 50 countries, making it easy for people to book travel and excursions on the go. Roberto Macina, CEO and founder of Qurami, said: “Apple’s continued innovation inspires us to create the best mobile experiences and make our customers’ lives just a little bit easier. Apple’s app ecosystem is the anchor for our business, and developing across Apple’s operating systems has enabled us to easily and quickly bring the Qurami experience to iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch users.” Thousands of companies are expanding because of their work with Apple, which supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in communities large and small across Europe. Milan-based Laboratorio Elettrofisico makes some of the most sophisticated magnetization equipment in the world and their technology enables some of the industry-leading magnetic features found in Apple products.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Union Square Highlights New Design Elements, Community Programs SAN FRANCISCO — May 19, 2016 — Apple® today revealed its new store on San Francisco’s Union Square, offering many new features and services rolling out to Apple retail stores worldwide. The new store will open its signature 42-foot tall sliding glass doors to customers on Saturday, May 21 at 10 a.m.  “Fifteen years ago today Apple opened its first two stores and we’re thrilled to mark the occasion with the opening of Apple Union Square in San Francisco,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail and Online Stores. “We are not just evolving our store design, but its purpose and greater role in the community as we educate and entertain visitors and serve our network of local entrepreneurs.”  Apple Union Square’s glass doors open the store to Post Street and Union Square. The building’s unique position connects San Francisco’s most famous square to a rejuvenated plaza to the north, creating a beautiful gathering place for the community. The art-filled plaza offers seating, public Wi-Fi, a 50-foot tall “green wall” and regular acoustic performances. The store is powered by 100 percent renewable energy, including power produced by photovoltaic panels integrated into the building’s roof. “We have a deep commitment to the cities we work in, and are aware of the importance that architecture plays in the community,” said Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “It all starts with the storefront — taking transparency to a whole new level — where the building blends the inside and the outside, breaking down barriers and making it more egalitarian and accessible.”  Features in the new Apple Union Square design include: “The Avenue,” inspired by the window displays along a boulevard that dynamically change with the season. Avenue walls are interactive themed “windows” where Apple’s products and services come to life, from music, to creativity, apps, photography and more. New “Creative Pros,” Apple experts in creative arts, offer advice and expertise at each of the displays. Customers will also find “Only at Apple” products on the Avenue, a curated collection of third-party accessories. “Genius Grove” invites customers to get support working side-by-side with Geniuses under the comfortable canopy of local trees in the heart of the store. “The Forum” is a vibrant gathering place, centered around a 6K Video Wall. It is home to “Today at Apple,” which brings to the community the world’s most talented artists, photographers, musicians, gamers, developers and entrepreneurs to inspire and educate our customers to go further with the things they are passionate about. Today at Apple includes year-round programs for kids, new monthly events for teachers, sessions for current and aspiring developers, Creative Sessions in partnership with local experts in creative arts, Game Night with editors from Apple’s App Store® and more. The Forum and Video Wall are a place of discovery, including events about the making of movies from iTunes®, or exclusive premieres of new music and music videos from Apple Music™.  “The Plaza” will be found only at Apple’s most significant stores, including Apple Union Square. It’s open to the public 24 hours a day, features public Wi-Fi and seating, and takes Today at Apple outside, with a regular weekend series of well known local acoustic performances such as Travis Hayes and global talents like Escondido, who will then give exclusive interviews about their craft in the Forum. The Plaza at Apple Union Square features a fountain by well-known San Francisco sculptor Ruth Asawa, originally commissioned in 1969, and a new work, “Love” by local artist Laura Kimpton, commissioned by Hyatt Hotels.  “The Boardroom” is an intimate space where the store’s Business Team offers hands-on advice and training to entrepreneurs, developers and other small and medium business customers. Apple’s original San Francisco store opened on Stockton Street in 2004 with about 100 employees. Having welcomed more than 20 million visitors, and seen the launch of iPhone®, iPad®, MacBook Air®, Apple TV®, Apple Watch® and more, the team moving to Apple Union Square has grown to more than 350.  While the store offers regular learning experiences in the Forum and Plaza, Apple is also committed to furthering creative arts education throughout San Francisco. Apple is working with the Ruth Asawa School of the Arts to build a visual arts lab with 45 workstations outfitted with the latest Apple products.  Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV.

Over one million people in the city work in the tech sector, and over 40 percent of graduates from local universities specialize in engineering or information technology. “This is a huge vote of confidence in India’s developer community and a tremendous opportunity to gain world-class design and development expertise,” said Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal. “Apple’s support will help drive growth and accelerate progress among the country’s vast talent pool.” “We have worked closely with Apple to transform the Snapdeal app and offer our users the best possible experience,” said Snapdeal co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl. “Apple’s expert guidance on the interface and user experience has helped us build an app that our consumers love. We are thrilled Apple will have a local presence which will amplify our efforts to develop more high-quality apps for our digital commerce ecosystem.” “Apple’s investment in Bengaluru through its iOS Development Accelerator will have far-reaching effects for the area’s rapidly growing and highly talented developer community,” said NASSCOM President R Chandrashekhar. “The skills and training they gain through this effort will significantly improve their app design and help them reach a broader market. Initiatives like these move the country forward in our efforts to advance a growth-led and sustainable technology sector.” The iOS App Design and Development Accelerator is expected to open in early 2017.

DailyTimes | India offers tax concessions to Apple to expand production Toggle navigation    Home Pakistan World Business Sport Life & Style Opinion Blogs Today's Paper E-PAPER Archives India offers tax concessions to Apple to expand production By:   agencies 24-May-17 Top News Manchester bleeds 24-May-17 364 MANCHESTER: A suicide bombing ... PTI ready for ‘examination’ by ECP in foreign funding case 24-May-17 404   ISLAMABAD: Pakis ... NEW DELHI: India has offered to allow Apple Inc to import mobile handset components intended for use in local manufacturing tax free, a top government official said on Tuesday. The tax concessions will be subject to the condition of increasing local value addition over a period of time. Apple Inc wants to expand its contract manufacturer's facility in the southern Indian tech hub of Bengaluru, a federal minister said on Tuesday, as the iPhone maker seeks a bigger share in one of the world's biggest smartphone markets. Cupertino, California-based Apple last week started making iPhone SE at its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron's plant in Bengaluru.. Apple, which sold over 50 million iPhones in the March quarter, down 1 percent year-on-year, is looking for new markets as its sales in China have weakened. Among a set of tax concessions, Apple had initially sought a 15-years tax holiday for all components that it would import for setting up a manufacturing facility in India. A panel of ministries rejected that demand and has offered a phased program to increase the share of local production in the manufacturing, Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and IT said. "We have offered them tax exemptions on those components which could not be manufactured in India," Sundararajan told Reuters, adding that local manufacturing component would have to be increased gradually. Apple has agreed to increase local share in production over a period of time, but there was a difference between the plans of the two sides, she said. Apple was not immediately available for comment. India wants Apple to raise value addition share in phases of 3,5,7 and 10 years as the local capacity builds up, part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plans to boost manufacturing. Industry estimates the phased manufacturing program could increase local value addition in mobile phones manufacturing to 40-50 percent in the next three years. Earlier, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the federal minister for Electronics and IT said government officials were in touch with Apple and other mobile phone manufacturers about expanding facilities and setting up new plants. "It will be a little early to say that India and Apple have agreed on the common ground," said the official, adding India was ready to work out a roadmap to encourage manufacturing. Industry estimates total value of mobile phones produced in India touched near 900 billion Indian rupees ($13.90 billion) compared with 540 billion rupees in the previous year. "We are waiting for Apple to come back," said Sundararajan.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Two pros enter, one pro leaves: Microsoft’s… Two pros enter, one pro leaves: Microsoft’s Surface Pro takes on Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 By Jayce Wagner — Updated May 23, 2017 4:57 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Now more than ever, ultra-portable tablets and laptops allow us to get work done from anywhere, without sacrificing power for portability. These two features are no longer mutually exclusive, which means the market is chock-full of nimble, lightweight solutions that will appeal to consumers of all demographics. Capitalizing on the burgeoning trend, Microsoft has doubled-down on its popular Surface Pro 2-in-1, by refreshing the internal components with the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 chips, refining the internal design, and iterating on a winning form factor. But it’s still just a tablet, right? Well, yes and no. Between the Type Cover and a full version of Windows 10, the new Surface Pro continues to provide a decent mobile computing experience in a lightweight package. Unlike the iPad Pro, which uses a modified version of Apple’s iOS, the Surface Pro is a fully-functional laptop (when you want it to be). With that in mind, let’s see how the new Surface Pro stacks up against a portable, premium laptop: Apple’s latest MacBook Pro 13. Specs MacBook Pro 13 Surface Pro (2017) Dimensions 13.75 x 9.48 x .61 (in) 11.50 x 7.9 x 0.33 (in) Weight  4.02 pounds 1.69 – 1.73 pounds Processor  6th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 7th-generation Intel Core m3, i5, or i7 RAM 8GB, 16GB 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB Display 13.3-inch Retina display 12.3-in PixelSense Display Resolution 2,560 × 1,600 2,736 x 1,824 Storage 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD Networking 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, optional LTE Ports 2x or 4x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), any can charge; 3.5mm headset 1x USB Type-A, Surface Connect, 3.5mm headphone jack, Mini DisplayPort, microSDXC card reader Webcam 720p FaceTime HD Windows Hello face sign-in camera, 5.0MP 1080p front-facing camera, 8.0MP 1080p rear-facing autofocus camera Operating System MacOS Sierra Windows 10 Battery Up to 10 hours Up to 13.5 hours Price $1,500+ $800+ Availability Available now Available June 15, 2017 Review 6 out of 10 Hands-on Design: Magnesium vs. aluminum The MacBook Pro 13, for all its faults, is a remarkably well-designed product. Apple’s industrial design is iconic, simple, and high-quality in a way most competitors have yet to match. That said, Microsoft has come closer than ever before with its latest Surface lineup, including the new Surface Pro. The Surface Pro’s magnesium-alloy chassis feels every bit as nice as the MacBook Pro 13’s aluminum unibody. They’re both rock-solid, and nearly seamless. Metal-and-glass construction makes both a joy to use, and they’re robust enough that tossing them in a bag never feels like a dangerous proposition. In everyday use, the MacBook Pro is just present enough — it does an excellent job of getting out of your way. The keyboard has short travel, but a welcome tactile feel, and the trackpad is large and spacious. Conversely, the Surface Pro offers a uniquely intuitive user experience with its touchscreen and Surface Pen integration. The MacBook Pro 13 is a great laptop, but the Surface Pro is a great tablet, with some laptop functionality. The keyboard cover, upholstered with that super-soft and luxurious Alcantara fabric, gets the job done and looks good doing it — but more often than not you might find yourself foregoing it entirely to interact with the Surface Pro’s gorgeous and responsive touchscreen. Both products exemplify different design sensibilities, delivering near-perfect craftsmanship in their own unique ways. They’re both at the top of their respective games, using clever, elegant design to elevate what could otherwise be typical and pedestrian user experiences. Bottom line, which one has the better overall design? Considering nothing else but product design, the MacBook Pro 13 is hard to beat as a laptop, and the Surface Pro is hard to beat as a tablet. That’s really it. This is the one area where there these two products are too different to really compare. Declaring a winner here would be a disservice to both products, both achieve and execute their design goals near-perfectly. Winner: Tie Power: 6th-generation Iris vs. 7th-generation HD If you just looked at the spec sheet, it might be hard to determine which one of these products was which. Both feature similar processor options, both have similar RAM and storage options, and both have a conspicuous lack of ports. Plus, neither the MacBook Pro 13 or the Surface Pro feature discrete graphics cards, instead relying on Intel HD or Intel Iris graphics. When it comes to memory and storage, both products have a decent range of choices available. The Surface Pro dips a little deeper into the low-end with its lowest RAM and storage options than the MacBook Pro 13 does, but otherwise the mid and high-end versions of both products can be scaled up to the same maximums — 1TB of storage space, and 16GB of RAM. In everyday use, both products provided more than enough horsepower to get through a typical workday. Neither one is going to be good for games beyond maybe Hearthstone, but neither is going to hold you back while doing some serious multi-tasking, either. It’s worth mentioning that the Surface Pro is running the latest 7th-generation “Kaby Lake” processors from Intel, so even though they’re comparable to what’s under the hood of the MacBook Pro 13, they’re going to have a little bit of a leg up when it comes to raw performance and energy efficiency. Also, the MacBook Pro features Intel Iris graphics up and down the line, which is a bit of a step up from the Intel HD graphics featured on the Core m3 and Core i5 versions of the Surface Pro. However, you can enjoy Intel Iris graphics if you opt for the Core i7 model of Surface Pro. Overall, the systems are very similar in performance. The MacBook Pro is more powerful in its base configuration, but also more expensive. They’re about equal in top-tier trim; however, the Surface Pro uses the latest Intel processors, so it obtains the win. Winner: Surface Pro Form factor: Tablet vs. laptop This is a battle between two ultra-portable computers, after all, so portability is of critical importance. Which one has the greater work-from-anywhere factor? Well for that answer, we’ll need to carefully weigh our options. Seriously, weight is an important aspect here. The MacBook Pro 13 is remarkably small; it’s svelte and slim, and at just four pounds, it fits in almost any messenger bag or backpack with ease. The Surface Pro is also thin and light, weighing in at just under two pounds. You could stuff two Surface Pros into a bag and it would still be lighter than a single MacBook Pro 13. It’s almost cheating, though. The Surface Pro’s keyboard doesn’t house any hardware — it’s just a keyboard — and it’s partially made of fabric. Still, the Surface Pro is far lighter than the lightweight MacBook Pro 13, and it has a few other advantages worth mentioning. Namely, it’s a 2-in-1. Need to type up a paper from a coffee shop? No problem, just pop the keyboard on there and get started. Need a tablet to read before bed? Sure thing, Surface Pro has you covered… just snap the keyboard off. These are two things that the MacBook Pro 13, as a traditional laptop, just can’t do. Add on top of that the Surface Pro’s superior battery life, and we have a clear winner here. The Surface Pro lasts around 13 hours on a single charge, while the MacBook Pro 13 only made it about nine hours on our internal tests. While the MacBook Pro 13 is one of the most portable laptops on the market today, the Surface Pro has it beat because of its versatility — it is by its very nature more portable. Winner: Surface Pro Price: A lot of money vs. even more money Well, this one’s pretty straightforward, right? Just point out which one costs more, full stop. Unfortunately, it’s actually a little tricky to tease out which one is the better value. Sure, the MacBook Pro 13 starts at $1,500, and the Surface Pro starts at $800 — that’s a pretty clear-cut difference — but that’s for the barebones versions of both products, and the prices only go up from there. For $1,500, you can get a decent MacBook Pro. For $800, however, you’d get a very underpowered Surface Pro running an Intel Core m3 processor that has pretty low headroom when it comes to real computing tasks — like running more than a handful of applications at a time. Moving on up the spectrum, the MacBook Pro 13 tops out at $2,900 for the fully tricked-out version, while the Surface Pro tops out at $2,700. At those prices, that’s a pretty narrow margin, and both products net you nearly identical specs. It’s also worth mentioning that no matter how much you spend on the Surface Pro, it doesn’t come bundled with any of the above-pictured accessories. That’s right, no Type Cover, Surface Pen, or Surface Dial will be in the box — even if you invest in the fully-loaded version. It’s an odd choice, given that the Surface Pro isn’t a 2-in-1 without the keyboard component, and you’ll have to spend an extra $130 for the privilege. Add on to that another $60 for the Surface Pen, and the grand total comes out to $2,890. That only puts it at ten bucks cheaper than a fully maxed-out MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar. Add the keyboard cover and pen to the low-end version of the Surface Pro and you’re looking at $990, which is an awful lot to spend on a “laptop” with an underpowered Intel m3 processor and the bare minimum amount of RAM and storage space. Winner: Tie Innovative design gives Surface Pro the win Which one should you buy? Well, there are plenty of great laptops, tablets, and hybrid 2-in-1s on the market today, and some of them might even require less compromise than one of these two products. The Surface Pro suffers from unfortunate up-charging, and the MacBook Pro 13 is a little too expensive for what you end up getting, and the Touch Bar is only available on the mid and high-end models. Still, the Surface Pro gains the nod. It’s slightly less expensive and more versatile than the MacBook Pro 13, yet also takes a minor edge in hardware. Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 is no slouch, but it feels a bit old-fashioned compared to Microsoft’s latest.

Baig , USA TODAY Published 7:18 p.m. ET May 23, 2017 | Updated 5 hours ago 255 Shares CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share When it comes to who's more loyal between iPhone and Android users, we have a clear winner as more people prefer to stick with their iPhones in the next 12 months, according to Morgan Stanley. Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more. Buzz60 Apple appears to be in the very early stages of readying a 5G-capable iPhone. The company filed an application for an “experimental radio service (other than broadcast)” with the Federal Communications Commission, to conduct wireless tests in two locations, one in the company’s Cupertino, Calif., backyard, the other in nearby Milpitas. Apple is seeking to test wireless technology known as “millimeter wave.” The application listed the 28 and 39-gigahertz spectrum bands. Business Insider first uncovered the FCC application, which USA TODAY has also seen. 5G, which promises blistering download speeds, is coming soon It’s hardly a surprise that Apple would be pursuing a path to 5G. The promise of this next generation of wireless is that smartphone makers might eventually achieve blistering wireless data speeds of 1 gigabit per second and beyond, along with low latency and other potential benefits. In the U.S., Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile are all chasing their own 5G future—and each other. Still, the road to 5G is a long one, suggesting that a true 5G iPhone is a ways off. The infrastructure is still being built out, security must be baked in, and industry standards are yet to be hammered out. Wireless 5G is not likely to approach mainstream adoption before 2020 at the earliest. According to the application, the estimated duration of Apple’s tests is 12 months. And as part of the tests, Apple will be using transmitting equipment manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz, A.H. Systems and Analog Devices. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Joe Mullin - May 23, 2017 11:45 pm UTC Enlarge / A Nokia store in Helsinki, Finland, in 2013. Tomi Setala/Bloomberg via Getty Images reader comments 16 Share this story A litigation brawl between Nokia and Apple over intellectual property has ended just five months after it started. The companies said today they have settled all outstanding litigation and agreed to a patent license. While exact financial terms are confidential, Apple will be making an up-front cash payment to Nokia, followed by additional payments over the course of the agreement. Further ReadingPatent-holding company uses ex-Nokia patents to sue Apple, phone carriers"This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple," Maria Varsellona, Chief Legal Officer at Nokia, said in a statement. "It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers." "We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia," said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer. Legal hostilities between the two companies broke out in December. Apple filed an antitrust lawsuit (PDF) against Nokia, accusing the company of moving "massive numbers of patents" to patent assertion entities—known pejoratively as "patent trolls"—like Acacia Research. Nokia then reached deals with "each of its PAE co-conspirators" to separately enforce a diffused patent portfolio. Further ReadingSmartphone patent wars redux: Nokia sues Apple, big timeNokia counter-attacked the following day by accusing Apple of infringing fully 32 of its smartphone patents. According to Nokia, every version of the iPhone, from the iPhone 7 all the way back to the 3GS, infringed Nokia patents. All that has been laid to rest now. However, today's statement doesn't say what will happen to those lawsuits that were initiated by PAEs holding Nokia patents. In April, Cellular Communications Equipment, LLC, a unit of Acacia, sued Apple, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile.

The disclosure of the declassified National Security Letter came as part of Apple’s latest transparency report, which covered requests received between July 1 and Dec. 31. It also included disclosure of 5,750 to 5,999 classified National Security Letters. Read: FBI Gag Orders: FBI Secret Subpoenas To Collect User Data From Tech Companies Dropped 5 Percent In 2016 The letters typically come from the FBI and are used to demand the phone and email records of an individual user from tech companies. They have also been used to acquire IP addresses associated with the user and other electronic records, including browsing history and web records. Essentially the only piece of information that cannot be obtained are the contents of direct communications, which require a warrant. The FBI typically uses the letters to compel or demand technology companies and phone and internet service providers to hand over information from their customers. In many cases, the letters are accompanied by a gag order that prevents the company in question from informing the subject of the letter their information has been accessed by the government. While the declassified letter received by Apple will likely remain secret, its declassification suggests the case in which the letter was involved may have concluded or moved to a point where strict classification was no longer needed. The declassification also removes the gag order. Apple isn’t the only company to see a letter declassified. Earlier this year, Microsoft revealed the first declassified National Security Letter, which it also received in the second half of 2016. In a blog post, the company said there “are times when secrecy is vital to an investigation, but too often secrecy orders are unnecessarily used, or are needlessly indefinite and prevent us from telling customers of intrusions even after investigations are long over.” Read: Microsoft Releases First National Security Letter It Received From FBI The declassification is likely the result of the USA Freedom Act, which was passed in 2015 as a reform of the Patriot Act. Under the law, there are periodic reviews of decisions made by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, including all classified surveillance requests like the National Security Letters received by tech companies. If a review shows that a letter no longer needs to be classified, the review can declassify it. Recent figures published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence show that not only are classifications on the letters being overturned but fewer National Security Letters are being sent. In 2016, the FBI sent 12,150 letters, down 5 percent from 12,870 the year prior and significantly down from its peak of 56,507 requests in 2004. Part of the decrease likely has to do with tech companies increasingly fighting against the orders. Earlier this year, Microsoft won the right to continue a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of its customers over ongoing gag orders that effectively prevented the company from ever informing a user of a government investigation. Adobe also succeeded in a challenge over an indefinite gag order, which a federal judge determined was unnecessary and overreaching. Twitter has been an outspoken opponent of the secret subpoenas as well, calling them an "Orwellian situation." The social network also won a  suit over a government demand to reveal the identity of an anonymous user who had criticized the president.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About General Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Latest iPhone 8 parts leak points to exciting new feature Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 23rd, 2017 at 6:33 PM Share Tweet Amidst a slew of iPhone 8 leaks coming down the pipeline, the latest leak involves a purported photo of the top portion of the iPhone 8’s front glass. The photo (via Slashleaks) seemingly corroborates previous reports suggesting that Apple with the iPhone 8 will introduce a brand new facial recognition feature that can be used to unlock a device and perhaps to even authenticate secure transactions. Indeed, Apple earlier this year acquired an Israeli start-up called Realface with incredibly advanced and secure facial recognition software. Don't Miss: Forget the NES Classic Edition, this $40 console can play every NES game ever The leaked photo is below and, as you can tell, there are three additional circular cutouts that are not present on the iPhone 7. While admittedly speculative, it stands to reason that these cutouts are for additional camera modules Apple plans to incorporate to support a new facial recognition feature. It’s also worth mentioning that Apple’s plans for facial recognition may extend far beyond user identification. Specifically, there has been speculation that the front-facing cameras on the iPhone 8 may be used for gaming purposes insofar that users will be able to superimpose photos of their own head onto playable characters. To this point, recall that Apple in 2015 acquired Faceshift, a company with expertise in real-time motion capture. In fact, Faceshift’s technology was used during the filming of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. A video showcasing Faceshift’s capabilities can be seen below. Incidentally, the leaked iPhone 8 part above seems to jibe with other leaks we’ve seen, as evidenced by the rendering below. The two flaps in the upper left and right-hand corners will seemingly be used to display status icons like signal strength and Wi-Fi and, thanks to the deep blacks offered by OLED, will simply go dark when a user is playing a game or watching a movie.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: Microsoft Microsoft has condemned the Surface line to dongle hell Chris Smith @chris_writes May 23rd, 2017 at 6:09 PM Share Tweet Apple always gets speeding tickets for rushing towards the future, even if that mean frustrating its customers in the process. The company kills old technology for what’s next, and the iPhone 7 and the MacBook Pro are a testament to that. Last year alone, Apple killed the 3.5mm headphone jack on smartphones, and while it wasn’t the only company to do so was the only one that had to deal with the backlash. The 2016 MacBook Pros only have USB-C ports, which means they need plenty of dongles — and yes, there’s no good way to connect the iPhone 7 to the MacBook Pro. Microsoft, meanwhile, appears to be at the other end of the spectrum, and the brand new Surface Pro only proves that point. Don't Miss: This car gets over 2,700 miles per gallon The new Surface Pro has a few interesting features, including a faster processor, impressive battery life, and even LTE connectivity. But the device isn’t ready for the future. It does not have the USB-C port that’s currently used on more and more smartphones, tablets, and laptops. No, instead Microsoft is making what can only be described as a dongle from hell: a USB-C to Surface Dock. That’s right, rather than motivating people and companies to move to the next-gen technology — and USB-C Is definitely the future — the company decided to stick to the past. “I love the technology in Type-C, I believe in Type-C,” Microsoft Surface chief Panos Paney told The Verge. He just isn’t pumped. “When Type-C is ready for our customers, to make it easy for them, we’ll be there.” “If you love Type-C, it means you love dongles,” Panay said. “We’re giving a dongle to people who love dongles.” Yeah, that’s not really the answer. Sure, the Surface Pro is extremely slim, so you don’t have a lot of space for ports. But that’s why USB-C comes in handy. It’s really small, and you could always find space for it on a tablet-like device. “If you want to charge a device with a Type-C charger, you can. If you want to put data back and forth with a Type-C peripheral, you can,” Panay said. But only after you buy the dongle, which doesn’t have a price or release date yet. Microsoft did not want to remove the DisplayPort from the Surface Pro, The Verge explains, and there may be some merit for that. But supporting USB-C via a dongle on a brand new laptop just sounds so counterintuitive at this point in time. In case you were wondering how many ports the new Surface Port has in the first place, you’ll have to know there are quite a few connectors on it, including a full sized USB 3.0 port, microSD card reader, Surface Connect, headset jack, mini DisplayPort, and a Cover port. That’s a lot better than the MacBook Pro (2016), which only has USB-C ports. And it also shows Microsoft could have found a way to support USB-C on the new Surface Pro laptop.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple hires first VP of diversity by Sara Ashley O'Brien   @saraashleyo May 23, 2017: 1:53 PM ET Apple unveils new "spaceship" headquarters Apple has hired its first head of diversity. Longtime Apple employee Denise Young Smith has taken on a new role as vice president of inclusion and diversity. The company hasn't had someone heading up those efforts since Jeffrey Siminoff left the company to join Twitter in 2015. He had been director of inclusion and diversity since 2013. Smith, who has been at Apple since 1997, will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, a source familiar with the company told CNNTech. The news of Smith's new position was first reported by 9 to 5 Mac. Smith, who started in her new role on Monday, had already updated her LinkedIn page with her new title. Related: Twitter mostly meets its modest diversity goals Smith has held prominent positions at Apple. Most recently, she was vice president of global talent and human resources; she was also part of the leadership team that built out Apple's retail business. Cook has said that diversity is a "readily solvable issue," explicitly saying in 2015 that he wanted to hire more women. The company's latest diversity report revealed a workforce that's still predominately white and male. Although Apple did report a slight increase in hiring female and black technical employees in the U.S. compared to 2014.

Best Accessories for Apple Watch By Serenity Caldwell Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 2:00 pm EDT 1 Comment What are the best accessories for your Apple Watch? The Apple Watch may technically be an accessory for your iPhone, but it's also a powerful device in its own right — cataloging workouts, monitoring your heart rate, helping you pay for items, playing music, and, of course, telling time. The more you use your Apple Watch, the more you may find yourself wanting to accessorize your accessory with new bands, protective coverings, external monitors, stands, travel cases, or headphones. Here are our must-have accessories to pick up for Apple Watch. Get more bands You can completely change the look and style of your Apple Watch with a lightning-quick band swap — but to do that, you need new bands! Apple offers a wide variety of bands for casual and formal use alike, but the band market goes far beyond Cupertino: There are tons of third-party designs out there, along with ways to make your old watch band Apple Watch-compatible and customize the lugs. Apple Watch bands FAQ: Everything you need to know! Best Third-party Bands for Apple Watch Best third-party Apple Watch bands that won't break the bank Our favorite Apple Watch bands Protect your Apple Watch While the Apple Watch is a pretty hardy piece of technology, it's still vulnerable to being cracked, scratched, or otherwise damage when embarking on more unusual activities. The Apple Watch Sport, in particular, risks screen breakage, thanks to its Ion-X glass screen (the higher-end models sport stronger sapphire glass, instead). If you want to protect your Apple Watch while biking, Tough Mudder-ing, skydiving, and more, here are some ways you can go about it. Should you get AppleCare+ for your Apple Watch? Best Apple Watch cases Best tempered glass screen protectors for the Apple Watch Best ways to protect the Apple Watch while working out How do I keep my Apple Watch from scratching my MacBook Pro? Pick up an external Heart Rate Monitor for extra data Whether you have tattoos that block your Apple Watch from accurately reading your heart rate or you're an exercise fiend who needs more detailed information than a pulse oximeter, an external heart rate monitor might be just the ticket for you and your Apple Watch. Bluetooth chest and arm monitors wirelessly connect to your Apple Watch; they can log many more heart rate instances than your Apple Watch in a given time period — often more accurately than a wrist-based device — and might also save you from draining your watch's battery by keeping you from using the wrist sensor. Best external heart rate monitors for iPhone and Apple Watch How to pair an external heart rate monitor to Apple Watch Stands and travel cases At the end of a long day, your Apple Watch deserves a comfy and safe place to rest. You don't want to be scrambling around the house trying to find it on your way out the door, and you certainly don't want to accidentally knock it off of the nightstand while turning off an alarm in the dark. Investing in a stand will make everything easier — trust us. Best Apple Watch stands and chargers Time for some Bluetooth headphones On your morning commute, your evening jog, or your lunch break, a pair of headphones will let your Watch play you the perfect soundtrack for your mood and moment. Your Watch can also serve as the perfect control source for your iPhone — it just depends on whether you're grooving out to music locally on your watch or controlling it from afar.

Formerly Vice President, Worldwide Talent and Human Resources, Smith now works under a newly-created title: Vice President for Inclusion and Diversity. According to 9to5Mac, Smith will continue to report to Apple CEO Tim Cook: The executive shuffle will see the creation of a new VP role for Apple's Inclusion and Diversity team with Smith reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook. Sources say Smith has long had a passion for diversity initiatives at the company and the newly created position reflects an increased focus on the company's efforts. Apple SVP and CFO Luca Maestri will reportedly temporarily fill in for Smith at the now-vacant VP role for human resources. Previously, Apple's Inclusion and Diversity fell under the Human Resources umbrella and was led by a director, reporting to Smith in her role as head of that department. As a separate entity reporting directly to Tim Cook, hopefully we'll see issues of diversity within Apple get more attention from the top levels of the company.

Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Millions of people love Apple computers and wouldn’t be caught using a PC. By contrast, there are many millions of PC users who feel the same way about Apple computers. Many men like double-breasted suits, but I wouldn’t be caught dead in one. Some people swear by Cadillac cars, but my favorite is Mercedes-Benz. Despite these strongly held preferences, there’s no conflict. We never see Apple computer lovers picketing firms that serve PC lovers. Mercedes-Benz lovers don’t battle Cadillac lovers. In free markets, people with strong differences in preferences get along and often are good friends. The reason is simple. If you like double-breasted suits and I like single-breasted suits, we get what we want. Contrast the harmony that emerges when there’s market allocation with the discord when there’s government allocation. For example, some parents want their children to say a morning prayer in school. Other parents are offended by that idea. Both parents have a right to their tastes, but these parental differences have given rise to conflict. Why is there conflict? The answer is simple. Schools are run by government. Thus, there are going to be either prayers in school or no prayers in school. That means parents who want their children to say prayers in school will have to enter into conflict with parents who do not want prayers in school. The stakes are high. If one parent wins, it comes at the expense of another parent. The losing parents have their preferences ignored. Or they must send their children to a private school that has morning prayers and pay that school’s tuition plus property taxes to support a public school for which they have little use. The liberty-oriented solution to the school prayer issue is simple. We should acknowledge the fact that though there is public financing of primary and secondary education, it doesn’t follow that there should be public production of education. Just as there is public financing of M1 Abrams main battle tanks and F/A-18 fighter jets, it in no way follows that there should be government production of those weapons. They are produced privately. There’s no government tank and fighter jet factory. The same principle should apply to education. If state and local authorities annually spend $15,000 per student, they could simply give each parent a voucher of that amount that could only be used for education. That way, the parent would be free to choose. If you wanted to send your children to a school that does not have morning prayers, you would be free to do so. And I could send my children to a school that does. As a result, you and I would not have to fight. We could be friends, play tennis and have a beer or two together. Free-market allocation is conflict-reducing, whereas government allocation enhances the potential for conflict. But I’m all too afraid that most Americans want to be able to impose their preferences on others. Their vision doesn’t differ from one that says, “I don’t want my children to say morning prayers, and I’m going to force you to live by my preferences.” The issue of prayers in school is just a minor example of people’s taste for tyranny. Think of the conflict that would arise if the government decreed that factories will produce either double-breasted or single-breasted suits or that there will be either Cadillacs or Mercedes-Benzes built or that there will be either Apple computers or PCs built. Can you imagine how otherwise-peaceable people would be forced into conflict with one another? Government allocation is mostly a zero-sum game, in which one person’s win necessarily means another person’s loss. The great ignored and overlooked feature of market allocation is that it is what game theorists call a positive-sum game. In positive-sum games, you get what you want, say an Apple computer, and I get what I want – a PC, in this case. My win does not come at your expense, and your win doesn’t come at my expense. And just as importantly, we can be friends.

The number marks a 9% rise from the same period in 2016, according to analyst company Gartner. Samsung and Apple keep their top positions, but Chinese companies Huawei, Oppo, and vivo are accountable for almost a quarter of all global sales. Samsung still leads comfortably, but experienced a decline in amount of devices shipped due to the discontinued Galaxy Note7. Apple is the second, but its sales remained flat, which meant it lost ground in the growing market. The following three companies all grew handsomely with Huawei reducing its deficit to Apple from 6.5 to 4.7 percentage points. Oppo managed to achieve a 94.6% increase in shipments and missed the third place by a margin of 250,000 units or 0.9 percentage points. vivo sold almost 26 million devices between January and March and holds the fifth place with a 6.8% market share. According to Gartner, Vivo saw growing demand of its smartphones from the emerging markets in Asia/Pacific, including India, where sales grew over 220 percent thanks to its increased brand appeal. Analysts also published distribution of worldwide smartphone sales by OS. Android is still the top operating system with 86.1% of the devices, while iOS accounts for 13.7%. Other platforms only contributed 0.2% of the sales.

But we haven't seen the device in any shape or form, until today. Thanks to models given to case manufacturers (usually a credible place to get leaks) we get our first look at what the new iPad Pro will look like. There's still a front-placed home-button-slash-TouchID-sensor, a camera lens in the top left corner along with an LED flash, and three microphones. Exclusive: 10.5‑inch iPad Pro (The model that case manufacturers received from the factory) 100% confirmed. Already in mass production. pic.twitter.com/5S9xNTLuZl Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 23, 2017 The leaked images come courtesy of concept and render artist Benjamin Geskin. He claims the models he obtained were given to case manufacturers and is already used for designing cases and accessories. Below you could find a mockup he made from the models which serves the purpose of giving us a rough idea of the device's scale. 10.5‑inch iPad Pro (Case manufacturers mockup) pic.twitter.com/i7qSWos4bf Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 23, 2017 Finally Mr Geskin whipped up a render from the leaks to give us a relative idea of what to expect. The 10.5" iPad Pro looks very similar to the 9.7" iPad Pro though the side bezels on the left and right of the screen appear thinner. 10.5-inch iPad Pro | Updated Render pic.twitter.com/5j4T614nO9 Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 23, 2017 Via Related articles Apple to launch 10.5 iPad Pro and Siri speaker at WWDC Apple to refresh entire MacBook lineup at WWDC, rumor says Apple's WWDC 2017 conference to take place June 5-9 Apple iPhone 8 sized up against the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus Reader comments Anonymous qNhS 2 hours ago Smaller bezels on a tablet isn't revolutionary, it's missing the point and calling it 'courage'.

Because Apple's upcoming flagship is set to launch in September, the report has led many to speculate that the deal was made for the iPhone 9. Scroll down for video  It has been revealed that Samsung could supply Apple with 80 million OLED panels for 'new iPhone next year', the iPhone 9, (stock), which is also said to be offered in two sizes - a 5.28-inch and 6.46-inch APPLE'S IPHONE 9  A report has revealed what is believed to be information regarding Apple's iPhone 9.  Samsung and Apple have signed a non- disclosure agreement for 80 million OLED panels - Samsung would provide the screens.  Because Apple's upcoming flagship is set to launch in September, the report has left many to speculate that the deal is in regards to the iPhone 9. It was also revealed that the iPhone 9 will display will be offered in two sizes - a 5.28-inch and 6.46-inch. 'The two companies have recently signed a non-disclosure agreement on general conditions, including the screen size,' an industry source said in the report, which was first revealed by The Korea Herald. However, the person familiar with the matter noted that other details including the smartphones designs and functions are 'still under development'. If true, the iPhone 9 will surpass not just the iPhone 7s line, is also set to launch this year, which will be fitted with LCD screens. OLED, or organic light-emitting diodes, works by putting electricity through certain materials that glow red, green and blue. This technology allows the scene on the screen to seem more colorful, vibrant and detailed, compared to what is shown on an LCD display.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Nokia and Apple settle long-running patent battle China's Huawei takes aim at Apple with its first laptop line...

Share this article Share 13 shares Also, the 2018 device would also be deemed superior to the upcoming iPhone 8 – the largest display is said to be 5.2 inches. It may come as a surprise to some that rumors of an iPhone 9 are already floating around the web, as there are still months left until Apple unveils its highly anticipated iPhone 8 – which is also said to boast an OLED display.  Because Apple's upcoming flagship is set to launch in September, the report has left many to speculate that the deal is in regards to the iPhone 9. If true, the 2018 device would also be deemed superior to the upcoming iPhone 8 (artist impression) And this is not the first time an agreement between Samsung and Apple has been revealed. In April, it was rumored that Apple had ordered 70 million OLED panels - also from Samsung. The massive request was said to fulfill Apple's expectations that its upcoming flagship smartphone will 'fly off the shelves' once it hits the market.  The leaked order details were shared by a supply chain source familiar with iPhone designs with Nikkei Asian Review, which said coincides with a previous prediction by David Hsieh, senior director at research company IHS Markit. IPHONE 8 TOUCH ID  The latest rumors have revealed Apple's plans to put the Touch ID on the back of the iPhone 8. The sleek, black handset appears to show the sensor positioned on the back, just below the Apple logo and about the third of the way down the phone. An image (pictured) surfaced in April that claimed to be 'a late stage iPhone 8 prototype' that was designed with the Touch ID on the back of the handset. And if Nikkei's sources are correct – it could be the premium iPhone 8 model If the report is true, then the new setup could be part of Apple's plan to add facial recognition technology to the device.  It is now believed that Apple will be going with a type of metal material for the back, as 'the glass back prototypes were too prone to shattering when dropped'. 'Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,' Hsieh said. And he also previously noted that Samsung would be the one to supply Apple with OLED displays. However, Samsung declined to comment to Nikkei Asian Review, stating it is unable to reveal customers' orders.  Apple is set to release three phones for the iPhone 8 family – and the premium could cost around $1,099, as it is said to be fitted with a curved OLED 5.2 inch screen. An image of a PowerPoint presentation has revealed the Touch ID could be placed on the back, just underneath the Apple logo - putting to rest the many rumors that said it would be under the display The other two smartphones are believed to measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, both of which will have the liquid crystal displays. IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging   - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) models with a wraparound OLED screen - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass or on the back  - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition -Premium model could cost $1,000 Sources also told Nikkei that all three handsets will be designed with wireless charging functions – if suppliers can solve the overheating issues with the technology. And it is said that the trio will also be waterproof. The person also noted that one of the smartphones will have a 3D sensor that lets users access it through facial recognition technology. But those not interested in flipping the bill for the premium model will have a home button – only the handset over $1,000 will not have the feature, the person said.  A leaked image from this week has suggested that the Touch ID could be placed on the back, just underneath the Apple logo - putting to rest the many rumors that said it would be under the display, Apple Insider reported. The image was posted to Slashleaks, which highlights a slide from a PowerPoint presentation dating back to March 3, Apple Insider reported. Also shown in the pictures is the camera setup, which shows a vertical camera orientation with the flash underneath the modular – there is a small circle underneath the camera area. These details coincide with a leak from March 29th of an image claiming to be 'a late stage iPhone 8 prototype', which showed the home button also on the back and underneath the Apple logo. If these reports are true, this method could allow the firm to add facial recognition to the device. The 'prototype' image was obtained by iDropNews 'from a source with intimate knowledge of Apple's manufacturing facility'.    Read more: Here's Why Apple's 10th Anniversary iPhone Will Likely Cost More Than $1,000 | Fast Company | Business + Innovation Sketchy report suggests iPhone 8 will be named ¿iPhone Edition¿, Touch ID moved to rear, vertical dual cameras | 9to5Mac iPhone addiction bites -- to Apple's benefit- Nikkei Asian Review Report: iPhone 8 to start mass production in September, featuring Apple-custom ¿built-in¿ fingerprint sensor | 9to5Mac Apple redesigns fingerprint ID solution for OLED iPhone, say sources ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿iPhone Edition¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ | Rumor | Mac ...

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

The companies are moving forward as business  partners now. “This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple,” said Maria Varsellona, Chief Legal Officer at Nokia, responsible for Nokia’s patent licensing business. “It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers.” According to a press release from both parties,"under a business collaboration agreement, Nokia will be providing certain network infrastructure product and services to Apple. Apple will resume carrying Nokia digital health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in Apple retail and online stores,  and Apple and Nokia are exploring future collaboration in digital health initiatives. Regular summits between top Nokia and Apple executives will ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers." This proves that rivals can always become partners, specially if there's profit to be made for both sides.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Emilija Manevska / Getty Images Welcome to This Week in Wellness! Once a week, we'll bring you the latest news from the wellness world that has SELF editors talking while jogging. Here's what we're talking about… Some colleges are providing free tampons in the women's—and men's—restrooms. Brown University, Bowdoin University, the University of Wisconsin at Madision, and the University of Minnestoa-Twin Cities are just a few of the colleges now providing free menstrual products in both the men's and women's bathroom as a way to increase inclusivity for transgender students and increase menstrual equality. To this news, all we have to say is: YASSSSSS. A new survey reveals how Instagram might impact young people's mental health. The survey, conducted by the U.K.'s Royal Society for Public Health, polled 1,479 people between the ages of 14 to 24. The results suggest Instagram intensified respondents' "fear of missing out," negatively impacted their body image, and also worsened their quality of sleep and decreased their amount of sleep. Instagram did, however, positively impact self-expression and self-identity. The survey is by no means definitive proof that Instagram is "bad" for you, but the results are interesting.

Italy passed new legislation last week that requires parents to vaccinate their children from 12 preventable diseases, including measles and chicken pox. Parents who don't vaccinate their children will face large fines, and only children who are vaccinated will be eligible for nursery school. The new law comes after a recent measles outbreak in the country and increased debate from anti-vaccine advocates. FYI: Multiple scientific studies have proven that vaccines are safe and effective, and not linked with health conditions like autism. However, many parents are still wary of vaccinating their children due to fear. Paolo Gentiloni, the Italian Premier, said he hopes the law will combat "anti-scientific theories" about vaccines, theories which can affect public health.

I’m calling balderdash—the entire premise is flawed. Here’s why. Huawei’s Matebook X Huawei’s Matebook X What brought this to mind was the announcement of Chinese firm Huawei’s announcement of the Matebook X. See what they did there with that name? Matebook? It’s like “MacBook,” but it’s “Matebook.” Get it? Yeah, a blindfolded mole could spot that turd from a thousand yards away. Here’s Ars Technica‘s look at the device, which is annoyingly an autoplay video. I’m including it because Valentina Palladino does a great job of showing us the Matebook X.   It looks a lot like a MacBook, sort of. If you squint. And maybe borrow that mole’s blindfold. Fine, I get it. I get the allure of thinking good looking PC designs are “going after” Apple’s MacBook sales. I personally contributed to that trend when I called Microsoft’s under-powered, under-rammed, under-ported, and over-priced Surface Laptops “sexy.” Mind you, they are sexy, but that’s not really the point. Good Looking Windows Laptops Don’t Threaten Apple’s MacBook At the end of the day, Huawei’s (relatively) good looking Matebook X is just another OEM Windows laptop. Just like any other. Wait, that’s not quite true. Unlike many PC OEMs, Huawei is banned from the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure market for fear that China could use it to compromise our national security. So, you know, if you want to buy a laptop made by a company with ties to the Chinese government…feel free. But again, that’s not the point here. Any given PC company FINALLY coming around to good, thin design is just another company playing catch up. It’s them reaching for the bar Apple set. By doing so, they might hope to take share from some other hapless OEM, but they aren’t going to lure Apple MacBook customers away*. OEMs Are Nothing More than OEMs At the end of each and every day, a PC OEM is just a PC OEM. They don’t do anything special. At all. If one goes away, the market won’t even notice. The legions of other PC OEMs will each grow a tiny bit and the world will move on. This is precisely the argument I’ve made about Samsung’s delusions of relevance in the smartphone market. When you don’t control the software, there’s nothing special about you, no matter how fervently you wish otherwise. A slick looking PC laptop that reaches for Apple’s bar won’t change anything. Performance for Pros There’s one area where this isn’t true, and that’s performance, especially for professional users. We’ve written about how HP was going after Apple’s pro users with attractive desktop PCs. That’s a separate argument from design. Professional users need power, and if Apple is going to let its professional desktop hardware languish, as it has for almost 4 years, the company will lose customers to Windows. And when they do so, many of those users will choose better looking pro PC hardware over crappy-looking pro PC hardware. But performance is behind that move in the first place, not design. Matebook, Schmatebook From my perspective, Huawei’s Matebook X is about as important to Apple’s laptop business as any other crappy Windows OEM laptop. Anyone lured into buying it because of its looks wasn’t going to buy an Apple laptop in the first place*. *Asia? I gave myself an asterisk here because Asia—China in particular—appears to be less prone to operating system loyalty than Western markets. There’s less brand loyalty, too. Apple has experienced this first hand as iPhone copycats have taken share from Apple in China. Devices like the Matebook X, Surface Laptop, and any other vaguely attractive PC laptop have a higher chance of taking sales that would have otherwise gone to Apple in those markets.

And the “unlock software” would be looking for slight variations in the position of the eye/iris/reflections off the eye as the eye had to look at a couple of different points on the screen ?

Or, to put it slightly less melodramatically, from Android to iOS. The company has launched a new website prodding Android users to wake up and smell the coffee Siri is brewing like a digital hipster. Android and iOS are the only two mobile operating systems that matter Apple vs. Android: Buy the Ecosystem, Not the Gadget Apple vs. Android: Buy the Ecosystem, Not the Gadget You love your Android phone and want to buy a tablet. Everyone tells you the iPad is the best tablet, and it really is the best; but you should still buy an Android tablet. Read More . And while Android has the upper hand in most parts of the world, in the U.S. Apple still reigns supreme. Google has been tempting people to switch from iOS to Android Google Makes It Easy to Switch From iOS to Android Google Makes It Easy to Switch From iOS to Android Google just made it much easier to escape the clutches of the Apple ecosystem by switching to Android. And making it easier to switch between the two can only be a good thing for consumers. Read More for a while, but now the roles are being reversed. From iOS to Android to iOS to Android Having already launched an app called Move to iOS to accommodate Android users switching to iOS, Apple has now launched a website too. The goal, to persuade Android users to switch to iOS, is the same, but the methods have changed slightly. Because this feels… friendlier, somehow. On its new Switch from Android to iPhone website, Apple asks (and answers) 10 questions. These are designed to gently persuade the average Android user to make the leap across to iOS. In order to do so, Apple explains how easy it is to switch, and extols the many virtues of iPhones. Apple talks up the camera, the chipset, the regular iOS updates, the user-friendliness, the privacy protocols, the Messaging app, Apple Support, and Apple Stores as reasons to switch. It then reveals the fact that 97 percent of iPhone owners are satisfied (or very satisfied) with their devices. If that little lot isn’t enough to persuade you to switch from Android to iOS, Apple is offering up to $260 in credit when you trade in your current smartphone. Oh, and there’s also the set of five new videos revealing why the iPhone is superior to your crappy Android device. Apple Needs to Stop the iPhone Sales Rot This is an admission that Android is now number one Android Now Powers 9 Out of 10 Smartphones Android Now Powers 9 Out of 10 Smartphones The mobile operating system war is now over. And Android won. Because while Apple still sells shedloads of iPhones, 9 of 10 smartphones sold around the world is now powered by Android. Read More . Apple has recently seemed happy to coast along, knowing it has loyal fans likely to stick with the company through thick and thin. Now, it’s actually putting some effort in, which Apple knows it needs to do to stop the rot. Apple is obviously doing very well, with billions of dollars in the bank, and huge profits swelling its coffers every year. However, iPhone sales are down, with Android in the ascendency, so Apple clearly needs to up its game in order to remain in the lofty position it currently inhabits. Do you currently own an iPhone or an Android? What made you choose one over the other? Have you switched from iPhone to Android? Or from Android to iPhone? Why did you switch?Are Apple’s overtures likely to win you back? Please let us know in the comments below!

I actually like ios and apple products but it's more expensive and too much bugs in it. I expirienced good and bad. I have some good ideas that might help apple in this. 1) full support of ios to android programs + ios programs. 2) First product sale a bit cheaper (some discount to anybody who will change from android). 3) To make easier communication itunes makes things difficult for users. 4) to make easier transmition, receiving of ony required files. 5)bluetooth controls to make better working. Reply Matt May 24, 2017 at 6:37 am For me to be able to even consider moving to an iphone *shudder* they'd need to let me root the phone, block adverts, change the launcher to one I like, get rid of itunes, let me mount the phone as a hard drive on my pc, and so on. In short, they'd need to completely change their design philosophy. Not likely to happen. Reply Dntgvaf kabtifon May 24, 2017 at 6:03 am The ads actually say 'your phone' so Apple still has issues bringing itself to say 'Android'. Also once you switch it's not your phone anymore, it's an iPhone. So don't fiddle with it, don't change anything, leave it to the Apple gods to decide what's cool and what's not. Voluntary servitude to a once was dictator. Btw more Androids are sold in the US so Apple has lost its upper hand there as well. In fact name one market where Apple outsells Android. Even Japan has flipped. 12% of market share is just 2 points away from where Windows phone was...

The deal means Nokia will get bigger royalties from Apple for using its mobile phone patents, helping offset the impact of waning demand for its mobile network hardware. Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia's digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France's Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. "There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel," said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an "accumulate" recommendation for Nokia shares. "I have not given any value so far for Nokia's digital health business, but might apply an option value to it." INDUSTRIAL DEAL Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told the company's annual general meeting later on Tuesday that the deal would help expand network sales beyond telecom operators to global internet and technology giants. "(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centres," he said. "It's a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it." Under the patent licence agreement, Nokia will receive a "significant" upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. "It's interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure," said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped to their highest since February 2016 and were up 6.7 percent at 5.89 euros by 1509 GMT. A previous patent licence contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. "(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners," Nokia's Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. QUICK RESOLUTION Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution of the dispute between Apple and Nokia. "Nokia told analysts in April don't calculate on any licence revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia's legal expenses," said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. "For Nokia, it's good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact," said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. "The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros." Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the U.S. company's patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia's overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia's patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world's dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents. Nokia's total sales in 2016 were about 24 billion euros.

Nokia and Apple settled their ongoing intellectual property dispute Photo: LEHTIKUVA/AFP/File tech Nokia, Apple bury hatchet in patent dispute Today 05:40 am JST 0 Comments By Roni Rekomaa HELSINKI Nokia and Apple said Tuesday they were burying the hatchet in a bitter patent dispute with a cooperation agreement and an undisclosed cash payment by the U.S. tech giant to the Finnish group. By settling their ongoing intellectual property dispute, the two companies would "move the relationship... from being adversaries in court to business partners," Nokia's chief legal officer Maria Varsellona said. Following years of clashes, Nokia and Apple originally signed a licensing agreement in 2011. But last December, the Finnish group, once the world's top mobile phone maker, complained that Apple was using Nokia technology in many products without paying for it. And it filed lawsuits in Germany and in the United States. Concretely, the dispute concerned 32 patents for innovations related to displays, user interface, software, antennae, chipsets and video coding. The deal reached on Tuesday would put the two companies' relationship back on an even keel, with Nokia providing "certain network infrastructure products and services to Apple," the statement said. Apple would "resume carrying Nokia digital health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in Apple retail and online stores, and Apple and Nokia are exploring future collaboration in digital health initiatives," it continued. "Regular summits between top Nokia and Apple executives will ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers." Apple's chief operating officer Jeff Williams said the US giant was "pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia." The two sides did not disclose the financial details of the deal. But Nokia would receive "additional revenues during the term of the agreement," the Finnish group said. The up-front cash payment would allow Nokia to "provide a comprehensive update of its capital structure optimisation programme," a restructuring plan launched in late 2015, which may now be lighter thanks to the payment by Apple. © 2017 AFP Seminar: How to Invest in B&B's in Tokyo: Chinese Language Seminar 針對中國人及台湾人 介紹合法民宿的不動産投資講座 (中文主講) Sat, May 27th in Ginza, Tokyo Real Estate Japan Inc.

Young Smith, formerly the company’s global head of human resources, will take over diversity initiatives and report directly to Apple CEO, Tim Cook. She takes over for the previous head of diversity and inclusion, Jeffrey Siminoff, who served at a director level and reported to Young Smith. He left the company for Twitter in January of last year. It’s a step in the right direction for Apple, since best practices for corporate diversity indicate that having a CEO directly involved leads to more effective inclusion measures within an organization.

This change comes after pressure from shareholders over the lack of diversity of the company’s senior management and board at the annual meeting in February. Apple has released data about their employee demographics since 2014 and has seen little success thus far in improving diversity at the company. In June 2016, Apple’s U.S. workforce was 56% white, 19% Asian, 12% Hispanic, and 9% black, according to the company’s EEO-1 report. These most recent numbers show that not much has changed— there were only one or two percentage point differences for each racial or ethnic group compared to previous reports. Grace Donnelly  The company also remained overwhelmingly male. Women made up 32% of their global workforce last June, up just two percentage points from 2014. In Apple’s leadership, representation is even worse—82% of executives at the company are white and fewer than one in five is a woman. Young Smith is the only black woman among Apple’s executives and has been involved with diversity initiatives in her previous VP role. She has worked in HR at Apple since joining the company in 1997. “Diversity is more than any one gender, race, or ethnicity. It’s richly representative of all people, all backgrounds, and all perspectives,” reads her quote on the company’s diversity page. “It is the entire human experience.” Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Will the Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Really Start at Just $870? This Fool isn't buying it. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 23, 2017 at 4:15PM Analyst Steve Milunovich of UBS just put out a note in which he says that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 -- the premium model with an OLED display and other goodies not expected to be found on the standard models -- will begin at $870 for a variant with 64 gigabytes of storage capacity. An upgraded version, with 256 gigabytes of storage capacity, would be priced at $1070, he says -- a whopping $200 premium for the additional storage space. Image source: Apple. Let's look at what such a pricing scheme would mean for Apple's business and whether it ultimately makes sense. Low base price, high premium for additional storage At $870 for the base model, Apple would be charging a $221 premium over what the current base iPhone 7 model with 32 gigabytes of storage sells for, and just a $101 premium over what the base iPhone 7 Plus model with 32 gigabytes of storage goes for. That, to be blunt, seems rather low, considering that the iPhone 8 is probably going to be substantially more expensive to build than either of the more mainstream iPhone models, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. To illustrate, compared to the iPhone 7s Plus (which, itself, is likely to be more expensive to build than the iPhone 7s): The iPhone 8 should have an OLED display rather than a cheaper LCD, a relatively pricey stainless steel frame (the iPhone 7s Plus could have an aluminum frame), more feature-packed camera subsystems, 3D sensing capability, and a substantially pricier 3D Touch implementation necessitated by the inclusion of an OLED display. If we compare a hypothetical iPhone 8 with 64 gigabytes of storage to a hypothetical iPhone 7s Plus with 32 gigabytes of storage, I wouldn't be surprised if the bill-of-materials cost delta between the 64-gigabyte iPhone 8 and the 32-gigabyte iPhone 7s is quite close to the rumored pricing delta. At $1070 for the 256-gigabyte model, Apple's margins should be quite a bit better, but customers might have less incentive to step up from the 64-gigabyte iPhone 8 to the 256-gigabyte iPhone 8 than they do for stepping up from the 32-gigabyte iPhone 7s/7s Plus model to the 128-gigabyte iPhone 7s/7s Plus. I'm not buying it I don't think it makes sense for Apple to price the base model of the iPhone 8 relatively low while charging a lot for an increase in storage capacity. Instead, it would make sense to charge more for the base model, and then offer customers a nice deal on models with higher storage capacity. By having a relatively pricey base model (say, between $969 and $999), Apple doesn't have to worry as much about seeing a reduction in its gross profit margins if a customer opts to go for a 64-gigabyte iPhone 8 over, say, a 128-gigabyte iPhone 7s Plus. When a customer opts for Apple's most premium iPhone, Apple needs to be sure that it enjoys profitability commensurate with the level of innovation that it's delivering. Additionally, with all the rumors that the iPhone 8 will be supply-constrained around launch, it makes sense for Apple to try to maximize its profit per unit, especially since it's likely to be able to sell every unit it can produce (for a while, anyway). Then, if production bottlenecks ease and production costs go down, Apple could conceivably cut prices mid-cycle, if necessary, to stimulate demand.

Saudi Arabia and Russia desperately want oil back to its highs -- but just how likely is it? Taylor Muckerman and Sean O'Reilly (TMFrunAMuck) May 23, 2017 at 4:45PM It's been years since oil peaked at $100, and while prices have rebounded from the lows, they're still pretty far from those highs. In this week's Industry Focus: Energy podcast, Motley Fool energy analysts Sean O'Reilly and Taylor Muckerman dive into five factors that could theoretically lead to oil popping back up to $100 a barrel in the next few years. Find out how likely it is that things like war or natural disasters might shoot the price back up, what investors should make of production decline curves, and more. Also, the two examine news out of OPEC, and what this week's developments could mean for oil in the next few months. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 16, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, May 18, 2017, so we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining me in the studio is a man who needs no introduction, Mr. Taylor Muckerman. What's up, man? Taylor Muckerman: Then why are you introducing me? O'Reilly: You don't need one. Muckerman: Oh, but we'll do it anyway. O'Reilly: You're that special and important and cool. Muckerman: Only on this show. O'Reilly: No, you're important internationally. So, Saudis and Russians. Muckerman: Yeah, they're doing it again, extensions. O'Reilly: On today's show, Motley Fool energy contributor Matt DiLallo has a very interesting piece at the top of Fool.com, and it's: "What Would It Take to Get Oil Back to $100 a Barrel?" This is, of course, a question that's been on everybody's mind for 2.5 years now. Muckerman: Since the last time it was over $100 a barrel. [laughs]  O'Reilly: I appreciate you razzing me over stating the obvious. Well, some of our listeners might not think about how long it's been. Muckerman: Yeah, November of 2014. O'Reilly: But, first, we have to talk about two parties that desperately want oil to be $100 a barrel, which is Saudi Arabia and Russia. On, what was it, Monday of this week, OPEC got together in Beijing, China. Muckerman: Of all places. O'Reilly: I think they were like, "We have to see what demand is doing over here." Muckerman: Chinese demand has been waning a little bit. O'Reilly: Although, on the other hand, I think their domestic production has fallen 80% year over year, so that's not great. Anyway, after the meeting, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid A. Al-Falih, and his Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak, I'm totally getting that right, I think, the two ministers agreed to do whatever it takes to achieve the desired goal of stabilizing the market and reducing commercial oil inventories to their five-year average level. So, they want oil inventories to be lower. The Saudi Oil Minister added, "We've come to the conclusion that the agreement needs to be extended." Oil, of course, popped, what was it ... Muckerman: 3.8%, almost $50. Almost $50. O'Reilly: It's come down a little bit throughout the day. Between these two countries alone, you're talking about 20 million barrels a day of crude production and the planet produces 90-something. Is it 94? So, this is a little over 20% of global production in that room, never mind the rest of OPEC in there. I'm pretty sure, correct me if I'm wrong, OPEC is at 40%-45% of total global production? Muckerman: If you add it all together, that sounds about right. O'Reilly: And I'm including, of course, Venezuela. They really want oil up. [laughs]  Muckerman: They're trying. O'Reilly: I had a friend who asked me what was up, and I was like, your guess is as good as mine, but the Saudis really want that Saudi Aramco IPO to go really well in a couple of years. Muckerman: Yeah, they're talking, $100 billion, $1 trillion, maybe. O'Reilly: I think we might have mentioned on the show a month ago, but the Saudis want Aramco to be valued at $2 trillion. By the way, Apple just crossed the $800 billion mark consistently. Muckerman: Well, Apple isn't sitting on a bunch of oil reserves. They're just investing $200 million in Corning -- O'Reilly: The Saudis don't have the iPhone, or the Apple car, or whatever it is they're doing. Muckerman: They don't have an Apple car, either. O'Reilly: [laughs] Touche. Yeah, they're trying to make the brain for or whatever, relax. Give Tim Cook some leeway. Muckerman: Not anymore. O'Reilly: I don't know if you saw, but Bloomberg had that piece a month or two ago, I think we mentioned this, but they've having a hard time justifying the $2 trillion valuation, even if oil got up there. Muckerman: The valuation is reliant on future cash flows. So, if the demand for oil and production from other places around the world are rising, cash flows might not be there to justify $2 trillion. O'Reilly: And I think their evil plan was to select 10% of the company to the public, and then raise, ergo, $200 billion, and -- oh look, then they have the same amount of cash as Apple. Muckerman: Yeah, they might spend it more wisely on solar projects, not just hoarding it and buying back shares. O'Reilly: [laughs] You know what Apple does? They actually have a ton of T-bills. Muckerman: I know, it's super unimaginative. O'Reilly: I think they get 3% on them. Muckerman: How do they get 3%? Are they doing 30 years? O'Reilly: Yeah, 30-year T-bill is at 3.4% now. Muckerman: Do you want me to trust Tim Cook, and that's what he's doing with $250 billion right now?  O'Reilly: What are you supposed to do? Muckerman: I don't know, invest more than $200 million in Corning. O'Reilly: In Corning? Muckerman: That's what they did, they invested $200 million in Corning recently, because they make the glass for their iPhones. O'Reilly: Yeah. I would be super nervous that they were just after IP. Anyway, we're going to save this for Dylan tomorrow for the Tech show. Muckerman: Yeah, really, pass the baton. O'Reilly: So, Saudis want oil up for various reasons. Muckerman: I mean, all of them too, not just Saudi Arabia. The Russians do too, which is why they agreed to cut until March, nine more months. O'Reilly: I'm sure there's a few oil men here in the States that wouldn't mind that, either. Muckerman: Nine more months. O'Reilly: Yeah, they said it's going to go through March next year. Muckerman: Traders are happy, a little volatility. At least there's volatility somewhere in this darn market. O'Reilly: [laughs] Are you bored? Muckerman: Yeah, a little bit. O'Reilly: You want volatility because you're bored. That's really sadistic. Muckerman: I'm happy watching Amazon rise 1% or more a day. I'm cool with that. But, I come in, and I see a little bit of green, a little bit of red, a little bit of green, a little bit of red. Where's my buying opportunity, Sean? Where are my buying opportunities? O'Reilly: You realize there's going to be an epic crash tomorrow, and it's going to be your fault? Muckerman: I don't know. We've seen some pretty questionable things happening in the Oval Office this week, and volatility hasn't spiked at all. O'Reilly: That's true. Maybe it's like a deer in the headlights kind of thing. Muckerman: I don't know. O'Reilly: So, what would it take, Mr. Muckerman, and you're going to be aided by Mr. Matthew DiLallo, TMFmd19, he also has a Twitter handle, MatthewDiLallo. He has a really cool piece on the top of Fool.com right now. Here's what would need to happen for oil prices to get back to $100 per barrel. First reason, we probably need to explain the second one a little bit more, but, OPEC overshoots, and it gets into what we were just talking about. Is it possible that, with the supply cuts and the lack of investment and their desire to get inventories to their five-year average, they overshoot? Because not only do we not have great data on them -- I wonder how good of data Saudi Arabia has on Venezuela, do you know what I mean? Muckerman: I don't know, I feel like they probably share quite a bit inside the consortium of OPEC countries. O'Reilly: I would think it would leak, then. Muckerman: This is not the White House, Sean, this is OPEC. They're tight. They run a tight ship. This is their country at stake, they're not going to leak that kind of stuff. O'Reilly: [laughs] Are you salty about what's going on?  Muckerman: [laughs] No, just being topical. Yeah, I mean, it's very possible. They obviously didn't think that U.S. producers were going to ramp up this quickly, so they underestimated. Maybe they have a chance to overestimate their own ability to cut. And maybe like you said, underinvestment by other companies around the world catches up to them. I don't know if that will catch up to us in the next nine months. But it's possible, for sure. O'Reilly: I know we've talked about this in the past, and gosh, we were talking about this when Tyler Crowe was a regular guest -- we miss you, Tyler. Come back soon. Actually, I should probably have him on. Muckerman: Yeah, you should have him on. O'Reilly: But, the decline curve never sleeps. Really quick, for anybody that's new, what the heck is a decline curve? Muckerman: It's basically the curve of production for an individual well, or a collection of wells. Basically, they have decline curves for each individual well, so you can see the initial production and then production over the time. And generally shale wells have a steeper decline curve, meaning the average daily production declines more rapidly than a conventional well, like a Saudi Arabian well or offshore oil. Conventional generally has a much flatter decline curve. You're talking about losing significant percentages of overall production in a very short amount of time, which is why they've been drilling so much in the shale regions. Because you have to keep up production. O'Reilly: The best analogy I've ever heard, and for anybody who ever asks me at a Christmas party or something, it's a kiddie pool in the backyard. You have a pool, and you're draining it at the end of the day, and you pull the drain plug on the side, water comes rushing out at first, and that's the first couple of days or months of these wells. Towards the end, when there's not a lot of volume pushing out -- Muckerman: Yeah, you're losing your pressure. O'Reilly: -- it comes out as a trickle, and that's what we're talking about here. So, if you're not investing in new wells, if you're not drilling new wells, eventually production runs out, and that's what we're talking about here. This has been a major thing with the CEO of Core Labs. He talks about the decline curve a lot. And they have a lot of amazing data on -- Muckerman: They're not talking about their stock price. [laughs]  O'Reilly: God. What did you think about that bear case, by the way? Sidebar. Muckerman: I definitely agree, and I've said it before, that this company's future was relying on offshore, deepwater oil. O'Reilly: And if that's not happening ... Muckerman: If that's not happening, then a lot of projections for this company's success in the next five or 10 years need to be reevaluated. And that was one of the points that was brought up the Sohn Conference, that deepwater isn't doing what they expected. O'Reilly: Right. Because deepwater, even with the technology advancements, as I understand it, it needs $70-$80 for people to be thinking about it. Muckerman: Yeah. Those rigs cost a lot of money, the day rates with staffing ... O'Reilly: The risk, the hassle. You're going 3,000 feet beneath the surface of the ocean -- Muckerman: Before you even start to drill. O'Reilly: Yeah. It does sound like a bit of a pain. So, this has been a major bull case put forth by the Core Labs CEO. The report that DiLallo cites notes that the industry needs to develop 2.8 million barrels of new production capacity per day just to offset declining and depleting legacy output, which isn't something shale alone can handle at current oil prices. This goes on to say that that actually needs to happen by the end of the decade. So, whoever, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, China, whoever, needs to go find 2.8 million barrels of daily oil production at some point in the next couple years, otherwise there's going to be a supply shortage by the end of the decade. Muckerman: I don't know, I think they already have it found, it just needs to be justified to drill it. O'Reilly: OK. So, you think they know where it is? Then you get into the offshore stuff you were just talking about. Muckerman: Yeah, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves of any country in the world, but they can't produce it, because they can't produce it at the right price. So, once they can, that oil will be there. It just depends on if the price justifies being able to produce it. O'Reilly: Got it. So, this is always a problem with oil, but, wars. That's No. 3. Muckerman: No. 3, wars and rumors of wars. We've had a few of those recently, hasn't done much to the price of oil. Kind of like how it was back with the Arab Spring, when prices were sky-high. They were too high to react to uprising in the Middle East. Now, they're too low because production is capable of producing at prices like this, so prices aren't wavering on possible news out of Syria or nuclear war with North Korea, or anything of that nature. O'Reilly: So, I'm going to play devil's advocate, if I may. We've gotten little hints of what might happen -- we've definitely had some conflict, that's mostly cold conflict. But, we got a hint a couple of months ago of what might happen if something really bad happens in a reasonably large producer. I'm, of course, referring to the Libyan oil field outage. Their pipeline was in jeopardy, the field was still producing but if you can't move it, what you going to do? But that was 300,000 barrels per day of oil production. And oil was higher after that than it is now after the Saudis and the Russians saying they want to cut production more. Muckerman: 300,000 barrels is around a quarter of what OPEC and Russia have been cutting, so that's a pretty decent amount. O'Reilly: So, it would be another quarter to a third. I would wonder what happens if a bigger producer has a problem. Muckerman: I don't want to even think about that right now. O'Reilly: Conjecture? Muckerman: Yeah, it would be bad. O'Reilly: Well, that's what he's saying. We don't know, but it could be bad. Muckerman: It's definitely possible. Hopefully we're not involved. O'Reilly: Oh, wow, I didn't know this. He cites with this, through the Persian Gulf, 17 million barrels of oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz every day. Muckerman: Yeah, that's a critical choke point. That's no joke. O'Reilly: That's 20% of global demand. Muckerman: There's a similar Strait in the South China Sea. If you look at both of those, it's pretty heavily fortified naval presences by multiple different countries in all of these areas. Isn't the Strait of Hormuz right around Iran? O'Reilly: I think it's next to Egypt. Let's see. Muckerman: We're both googling it. Who can google it faster? Oh, I got it. O'Reilly: Is it next to Yemen? Muckerman: My map is coming up in a foreign language. Iran, it's Iran, UAE and Oman. O'Reilly: What was I thinking of? Oh, the Suez Canal. My bad. That's also somewhat important, actually. Muckerman: It is, but not as important in terms of oil as the Strait of Hormuz itself. A lot going on there. O'Reilly: This second to last one, the next point is the wrath of God, wrath of nature. We got a bit of that back in 2005, when Katrina hit. That hit Louisiana and south Texas, Houston, and that's somewhat of a problem, because that's where all of our hubs are. Muckerman: Yeah, I think when you think about that, it might impact refining a little bit more, so that could drive the prices up, because they have to shut down refining facilities, so then there's a backlog, when they come back online -- O'Reilly: So, gasoline prices would then go up, which would incentivize oil prices to go up, to refine it somewhere else. Muckerman: Yeah, and then they have to catch up to production, once the refineries come back online. I think a hurricane generally hurts the refiners a little bit more. O'Reilly: Yeah, this was a cool statistic. Katrina, when it hit in 2005, it knocked out 95% of the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, and at the time, it supplied 1.5 million barrels per day, which was 30% of America's oil production back then, it's obviously lower now. Muckerman: Ha, we were only producing 4.5 million barrels of oil per day back then. O'Reilly: What if something bad happens, Act of God, earthquake, something crazy somewhere else that produces a couple million barrels per day? Muckerman: It could have an impact, hard to tell how much, now that we're producing oil in a bit more of a widespread nature. But yeah, certainly other areas of the globe, if you had another nuclear disaster somewhere people might rely more on oil or natural gas for energy, certainly, anything's possible there. But, I think that one is just too hard to predict. O'Reilly: So is this last one. Drumroll, please. Matt DiLallo says the sleeping dragon demand awakes. Most people don't know this, but demand for oil globally is up 1.3 million barrels in 2017 over 2016. And it does make you wonder what happens if, I don't know, economic growth in India goes up a bunch next year or something. Muckerman: Yeah, a billion people. What is that, three times more people than we have? O'Reilly: I wonder if they sell Teslas down there. Muckerman: I don't think they do. But I'm sure if they have infrastructure, electric cars can't be too far behind. Out of all of those, I would say OPEC overshooting or a war would be the top two that I would be worried about. O'Reilly: I'll buy that. Muckerman: Wrath of nature could, but -- O'Reilly: You recover after a month. Muckerman: -- more unpredictable. The decline curves, yeah, that's definitely a worry, but I think we have enough wells in the United States and worldwide to overcome that, if prices creep up into the $60-$70 range. We'll find those extra 3 million barrels that we would need at the prices that would warrant it before it crept up to $100. I think it would take a combination of two or three of these five within a short amount of time to really ramp back up to $100 of a barrel. Because everyone would produce at $100 a barrel, everyone. O'Reilly: Yeah. Heck, I would, I would go buy property and get a drill. Muckerman: Everyone. And, in America, we're producing as much as we can produce right now. OPEC and Russia, they're producing not as much. So, the moment that prices justify it, that 1.2 million decline in their production could be turned on in such a short amount of time compared to people having to go out and drill to find this oil, that I don't think prices are going to go back to $100. O'Reilly: Because that's instantaneous, more or less. Muckerman: Yeah, very much so, relatively instantaneous. O'Reilly: Cool. Thank you for your thoughts, Mr. Muckerman. We'll see you next week.

Chicago-based Walton Street Capital has agreed to buy the building for about $370 million, according to sources. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune) Ryan OriContact ReporterChicago Tribune A Michigan Avenue office tower whose plaza will include Apple's new flagship store is about to get a new owner in a $370 million deal. That comes as the 50-story Leo Burnett Building on Wacker Drive is set to go up for sale. Valued at an estimated $530 million, it will be the most valuable office tower to hit the market in downtown Chicago so far this year. Chicago-based Walton Street Capital has agreed to buy the 35-story office building, 401 North Michigan, for about $370 million, according to sources. If the deal is completed as expected, the sale price for the former Equitable Building would be more than triple the $120 million that Chicago's Zeller Realty Group paid Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States in 2001. The approximately 760,000-square-foot office property includes a 22,000-square-foot Apple store that is under construction on the plaza alongside the office tower and the Chicago River. Apple's glassy new store is expected to open in October, about two blocks south from its current Mag Mile location. Zeller has invested heavily in the property, including the Apple store, which the Tribune previously reported would cost about $27 million to construct. In addition to the Apple store, the Michigan Avenue property is known for Pioneer Court in front of the office building. Zeller has had several public art installments on the plaza, including a current Abraham Lincoln statue and a previous one of Marilyn Monroe. The property is just south of Tribune Tower, along the north side of the river. The largest office tenant is the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, which leases more than 100,000 square feet. Zeller is expected to maintain a small ownership stake and to continue to lease and manage the property. Walton Street Capital principal Stephen Sotoloff declined to comment. Ari Glass, Zeller principal, chief investment officer and president, could not immediately be reached for comment. Zeller is being represented in the sale by CBRE brokers including Blake Johnson. Walton Street is a private equity firm led by billionaire Neil Bluhm. Crain's Chicago Business first reported Walton Street's deal on Michigan Avenue. A few blocks west of the Michigan Avenue property, the Swiss owner of the Leo Burnett Building plans to seek a sale of the more than 1.1 million-square-foot structure. It is owned by an investment fund managed by UBS Realty. The sale by UBS could test the staying power of an already yearslong rally of downtown Chicago office values. That run has included Blackstone Group's Chicago-record $1.3 billion acquisition of 110-story Willis Tower in 2015 as well as an $850 million sale of the tower at 300 N. LaSalle St. in 2014 and a $712 million sale of the Aon Center in 2015. Apple's new Chicago flagship store on the riverfront is taking shape. The roof is going in place this week as March draws to a close. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Nearly $6.5 billion was invested in downtown Chicago office sales in 2015, a record volume, according to New York-based Real Capital Analytics. Volume fell below $3.7 billion in 2016. Just under $418 million was invested in the first quarter of this year, the lowest quarterly total in four years. UBS is believed to be seeking offers of around $530 million for a Leo Burnett property that is more than 93 percent leased. The venture of Zurich-based UBS bought the tower, on the southeast corner of Wacker Drive and Dearborn Street, in a 2011 deal that valued it at $401 million. UBS spokeswoman Sheryl Lee confirmed plans to sell the building but declined to provide an expected price. "Its potential sale is part of the normal portfolio management process within the fund aimed at maximizing risk-adjusted return to investors," she wrote in an email. Virtually all of the property's space is leased to two tenants: advertising conglomerate Publicis Groupe, which has firms including Leo Burnett Worldwide and Starcom Mediavest Group in the building, and law firm Winston & Strawn. Both leases extend well into the 2020s, meaning a buyer would be assured of steady long-term rental revenue. Another huge property, the office and parking portions of the 100-story John Hancock Center, is expected to go on the market this year, owner Hearn Co. recently said. rori@chicagotribune.com Twitter @Ryan_Ori Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune UBS AG Leo Burnett Apple store along Chicago River takes shape Apple's Chicago River flagship taking shape @properties acquires 2 apartment-finding services, forms rental division Suburban builders seek class action to stop Zillow estimates Retail bankruptcies push available anchor store space to new high in Chicago area Sports Breaking Eat.Drink.Do.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > New Microsoft Surface Pro lands with more polish… New Microsoft Surface Pro lands with more polish and power, but no pen By Bill Roberson — May 23, 2017 12:25 pm Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Dialing up more Surface action Microsoft has just rolled out their latest follow-up to the Surface Pro, their top-tier 2-in1 laptop/tablet PC that initially debuted in 2013. In the four years that followed, Redmond’s “Surface” family of devices has gradually expanded, but that first crack at combining a laptop and a tablet proved popular, and now Microsoft has refined both the hardware and the software that make the Pro work. The new Surface Pro is a little bit thinner and little bit lighter than the original, and it’s packing the latest Core i7 chipset for a 20-percent boost in performance, and Microsoft says it will run for 13 hours on a charge, up from 9 on the original. The click-on Type Cover has also gotten a bit of a makeover, with improved action for the keys and some nice aesthetic upgrades. There’s also an LTE option to give the device more mobile connection options. You can also use the new Surface Dial with it, and the Surface Pen, while not included, has also gotten several internal performance upgrades. The new Surface Pro is up for preorder now and launches June 15th. Prices start at $800  but option up pretty quickly, so hit this link for all the details. Those poor lawyers Tech companies turn out some amazing products, but they also file a lot of lawsuits, which can seem to drag on longer than the lifespan of… whatever they’re suing each other over. However, it looks like Apple and Nokia have decided to bury the hatchet – and strike a new licensing deal at the same time. Fortune says Apple will give Nokia an unspecified cash payment and then, Nokia said it would provide network products and services to Apple. Apple will also resume carrying Nokia’s digital health products in its retail and online stores, and Fortune says the two companies will work more closely on health monitoring tech going forward. See, it’s much more fun to be friends! Now, if only Apple and Samsung could kiss and make up. Yeah, we won’t hold our breath either. Little 840hp solo coupe There’s an old saying in motorsports: if you want to go faster, just add money. Well, if you’ve been saving for the new 840-horsepower Dodge Challenger SRT Demon, you’re gonna need a lot of nickels, as Dodge has announced the base price of the car will start at just a tick under $85,000. And again, that’s for the base version of the street-legal dragster, which doesn’t even come with a passenger seat. Good news though: Adding in the optional three passenger seats, trunk carpet, and a box full of drag race parts will only set you back a buck each, probably because the car costs 85 grand. Of course, there are other more expensive options that will change the Demon into something even grandma would love to drive, including an 18-speaker audio system, heated seats, a sunroof, and even red seat belts. And, again, with over 800 ponies on tap, those things will hardly slow you down at all. Buckle up. We’ve got more news on our Facebook page and YouTube channel, and be sure to tune in to this week’s DT podcasts: Close to the Metal (computers and such) on Tuesday, Trends with Benefits (general tech shenanigans)  on Thursdays, and Between the Streams (movie and TV topics) every Friday.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > iPhone 9 rumors and news iPhone 9 rumors and news Samsung may supply iPhone 9's high-resolution OLED display, report says By Kyle Wiggers — Updated May 23, 2017 1:00 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Apple has yet to release the successor to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but rumors of future iPhones have already begun to swirl — including tidbits about the iPhone 9. The iPhone 9 could be years away, but a few of the details are starting to come into focus. Here is everything we know about Apple’s next-generation iPhone. Specs Samsung might supply the iPhone 9’s screen. That is according to The Bell (via The Investor), which reported that the Seoul, South Korea-based company will supply 5.28-inch and 6.46-inch OLED panels for Apple’s upcoming phone. “[The] iPhone 9 is expected to come in two OLED models — 5.28- and 6.46-inch display sizes,” The Investor reported. “Samsung’s OLED shipment is also likely to be more than double at 180 million units.” Assuming details are not adjusted down the line, the iPhone 9 could look radically different from the iPhone 7 and the rumored iPhone 7S. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD screens, respectively, and the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus’ displays are expected to retain those dimensions. The iPhone 9 will have a screen that is more vibrant and colorful than the iPhone 7’s. OLED, or organic light-emitting diodes, creates light depending on how much electric current you send it and dims black in the absence of a charge. That is in contrast to LCD panels, which have a persistent backlight that never switches off. The iPhone 7S and 7S Plus are rumored to debut alongside a high-end iPhone — the iPhone 8 or iPhone X — with a 5.8-inch OLED panel. If the rumors are true, it seems that Apple will equip all future iPhones models with OLED. Design Alushta, Russia – November 21, 2014: Man holding an iPhone 6 Space Gray with social networking service Twitter on the screen. The iPhone 6 was created and developed by Apple. The iPhone 9’s design remains a complete mystery, as of now, but there is a chance it will look something like iPhone 8. According to the latest rumblings, the upcoming iPhone 8 will boast a stainless steel body, a bezel-less curved touchscreen, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor that is concealed beneath the display and vertically oriented dual rear cameras. The front shooter is expected to be oriented along the phone’s center (in contrast to the iPhone 7’s off-center selfie camera), and the iPhone 8 is likely to ditch the home button for a digital, software-based alternative. Naming, release date and price Historically, Apple has followed predictable iPhone release schedule: Minor “S” models follow major upgrades. The iPhone 4S came after the redesigned iPhone 4, and the iPhone 5S came after the Touch ID-enabled iPhone 5. But Apple might switch things up this year. Rumor has it that Apple will release three iPhone models in fall 2017: The iPhone 7S, 7S Plus, and 8. If that happens, the iPhone 9 could launch as soon as next year. But if it doesn’t — if Apple sticks to its guns and releases the iPhone 8 next year — the iPhone 9 could be as many as two years off. If the iPhone 9 is priced anything like the iPhone 8, it will be expensive — analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that the 128GB and 256GB iPhone 8 will cost $1,000 and $1,100, respectively. But it could be in line with the iPhone 7S, which is expected start at $650 for the 64GB model and $750 for 128GB —  the same as the iPhone 7.
Digital Trends Home > Photography > Infltr is the first app to edit stills, video… Infltr is the first app to edit stills, video, GIFs, and Apple Live Photos By Hillary Grigonis — May 23, 2017 1:23 pm Subscribe Share Infltr Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you want to edit your GIFs, Apple Live Photos, photos and videos in a single app, Infltr is currently the only one that can manage all four. Love them or hate them, the moving photos called GIFs and Apple’s Live Photos are here to stay — and now there’s an iOS program that can edit them all. Photo editing app Infltr’s latest update makes the app the first program that can edit GIFs and Live Photos right alongside regular photos and videos. Version 2.8 of Infltr allows users to edit GIFs and Live photos, which makes the app the only one capable of handling the four most popular media types, according to the developer. The update includes 10 new tools that work across all four file types, including the ability to adjust saturation, brightness, contrast, filter intensity, crop, rotate, straighten, flip horizontally, flip vertically and change perspective both horizontally and vertically. All of the edits are saved in the photo’s history, which allows any of the custom edits to be undone later. Infltr gets its name from the infinite filter possibilities available with a swipe, navigating through a seemingly limitless number of filters that now number surpasses 7 million. The new GIF and video tools can be used alongside the platform’s original filters, which are applied in real time, to further customize the look. Adjustments can also easily be applied to more than one image at a time and favorite filters can be saved for easy access later. Along with allowing users to edit GIFs, Live Photos, images, and video after the fact, the app’s camera mode allows users to shoot Live Photos and still photos with filter effects already applied, showing the results in real time while still saving an original unretouched file. The developer says the saturation, brightness, contrast, vignetting, and filter intensity can all be previewed in real time in the app’s camera mode. Infltr is an iOS-only app that has received Editor’s Choice and Apple’s Best New App award in more than 150 countries. Infltr is available from the App Store for $2 for the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.

Business Insider points to the filing, in which the iPhone maker asks the Commission for an experimental license to use a new wireless technology called ‘millimeter wave.’ Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum. These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks. Apple intends to transmit from two fixed points located at Apple-controlled facilities in Cupertino and Milpitas, CA. These transmissions will be consistent with the parameters and equipment identified in Apple’s accompanying Form 442, and will include the use of a horn antenna with a half-power beamwidth of 20 degrees in the E-plane and H-plane and a downtilt between 20 – 25 degrees. Apple anticipates that it will conduct its experiments for a period not to exceed 12 months. Interestingly enough, one of the bands Apple intends to test (28GHz) has been allocated for earth-to-space transmissions. It was reported last month that Apple is recruiting satellite experts for a secret hardware team. The company is also currently in a legal battle with wireless chip supplier Qualcomm. Here in the US, major carriers like Verizon and AT&T have pledged to start rolling out their 5G networks to major markets later this year. T-Mobile and Sprint both hope to have 5G towers up and running by 2020.

Written by Pranav Mukul | New Delhi | Published:May 24, 2017 3:03 am IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday that Apple was in touch with government officials for scaling up operations in India. US-based Apple Inc is in discussions with the Centre to substantially expand its manufacturing operation in India through its contract manufacturer here. IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday that Apple was in touch with government officials for scaling up operations in India. Currently, the company manufactures the iPhone SE model through Taiwanese firm Wistron in Bengaluru. IT secretary Aruna Sundararajan later said that the Apple has indicated a plan for its entire product range and has also shared a road map with the government for indigenous manufacturing of the components that go into making iPhone models. “Right now what they’ve started is very small. They’re talking of a much larger plan where they want to bring in the whole ecosystem… They definitely intend to make all their products, is what they’ve told us, in the next phase, for which they are evaluating various options,” she said. Apple did not respond to a query by The Indian Express. The ministry is also trying to get the US firm to align its plans with the government’s roadmap for indigenisation. “The first thing they requested us was 15 years of duty free imports of the components. They’ve also indicated that they have a road map for indigenisation. Some of their components will start being manufactured out of India over a period of time. They’ve shared a specific road map. We, in turn, have told them that we ourselves drawn a road map for indigenisation because we want to drive up value addition, and so in consultation with the industry over the last two years, we have prepared our own roadmap. We have now shared that road map, and told them if they can align their road map, in which case we don’t need to give them any separate concessions,” Sundararajan said. Last month, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had notified a phased manufacturing programme, one that details a road map for fiscal benefits on production of components, in a periodic manner. The cellular device manufacturing industry has estimated a 39-50 per cent increase in value addition through the government’s phased manufacturing programme, which would look at local production of components in phases of 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. “We also admit that there will be some products, for which we will have to import duty free, because we don’t manufacture them. There’s no dispute on that,” Sundararajan said. Earlier, Apple had found itself at loggerheads with the government over the local sourcing norm for single-brand retail trading, when the company wanted to set up its own retail stores in India. The norms stipulate that at least 30 per cent of the goods sold at single-brand retail stores must be sourced domestically. Industry analysts suggest this is what could possibly have prompted Apple to set up, and now look at expanding, local manufacturing capacity. On Monday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also ruled out the launch of the firm’s cars in India in the next few years, considering that the supply does not exist in India for the firm to support the 30 per cent local sourcing norms. The government on Tuesday clarified that Tesla will not have to source local components if it plans to up a manufacturing unit in India.

Primary sources. Global perspective. advertisement Apple and Nokia settle ongoing patent dispute Tuesday 23 May 2017 at 2:05 PM ET by Madison Chajson ©  WikiMedia (-Majestic-) [JURIST] After a six-month legal dispute [text, PDF] over the right to use patents and other intellectual property, Apple and Nokia [corporate websites] reached a settlement [press release] Tuesday that covers all ends of the lawsuits filed. The suit came as a result of Apple stating that they would no longer pay to use Nokia's patents, many of which are built into Apple's miscellany of products. Apple claims that the Finnish telecommunications company is guilty of extortion while Nokia is adamant in defending their intellectual property. Nokia's former chief executive, Stephan Elop, said [Guardian report] the settlement "enables us to focus on further licensing opportunities in the mobile communications market." This is not the first time that Apple has been involved in a patent dispute. In December there was an installment concerning an ongoing patent dispute [JURIST op-ed] between the two electronics giants Apple and Samsung. In July Apple filed a brief [JURIST report] asking the Supreme Court to rule against Samsung in its patent infringement lawsuit. In January the US District Court for the Northern District of California [official website] granted [JURIST report] Apple's motion for a permanent injunction against Samsung for infringing upon three software patents. In August 2014 the US District Court for the Northern District of California denied [JURIST report] Apple's request to ban Samsung from selling any of its products that infringed on Apple's patented technology. Earlier in August 2014 Apple and Samsung agreed to drop [JURIST report] all patent infringement lawsuits in courts outside of the US.

I don’t mean that metaphorically, either: the question of where a user in a virtual world is physically, and how they’re interacting with the real world around them, is arguably the key to making the next generation of headsets. It’s something not only big names like Google and Apple are working on, but VR/AR specialists like Occipital. The San Francisco company isn’t new, but you’d be forgiven for not having necessary heard of it. For the past few years Occipital has been working on sensor technology that can map out a space in real-time, without relying on GPS or resorting to adhesive markers or beacons. That resulted in the Structure Sensor, an $379 iPad accessory that turns Apple’s tablet into a room-mapping 3D scanner. Now, the technology has advanced again, now mounted atop a mixed reality headset. Dubbed Bridge, it adopts the same strategy as Google Cardboard, Daydream, and Samsung Gear VR by putting a smartphone at its heart. However, though the iPhone Bridge is designed to accommodate does make use of its camera, the really clever stuff comes from the Structure Sensor mounted on the top and plugged in via Lightning. When I sat down with Occipital, the team was just preparing to ship its second batch of preorders. Sales of the so-called Bridge Explorer Edition had shipped in December to the early-adopters. Now, a new version – complete with 6-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) tracking and a brand new 3DoF controller – is headed out to developers eager to try Occipital’s Bridge Engine. The system is a one-two punch of hardware and software. The former distinguishes itself from other phone-based headsets by virtue of how it integrate’s the iPhone’s own abilities with external sensors. A wide-angle lens atop the phone’s camera can feed live video from the room around you into the headset for augmented reality (and, bluntly, so that you don’t bump into anything). However, Occipital is also using data from its own depth sensor to create a 3D view from that single wide-angle feed. The result is a slightly offset view served up to each eye, helping with binocular vision. In the process, Bridge also adjusts for the iPhone’s offset camera, so that your perceived view of the room around is from where your pupils actually are, not offset like the camera itself is seeing. It’s important, since Occipital isn’t just targeting virtual reality like Gear VR and Daydream. Instead, it’s aiming for augmented reality in the manner of Microsoft HoloLens. Unlike Microsoft’s visor, it doesn’t have fancy transparent displays; however, that keeps the price down – $399 for Bridge, though you’ll need to supply the iPhone 6, 6s, or 7 yourself, versus several thousand for HoloLens – and dramatically increases the amount of space for AR effects. That was put to good use in the demo I tried. Bridge first needs to map the room, a quick process involving turning it to look around the walls, floor, and furniture. From that, it builds up a wireframe of the space, so that not only do you see what the iPhone camera sees, but the Bridge Engine understands what’s a horizontal surface, what’s vertical, and all angles in-between. Occipital’s demo app puts a small robot – Bridget – into the room, which you interact with using the Daydream-style controller. You can point and click to navigate it around, with the ‘bot moving around furniture and other objects rather than just running straight through them. Dropping items into the space similarly acknowledges the real topography; at one point, I accidentally backed the robot into a corner by inadvertently positioning a virtual chair in its way. You quickly stop differentiating between what’s real and what’s digitally created, especially when virtual balls start rolling across real tables and bouncing down under and behind things. It’s pushing the capabilities of a smartphone hard. There was a very small amount of lag visible when I moved my head quickly, though not enough to cause any discomfort. The iPhone’s own screen resolution is another limiting factor; Occipital tells me that, even though some Android devices have higher-resolution displays, there are no current plans to support Google’s OS since the design, connectivity, and camera of each phone varies from the next. Google is, probably, Occipital’s biggest competitor. Back at I/O last week, the company showed off its new WorldSense tracking system, built on the indoor visual mapping technology developed as part of Project Tango. WorldSense works by looking for visual anchors in the world, using those as impromptu markers from which it can figure out where the headset-wearer is looking, and how the different objects related in 3D space. Early feedback suggests it works reasonably well, but Google is still apparently recommending that WorldSense systems – which will be standalone, rather than based on slotting in a phone – be used while sitting down or stationary. In contrast, Occipital’s setup allowed me to move around and, far from bumping into things, my biggest klutz was forgetting that you can’t put down real objects like the Bridge controller on a virtual table in that space. Already being on the market is another tick in Occipital’s column, as is existing Bridge Engine integration with popular platforms like SceneKit for VR and AR, and Unity for VR. I’m told developers have been able to get their existing mixed reality experiences up and running on Bridge in as little as ten minutes. For now, Bridge remains a developer-focused device. After all, you can’t really sell a platform to consumers without apps to use on it. Occipital isn’t saying quite how many devices are in the wild, but tells me that the last preorder phase sold out in a matter of days. The demand, clearly, is there. Now we just need the compelling mixed reality experiences to sell it to the mass market.

Business Insider brings word from an FCC filing in which Apple seeks permission to experiment with the new tech. The request states: “Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum. These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks.” According to the report, the firm is now able to test the data tech in two California locations, including its own Infinite Loop campus. Related: What is 5G? The application cites the 28GHz and 39GHz frequencies which have been assigned for commercial 5G use. Interestingly, the 28GHz band has been assigned for earth-to-space communications, which ties into recent reports claiming Apple had hired Google’s top satellite executive. Apple’s expansion into this area is interesting, given the onus is usually on the service providers to push the envelope when it comes to faster data speeds. Smartphone manufacturers and their partners can, of course, create wireless chips with greater capabilities, but until the networks make those speeds available, that capacity goes unfulfilled. From Apple's statement, it appears it wants to be at the head of the table to capitalise on the "operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks." Earlier this year, we learned Samsung is working with US carrier Verizon on 5G networks, with "multi-gigabit" speeds reached during initial tests. Given Apple's filing doesn't indicate a partnership with a service provider, perhaps it has something in mind specifically for iPhone users? Watch this space... or maybe just watch space. Are we currently limited by our 4G data speeds or is it currently sufficient for our streaming and downloading needs? Let us know in the comments below.

That’s where an iTunes or Apple Music gift card should come in handy. Upon redeeming, the amount shown on the card is added to your Apple ID in the form of good-as-cash credit that can be used for each purchase you make in Apple’s content stores. In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the types of gift cards Apple supports, how they should be used, as well as how to redeem your iTunes or Apple Music gift card and apply the credit toward an individual Apple Music membership or to top up your Apple ID balance. About iTunes and Apple Music gift cards iTunes gift cards and Apple Music gift cards can be purchased from Apple, PayPal, Amazon, eBay, Best Buy and a number of other retailers. iTunes gift cards typically come in $25, $50 and $100 denominations. Apple Music gift cards are currently available in $30 and $100 denominations for three or twelve months of service, respectively. You can buy them in physical form for delivery via mail or opt for a digital gift card, in which case your redemption code will be delivered straight to your inbox. The 16-digit redemption code is hidden underneath the label on the card’s back. The redemption code always starts with an “X”. The redemption code may appear in different places on the back of your card. Redeeming an iTunes gift card adds store credit to your Apple ID. Store credit is used for each purchase you make in iTunes Store, App Store or iBooks Store until it’s gone. iTunes billing system always uses your store credit first, as long as the value of the item that you’re buying is less than or equal to the value of your credit balance. If you don’t have any store credit left, the payment method that you designate when you sign up for an Apple ID is charged for the entire purchase. You can use your store credit to buy the following items: Apps from App Store and Mac App Store In-App Purchases Songs, albums, movies, TV shows and more from iTunes Store Books and audiobooks from iBooks Store iCloud storage Store credit cannot be used to purchase more gift cards or iTunes Gifts. NOTE: Some purchases might require that you have a credit card on file, even if you’re using your credit balance to make the purchase. For instance, you must have a credit card on file in order to use store credit to pay for your iCloud storage upgrades. You cannot use store credits for: App gifting—When you gift an app or media item to someone else the payment method on file is always billed for the entire purchase, not the store credit. Family Sharing—You cannot share your store credit with other family members. Even if a Family Sharing member buys something and the family organizer has store credit on their account, the item cost is still billed to the organizer’s payment method on file rather than being deducted from their store credit.

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You NEW DELHI: India will allow Apple to import some components at zero duty in return for the iPhone maker agreeing to scale up local manufacturing in a phased manner over the coming years, said Aruna Sundararajan, secretary for the ministry of electronics and IT. The ministry is currently in discussions with Apple on its proposal to manufacture in India for which the Cupertino, US-based firm had sought a slew of concessions, including duty waiver for its component manufacturers for 15 years. Speaking to ET, Sundararajan said the government is trying to reach a common ground with Apple so that the company can start full-fledged manufacturing here. She said the government agrees that some components required by Apple can’t be immediately manufactured in India and so it has made a list of products that can be imported duty free till they are ready to be produced locally. Apple also has submitted a list of components on which it is demanding duty exemptions for its suppliers. The government is trying to find a common ground keeping the interests of both sides in mind, she said. “They are saying that some of their components cannot be manufactured in India because that requires certain kind of manufacturing capability. Our roadmap for indigenisation also envisages only those products that can be (locally) manufactured. There are many products that we also admit that cannot be manufactured, so they can be imported duty free,” said Sundararajan, adding that Apple is also ready to manufacture some components locally through partners. “So, now we are trying to see that their roadmap for indigenisation and ours can be harmonised.” According to industry experts, Apple is asking for special concessions for its component manufacturers over and above what is already been offered by the Indian government. After the government announced incentives for domestic manufacturing, several companies set up local factories, but most of them are assembling phones here while largely importing components. Component manufacturers which have set shop in the country are largely catering to the low-end feature phones. The government recently notified the phased manufacturing programme under which it has set a timeline for locally manufacturing of mobile phone components. For instance, the programme covers mechanics, die cut parts, microphone and receiver, keypad and USB cable in the current financial year. It aims to promote local manufacturing of populated printed circuit boards, camera modules and connectors in 2018-19, and display assembly, touch panels, vibrator motor and ringer in 2019-20. Sundararajan said the government has defined different components that will be ready to be manufactured over the next three, five or seven years. “So Apple’s roadmap is slightly different (from ours) and we are looking at harmonising it.” Comments(0)Add Comments Apple may get duty relief but has to scale up manufacturing in India To post this comment you must Log In/Connect with:Indiatimes Network or Fill in your details: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed Share this Comment:Post to Twitter Also Read Apple plans to use micro-LED in 2017 Apple Watch 3 Will Apple be around in 2075?

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Apple has hired its first head of diversity. Longtime Apple employee Denise Young Smith has taken on a new role as vice president of inclusion and diversity. The company hasn't had someone heading up those efforts since Jeffrey Siminoff left the company to join Twitter in 2015. He had been director of inclusion and diversity since 2013. Smith, who has been at Apple since 1997, will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, a source familiar with the company told CNNTech. The news of Smith's new position was first reported by 9 to 5 Mac. Smith, who started in her new role on Monday, had already updated her LinkedIn page with her new title. Smith has held prominent positions at Apple. Most recently, she was vice president of global talent and human resources; she was also part of the leadership team that built out Apple's retail business. Cook has said that diversity is a "readily solvable issue," explicitly saying in 2015 that he wanted to hire more women. The company's latest diversity report revealed a workforce that's still predominately white and male. Although Apple did report a slight increase in hiring female and black technical employees in the U.S. compared to 2014.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple and Nokia Settle Patent Dispute With New Licensing Agreement Apple and Nokia Settle Patent Dispute With New Licensing Agreement Tuesday, 23 May 2017 (23 hours ago) Nokia and Apple announced today that they have settled all litigation related to their intellectual property dispute and agreed a multi-year patent license. Under the collaborative agreement, Nokia said it will provide "certain network infrastructure products and services" to Apple. In turn, Apple agreed to return all Nokia health products to Apple retail and online stores. "This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple," said Maria Varsellona, Chief Legal Officer at Nokia, responsible for Nokia's patent licensing business. "It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers." In December of last year, Nokia filed multiple complaints against Apple in several countries, accusing the Cupertino company of infringing several of its patents. In response, Apple sued Nokia in an antitrust lawsuit against several patent assertion entities which it claimed were trying to collect excessive fees for Nokia patents. Apple had established FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory) deals with Nokia, but by transferring patents to patent holding companies, additional royalties can be demanded. Just days after the legal dispute flared up, Apple pulled all Withings-branded, Nokia-owned accessories from its online and retail stores around the world. Nokia stood its ground, however, claiming that it had not been able to reach a licensing agreement with Apple and therefore had to defend its rights. Following the latest development, Nokia will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple with additional revenues forthcoming. The figure remains undisclosed, but net sales in Nokia patent licensing will reflect the value of the agreement, while Nokia expects related revenues to be reflected in the second quarter of 2017. No other details of the terms of the agreement have been released. "We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia," said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer.Tags: Withings, Nokia, Patent lawsuits Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 13 hours ago< > Embed Apple And Nokia See Deeper Partnership 00:44 On Tuesday, Reuters reports that Apple has settled a patent dispute Nokia and agreed to buy more of its network products and services, sending Nokia shares up 7 percent.

Apple will pay Nokia an undisclosed upfront cash payment, with additional revenues during the term of the new agreement. Both companies sued each other in December last year after a deal where Apple used Nokia’s patents signed in 2011 expired. Nokia technology is used in Apple devices such as the iPhone and iPad, from the user interface to the chipsets. Under the new agreement, Nokia will provide “certain network infrastructure product and services to Apple.” The California-based company will resume stocking Nokia fitness products in retail, formerly the Withings range until Nokia bought them out. Adversaries to friends “This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple,” said Nokia chief legal officer Maria Varsellona. “It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers.” Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams (pictured) added: “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia.” TAGS Apple Nokia Patent Withings SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGartner: Global smartphone sales grew 9pc in Q1 Next articleHuawei unveils MateBook trio Manny Pham RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Huawei unveils MateBook trio Gartner: Global smartphone sales grew 9pc in Q1 HighSpeedOffice wins Rugby Council contract NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Kimberley Glover - 020 3122 0871 Stephen Watson - 020 3122 0872 POPULAR POSTS News page 10 January 1, 2007 Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 153.80 -0.19 -0.12% The tech giant recently launched a section of its website explaining to consumers who might own an Android device why they should switch to the iPhone. The section is found when navigating Apple's site for the iPhone, or at www.apple.com/switch.  The top of the page features the headline "Life is easier on the iPhone," followed by a series of questions such as "Is the camera as good as they say?" and "Why is iPhone so fast?" When you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you have the option to buy one of several iPhone models. It also published YouTube videos, highlighting how easy it is to switch music to iPhone, and how fast its hallmark device is.  Last quarter, Apple reported iPhone shipments below Wall Street forecasts, citing consumers waiting to see what the company will reveal this fall. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's launch, and Apple is reportedly planning big things for its flagship device. In February, The Wall Street Journal reported Apple will launch one iPhone model with a curved screen that will cost around $1,000. It's reportedly one of three models Apple is expected to introduce this fall.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The average selling price was $695. Pricing for chief competitor Samsung was more than $500 less, according to research from Canaccord Genuity. The result: Apple earned 92% of the profits in the smartphone category and has racked up a cash hoard of $257 billion on its balance sheet. Apple tops Forbes’ annual study of the most valuable brands in the world for the seventh straight year, worth $170 billion. Its brand value is up 10% over last year and represents 21% of the company’s recent market value of $806 billion. The Apple train is not slowing down anytime soon. The iPhone 8 is expected to be out in the fall. The company is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the transformational product, and the latest version is expected to include an OLED screen, wireless charging and a host of other changes. The new features could push the price to north of $1,000 for the 256GB version and propel Apple to be the first company with a market capitalization of $1 trillion.  Google ranks second among the most valuable brands at $101.8 billion. It’s the second straight year Google has placed second to Apple, and it is closing the gap with a 23% gain this year after a 26% jump in 2016. Google has integrated itself into multiple aspects of our daily routines with seven products with over one billion users each, according to the company. They include Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Play Store, Maps, Search and YouTube (Forbes values YouTube separately from Google as a brand, but the video-sharing website did not crack the top 100 brands). To “google” is synonymous for search, but the Alphabet subsidiary is still fighting to protect its brand. A federal appeals court affirmed the Google trademark this month, ruling the brand name was worth protecting in a case from 2012 involving cybersquatting of 763 domain names with the word “google” in them. The value of Google is surging, and it will not go the way of aspirin, elevator, thermos and other brands that faced “genericide.” U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Tallman wrote: “The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic.” Rounding out the top five brands are Microsoft ($87 billion, up 16%), Facebook ($73.5 billion, up 40%) and Coca-Cola ($56.4 billion, down 4%). The 100 most valuable brands are worth a cumulative $1.95 trillion, up 6% over last year. They range from Apple on top at $170 billion to German financial services firm Allianz with a brand worth $6.8 billion by Forbes’ count. We evaluated more than 200 global brands to determine the final list of 100. Brands were required to have a presence in the U.S., which knocked out some big brands like multinational telecom firm Vodafone. The top 100 includes product brands like Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Budweiser, as well as brands marketed under their corporate name like Starbucks. Forbes valued the brands on three years of earnings and allocated a percentage of those earnings based on the role brands play in each industry (e.g., high for luxury goods and beverages, low for airlines and oil companies). We applied the average price-to-earnings multiple over the past three years to these earnings to arrive at the final brand valuable (click here for the complete methodology). Tech brands dominate the top 100 with 18 making the cut, including nine of the top 15. Thirteen financial service brands qualified, led by American Express at No. 22 worth $24.5 billion. The 12 consumer packaged goods brands were headed by Gillette at No. 28 ($19.2 billion). The U.S. is home to just over half the list with 56 brands, followed by Germany (11), France (7) and Japan (6). Companies based in 15 countries landed at least one brand among the top 100. Most of the major risers this year came from the world of tech with Amazon leading the way, up 54% to $54.1 billion and sixth overall. The e-commerce giant’s number of Prime members in the U.S. has doubled over the past two years to 80 million, or two-thirds of American households, according to data from research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Firm. Other big gainers were Facebook (+40%), Starbucks (24%) and Google (23%). IBM had the biggest drop for the second straight year. Big Blue’s brand declined 20% to $33.3 billion and No. 13 overall after ranking fifth as recently as 2015. The company has moved away from hardware and software to focus on its cloud computing division and the result is 20 straight quarters of sales declines. Other brands that took big hits were HSBC (down 18%), Caterpillar (-11%) and H&M (-11%). Adobe was the highest-ranking of seven new entries in the top 100. The software brand ranked No. 84 with a value of $7.4 billion. Volkswagen ranked No. 77 last year, but its brand value fell 10% to $6.7 billion to knock it out of the top 100. It was the third straight decline for the reeling German carmaker, which has been embroiled in a scandal involving cheating exhaust emissions tests. VW was ordered to pay a $2.8 billion criminal penalty last month by a U.S. federal judge, on top of a $1.5 billion civil penalty.

One of them is said to be a special anniversary edition iPhone – perhaps named the iPhone 8. Among other features, numerous reports have said that this phone will have an OLED display. Assuming that turns out to be true, then this iPhone 8 could spark a huge shift for Apple. According to a new report from The Investor, Apple is already looking to next year, placing an order with Samsung Display for OLED panels to use in 2018’s iPhone. The Investor refers to this phone as the iPhone 9, but honestly it’s too early to call at this point, especially when we’re not even positive where the iPhone 8 name fits into all of this. In any case, Apple is looking to greatly increase its order of OLED panels for 2018’s iPhone. While current estimates say that Apple has around 80 million OLED panels on order for the iPhone 8, we could see that number balloon up to 180 million by next year. This is because OLED panels could be a standard feature from 2018’s iPhone on. This latest report claims that Apple will ship two OLED models next year – one with a 5.28-inch display and another with a 6.46-inch display. Those are fairly specific screen sizes, but it sounds like those could very well be the standard iPhone 9 and iPhone 9 Plus. Assuming we don’t get a third model next year, this could mean that Apple is ditching LCD displays for OLED ones. While that’s certainly exciting, we can likely still expect LCD displays on some models for 2017. Many reports have said that the two other models launching alongside the iPhone 8 (or iPhone Anniversary Edition) will sport LCD displays. So, we’ll have to wait a while for Apple’s OLED revolution to move into full swing, but it sounds like it’s coming nonetheless.

The iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update isn’t a milestone upgrade but it could have a significant impact on your device’s performance. Many iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus owners are complaining about frustrating iOS 10.3.2 problems. Many others are having an excellent experience on Apple’s newest iOS 10 update. If you are coming to iOS 10.3.2 from Apple’s iOS 10.3.1 update, your download will be pretty small. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.2 from something older than that, your iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update will be much larger thanks to the previous versions of iOS. They’re included in your iOS 10.3.2 update. Now that we’re a week removed from the iOS 10.3.2 update’s release we want to take a look at the most important things you need to know if you’re already on iOS 10.3.2 or if you’re still thinking about installing the iOS 10.3.2 update on your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. Our guide looks at the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update’s performance, the current state of iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 problems, and it offers a quick glimpse at what’s next from Apple and iOS 10. iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 Before we get into the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update's performance, a quick note about the iOS 10.3.2 installation process. The iOS 10.3.2 download/installation process took us about 8 minutes to complete. We upgraded from Apple's iOS 10.3.1 update.  If you're coming to iOS 10.3.2 from an older version of iOS, your iOS 10.3.2 installation could take longer. We suggest putting 20 minutes of quiet time aside to monitor the download and the installation process for problems.  We've been using the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update for a week now and the update continues to perform well on the devices in our possession.  Battery life is holding up and we haven't noticed any abnormal drain on the iPhone 6s models we're using to test iOS 10.3.2. We're able to get a full day of use when using a mixture of Wi-Fi and LTE.  If you recently installed iOS 10.3.2 and you're seeing abnormal battery drain issues, give it a couple of days. Sometimes it takes a few days for the battery to settle in. If the problems persist, you'll want to dig into some fixes. We've tested the phone and the update with several ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices and we haven't noticed any major issues with our connections. They remain strong and fast. The iPhone 6s' UI is fast and we haven't experienced any lag, random reboots or freezes during our testing. The iOS 10.3.2 update feels stable and fluid. Same as iOS 10.3.1.  So far, the transition from iOS 10.3.1 to iOS 10.3.2 has been extremely smooth. We haven't run into any significant performance issues. Apple's iOS 10.3.2 update is definitely worth a look if you're running into issues on an older version of iOS 10 or if you're concerned with your device's security.  If you're coming from an older version of iOS, like iOS 9 or iOS 10.2.1, you might want to snag a second opinion before installing the update on your device. For more, take a look at our reasons to and not to install iOS 10.3.2 today.   1 / 9 Comments are closed.

Next year's OLED-based iPhone models could come in two screen sizes. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 23, 2017 at 3:15PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 2017 iPhone lineup hasn't even been announced yet, but already, we're beginning to see purported leaks about the company's 2018 iPhone lineup, referred to as the iPhone 9. Per a new report from The Bell (via MacRumors), Apple's 2018 iPhone lineup will include devices with the following display sizes: 5.28 inches and 6.46 inches. The report also claims that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Display, which is expected to supply the OLED displays for this year's iPhone 8, will also provide the OLED displays for the upcoming iPhone 9 models. Image source: Apple. Does this report make sense? Let's take a closer look. The core concept is good Fundamentally, the idea of offering premium iPhone models in two sizes is good. Apple's iPhones have come in two display sizes (4.7 inches and 5.5 inches) since 2014, and even though this year's iPhone 8 is expected to come in a single display size (5.8 inches), it should be accompanied by so-called "iPhone 7s" models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch liquid crystal displays (the display technology Apple currently uses in its iPhones) at more mainstream price points, too. It makes sense, then, that as Apple more broadly deploys OLED displays in its product lineup that it would offer phones in multiple sizes to appeal to a wider range of tastes. Further, it seems reasonable to expect that Apple will completely ditch liquid crystal displays in new models (outside of, perhaps, a low-cost successor to the current iPhone SE) beginning in 2018. So, rather than offer a "special edition" OLED iPhone with a 5.8-inch display (a sort of "compromise" size) alongside the standard 4.7-inch/5.5-inch LCD versions, Apple might instead choose to offer small and large iPhone models with OLED displays. Though I might not be inclined to take the rumored iPhone 9 display sizes as fact based on this single report, I'm confident that Apple will indeed offer the iPhone 9 in two display sizes, and that those displays will be OLED-based. An uncomfortable question Here's an interesting -- and, potentially uncomfortable -- question worth asking: What happens to the concept of the "premium" iPhone in this scenario? Would Apple apply the same pricing structure that it plans to roll out with the iPhone 8 to the rumored 6.46-inch version, and then offer the 5.28-inch version at more standard price points? Or would Apple offer up yet-another special edition along with the more "mainstream" models in this lineup? Alternatively, Apple could simply price the 5.28-inch/6.46-inch models at the price points that the iPhone 7/7 Plus currently occupy and lower the price ceiling that this year's iPhone 8 model is likely to raise. Such a move would pose a risk to Apple's average iPhone selling price during the iPhone 9 cycle, though. At this point, it's not clear what Apple is going to do, and there are certainly pros and cons to each potential path. I suspect that even Apple itself is probably going to want to see the initial data from this year's iPhone product cycle before determining its pricing/positioning strategy for the iPhone 9.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple hires first VP of diversity by Sara Ashley O'Brien   @saraashleyo May 23, 2017: 1:53 PM ET Apple unveils new "spaceship" headquarters Apple has hired its first head of diversity. Longtime Apple employee Denise Young Smith has taken on a new role as vice president of inclusion and diversity. The company hasn't had someone heading up those efforts since Jeffrey Siminoff left the company to join Twitter in 2015. He had been director of inclusion and diversity since 2013. Smith, who has been at Apple since 1997, will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, a source familiar with the company told CNNTech. The news of Smith's new position was first reported by 9 to 5 Mac. Smith, who started in her new role on Monday, had already updated her LinkedIn page with her new title. Related: Twitter mostly meets its modest diversity goals Smith has held prominent positions at Apple. Most recently, she was vice president of global talent and human resources; she was also part of the leadership team that built out Apple's retail business. Cook has said that diversity is a "readily solvable issue," explicitly saying in 2015 that he wanted to hire more women. The company's latest diversity report revealed a workforce that's still predominately white and male. Although Apple did report a slight increase in hiring female and black technical employees in the U.S. compared to 2014.

The first thing any creator should do once they’ve developed a new product or concept is to get it patented. It’s especially important for start-ups and inventors that are just starting out. It might seem like a bold move. After all, the company and the product are unknown. Why bother with going through the hassle of a patent at such an early stage in development? There are very good reasons, and I know this first-hand.   My patent story My own story shows why patents are a vital first step for new tech companies. John Safa, founder and CTO of Pushfor. When I launched my first tech start-up in early 2000, I was keen to show major tech companies how my product – a new kind of protection – could help secure their business applications. One of the businesses I pitched to copied my idea. Fortunately for me (not so much for them) I’d already taken out a patent on the technology. Later, as the business went through an IPO process, it was forced to admit that it had copied my idea. It offered to buy my business as a way to resolve the issue quickly. I chose not to sell.   Your ideas are at risk without a patent Several major tech companies have been fined for the unauthorised use of patented technology. In 2012 both Samsung and Apple were fined for infringing on each other’s patents. In 2014, Apple was fined $23.6m for infringing on six patents belonging to mobile telecoms firm, SkyTel. 2016 saw Apple ordered to pay $302m for breaking patents in its development of iMessage and FaceTime. Obviously, it’s possible for two people working at different companies to come up with similar ideas without one copying the other. But in such cases, it’s the one who has patented that idea first that has the advantage. These are big companies, with big legal budgets. Imagine how much easier it is for a company to take advantage of a start-up. A patent protects you.   Your ideas are valuable, so patent them Let’s be honest, if you don’t think your concept is valuable enough to patent it, why should anyone else be excited by your idea? You are your concept’s biggest advocate. If the idea has value, you won’t be the only one to see it. Patent it. The patent process also checks for prior art so you can be confident that no-one has a similar idea as yours.   A patent makes you more attractive to investors One of the first things an investor will say to a tech start up is ‘What’s unique about your idea? If it’s so good, what’s to stop Google or Microsoft developing it?’ The answer is ‘a granted patent’. That’s going to give your business much more value in the long term, which is what investors are interested in.   A patent gives your business more value at exit If you’re looking to exit your business eventually, or create liquidity through another route such as IPO, having a unique, patented technology will give your business more value.   When to apply for a patent If you have a technology that is unique and new, it could be patentable. A patent can be granted for (according to the patent office) something that can be made or used, is new, and is inventive (not just a simple modification to something that already exists). They aren’t granted for every idea. The concept being patented needs to be unique or the application will be rejected.   What it costs Applying for a patent isn’t cheap. In the UK, according to the patent office, it costs around £4,000 to apply, and takes five years. That’s not the end of it – you have to pay to renew it each year, and of course to defend it if someone tries to copy your technology. But the cost of not applying could be far, far greater.   Selling your patent There are companies that exist just to hunt down patent infringements. These companies buy patents from tech companies and hold them as part of a holding company. They then search for companies who are infringing those patents, making money from bringing lawsuits against them. If you’re approached by one, be cautious, in case they’re offering you much less than your patent is worth (they often buy patents from companies about to go out of business). They’re known as ‘patent trolls’, and many of the big cases against tech companies are brought by them. This shows the value of a patent – whoever holds it can realise its value, and whatever the circumstances, copying patented technology is against the law. Patents are incredibly important in safeguarding the future of a tech business. My own experience shows that if you own the patent, you are protecting the true value of your business.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple hires first VP of diversity by Sara Ashley O'Brien   @saraashleyo May 23, 2017: 1:53 PM ET Apple unveils new "spaceship" headquarters Apple has hired its first head of diversity. Longtime Apple employee Denise Young Smith has taken on a new role as vice president of inclusion and diversity. The company hasn't had someone heading up those efforts since Jeffrey Siminoff left the company to join Twitter in 2015. He had been director of inclusion and diversity since 2013. Smith, who has been at Apple since 1997, will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, a source familiar with the company told CNNTech. The news of Smith's new position was first reported by 9 to 5 Mac. Smith, who started in her new role on Monday, had already updated her LinkedIn page with her new title. Related: Twitter mostly meets its modest diversity goals Smith has held prominent positions at Apple. Most recently, she was vice president of global talent and human resources; she was also part of the leadership team that built out Apple's retail business. Cook has said that diversity is a "readily solvable issue," explicitly saying in 2015 that he wanted to hire more women. The company's latest diversity report revealed a workforce that's still predominately white and male. Although Apple did report a slight increase in hiring female and black technical employees in the U.S. compared to 2014.

Tech News | 16 May 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (10) New CMD-D Conference Targets Automation by Adam C. Engst Well, this is exciting — the Apple world has a new conference dedicated to automation on 9 August 2017 in Santa Clara, California. CMD-D offers a packed 13-hour day of sessions on many aspects of scripting and automation. For those new to automation, there’s an optional Scripting Boot Camp on the day before, 8 August 2017 (more details on that will be forthcoming). The conference is organized by Mr. Automation himself, Sal Soghoian, with help from Macworld Expo producer Paul Kent and PR veteran Naomi Pearce. It’s sponsored by the Omni Group and Apple device management firm JAMF. The speakers lined up so far are top-notch, which I would say even if they weren’t all friends. Sal knows more about Apple automation than anyone, and he’ll be talking about power features of AppleScript, AppleScriptObj-C, and JavaScript for Automation that even most experts don’t know. John Welch has been in the admin trenches for longer than I can imagine and will be talking about when automation is a must and when not to bother. Jon Pugh was one of the original members of the AppleScript team and will be sharing stories about how AppleScript was created. Andy Ihnatko… well, everyone knows Andy, and he is slated to discuss automation as a martial art practiced against “tedious, repetitive work.” And finally, Jason Snell, who has become one of the premiere podcasters in the Apple world after leaving Macworld, will be hosting a live Six Colors podcast session with the speakers on the present and future of automation. Other sessions include a deep dive into Automator, automation’s role in managing hundreds or thousands of iOS devices, how to use the Apple-acquired Workflow to automate tasks in iOS, an introduction to the Omni Group’s cross-platform scripting solution for their apps, and even an open-mic automation slam for attendees to share their most impressive solutions while competing for an award. I hope it’s a big shiny gear. CMD-D will take place in the Santa Clara Convention Center, which is near the San Jose International Airport and not far from the airports in both San Francisco and Oakland. You can register independently for the CMD-D conference and the Scripting Boot Camp for $295, or sign up for both for $590. That’s early bird pricing, which is good through the middle of June; after that, each day’s fee goes up to $395 and the two-day pass increases to $790. Lunch and afternoon snacks are included.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS! Put your company and products in front of tens of thousands of savvy, committed Apple users who actually buy stuff.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard Fairbanks  2017-05-17 02:40 I (and many others) really wanted Apple to adopt Hamish Sanderson’s SwiftAutomation for 10.13, but apparently not enough people responded (or Apple is still addicted to its “not-invented-here” dogma). Hamish’s AppScript was an inspirational start, and SwiftAutomation would have been a long-held dream come true. Apple’s (Sal’s?) choice to use JavaScript for system-level automation was a new low point, among many, going back decades. (How many people remember WestCode Software’s OneClick?) Apple continues to slowly and methodically “dumb down the herd.” These are very dark days for Mac system-level automation; that Hamish is not a speaker at CMD-D is a glaring omission. Adam, for decades, I have had great respect and appreciation for you and your crew!, but this page is just hype over a dying carcass. Blessings to you, Tonya, and to everyone at TidBITS! Reply has  2017-05-19 13:38 Appreciate the sentiment, although I'm not a fan of current US Border policy of Free Cavity Searches For All, so would not be attending anyway, even if Sal did have the basic courtesy and professionalism to send me an invite. (Which he does not.) Please do not rag on JavaScript though. Whatever its faults as a language, by dint of canny placement and power of network effect it is neverthelss THE MOST POPULAR and widespread language IN THE WORLD! A first-class JS-AE bridge could have tapped up to a MILLION EXISTING JS USERS on macOS alone and turned them into a VAST NEW MARKET for MacAutomation OVERNIGHT! I can only imagine the WebKit team were more than a little miffed when management took their thrilling new (if mediocre to us) JavaScriptCore project off them and handed to Sal’s team to run straight into the ground. Cos I know how I felt after 6 weeks of work desperately trying to help them make JXA be that success, only for Sal to throw all that investment back in my face. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-19 15:03 Folks, let's avoid the personal invective. No one owes anyone anything by default, and everything is far more complicated on the inside than it seems from the outside. Reply Richard Fairbanks  2017-05-19 15:57 Adam, that you were gracious enough to allow my post in the first place speaks volumes about your (and your team’s) integrity. Your long-established and highly respected stature in the Mac community is well-earned. However . . . When a company (Apple Computer) hoards hundreds of billions of dollars, nothing “is far more complicated on the inside.” Certainly, we should be grateful that we may (finally!) be getting an upgrade to HFS+. Let us pray that Apple considers user data also worthy of checksums. But those of us “who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world” and have devoted our lives to that end, have not been treated with much respect by a company that now focusses primarily on making gadgets for social networking. You know very well, Adam, that I am not alone in this sentiment! Bless you, Brother (and to you too, Hamish!!). Reply has  2017-05-19 16:24 Adam, I’ve nothing against Sal on a personal level—I don’t know Sal the person. I do have everything against him as Automation Product Manager—a role he proved hopelessly unfit for. If he didn’t want me calling out his faults in public he should’ve accepted/declined my advice & expertise with grace & attitude back when I was offering it in private. You don’t see me treating others badly for calling me out on my own errors—it’s the highest form of complement when they take the time and effort to explain exactly why and where you’re screwing up and how to put it right. OF COURSE Apple owes us nothing—we’re only customers. We can choose to buy a product or not. But millions—no, BILLIONS—of users are being casually stripped of the rights to control & shape their own tools, while the one person IN THE WORLD best positioned to change this ACCELERATES IT INSTEAD, all cos he can’t rise past his own ego. Sorry I’m techy, but these stakes are 7 BILLION times bigger than you, me, or Sal’s feels. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-19 16:52 I have nothing against criticism of Apple when it's deserved (and we do it all the time), but I can guarantee that there are powerful forces inside Apple (and all other major tech companies) that are pushing and pulling policy in numerous unknown directions. What seems obvious to us from the outside could be completely untenable internally for multiple business, technical, and political reasons. I don't like it either, and it's not an excuse, just a reality that we should all keep in mind. What comes out of a large company is never the result of everyone coming together and saying "What a good idea!" There are always multiple factions, winners and losers, and the buck stops pretty high up in many of these companies. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-19 17:11 There are always at least two sides to every story, and often many more. Regardless, this is neither the time (what's past is past, and Sal is no longer employed by Apple) nor the place (this article is about the CMD-D conference) to air personal or professional grievances. I will delete any future comments on this article that go beyond the topic of the CMD-D conference, along with anything that refers to an individual. Frankly, I'm perturbed by this entire exchange. Creating CMD-D has taken Sal and Paul and Naomi a significant amount of time and effort, and I see it as a highly positive contribution to the Apple community. I dislike having TidBITS used to distract from that. Reply Richard Fairbanks  2017-05-20 16:06 Adam, you have been most gracious; I have no need to further elaborate upon my part of this thread. Please allow me to close with a quote from George Bernard Shaw: “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” Reply Mike Detmar  2017-05-23 14:11 Hello all. I'm interested in knowing more about iOS and Mac deployment automation solutions. I work for a company that uses an MDM to deploy and manage +10,000 company owned iOS devices. We use Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP), and Volume Purchase Program (VPP). We're trying to learn more about what tools are available to automate the process of initial deployment, device replacement process, etc. We're also starting to enroll and manage MacOS devices in our MDM. I've reached out to the organizers of the CMD-D conference for more details because I think that this may be a good start for us. We are engaged with Apple and our MDM vendor, but I'd also like to hear from others about tools, technologies, books, seminars, and web sites where we can learn more about the automation of the iOS and MacOS device management process. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. Thank you. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-23 15:29 CMD-D is definitely a good place to start with this, but you should also check out JAMF own conference, the MacTech Conference, and various other sysadmin-focused events.

Tech News | 22 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (5) Google Aims to Attract Apple Users with Google I/O Announcements by Julio Ojeda-Zapata Comparisons between Apple and Google are inescapable now that the two increasingly play in the same categories: smartphones, voice assistants, home automation, photo sharing, and so on. In recent years, Apple and Google have invited such comparisons with dueling springtime press events that reveal products and services intended to compete for consumer hearts and pocketbooks (see “Google I/O 2016 Includes Announcements with Apple Appeal,” 23 May 2016). This year, the cycle is repeating. Google last week took over an outdoor amphitheater in Mountain View, California, to unleash a torrent of tech news during its Google I/O keynote, which precedes Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in nearby San Jose by less than a month. Much of what Google announced is relevant to Apple users. For instance, Google’s voice-controlled Assistant app has finally come to the iPhone to go up against Apple’s Siri. Many photography enthusiasts prefer the Google Photos service over Apple’s iCloud Photo Library, and Google announced a number of upgrades in that department. Angst about Apple falling behind is an inevitable byproduct of every Google I/O keynote. As the absence of a Siri device similar to Amazon’s popular Echo voice-controlled gadgets becomes ever more glaring, Google announced improvements to its Echo competitor, the Google Home. Rumors have lately swirled about an Apple reveal at WWDC, but we will have to wait and see whether the mythical Siri Speaker actually exists. Here is a look at Google I/O announcements that intersect with Apple in some fashion. Note that some of the products, services, and technologies mentioned below aren’t available immediately but are coming soon. Google Assistant -- Siri has its limitations, as iOS-device owners will attest. Fortunately, there are alternatives. Amazon brought its Alexa voice assistant, the one built into Echo devices, to the iPhone last March, via an update to the company’s Amazon App for iOS. Now, Google Assistant has come to the iPhone as well. Unsurprisingly, the Google Assistant iOS app is just an app, unlike its deeper integration on Android-based devices. Given that Siri can be invoked with a press of the Home button at any time, Apple still has a significant advantage in iOS. But iPhone users who already rely on other Google services, or are just frustrated with Siri, may find Google’s new voice app tempting. Google Assistant has a chat-like interface (familiar to the handful of iPhone users who have installed Google’s Allo chat app) and can be manipulated with either voice commands or by typing, for those embarrassed by vocalized directives. There’s a shortcut widget in Notification Center, for added convenience. Google Assistant is handy for requesting workout tunes; getting stock updates or the news; accessing YouTube or Netflix videos; making Google keyword searches; getting directions; initiating calls, texts, and emails; and much more. But Google Assistant’s lack of full iPhone integration means you cannot invoke it by voice or a press of the Home button, access low-level functions like Airplane Mode, and so on. Access to non-Google apps is clunky, when it’s available at all. If you aren’t heavily invested in the Google ecosystem, Google Assistant may be more trouble than it is worth. The fact that the main Google search app is separate from and partly redundant with the Google Assistant app makes things more confusing. And while you can use the Google Assistant app on the iPad, it’s not tablet-native. Google Assistant should improve, though, as Google now makes it possible for developers to add capabilities via an SDK. These, interestingly, include appliance maker General Electric. There’s even an extension to let Google Assistant control Philips Hue lights (see “Getting Started with the Philips Hue Smart Light Bulbs,” 1 August 2016). Google Home -- Google was playing catch-up with Amazon’s popular Echo at last year’s Google I/O when it announced its voice-controlled Google Home gadget. That product did not become available to the public until months later, and in many respects still lags behind the Echo. For Apple users who are invested in Google’s ecosystem, though, the Google Home may have more appeal than an Echo device. This year’s improvements increase the allure. Such enhancements include an option to make outgoing (and, in the United States, free) calls to landline and cellular phones, essentially turning the Google Home into a speakerphone. You can even associate your phone number with it, but you can’t receive calls for now. Another new feature called “proactive assistance” pushes relevant information to users – calendar reminders and traffic updates, for instance – without being asked. Google Home has been tweaked to work better with Chromecast-capable televisions, too. You can initiate programming from the likes of HBO GO. More interesting is how Google Home can display responses to your questions on the TV screen, such as your calendar or a map with driving directions. Some responses just don’t work in audio form, so having a screen on which to display information can be a big win. Google Photos -- Google’s photo-sharing service debuted at Google I/O two years ago and has since been a top priority for the company. Users have seen a steady flow of upgrades, which are available to iOS- and Android-device owners via apps as well as those accessing the service via desktop Web browsers. To enhance the service, Google last week rolled out a new batch of enhancements that are largely focused on sharing. Most notable is a Suggested Sharing feature that picks out what it thinks are the best photos from an event, identifies people in those photos, and offers to send the right shots to the right people. It will even nudge recipients to add their own photos of the same event. A Shared Libraries feature provides a different sort of sharing automation. It lets you automatically share photos with a particular person like a spouse or a best friend. That person can get access to your full library, just shots of certain people, or only photos from a given date forward. They can also access and save “creations” (collages, animated GIFs, slideshows) made from the shots, either manually by you or automatically by Google. One Google Photos announcement is a catch-up maneuver. Google Photo users can now order customized hardcover or softcover photo books, an option that had long been available to users of Apple’s Photos and similar services, including, at one time, Google Photos predecessor Picasa Web Albums. Google Lens -- This isn’t a product or feature but, rather, a technology that will augment the capabilities of Google’s services – starting, the company said, with Google Assistant and Google Photos. Google describes Google Lens as “a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you are looking at and help you take action based on that information.” You’ll be able to point your smartphone camera at a flower, for instance, and have Google Assistant identify it for you. Likewise, you could aim your phone at a storefront to get information and reviews about that establishment. Also, Google Lens will enable Google Assistant to analyze the significance of text in useful ways, such as translating foreign languages on menus or logging you into Wi-Fi networks if it can see and parse corresponding SSIDs and passwords. Google Photos is already somewhat competent at identifying people, animals, objects, places, and so on, and that capability should improve as Google Lens learns to recognize more images. Virtual Reality -- This another tech category that makes pundits wonder what Apple is doing, especially as Google and others push aggressively into the space. At last year’s Google I/O, Google announced VR goggles meant to be used with Android smartphones, as well as Daydream technology built into the latest such phones to boost their VR capabilities. This year, Google is taking another VR step, announcing specifications for standalone VR goggles that require neither a smartphone nor a tethered connection a desktop computer, as some high-end VR goggles do. Google is working with hardware partners like HTC and Lenovo to make these devices happen. Gmail Smart Replies -- Google provides iOS users two ways to access their Gmail accounts: its traditional Gmail app and the alternative Inbox app that provides a different interface. Inbox has long had “smart replies” with auto-generated text snippets to let users answer email messages with just a tap. This feature is now making its way to the older, more popular Gmail app for iOS. Looking Forward to WWDC -- This is an exciting time of year in consumer technology because of events like Google I/O and WWDC that give us a better sense of how these tech titans are competing for new users. Make no mistake, Google and Apple are in a struggle for the ages, and they’re not alone, with Amazon and Microsoft trying to appeal to tech consumers as well (see “New Microsoft OS and Laptop Aim at Apple and Google in Education,” 3 May 2017). Our gaze is now focused on San Jose, and on what Tim Cook and crew have to show us on 5 June 2017 during the WWDC keynote.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Especially VR, a product which researchers say the interested user can stand for about three minutes at a time. That's the kind of product Apple needs, right now! Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-05-23 00:24 Google is the antithesis of Apple as it is predicated on violating user privacy; created a very buggy and insecure OS in Android, and is living up to its motto "DO Do Evil". Reply Jack Smith  2017-05-23 09:58 Thought the most impressive thing saw at Google I/O was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2VF8tmLFHw&feature=youtu.be&t=10m43s Google is just killing it in AI. The 2nd generation TPUs faster than anything commercially available while using far less power. We see that TensorFlow has already 58k stars on GitHub. Suggest the AI framework battles are over. Then Linkedin share the most desired place to work is Google. Google is winning in all the dimensions to AI. Cherry on top is Google just beat the #1 Go player in the world in China earlier this morning!! 10 years earlier than what was thought to be possible. Brute force not possible so Google AI is using intuition.

Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-23 15:26 It's not the same thing, and you know it. :-) It's five steps instead of one: 1) "Hey Siri, open Assistant." 2) "You'll need to unlock your iPhone first. 3) unlock iphone 4) tap mic icon in Assistant 5) ask question Reply  Search   Cached.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / Nokia and Apple settle patent dispute with new partnership Nokia and Apple settle patent dispute with new partnership Matthew Wilson 12 hours ago Featured Tech News, Mobile It looks like Nokia and Apple have managed to settle their differences as the Nokia V Apple patent dispute is now officially over. The two companies managed to settle out of court by hammering out a new licensing deal, a surprising move given how often these cases can drag on. The two companies announced earlier today that going forward, Nokia would receive ongoing revenue from Apple starting from this quarter. Nokia is also set to get a lump of cash upfront, though exact figures were not disclosed. As Reuters reports, Nokia’s shares took a hit back in December when the company first announced that it would be going after Apple in court. Fortunately in this instance, it seems that a solution was found quicker than anyone predicted. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said in a joint statement from the companies. KitGuru Says: Nokia and Apple have managed to go back to being business partners, rather than rivals in the court room, which is refreshing to see. Usually these patent disputes drag on for years and it often feels like we never hear the end of it.

Apple also said it received at least one declassified, yet secret National Security Letter. Apple's report, which covers the second half of 2016, revealed that US law enforcement made about 600 hundred fewer overall customer-data requests from July to December 2016 (4,254) compared to January through June of 2016 (4,822). Meanwhile, the number of Apple devices subject to requests doubled from last year's first half (10,260) to the second half (20,013), ZDNet noted. Apple was required to respond with customer data in 78 percent of all US government requests made from July to December (p.3). The report showed that Apple received at least 5,750 individual national security orders, affecting at least 4,750 accounts (p.14). Read more Twitter reveals details of 2 FBI national security letters after gag order lifted Apple also listed one declassified national security letter (NSL) the company received in the second half of 2016. An NSL is a secret subpoena of metadata records used by the US that does not require judicial approval. Apple cannot detail the order, as NSLs include gag orders that restrict companies from divulging the request or even notifying the customer whose account was the subject of the order. The FBI is required by the USA Freedom Act, a 2015 surveillance reform bill, to periodically review gag orders associated with NSLs. These reviews may have led to a declassification of the NSL in Apple's report, according to ZDNet. Apple has received more than 10,000 NSLs since 2015, The Verge reported. NSLs can call for access to metadata but not contents of communications, which would require a court order to access. Other high-profile tech companies have revealed reception of declassified NSLs they received since the USA Freedom Act went into effect. In June of last year, Yahoo said it received three NSLs from the FBI, while Twitter said it received two NSLs in January. Google said in December it had got eight NSLs from the FBI.

Since joining Apple in 1997, Denise has served in several key HR roles. Most recently as Vice President of Worldwide Human Resources and Talent. For over 10 years, she sat on the leadership team that built Apple’s retail organization, which now welcomes more than one million people every day. Apple stores have redefined the retail experience and their talented employees have become the face of Apple for customers around the world. Before retail, Denise ran HR for Apple’s Worldwide Operations and Corporate Employee Relations teams. Her change of position was first noticed on LinkedIn by 9to5Mac. Apple has since confirmed the news with the following statement... “Our inclusion and diversity efforts are critically important to Apple’s future. Denise’s years of experience, expertise and passion will help us make an even greater impact in this area.” The company has yet to update its leadership webpage. SVP and CFO Luca Maestri will step in to temporarily fill the role until a replacement for Smith is found.

BLM was very popular and active at the end of Obama regime and during the election. they practically vanished after Trump got elected. point is simple: how much of the racial issues is "manufactured" vs "actual" racism?

Zeman   @phonescooper Apple today said it has settled its patent complaints against Nokia and the two have signed a multi-year patent license. The two corporations sued one another in December of last year concerning licensing fees for Nokia's patents. Nokia said Apple refused to pay fair prices, while Apple accused Nokia of antitrust behavior. Nokia had sold its patents to patent-assertion firms that then demanded higher rates. Moving forward, Nokia will provide Apple with network infrastructure products and services, and Apple will resume selling Nokia-owned smart devices (Withings) as the two look at future potential digital health offerings. Apple is set to pay Nokia a significant upfront fee and then on-going payments. Both companies expressed positive sentiments in having the matter behind them. "We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia," said Apple COO Jeff Williams. Companies often use lawsuits as a negotiation tactic. more info at Apple » Related Nokia, Apple File Dueling Patent Lawsuits Nokia and Apple have this week filed patent-related lawsuits against one another in various jurisdictions.

Credit: Apple More like this Mac design decline: The solution staring Apple down Apple upgrades Mac Pro, says ‘sorry’ to pro users (Updated) It’s not game over for Apple TV -- yet Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell There isn’t anything flashy about computer towers.  And their lack of style made it easy for Apple to abandon them. But do we really prefer Apple produces more iMacs and unconventionally shaped Mac Pros? What if instead they decide to return to their most durable, albeit boring desktop hardware design? Returning to the tower designs of yesteryear could potentially be a big win for Apple not to mention its customers. iMac and Mac Pro hardware designs feature stylish good looks over the ability to easily upgrade.  Apple’s tight, sleek iMac suffers from poor thermal distribution. Consequently, incredible amounts of heat amass inside. Over time, the accumulation of heat contributes to rapid aging. Towers offer no similar compromise regarding the ravages of high temperatures. They are built to more efficiently distribute and filter heat from their cavernous cases. The desktop towers’ interiors that Apple once made were easily accessed. Apple has hinted at a return to a more modular design. It can’t come soon enough for this old Apple fanboy. Today, Apple makes the complete opposite of modular design computers. And every desktop they produce is vulnerable to premature hardware failure because of aforementioned interior airflow deficiencies. Why Apple should do it Apple wants us to buy Macs more frequently. While it is only my opinion, I believe we’ve been conditioned accordingly and sales of Macs remain up. How else to explain it? That being said, I also feel our standards and expectations are considerably lower when it comes to what to expect from Apple and its line of Macs moving forward. We’re just not excited at the prospect anymore. One way to gain younger customers and to reinvigorate older ones is for Apple to create and produce computers featuring the ability (of its buyers) to perform basic upgrades. This could be their new “prosumer” line of Apple towers. Think of the joy consumers and professionals alike could know at: Easily upgrading the memory and hard disk in their machine; or Being able to order and install a replacement GPU from Apple; and Being able to order and install a logic board or CPU replacement (or perhaps unlock an Apple-authorized CPU overclock, as needs for more processing power arise). Number three may be pushing it, but at least you get the picture. A return to a tower design of some kind would not be the equivalent of Apple conceding it no longer can design innovatively; to the contrary it would be an admission that it is better late than never to recognize past triumphs in design by creating modernized versions. Additionally, the price tag for an Apple machine can be high, to put it kindly. For the amount of hard earned cash its customers fork over, they should be able to expect a reasonable level of modular capability in their machines. And towers offer unrivaled access to innards via drop down, swing open, as well as side panel sliding doors. Why Apple won’t do it Apple would stand to lose money on new machine purchases with a return to a tower-like design. They’re a publicly-owned company. They have stakeholders and the like to consider and appease. Releasing a machine that consumers would hold on to longer is not in the best interests of a computer maker that relies on machine planned obsolescence in three to five years’ time. Apple typically does not want its customers to mess with hardware it sells them. Whether it’s an iPhone or an iMac, Apple would prefer you bring it to them or an Apple authorized reseller when something goes wrong. If consumers are working on their own Macs’ interiors, this is against the grain of the “hands off by its customers” repair/upgrade approach Apple traditionally takes. By returning to the tower, though, Apple would also (in theory) look to re-enter the display business. Again, with the talk of a more modular Mac pro being bandied about, comes the parallel chatter of an Apple branded display that would accompany it. Apple left the tower business. It also left the monitor business. It doesn’t make any sense to return to something they discarded, right? The old Apple would have done the opposite of what appears logical. Here’s hoping the new Apple can demonstrate regard for its consumers by bringing excitement back to the Mac—even if it doesn’t seem to make business sense.

In addition to settling all litigation related to the intellectual property dispute, the two companies have also agreed to a multi-year patent license, which will see Nokia providing certain network infrastructure products and services to Apple, and Apple returning Nokia’s digital health products (formerly Withings) to its store shelves. The two companies are also exploring future collaboration in digital health initiatives, with regular summits between their top executives to maintain the business relationship. Details of the agreement remain confidential, however Nokia will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple, with additional payments made during the term of the agreement.

It’s one of the best updates of 2017, but it’s also causing problems for many gamers. Here we’ll be going over some of the problems users are facing from the latest Clash update and any potential fixes. Most of the issues are happening on Apple devices, as well as older Samsung smartphones. From weird glitches, games crashing, to not being able to install the update at all. Read: May Clash of Clans Update Frustrates Gamers While the update added some much-needed balance changes to the regular game, it also delivered a brand new element to Clash of Clans, versus battles that happen in real-time. With each new update, problems arise and we’re here to help. Heading to the official Supercell Clash of Clans forum users will notice its full of new reports, bugs or issues from the past few days. This is because the May update is causing a lot of problems. This is typical with any big release, and we can expect a few small bug fixing upgrades in the next few days or this weekend. Can’t Update Clash of Clans An issue we’re seeing a lot of complaints about is users are unable to install the Clash of Clans update, mainly on iOS devices. There are a few different problems happening here at once. For general tips about Clash on iOS click here. The reason most can’t install the Clash of Clans update is because they’re on an old and outdated version of iOS (Apple software) that is no longer supported. Starting with the May Clash of Clans update the game will no longer work on any iPhone, iPod or iPad running software older than iOS 7.0. Like the original iPad or an iPhone 3GS. Update to the latest software or get a new device. Also, those on iOS can try uninstalling Clash of Clans and reinstalling it. Then just sign into Game Center and restore your entire village back to your device and Apple ID account. Make sure it’s saved so you can restore the game first, otherwise you could potentially lose everything. That would be awful. More details for transferring accounts is right here. Samsung Clash of Clans Problems Millions of players with a Samsung device cannot update to the latest version or the game will not load. This is a known issue and Supercell is working on a fix. It looks like a behind the scenes tweak to the Google Play Store listing fixed part of the problem, but not all of it. If you have an older device like the Galaxy S3, try updating again as it should now be available. For those with a Samsung phone that can’t load Clash or it freezes halfway, try clearing the cache and re-installing the game. Otherwise, wait for a fix from Supercell. Back up your game before you uninstall it, to avoid losing your village and progress. Head into Settings > Apps > All Apps > Find Clash of Clans and hit clear cache. Then restart the game and try to play. And finally, on some Samsung devices the game is pixellated and set at a low resolution. This is a known problem that is due to a feature on Samsung phones. Users need to download Samsung’s Game Tuner app, and probably Game Services (Game Mode) to fix the problem in settings. Change graphics to max, and 60 fps. This is from improved graphics APIs in the update. Click here for more details. Clash of Clans Tiny Font (Galaxy S8) The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ both have huge screens that are long and skinny, as does the LG G6. The May Clash of Clans update added support for full-screen mode on the Galaxy S8. However, this made the font tiny, messed up graphics, and in war, some villages are not visible on the screen. You can try heading to Settings > Display > and toggle off full-screen mode, but it’s grayed out for most. Supercell is aware of the problem and will be updating the game in the near future to fix this problem. In the meantime, Galaxy S8 owners can head into Settings > Display > screen zoom & font and increase the screen zoom to medium or make the font bigger. This is a temporary fix as it makes everything on your phone bigger, not just the game. Archers and Wizards Missing from Towers After the May update, dozens of players have reported the Archers and Wizards are missing from their towers. This is a glitch that Supercell is aware of, and are working on a fix. This will not affect your defense during attacks and a simple reboot should fix it. Expect an update soon to solve this minor glitch. Special Offers Not Being Delivered The team at Supercell has added “Special Offers” or special packs players can buy back in October of 2016, but they’re still occasionally having issues with this. The only problem is users are spending real money, and not getting what is promised. This is a huge issue, but Supercell will refund anyone or re-send your special offers. The offer above is $9.99 and gets you 1200 Gems. That’s how much 1200 gems costs on any given day. However, this special pack rewards those who buy it a decent chunk of gold and a level 2 Bomb Tower completely free. The Bomb Tower is 2 million gold, and 3.5 million to upgrade. So you’re getting a lot for free by spending $10. Read: How to Fix Clash Royale Device Not Compatible Problems Countless users on the forum and all over Twitter have confirmed rewards sometimes don’t come through, or they only received the gems. Some bought the $20 pack for 15 million gold and didn’t get anything. You can contact Supercell with the in-game controls and request a refund. Most likely they will respond and say to wait, as it will arrive within the next 1-2 hours. Supercell is able to track who does or doesn’t receive the offer and resend it. Eventually, the offer will arrive or you can request a refund. Not Enough Eligible Members In 2016 Supercell added a Friendly Clan Challenge or Friendly Clan Wars. Some are having problems but that’s because you don’t have enough players. You’re able to start a friendly war with 5v5, 10v10 and so on, in increments of 5. Most players are getting an error that states “Not Enough Eligible Members” and the war won’t start. Make sure none have been in an active war within the past 24 hours, and make sure each clan has more than 5-10 eligible players. Any other issues with this have since been resolved. Can’t Build Two Troops at the Same Time The entire interface for brewing troops and spells or creating an army changed in October, and happens automatically at Builders Base. Now we can hit “retrain” to use the same army as previous battles, instead of tapping 20 times to make troops like before. There’s also 3 pre-sets to make specific attack styles for any situation. Troops brew one at a time now and has been this way for months. Those coming back to the game after the update may be confused. This is the new method, so get used to it. This seems longer, but build times are heavily reduced from the past. Game Crashes After the update, a lot of users are experiencing crashes. The game works fine for most things, but the minute you try to find or start a battle the game crashes or closes. Some are claiming it freezes while traveling between each village. If you can’t play at all right now we suggest reinstalling the game or try clearing the cache in the Android application manager through settings. Similar to the steps mentioned above. We recommend you backup your village first or sync it to Google Play Games. In the next few days, Supercell will release an update to fix any small problems from the May release. Banned After Update Were you banned from Clash of Clans and after the update can’t play? If so, you were probably cheating or using some mods and illegal software. There’s a tool built-in that detect these applications and changes on smartphones and tablets. If detected you’ll instantly be banned permanently from the game. Supercell has warned cheaters time and time again, and in late 2016 started banning anyone caught cheating. If you feel there was a mistake, contact Supercell. Other Details The May Clash of Clans update is one of the biggest in the history of the game. There are tons of changes, new features, and the all-new Builders Base. It’s almost an entirely new game inside of Clash of Clans. Problems will surface, but Supercell is quick to fix things. We’ll add more details as soon as Supercell releases a bug fixing update or explains some of the Samsung issues. Not to mention add more problems, bugs or fixes as they become available. If you can, download the latest Clash of Clans May update today and enjoy all the new content. Drop us a comment below if you’re experiencing any other issues. 12 Comments 12 Comments titilope 10/13/2016 at 6:17 pm Thanks for the commets. I noticed specifically that a lot of samsung galaxy tabb3 users are experiencing what I am also experiencing. The game crashes on loading screen between 1 and 20 percent loading and its really really frustrating Reply Loman 10/14/2016 at 3:04 am I’ve got the same problem as titilope on my Samsung galaxy Tab3 10.1″ I’ve also got a weird glitch on my Samsung S7 where there are no troops in my training queue and yet the last troop I trained keep on training as soon as i’ve got space. My last troop was a lvl 1 miner and I am trying to train valks for the upcoming war but no matter how much miners I donate and even clear, they just keep on being trained even though there are none in the queue. Also there isnt’ even a friendly war option anywhere. Just the normal war and challenges. Other said they can’t start a friendly war but none in our clan (28 members) even have such an option. So far this update for me has been a total waste. The bomb tower is a nice addition, but i’m not impressed with the rest. Reply maccwin 10/14/2016 at 6:59 am i trained usual combo of golem, giants , wiz, valkyries, and archers, it showed 480 troops, but after raid, got 4 dragon, 3 golems etc, what is goin on, coc gone mad after that i empty the queue when back from raid again dragons etc, I did not train them, same with spells 5 eq, can someone explain Reply Belladonna 10/14/2016 at 9:00 am I have to waste gems to boost barracks. Didn’t want dark troop or dark spells and still had to pay to boost them. Not fair!! Sometimes I only want dark and not regular so will waste all those gems if I boost. Queueing troops being made takes longer. Reply Belladonna 10/14/2016 at 9:07 am Game also won’t load on Samsung Tab, so haven’t been able to play since wednesday night. it loaded about twice after many tries, but no more. I have uninstalled, cleared cache and done all the usual but still nothing. I wanted to buy the new package but won’t if I can’t even load the game. And recently bought 1200 gems and what if I can never play again? I’m beginning to dread CoC updates, as there are always problems and costing us more money and gems like with the barracks and spell factories boosting all at once instead of individually like before. Reply Dani Dimitrov 10/15/2016 at 12:26 pm I really want to buy the TH pack but it says the transaction can’t be completed or something like that. Can someone please tell me if there is possible fix. Reply ds 10/15/2016 at 5:27 pm Another annoying bug is that you can no longer fully zoom in your base. Before the update you could zoom in completely and see the base by moving up and down. Now it won’t zoom fully so you have to move side to side as well as up and down. This has a negative vertigo effect when searching for an opponent as the screen zooms out on every click of the attack button just after the clouds part. Also a lot more false taps are happening due to this as instead of dropping troops, tapping on buildings etc it moves the screen side to side… NEver thought I’d get vertigo from Clash …. Reply nia 10/17/2016 at 12:23 am Will you please reconsider your decision of the permanent banned villages :) Reply Na 11/23/2016 at 7:07 pm If I’m in battle or war, each time a troop finishes it crashes. I have to make sure my troops are all done brewing before an attack. Anybody have a fix? Reply Edgee 12/15/2016 at 7:30 pm I cannot see my troops or villgers in my town. Even the army in the towers. Barbarian king and archer queen is invisible as well. Basically, there’s no people in my village. I am using Ipad Mini 1 Reply Nasir 02/23/2017 at 1:06 am when i open coc then see downloading constant but not open and again loading but not open. plzz help me Reply ali 04/04/2017 at 2:54 am My clash of clan get installed but not playing .the device is samsung galaxy prime .what can be its solution.plz tell fast .

Small, but annoying problems are common with new device categories. For most users, these Apple Watch problems are not a major issue, but some of these can break the Apple Watch experience for some users and it may require sending the Apple Watch back to Apple for a replacement in extreme cases. Read: Best Apple Watch Accessories The Apple Watch went on sale in 2015 and the Apple Watch Series 2 in 2016. Since then Apple delivered several WatchOS updates designed to fix problems and bugs that can prevent owners from using the Apple Watch or form using all the features. At this point, there are not widespread Apple Watch problems to the level of iPhone 4 antenna problems or iPhone 6 bending complaints, but these issues and bugs are ones that you can fix or at least work around. The first thing to do is install the latest Apple Watch update, which may fix your Apple Watch problem without additional troubleshooting. Apple Watch Problems Learn how to fix common Apple Watch problems. With that in mind here are the Apple Watch problems you need to know about and what you can do about some of these issues and problems. You may see these Apple Watch problems pop up on the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch models. In most cases, the Apple watch issues impact the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport alike, but there are some issues linked directly to the more expensive Apple Watch models. Here’s how to fix common Apple Watch problems on your own. Fix Apple Watch Bluetooth Problems Some users complain that the Apple Watch Bluetooth connection to the iPhone is not consistent. This is not a problem on our Apple Watch, but if it does impact your Apple Watch you can fix this with a quick toggle on your iPhone. Turning Bluetooth off and then back on  with your iPhone should solve this problem. If you continue to have this problem, you should attempt to re-pair the Apple Watch with your iPhone. You should also make sure that your Apple Watch software is up to date and your iPhone software is up to date. How to Fix Apple Watch No iPhone Connection Problems Another issue that you may run into after using Airplane mode or turning your Apple Watch back on is a no iPhone connection error. If that happens there are some things you can try to solve the problem on your own. The first step is to restart the iPhone by holding the side button and then sliding to power off. You should also restart your iPhone so that it is set coming back online to look for the Apple Watch fresh. Hold the iPhone power button until you see the option to turn it off. If that does not work you may need to jump to the last section of this guide to fix stubborn Apple Watch problems. Fix Bad Apple Watch Battery Life One option is to limit heart rate monitoring during workouts. Overall the Apple Watch battery life is better than advertised lasting a full day in our tests, but there are some complaints from users who are experiencing bad Apple Watch battery life. Here are several solutions to fix bad Apple Watch battery life problems. Limit notifications – Notifications light up the screen push the Taptic feedback and cause you to use the watch. Limit useless notifications and your battery life will improve. Limit these in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Use Bluetooth – When you are not connected to the phone by Bluetooth the phone resorts to WiFi which is not as power friendly. Turn off heart rate monitoring – Go to Apple Watch app -> Workout -> Power Saving Mode -> On. This will stop using the hear rate sensor during workouts to help the Apple Watch battery last longer. Reboot – Restart your Apple Watch. This simple solution can fix a lot of problems. If all else fails you can turn on the Power Reserve mode to make the Apple Watch battery life last longer. Hold the side button and swipe left to right on Power Reserve. You can open the Apple Watch app -> General -> Usage and scroll down to the bottom of the Apple Watch to see the battery usage and standby times. If these are the same then there is a problem with your Apple Watch and you may need to remove a problem app or start from scratch. You can also see your Power Reserve time on this page. How to Fix Bad iPhone Battery Life With Apple Watch Another common problem is bad iPhone battery life when connected to the Apple Watch. This is more common than complaints about Apple Watch battery life. Noticed my iPhone's battery was abnormally low, especially for barely having used it today. So now we know why. pic.twitter.com/9sJuPrpH0Q — Ryan Block (@ryan) April 26, 2015 When this happens you will see the Apple Watch app listed as one of the highest users of power and your Usage and Standby time will show as the same, similar to the image above. If this happens you need to restart the iPhone and the Apple Watch and wait for them to reconnect. This should fix the problem for most users. If this does not solve that issue, you will need to pair the Apple Watch with your iPhone again. If this issue continues, make sure your iPhone and Apple WatchOS software are up to date. How to Fix Apple Watch Scratches The Stainless Steel Apple Watch scratches pretty easily along the sides of the metal case. This isn’t from abuse or rough treatment. Instead, this is due to the softness of the Stainless Steel. Reports on Twitter, Instagram and Reddit detailed the scratches shortly after the Apple Watch release. The good news is that this is one Apple Watch problem that you can fix on your own for less than $10. Watch the video above and check out our walkthrough to fix Apple Watch scratches. Apple Watch Problems for Users with Tattoos If you have a wrist tattoo you might need to disable a feature to make the Apple Watch work. Some users with wrist tattoos cannot use the Apple Watch to the fullest. The ink prevents the on-wrist detection for some users with dark wrist tattoos. This is not an issue with all wrist tattoos and this issue does not mean the Apple Watch cannot work on darker skin. If you experience this problem, you can go to the Apple Watch app -> General -> Wrist Detection Off. This will remove the on body detection so that notifications come through, but this will not allow the Apple Watch to use Apple Pay. How to Fix Slow Apple Watch Performance You can try uninstalling apps if the Apple Watch performance is sluggish. One of the complaints about the Apple Watch performance is that it can slow down when you load a lot of apps on it. If you go to the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, you can limit the apps installed on your Apple Watch and this may fix the problem. Go to the Apple Watch app -> Scroll down -> tap on an app you don’t use -> Tap on the toggle to turn off Show on Apple Watch. This will uninstall the app. Read: 30 Apple Watch Tips & Tricks This will not fix apps loading information slowly on the phone, but does help in some cases with general slowdowns. Apple WatchOS updates have helped with the overall performance of the Apple Watch, so once again make sure you update. How to Fix Apple Watch Charging Problems How to fix Apple Watch not charging problems. If your Apple Watch does not charge when it is on the charger there is most likely not a problem with your charger or the hardware of your watch, but you will need to take steps to fix this problem. On the Apple Support Forums there are several complaints about the Apple Watch not charging. If this happens to you, try the following steps which Apple walked one of the users through. “Turn off the watch (hold side button (while not on charge) and then swipe to power off like iPhone) Then Reset the watch Hold the Digital crown and the side button and the same time until you see the apple logo Put on charger and see if it charges. If this does not work do the following: reboot iPhone go to apple watch app in the apple watch app go to > general > reset > erase all content and settings wait for watch to erase and reboot to language screen Set up the watch until you see the app bubbles” If these steps fail, make sure all of the packaging is off of the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch charger. If that fails you likely need to contact Apple for a replacement. How to Fix Apple Watch Digital Crown Problems If the Digital Crown on your Apple Watch does not control the watch like you would expect or is difficult to turn you may need to clean it. Apple recommends taking the watch bands off, turning the Apple Watch off and then run warm water over the Digital Crown for 10 to 15 seconds. After this is complete allow the watch to dry, turn it back on and see if your issue is resolved. If not you may need to contact Apple for support. How to Fix Stubborn Apple Watch Problems Sometimes you will run into an Apple Watch problem that won’t go away. You can use the following process to unpair your Apple Watch and iPhone and start over. As part of this process the Apple Watch will backup and you will be able to restore that backup if you want to get back to where you were. On your iPhone open the Watch app. Tap on My Watch and tap Apple Watch. Tap Unpair Apple Watch. Next, tap to confirm and if you have Activation Lock on, enter your Apple ID password to turn it off. This will trigger a new backup, which may take a little while. Keep the iPhone and Apple Watch close until this is done. After it completes the Apple Watch will restart and you can point your iPhone at it to start the pairing process again. 30 Exciting Things You Can Do With the Apple Watch Answer Calls on the Apple Watch   1 / 30 You can answer a call on your Apple Watch using it as a small Bluetooth speaker phone. After using a similar feature from a Samsung watch we know you'll definitely want to use this only for short calls and to be conscious of where you are taking calls. If you wouldn't talk on speakerphone, you shouldn't talk on your Apple Watch. You cannot answer a FaceTime or FaceTime Audio call on the Apple Watch. You can choose to answer and transfer a call to the iPhone.    1 / 30 28 Comments 28 Comments Logan 04/29/2015 at 2:19 pm On day one with my Apple Watch sport, I wore my watch to play sand volleyball. I figured that it’s the sport edition, meant for somewhat strenuous activity. Also, I wanted to be able to track my activity as I repeatedly spiked so many balls, so well. After around 1 hour of game play, I went to push my digital crown button to light up the watch. It wouldn’t budge. One to two tiny grains of sand had got into the crease between the button and the watch. It took me the better part of the evening to get the sand out and make the digital crown usable again. Long story short, Apple Watch NOT sand friendly. Please pass this along. Reply Soluble Apps 07/22/2015 at 5:43 am I had the same problem. I’m sure you know by know, but the official fix for this problem is to run the crown part of the watch under a tap.

Reply Dolores 01/27/2016 at 9:26 am PapaCat Jun 14, 2015 8:00 AM in response to Tendersyl My Sports Watch worked just find for the first few weeks. Now, several times a day it zooms to the maximum — actually about 100 times wha the maximum zoom should be. The watch becomes unusable for several hours a day, then mysteriously “unzooms by itself. I used to be able to “unzoom” it by double-tapping with 2 fingers, but that no longer works. I did find that if I connect it to its charging cord it seems to “unzoom” itself, but how many of us carry around the charging cord when going about our daily business. The first time it zoomed by itself I called Apple Support and was told that quickly pressing the crown 3 times toggles the zoom feature. It never worked for me — maybe you will have better luck. Like I wrote above, for about a week I was able to “unzoom” by double tapping with two fingers, but that no longer works. My watch seems to be getting worst each day, and my next step will be to bring it to the Genius Bar and see if they can run any diagnostics on it. Good luck with your problem. Reply Gwen 06/04/2016 at 7:56 am My Apple Watch is doing the same thing with zooming to the maximum and then can not get it to go back to normal for a long period of time. This is so frustrating. What is causing this? I have tried everything, Reply Sandra Bayes 02/15/2017 at 8:03 am I’m having the same problem with the face zooming to overly large. The solution is inconsistent. Sometimes tapping helps, sometimes pressing the crown, sometimes just clears up on own. Very frustrating!

I tried several thing to get it to come on. after no response. i decided to get it ready to take back to the store.

Reply charlie malone 04/23/2017 at 4:20 pm my problem as of 4 23 17 is that the watch has been dropped by from about 3-4 feet…unbeknownst to me the lens cracked , but the watch worked fine, i did not know that the lens had a small crack….some time later c. 3-5 weeks , the watch stopped working (just went black and did not ever regain life). shipped it to the repair facility in texas and was told that when the lens is cracked the warranty is voided. In other words, dropping the watch and cracking the lens voids the warranty even though dropping did not cause the damage that gave rise to the watch not working…i am of the opinion that the watch is too fragile and the cracked lens- voiding the warranty is a dodge so that apple will not have to make good on the warranty of a watch that is unreasonably fragile…the watch was c. 4 months old when it stopped working.

Apple continues to refine its iOS 10 operating system with milestone upgrades and maintenance releases. The latest, iOS 10.3.2, is a small maintenance release. A bug fix update. It brings a few bug fixes and a several important security update to the company’s fleet of iPads. The iPad’s iOS 10.3.2 update isn’t a milestone upgrade but it’s worth monitoring as we push away from its release date. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.2 from iOS 10.3.1 your update is just bug fixes and security patches. If you’re coming to it from something older than iOS 10.3.1, your iPad’s iOS 10.3.2 update will be larger thanks to the fixes and features from previous versions of iOS. They’re baked in. Our guide to the iPad iOS 10.3.2 update takes a look at the iOS 10.3.2 update’s performance on several popular iPad variants. It also takes you through some of the iOS 10.3.2 problems currently plaguing iPad users and outlines key details about Apple’s next iOS updates for the iPad. We’ll continue to update this with new information so check back in as the month goes on. iPad iOS 10.3.2 Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 We've installed the iOS 10.3.2 update on four iPad variants: The 9-inch iPad Pro, the iPad Air 2, the iPad mini 2, and the original iPad Air. You can expect the entire installation process to take in and around 10 minutes if you're coming to it from iOS 10.3.1. Mileage will, of course, vary. If you're coming to iOS 10.3.2 from something older your download process could take 15 minutes or more so make sure you carve out some time to get the job done.  In the week since the iOS 10.3.2 update's release we've been taking a look at several key areas of performance including including battery life, connectivity, and UI speed.  So far, battery life has been excellent on all of these iPad models. We haven't noticed abnormal battery drain and we've been able to get more than a full day of use out of them. If you recently installed iOS 10.3.2, and you're noticing weird drain, you should give the battery a few days to settle in. If you continue to see issues with battery life, you should take action. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are holding up. We've tested these slates with several different ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices and we haven't run into any problems with speed or random disconnects. Our connections are stable.  We're using the iPad mini 2 on AT&T's network and we haven't noticed any issues with cellular data. LTE and 4G are working fine.  We haven't experienced any random reboots or freezes/lockups and we've noticed improvements to the UI speed on the iPad Air 2 and the iPad mini 2, particularly when opening up folders and apps. This was an issue for us on iOS 10.2.1 and below. iOS 10.3.2 feels fast and stable on all four of these iPad models. We haven't noticed any major problems though some users are noticing various performance issues so you'll want to be extremely careful, especially if you own an older model.  If you need additional feedback, please take a peek at our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.2 update right now.    1 / 9 2 Comments 2 Comments Joe U 04/09/2017 at 4:31 pm Messaging appears to be messed up after the 10.3.1 upgrade on an iPad Pro. Messages are appearing in the incorrect threads and some phone numbers cannot be reached at all even though they worked just previous to the upgrade. The phone number is not registered with iMessage error now appears even though that same number works on an iPhone. Reply máy chạy bộ 04/28/2017 at 3:36 pm Excellent beat !

Apple will resume carrying Nokia digital health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in Apple retail and online stores, and Apple and Nokia are exploring future collaboration in digital health initiatives. Regular summits between top Nokia and Apple executives will ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This agreement will strengthen our collaboration,” said Basil Alwan, President of Nokia’s IP/Optical Networks business. “We look forward to supporting Apple.” Nokia will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple with additional revenues during the term of the agreement. Revenues will start to be recognized in the second quarter of 2017. Follow iClarified Comments (1) Add Comment Raven - 11 hours ago Yet another burn to Microsoft.

Gotta Be Mobile Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] 5 Things to Know About the iOS 10.3.2 Update The iOS 10.3.2 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch is now the most up-to-date version of iOS 10. This guide will walk you through the most important things to know about the iOS 10.3.2 update and some of its problems. We’ll also tell you about how it performs on the iPhone and iPad. The company’s latest version of iOS 10 isn’t a big milestone upgrade but, iOS 10.3.2 is still a very important release thanks to the bug fixes and security patches on board. The iOS 10.3.2 could have a positive impact on your device’s performance. It could also cause problems if you aren’t careful. With that in mind, we want to go over the most important things you need to know about the iOS 10.3.2 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Let’s start with a basic look at iOS 10.3.2’s performance on four popular iPhone variants: The iPhone 7, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5. iOS 10.3.2 Review The iOS 10.3.2 update might be a maintenance release but the download is close to 200MB for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. That’s if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.3.1. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.2 from something a little older, say iOS 10.2.1, you can expect your download to be much larger. The download only took us a few seconds (we downloaded the update while connected to a high-speed Wi-Fi network) but the installation took about seven minutes on the iPhone 7. It’ll take a lot longer if you skipped iOS 10.3 and/or iOS 10.3.1. We recommend putting 15 minutes aside so that you can monitor both the iOS 10.3.2 download and installation. Install 10.3.2. We’ve spent a full week with the iOS 10.3.2 update but it appears to be stable on the iPhone 7, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5. We haven’t noticed any freaky battery drain and we’ve been able to connect to various Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices. AT&T’s LTE and 4G networks are also working properly. Core applications like Gmail, Slack, Asana, Twitter, Spotify, Soundcloud, and Google Chrome are also functioning as normal with iOS 10.3.2 on board. We haven’t noticed any random reboots or UI lag nor have run into any debilitating bugs. That could change down the road but for now, iOS 10.3.2 feels stable on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 5. If you need additional feedback about iOS 10.3.2 and its changes, take a look at our reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3.2 update on your device right now. It should help you one to one side of the fence or the other. If you’re looking for more substantial feedback, take a look at our iPhone 7, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 roundups. We’re planning to take closer looks at the iPhone 6s and iPad iOS 10.3.2 updates as well. Be on the lookout for those impressions later this month. iOS 10.3.2 Update: What’s New All signs pointed to a small maintenance release and that’s exactly what iOS 10.3.2 is. It fixes some bugs and it improves device security. iOS 10.3.2’s change log is pretty thin. We know the update fixes some problems with SiriKit car commands. We also know that it brings 23 security patches to beef up security on the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It doesn’t come with much else, unless of course you decided to skip Apple’s iOS 10.3.1 update and/or its iOS 10.3 update. If you skipped either one of those, iOS 10.3.2 will bring changes from those updates to your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. iOS 10.3.1 was a small bug fixer but the company’s iOS 10.3 update delivered a new file system, a Find My AirPods features, and a long list of other changes. Make sure you get familiar with those before you download iOS 10.3.2. iOS 10.3.2 Problems iOS 10.3.2 went through a six week beta process but problems have slipped into the final version. We’ve seen complaints about installation problems (some of these issues come from people moving off the iOS 10.3.2 beta), weird battery drain, connectivity issues, and bad performance including lag and random reboots. It’s still early so we expect complaints about iOS 10.3.2 problems to pickup as we push away from the update’s release date. If you’re struggling with iOS 10.3.2 problems, please take a look at our list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems. You’ll also want to take a look at our tips to improve iOS 10 performance. If your situation is dire you might try dropping down to the iOS 10.3.1 update in an effort to improve your device’s performance. Sadly, you can’t drop back down to anything older than iOS 10.3.1. The iOS 10.3 and iOS 10.2.1 downgrade paths are now closed. For more on the downgrade process, see our iOS 10 downgrade walkthrough. iOS 10.3.2 Jailbreak Jailbreak developers recently demonstrated an iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak. The proof of concept, which can be seen in the video below, is a great sign for those looking to jailbreak iOS 10.3.1. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen or heard anything about an iOS 10.3.2 jailbreak release for iPhone and iPad. iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak release rumors pointed to a release sometime after the release of iOS 10.3.2 but nothing’s been released yet. For now, current and prospective iOS 10 jailbreak users must contend with the public iOS 10.2 jailbreak tool. What’s Next Apple’s already launched a new version of iOS 10. The iOS 10.3.3 update is confirmed for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and it’s currently in beta ahead of an unknown release date. The iOS 10.3.3 update, like iOS 10.3.2, appears to be a maintenance release focused on under-the-hood improvements and security. The first iOS 10.3.3 beta also includes some new iPad Pro wallpapers which could be a hint at new products to come. Apple is rumored to have new iPads in store for its annual developer conference (WWDC) in June. We expect the iOS 10.3.3 to stay in beta for a few more days as Apple engineers and beta testers poke and prod it for issues. Apple’s iOS 10.3.3 update isn’t the only iOS update on the horizon. The company will deliver its WWDC 2017 keynote on the morning of June 5th and it’s there we’ll probably hear about iOS 10’s successor. iOS 11 isn’t confirmed but there’s a good chance we’ll hear about some of its features, its release date, and a beta on stage during the keynote. Apple typically releases the first beta shortly after the conclusion of its keynote so we’re expecting an iOS 11 beta to arrive on June 5th. For more on the iOS 11 beta, please take a look at our expectations. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.2 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.2 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.2 brings (by our count) 23 security patches for a potential exploits. That's a ton for a small maintenance update and a great reason to install iOS 10.3.2 in the near future. Your iOS 10.3.2 update will bring even more security features if you failed to download previous versions of iOS. If you skipped iOS 10.3.1, your iOS 10.3.2 update will bring its security patch. If you skipped iOS 10.3, iOS 10.3.2 will also bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.2 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device.    1 / 13 3 Comments 3 Comments Gustavo 05/03/2017 at 8:43 am redundant, irrelevant Reply xterminate 05/15/2017 at 3:04 am so much iOS 10.3.2 keyword for SEO. overdone. useless website Reply Luca 05/23/2017 at 11:39 am This update has messed up the battery on my iPhone.

Smith, who has been at Apple since 1997, will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. By Sara Ashley O'Brien NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Apple has hired its first head of diversity. Longtime Apple employee Denise Young Smith has taken on a new role as vice president of inclusion and diversity. The company hasn't had someone heading up those efforts since Jeffrey Siminoff left the company to join Twitter in 2015. He had been director of inclusion and diversity since 2013. Smith, who has been at Apple since 1997, will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, a source familiar with the company told CNNTech. The news of Smith's new position was first reported by 9 to 5 Mac. Smith, who started in her new role on Monday, had already updated her LinkedIn page with her new title. Smith has held prominent positions at Apple. Most recently, she was vice president of global talent and human resources; she was also part of the leadership team that built out Apple's retail business. Cook has said that diversity is a "readily solvable issue," explicitly saying in 2015 that he wanted to hire more women. The company's latest diversity report revealed a workforce that's still predominately white and male. Although Apple did report a slight increase in hiring female and black technical employees in the U.S. compared to 2014. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

In December last year, the Finnish firm alleged Apple had infringed on 32 of its patents, after Apple halted royalty payments over allegations of patent trolling. Nokia filed 40 lawsuits worldwide, while also seeking to block US imports of devices it deemed to have infringed the patents in question. Related: Microsoft Surface Pro 2017 - What you need to know However, before a repeat of the epic showdown between Samsung and Apple could bore us all to tears, the two firms have instead decided to come together in friendship. The patents - relating to chipsets, display tech, software, UI, video coding and antennas - are now being licensed once again, while Nokia will also receive a chunk of cash upfront. Nokia-owned products like the Withings-branded health devices will return to Apple retail outlets. Nokia will also provide “certain network infrastructure product and services to Apple.” As part of the agreement, the two firms have agreed to “regular summits” and “future collaboration in digital health initiatives.” Apple COO Jeff Williams said: “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia.” Meanwhile, Maria Varsellona, chief legal officer at Nokia, added: “This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple.

The deal means Nokia will get bigger royalties from Apple for using its mobile phone patents, helping offset the impact of waning demand for its mobile network hardware. Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia's digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France's Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. "There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel," said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an "accumulate" recommendation for Nokia shares. "I have not given any value so far for Nokia's digital health business, but might apply an option value to it." INDUSTRIAL DEAL Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told the company's annual general meeting later on Tuesday that the deal would help expand network sales beyond telecom operators to global internet and technology giants. "(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centres," he said. "It's a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it." Under the patent licence agreement, Nokia will receive a "significant" upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. "It's interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure," said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped to their highest since February 2016 and were up 6.7 percent at 5.89 euros by 1509 GMT. A previous patent licence contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. "(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners," Nokia's Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. QUICK RESOLUTION Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution of the dispute between Apple and Nokia. "Nokia told analysts in April don't calculate on any licence revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia's legal expenses," said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. "For Nokia, it's good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact," said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. "The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros." Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the U.S. company's patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia's overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia's patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world's dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents. Nokia's total sales in 2016 were about 24 billion euros.

The tech giant recently launched a section of its website explaining to consumers who might own an Android device why they should switch to the iPhone. The section is found when navigating Apple's site for the iPhone, or at www.apple.com/switch.  The top of the page features the headline "Life is easier on the iPhone," followed by a series of questions such as "Is the camera as good as they say?" and "Why is iPhone so fast?" When you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you have the option to buy one of several iPhone models. It also published YouTube videos, highlighting how easy it is to switch music to iPhone, and how fast its hallmark device is.  © Apple Red special edition iPhone 7. Last quarter, Apple reported iPhone shipments below Wall Street forecasts, citing consumers waiting to see what the company will reveal this fall. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's launch, and Apple is reportedly planning big things for its flagship device. In February, The Wall Street Journal reported Apple will launch one iPhone model with a curved screen that will cost around $1,000. It's reportedly one of three models Apple is expected to introduce this fall.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

deadspin Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root deadspin Will Cars Ever Die? Drew MagaryYesterday 2:20pm Filed to: funbag balls deep drew magary cars flying cars automobiles 305 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Illustration by Sam Woolley Time for your weekly edition of the Deadspin Funbag. Got something on your mind? Email the Funbag. Today, we’re talking animal attacks, pee tapes, Red Vines, and more. Before we get into the Funbag, here are some quick announcements. First of all, I started a newsletter, which you can subscribe to here if you feel like doing that to yourself. Secondly, The Hike comes out in paperback on July 4. There will be a small tour, with the requisite drinking and merriment. I’ll post dates here sometime when I feel like it. Now for your letters: Advertisement Brian: Is a flying car a plane? No it’s an aircraft, but it’s not a plane because a plane has wings and a tail and shit. If we’re going by my imagined design of a flying car—which is probably not structurally sound—it still looks and drives like a landbound car, only you can push a button and zoom up into the sky if the left lane is shut down due to roadwork. There are some flying car prototypes out there where I’m like, “That’s not a fucking flying car.” If there’s a helicopter rotor and just one seat, it’s not a flying car. It needs to be relatively compact and so user-friendly that you can fly it while simultaneously reaching into a McDonald’s bag to grab an early fry or two before landing home. Truthfully, there probably needs to be a future beyond cars and planes, where a new sort of craft becomes the dominant mode of transport. I can guarantee you that there’s a team of Apple engineers holed up right now who have been given orders to develop not an Apple car, but a CAR KILLER. Just a dozen Steve Jobs wannabes around a fancy white table going, “What if it had NO seats?” They desperately want Tim Cook to unveil some hovering trapezoid three years from now that changes the entire foundation of human transportation. But they’ll probably come up empty and just push out another iPhone with a slightly better camera. Sponsored Even though we need to move on from cars for the good of both the environment and urban planning, they’ll never be able to kill the car entirely, because the science isn’t feasible AND because there are people like me who are wedded to the idea of cars, flying or not. I want an enclosed pod, with X number of seats, and a kickass stereo system, and I want it to be PRIVATE, so that I don’t have to make any needless stops and so I can scream obscenities at other flying car drivers as they fly by. I’m too used to car culture to accept the iZoid, or whatever the fuck they try to invent to top it. Rob: If you were to wear a suit of metal spikes covering your entire body, would you be invincible to every type of animal attack? I would have to assume so???... No, no way. You could still get badly fucked up. Some animals have insanely tough skin. An elephant’s skin is over an inch thick. Stepping on you would be like stepping on a tack for them. Also, many of them may not CARE if they get pricked by metal spikes as they throw you around until your body is limp and ragged. I have read enough florid descriptions of bullfights to know that getting stabbed only makes the bull angrier. A bull could still ruin you. A hippo could still ruin you. An anaconda could still ruin you. It could probably find the weak spot in your armor and then strangle you from within. And we haven’t even gotten to microbes. No one ever beat anthrax with pointy armor. Advertisement You also need to factor in mobility to surviving an animal attack. A suit of metal spikes is extremely heavy. Back in the day, soldiers who wore full plate armor were well-protected from arrows and sword attacks. Spanish conquistadors could be outnumbered 100:1 by native armies and still defeat them with good armor and harquebusiers. BUT the armor was so heavy that if you fell from your horse, you were dead meat because you were literally unable to get up. People could just walk up and slit your throat, easy peasy. Armor is fickle like that. Do you know they would march through the Amazon rainforest in this shit? Can you even imagine? I’d fucking kill myself. Chet: Advertisement Let’s say you are Vladimir Putin, and you do, in fact, have the Don Trump piss tape in your possession. At what point do you release it? On the one hand, it would create absolute chaos in the American political landscape immediately. On the other hand...I assume Putin wants to ensure he squeezes every last drop (no pun intended) out of this useful idiot before he sets the world on fire with the tape. So do you release it...during impeachment hearings? After Trump takes some sort of anti-Russian policy position? Or do you simply wait until he’s out of office and release it just for fun? As if to say “Your precious democracy elected this fucking guy.” What makes the most sense strategically? Oh, I’d never release it. I would use it to extort Trump until Trump is dead, and then use it to extort his kids, and his kids’ kids, and his kids’ kids’ elementary school friends. Vladimir Putin has no interest in YOU ever seeing that tape. A secret loses its power once it’s no longer secret. I think Putin is cut from the same cloth as J. Edgar Hoover: men who prize secrets because those secrets give them permanent dominion over certain individuals, and because—on a primal level—they relish having sole possession of such treasures. I bet Hoover treated his MLK tapes like he owned a fucking Picasso. So if it were up to Putin, you’d never see the pee tape. Why end Trump’s career when you can keep the ongoing disgrace of America going on and on in perpetuity with it locked safely away? He probably has it stored in a giant warehouse next to the fucking Ark of the Covenant. I keep waiting every day for that pee tape to break, but I should know better. It’s gone, man. We’ll never have the chance to watch Donald Trump order escorts to piss on one another. SAD. Advertisement Frank: What’s the best way to split a cab fare with a buddy when you’re making two stops? Does the person who gets out first pay the whole fare to that point, half the fare to that point, half the total fare? How much compensation is necessary if the first stop is out of the way? Don’t bother. Dinner math is annoying enough. When it comes to cabs and/or Ubers, I would just pay it all if I were the last stop, and then my friend can get the next cab, or a round of drinks later on. I’m too drunk and tired to haggle, and a round of drinks is really useful as make-good currency anyway. I used to do cab math and try to split the fare evenly, but the chances of you having correct change for that at 3 a.m. are .00000002%. You’re either paying it all, or paying nothing, or grunting and throwing a sawbuck at your friend and hoping that magically evens things out. It’s not worth splitting hairs when you can just come out even later on. Advertisement Please note that this assumes your friend is not a deadbeat who never pays shit back. If you are friends with a deadbeat, make his ass walk. I know that, with Uber, there’s always that awkward moment when someone has to take the initiative and actually order the thing, knowing full well they’ll get charged for the whole ride. It’s natural to have your inner cheapskate be like, “Oh shit, I’m the one who’s gonna have to pay it all, huh?” But eventually you have to grow up and have faith that you’ll get compensated on the back end. Simon: Advertisement What percentage of people masturbate for the last time realizing they are doing so? Aw man, you just ruined my day. I think it’s a pretty low percentage. I can’t imagine there are too many old fogies with colon cancer who have a whole final night of masturbating planned, with candles and decorations and a favorite last porn clip queued up and waiting for them. That’s not it works. Either you die before getting a chance to jerk off again, or you become so sick and frail that, at some point, you’re like, “Oh, I guess that was it for me and jerking it.” Just a very terse realization that that chapter of your life is over. I’m gonna go cry now. Brendan: Advertisement I work in an office with a pretty excellently stocked kitchen. One of the more popular items we have is the giant container of Red Vines. What is the most vines I can take in a kitchen run without being seen as a glutton? I think the number is either 3 or 4 but I can’t really decide. Yeah, that seems like a reasonable handful. If you take a dozen it’s too conspicuous, like running out of the kitchen with a bouquet of roses in your hand. As always, the key to office gorging is to take a small amount, and then wait a few minutes, and then take another small amount, and then repeat the process until there are only two Red Vines left and you hate yourself. Then someone finally finishes off the bucket and you have the audacity to be upset with them. No matter how responsible you may be for it, there’s nothing more dispiriting than an empty office kitchen. It’s a space of infinite cruelty. Advertisement Johnny: I was reading some news on English soccer and noticed both the press and the coaches are mean as hell when they’re talking about teams and players. I saw some coaches publicly calling out dudes for fucking up just one play. Should American press and coaches do this? Would teams be better? I think it really depends on the team and the situation. Like, college coaches who throw their players under the bus (see: Kelly, Brian) can funnel a gallon of liquid shit. But if you’re coaching grown men and they all show up to the game hung over, I think you’ve got the right to blast them so long as you also take some accountability for the assbeating (Tom Coughlin never, EVER did this). In general, I think the best coaching strategy is to say nothing of substance publicly and ruthlessly own the shit out of your players in private meetings. English soccer teams are a whole other matter. I support those coaches going ballistic because A) When they get mad, it’s fucking HILARIOUS (’Arry went out there and played like right shite, ‘e did!), B) Soccer players are fancypants GLORY BOYS and deserve to get knocked down a peg, and C) There’s only so much some loser soccer coach can do to influence a game. You put the best players out there, hope they score a lot, and make a few key subs if guys look gassed. EASY JOB. I could and should be hired to do it. I Should Coach The USMNT By now you know that U.S. Soccer has fired head coach Jurgen Klinnsman (immigrants losing their…Read more I feel like Denny Green and Jim Mora essentially killed that postgame rant. They were so good at bitching out their own team that no coach does it anymore because they don’t want to become a meme-able distraction. I need a nihilist coach who isn’t afraid to turn into Don Rickles at the postgame presser. “Folks, this team is a fucking disgrace. Someone take us out back and fire paintballs at our asses.” Advertisement Spencer: Recently, a friend of mine was at a large music festival and overheard someone crying in the stall next to them. They peaked over to discover an honest-to-goodness supermodel totally hammered and crying because they were too smashed to wipe their own ass. My friend, being the good Samaritan she is, ended up guiding said supermodel through the process. Is she crazy for helping a stranger, albeit a very famous stranger, wipe their own ass? Ooooh, was it Kate Moss? Or maybe one of those supermodels who’s fake BFFs with Taylor Swift? I bet it was the latter. Anyway, your friend definitely went above and beyond the call of duty in wiping a stranger’s ass. I’d like to think I have that kind of innate kindness within me, but I know that’s a lie. We’re talking about a dirtyass festival toilet. God only know what kind of Satanic plague awaits you if you delve into the muck. If I’m wiping a drunk supermodel’s ass, there better be VIP passes to the exclusive, supermodel-only festival viewing terrace for me. I want entrance into the land of milk & honey. It’s only fair. NO FREE WIPES, LADY. Advertisement HALFTIME! Matt: First bite of a meal: side dish or main attraction? I started thinking about this recently and I realized I take a bite of a side dish 100% of the time. I have no idea why. Meat first! I’m not patient enough to start with the side dish, and I hate people who performatively eat the vegetables first and are like OH THESE ARE THE REAL STARS OF THE PLATE. Fuck you. You gotta hit the meat first, when it’s at its freshest/most sizzling. The chef will disappointed if you don’t make it a priority to lop off the fatty, charred end of that ribeye and let it EXPLODE in your mouth. I wanna be the first person at the table to be like, “Oh, this looks so good,” and then I wanna be the first to be like, “Ommmmigod it IS so good!” I want my ordering skillz firmly established right away. Advertisement By the way, the current dining scene must be a total nightmare if you’re some fussy dipshit who has to keep everything on the plate separate. Restaurants today are big into harmony, which means everything is commingled on the plate, and you use your knife to wipe each bite of meat with whatever fancy celery root puree is pooled below. If you’re like Andy Rooney and need everything segregated like a TV dinner, you’re screwed. I have no sympathy. Brett: Advertisement Do you think the NFL would ever consider adopting a loan system like international soccer leagues? The gap between the college game and the professional is sizable and there are enough teams with quarterback needs that it seems like someone might be willing to take on a Goff or a Garoppolo in exchange for paying all or a percentage of their yearly salary with play time stipulations set by the team the player is under contract to (and whom he wouldn’t be allowed to take the field against). What are the negatives I’m not seeing (besides injury) in having this opportunity to develop players before they get to start? Well you can’t just say “besides injury” because that would be such an overriding concern. If I loan out a soccer player, there’s not nearly as much injury risk. At worst, the guy maybe chips his tooth on a champagne flute. If I have a high draft pick like Goff or a prized backup like Janeane Garofalo, I can’t risk lending them out to some other team and seeing them get killed. You got NFL coaches who are roasted just for putting dudes on the kickoff team, so imagine one of their players getting hurt, and not even in the course of playing for them. They’d get crushed. Advertisement Also, the NFL would never have a loan system for the same reason you rarely see in-season trades in the NFL. Teams want to develop players within their system, which is always some proprietary, utterly byzantine series of playbooks that every player is expected to master (and players who are talented but cannot master it are seen as useless). Teams don’t want you learning some other system from some other team. You’ll come back to them babbling playcalls in some strange, unknown language, and then they’ll have to have you unlearn everything you’ve learned. This lack of fluidity is a real problem in the NFL. The whole chess match shit has gone way too far, to the point where a lot of otherwise good players are sent out onto the field not knowing what the fuck they’re supposed to be doing. If the NFL was smart, they would simplify the rules of play to the point where schemes are more uniform and raw talent can shine through. I have exactly zero confidence that they’ll ever do this. Taylor: Advertisement If you want the house colder, do you turn your AC up or turn your AC down? My girlfriend says turn it down, as in decrease the temperature, and I say turn it up, as in increase the cooling power. There’s an 8-0 record of winning trivial bets on the line. Who’s right? I say UP, because you are upping the output of cool, crisp aircon goodness in your home. I know that’s confusing because you’re actually lowering the temperature, but your girlfriend just has to accept that this is a frustrating bit of linguistic jiu-jitsu. I polled the Deadspin staff on this and the majority say UP if they want it colder. I did not bother asking Marchman for an answer, seeing as how he probably thinks a damp washcloth is the only real air conditioning anyone needs. Advertisement Brian: I’m in the market for a new ceiling fan light fixture in an oft-used living space. The current fixture has a broken chain; the break point is up inside the casing (irreparable), and it’s about 37 years old. The question now is: do I go with another multi-bulb setup (the current one has 5 — 1 in the center w/ 4 on radial arms), or one with a single bulb? I would get one with a single bulb that has some kind of opaque covering for it. You don’t want a circle of bare bulbs staring down at you from the ceiling. One stray look upward and you’re blinded for a good ten seconds. It’s fucking awful. Also, even though taking the cover off can be dicey, having just one bulb means there are fewer bulbs to change. That’s important because changing a ceiling fan bulb can be a real pain the ass. You gotta get a step ladder. Then you gotta carefully unscrew the bulb while a dozen fly corpses land on your face. Then you gotta screw in the new bulb and pray you don’t slip and accidentally rip the goddamn fan out of the ceiling. It’s a fraught process. It’s like playing Operation, only the shocks are deadly. Advertisement This is more discussion of home air circulation than you probably asked for BUT…as someone who has lived through home renovation, I cannot recommend ceiling fans enough. If you ever get sucked into some horrific remodeling job, make sure you put one EVERYWHERE. Put one in the fucking broom closet if you can. Ceiling fans are lovely. They’re quiet, and consistent, and you don’t have to plug them in like some stupid table fan. I like to lie there and stare at one and pretend I’m Martin Sheen at the beginning of Apocalypse Now. ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS GETTING BACK INTO THE JUNGLE. Paul: Like a team that’s up in basketball, is there any benefit for a Jeopardy! contestant who’s leading in Double Jeopardy to intentionally milk the clock by hemming and hawing over which category and/or clue to select next? Especially if it’s a category the leader knows nothing about. Is there a time limit on choosing a clue? Sure it would be obnoxious, but that hasn’t stopped any number of contestants from employing annoying strategies (ie. Arthur Chu). I’ve tried asking Ken Jennings this and get nothing. I assume producers cut tape and have a little chat with you if you sit there for five minutes hemming and hawing about picking a category. I can’t find a specific rule that forbids milking the clock, but that may be because there’s no upside to doing it. I mean, yeah, maybe you could bank $1,000 off of the first question and then spend the rest of the taping making armpit farts. But that’s hardly a “victory,” seeing as how you minimized your winnings and earned the wrath of everyone at home and in the studio audience. Your goal is to amass as large of a war chest as possible so that you A) Have Final Jeopardy leverage and B) Win lots of money at the end. You can’t do that by playing Martyball. Anyone too chickenshit to duck questions isn’t qualifying for a taping anyway. Your average Jeopardy contestant can’t wait to win money AND wipe their intellect all over the telecast. Advertisement If anything, you want to choose categories quickly, so that you can answer more questions and potentially make even more money. This former contestant wrote a post detailing shortcuts that experienced players use to help keep the round moving. I hope all future players follow these instructions, because nothing pisses me off more than an unfinished Jeopardy board. I’ll never know what that $800 question in Potpourri was, and it will torture me forever. Zach: Advertisement What would be the more achievable feat for an average semi-athletic person: A) Return a serve in bounds from a star tennis player (a serve specialist like Milos Raonic), or B) Make contact and get the ball in play from a pitch from a star MLB pitcher (power pitcher like Aroldis Chapman) And how many attempts would it approximately take to achieve one of these feats? Feel like I would get lucky about 1 of 100 attempts. It has to be the serve (resident tennis person Giri Nathan agrees), even though I know full well how terrifying it is to stare down a serve going 1,000mph. I don’t know how pro players even see it. It’s like hitting a bullet. I would just close my eyes and stick my racket out and pray I hit something. At least the serve bounces before it reaches you. That’s a crucial bit of slowdown. Advertisement But I still think my odds of success there are slightly better than if I had to hit a Major League fastball. I wouldn’t even be able to stand in the box, man. The second the ball leaves Chapman’s hands, I am running out of there like a total sissy. No fucking thank you, sir. I’d rather eat a Penn tennis ball launched from a bazooka. Hell, I’d rather take a punch. Kraig: What would happen if the Raiders when on the most historic winning streaks in all of sports and went 19-0 for the next three years and one 3 consecutive Super Bowls while riding a 57-game winning streak? They still move? Yup. Do you see Mark Davis giving Vegas back $750 million out of the goodness of his heart? Neither do I. He could probably bleed Nevada dry for extra parking money with a team that dominant. Advertisement Email of the week! Jim: Advertisement Recently, my kids ate the bare minimum amount of dinner in order to qualify for dessert, as always. That night’s selection was from the plastic sugar variety pack box: Gushers, Fruit Roll Ups and Fruit by the Foot. Of course, there was only one Fruit by the Foot left, almost certainly because I ate one long after their bedtime, and they both demanded it. I immediately went into mediation mode trying to come up with some grand bargain so there wouldn’t be a huge fight, but my heart wasn’t in it and they weren’t buying it. At that very moment, I realized that the individually wrapped Fruit by the Foot felt bulkier than normal. I tore it open to reveal TWO separate rolls where there was only supposed to be ONE! Both kids went away happy for at least the next 6 minutes, and I experienced a wave of serendipitous euphoria unlike anything I’d ever felt before. Am I making too big a deal of this, or was this truly something special? ‘Twas a miracle. Write of it on sacred parchment.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Large-Cap Stocks for Savvy Investors Millions of investors own large-capitalization stocks -- but these three stocks are solid buys now. Sean O'Reilly, Travis Hoium, and Brian Feroldi (TMFBuckeye) May 23, 2017 at 1:15PM Not all large-capitalization stocks are boring and stodgy: far from it. For investors who know what to look for, many of the world's premier large-cap companies have unique situations brewing that could prove extremely profitable for owners of their shares. To get Foolish investors started, we asked three of The Motley Fool's contributing writers to offer up their best picks for savvy investors in the large-capitalization space. In response, they identified General Electric (NYSE:GE), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). Read on for all the key details. Image source: Getty Images. Sean O'Reilly (General Electric): There's something big going on over at General Electric, which is why it's my pick as a large-cap stock. GE is the quintessential industrial conglomerate. Founded over 100 years ago, it has its hands in a multitude of sectors, including gas and steam power systems through its power segment, wind-turbine manufacturing through its renewable energy segment, and aircraft engines through its aviation segment. Its energy connections and lighting segment offers power conversion solutions to both industrial and grid customers. And thanks to the acquisition of a majority stake in Baker Hughes, GE is now one of the world's largest players in oil and gas services. GE is a true large-capitalization stock, currently valued at approximately $240 billion. The first thing investors should know about GE is that it's almost done with its plan to drastically reduce its investments in its GE Capital subsidiary. This is a big deal because it frees up ree up billions of cash that can be reinvested in industrial operations, or returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. This is not only good because GE Capital has frequently been more trouble that it was worth (particularly during the 2008 financial crisis), but also because recent results in these operations have been solid: Organic revenues were up 7%, orders increased 10%, and industrial operating margins expanded 1.3% over the same quarter in fiscal year 2016. First-quarter earnings from ongoing operations (defined by GE as industrial plus verticals) came in at $0.21 per share, flat year over year, but a 12% gain once asset sale gains and restructuring charges are factored in. All of this lends itself strongly to the idea that GE's future is bright, because the disposal of the vast majority of GE's financial assets, $198 billion at last count, means GE will no longer be deemed "systemically important" by regulators -- freeing up tons of cash. As was reiterated by management in their first-quarter conference call, GE will return somewhere between $19 billion and $21 billion to shareholders via buybacks and dividends this year alone. Investors can expect these initiatives to bear fruit through the end of the decade, with analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence expecting earnings per share to grow from $1.63 this year to over $2.00 by fiscal year 2019. Strong EPS growth, and a renewed focus on what it does best make GE a solid pick for Foolish investors. Big and getting bigger Travis Hoium (Apple): The biggest company on the stock market is still a smart buy today. Yes, despite its $800 billion market cap, Apple is still a great value for investors, because it's a cash flow machine with no signs of stopping soon. You can see below that Apple's cash levels have exploded the last five years, even as it's been paying investors bigger and bigger dividends: AAPL Cash and Equivalents (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Apple hasn't lost its hold on the smartphone market and accompanying ecosystem. Customers who buy an iPhone, iPad, or Mac are quickly brought into an ecosystem that drives services revenue, which topped $7 billion last quarter alone, and makes owning other Apple products more attractive. And while new iPhones and other products bring excitement to the company, the ecosystem is what keeps Apple customers coming back time after time. Even if Apple isn't the revolutionary company it was a decade ago, it can still use its immense cash flow to buy back shares and provide a great dividend. Those are qualities in a large-cap stock that investors should love, and they make Apple a great buy today. The wind at its back Brian Feroldi (Medtronic): The demand for high-quality healthcare is poised to rise considerably in the years ahead, thanks to steady growth in the global middle class. That should prove to be a meaningful tailwind for all companies that sell healthcare products like medical devices. That's why I believe that Medtronic is a great large-cap stock for investors to take a look at today. Medtronic is a highly diversified medical-device maker that has its hand in a number of healthcare markets. The company has a long history of buying or building innovative products that treat a range of diseases. Currently, Medtronic's business is broken down into four segments -- diabetes, cardiac and vascular, minimally invasive, and restorative therapies. The company sells hundreds of individual products across these four categories around the world. One big benefit of this extreme diversification is that the company's financial statements are remarkably resilient to the competitive landscape or changes in the global economy. That has allowed Medtronic's financial statements to flourish even when a few of its business segments are under pressure. Medtronic's financial resiliency has worked out beautifully for long-term shareholders. The company now boasts a 39-year history of increasing its dividend payment and regularly buying back stock. Those factors have helped the stock thump the S&P 500 over the last five years: MDT Total Return Price data by YCharts. Medtronic's business model should ensure that it will continue to deliver great results for investors. With shares trading for less than 17 times forward earnings, I think right now is a fine time to add this stable business to your portfolio. Brian Feroldi owns shares of Apple.

Stocks claw back more lost ground with 4th straight gain Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose for the fourth day in a row Tuesday as they continued to recover the ground they lost last week. Major indexes approached record highs again. Most of the gains went to banks, which surged as bond yields jumped. That will allow them to charge higher rates on loans. Banks took steep losses last Wednesday, when stocks had their worst day since September. Scientific instrument companies and drugmakers also rose. However auto parts companies were hammered after poor third-quarter results from AutoZone and home builders fell after sales of new homes sank in April. The four-day rally has restored most of the market's losses and the Standard & Poor's 500 index is almost back to record highs. "The market was simply reminded that there's political risk out there and it reacted to that reminder," said Matthew Peterson, chief wealth strategist for LPL Financial. Peterson said he doesn't think long-term investors have made big changes to their portfolios in response to last week's drop, which followed allegations President Donald Trump asked the FBI to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Peterson says high stock prices and the calm market makes stocks more vulnerable to surprises from the political arena. The S&P 500 added 4.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,398.42. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 43.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,937.91. The Nasdaq composite rose 5.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,138.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 3.84 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,380.98. Bond prices turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.28 percent from 2.25 percent. That helped bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase, which gained $1.06, or 1.3 percent, to $85.76 and BB&T, which rose 63 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $43.03. Scientific instrument maker Agilent Technologies raised its annual profit forecast after its second-quarter profit and sales beat Wall Street estimates. Its shares gained $2.58, or 4.6 percent, to $58.66. Industrial and medical device maker Danaher picked up $1.04, or 1.3 percent, to $83.95. Auto parts retailer AutoZone took its worst one-day loss in eight and a half years as high costs and lower sales at older locations hurt its results. Its stock fell $78.09, or 11.8 percent, to $581.40. O'Reilly Automotive sank $8.28, or 3.3 percent, to $240.18 and Advance Auto Parts gave up $6.71, or 4.6 percent, to $140.66. All have tumbled this year as investors worried about slowing car sales. Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software jumped after its fourth-quarter profit and sales surpassed analysts' expectations. The company's games include the "Grand Theft Auto" ''NBA2K" and "Sid Meier's Civilization" franchises. Take-Two stock jumped $3.79, or 5.5 percent, to $72.83, and it has doubled over the last year. Rival Activision Blizzard added 68 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $57.80 and Electronic Arts rose 62 cents to $109.01. Sales of new homes fell 11 percent in April from the month before, the biggest drop in more than two years. Sales had reached a nine-year high in March, and experts said the decline was most likely a blip. Homebuilder NVR fell $61.27, or 2.6 percent, to $2,296 and D.R. Horton lost 54 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $33.37. Home improvement retailer Lowe's lost $1.71, or 2 percent, to $82.34 and Home Depot also slipped. Nokia climbed after the company said it settled its legal disputes with Apple. The two companies said they will work together and that Nokia will get a cash payment from Apple. The Finnish company was once the biggest cellphone maker in the world, but it sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft in 2014 and is now a network infrastructure provider. Its U.S. shares rose 33 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $6.54. Fiat Chrysler sank after the U.S. government sued the automaker, saying some of diesel pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs included software that cheated emissions tests. The Department of Justice said the software let the vehicles' engines emit more pollution on the road than during Environmental Protection Agency lab testing. Fiat Chrysler stock lost 44 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $10.32. Benchmark U.S. crude oil added 34 cents to $51.47 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, picked up 28 cents to $54.15 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline remained at $1.66 a gallon and heating oil finished where it started, at $1.61 a gallon. Natural gas sank 11 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $5.90 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 5 cents to $17.14 an ounce. Copper remained at $2.60 a pound. The dollar rose to 111.76 yen from 111.20 yen. The euro declined to $1.1185 from $1.1234. European stocks traded slightly higher. The CAC 40 in France rose 0.5 percent. Germany's DAX and the FTSE 100 index in Britain both added 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.3 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.1 percent. The South Korean Kospi gained 0.7 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

However, that won’t be the case. Apple and Nokia have announced that they’ve settled all litigation and agreed to a multi-year patent license. Details of the deal are confidential, but Nokia will provide network infrastructure products and services to Apple, while Apple will resume offering Nokia health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in Apple stores. The two companies will also explore future health-related collaborations. Additionally, Nokia is receiving an upfront cash payment from Apple, with more revenues to follow during the term of the agreement. Here’s what Maria Varsellona, Nokia’s Chief Legal Officer, had to say about this deal: “This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple. It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers.” And here’s Apple COO Jeff Williams: “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia.” Nokia filed its lawsuit against Apple in December 2016, alleging that Apple violated 32 patents relating to displays, UI, antennas, chipsets, software, and video encoding. Apple then filed a complaint against Nokia, claiming that Nokia changed its stance on FRAND licensing for standard-essential patents and worked to make royalty demands and infringement lawsuits to get around its FRAND licensing terms.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology HTC U11 vs. iPhone 7 Emily Ferron May 23, 2017 The HTC U11 and iPhone 7 have the same starting price, but beyond that, they have very relatively little in common View gallery - 32 images The HTC U11 and iPhone 7 have the same starting price point, but otherwise, they are about as different as premium smartphone flagships can be. Here's how their specs and features compare. Size NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW The HTC U11 falls squarely in phablet territory, while the iPhone 7 is one of the smallest premium flagships you'll find. The U11 is about 10-percent taller, 12-percent wider and 10-percent thicker. Weight Fittingly, the HTC U11 also weighs 18-percent more. Build materials The iPhone 7 has the same aluminum unibody we've seen from Apple over the last few generations. The HTC U11, no doubt inspired by phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8, has an all-glass body with an aluminum frame. Colors Both makers offer a variety of color options, but availability varies. The HTC options marked with an asterisk are not currently available in the US. The red iPhone variant is a special Product (RED) edition. Water resistance Both phones have an IP67 water resistance rating, so you don't need to worry about splashing or a shallow quick dip. Display size Even without touting super-narrow bezels, the 5.5-inch HTC U11 handily trounces the iPhone's 4.7-inch display area. Display resolution The U11 also has considerably higher display resolution, though pixel density is far from the only indicator of display quality. Display type Both makers opt for IPS displays instead of the AMOLED alternative. Pressure-sensitive display The iPhone 7 has a pressure-sensitive display, a bit of technology that Apple calls 3D Touch. 3D Touch adds a new way to navigate through your phone. It launches different actions depending on how long and hard you press the screen. Pressure-sensitive edges While the U11 does not have a pressure-sensitive display, it does add additional interactions with its pressure-sensitive edges. You can perform simple actions like snapping the camera shutter or launching voice-to-text with just a squeeze to your phone. Fingerprint sensor Both phones have an off-screen home button with an embedded fingerprint sensor. Processor HTC uses the latest Snapdragon 835 chipset, while Apple uses its own A10 chip. RAM The HTC U11 has double the RAM of the iPhone 7, but to be fair, the two operating systems use memory differently. Storage Apple offers three built-in storage tiers starting with an entry-level 32 GB. HTC keeps things simple with one 64 GB amount. MicroSD HTC further safeguards against storage issues with a microSD slot, for expandable storage. Hi-Fi audio HTC is one of the few smartphone makers that caters to audiophiles with Hi-Fi audio support. Headphone jack However, HTC has opted to follow in Apple's footsteps and nix the standard 3.5 mm headphone jack. You'll need either an adapter (included), USB-C/Lightning port headphones or a pair that connects via Bluetooth. Bundled headphones Both makers bundle a pair of headphones in the box. HTC adds a pair of U Sonic active noise cancelling headphones that plug into the USB-C port. Apple includes a (wired) Lightning port version of its earpods. Battery size The U11 has considerably more battery capacity than the iPhone 7. Battery size isn't the only indicator of overall battery life, so we'll have to see how well the U11 fares in a benchmark test to get a better idea. Fast charging The U11 supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. Wireless charging Neither phone supports wireless charging. Camera megapixels Both phones have 12 MP in the rear (main) camera, but HTC makes an unusual move and adds even higher 16 MP resolution in the front camera. The U11 should be able to take seriously sharp selfies. Camera aperture (rear) The U11 has a slightly higher camera aperture, which should mean competitive low light shooting and depth of field effects. Dual-lens camera Neither of these phones include a trendy dual-lens camera – you'll have to look to phones like the iPhone 7 Plus or LG G6. Optical image stabilization (OIS) Both shooters include OIS, which minimizes image blur by counteracting hand shake. Mobile payments Both phones contain NFC, the requisite technology for making payments at brick-and-mortar retailers with a swipe of your phone (at participating merchants). The U11 supports Android Pay; the iPhone 7 supports Apple Pay. Voice assistant The iPhone keeps things simple with Siri. On the other hand, the U11 has Google Assistant (like all recent Androids) along with wake word access to Amazon Alexa, as well as its own HTC Sense Companion voice-controlled assistant. VR-ready Neither of these phones support mobile virtual reality beyond basic Google Cardboard functionality. Operating system The U11 runs Android Nougat with HTC's UI skinned on top. The iPhone runs iOS 10, Apple's latest mobile OS. Release date The iPhone 7 has been around since late last year, but the newly announced HTC U11 hits stores next month. Starting price (full retail) Despite all of their differences, these phones share the same US$649 starting retail price. Of course, prices vary according to carrier, payment plan and configuration. If you're an Apple fan, the choice will be obvious, but otherwise, features like a large display and Hi-Fi audio might win you over. For more info, revisit our full-length review of the iPhone 7. We'll have more on the HTC U11 when it becomes available.

clock menu more-arrow How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game by Nick Statt@nickstatt May 22, 2017, 10:19am EDT Illustrations by William Joel Photography by James Bareham share tweet Linkedin Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. “I was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didn’t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,” Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazon’s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers. He named the company Anker, after the German word for ship anchor. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave Anker has since become the most popular brand of portable battery packs on Amazon. Portable chargers had a bit of a standout moment last summer, when players of the wildly popular and battery-hogging Pokémon Go could be seen roaming the streets, their phones constantly plugged in. But these accessories have existed for years as a remedy for our battery woes since the standard smartphone tends to last no more than a day on a single charge. So in airports, the back of cabs, and on city streets we’re plugging into lithium-ion slabs in our pockets and bags to stay connected. The market for portable battery packs generated $360 million in the 12 months ending in March 2017 in the US alone. The brands behind these packs are largely anonymous — Kmashi, Jackery, and iMuto — and they often stay that way. Except Anker. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave as it continues to ripple out to other markets. A majority of Anker’s sales come from cables and wall chargers, and it’s now moving into the smart home and auto market — anywhere a plug and a cable can solve a problem. Yang and his team started a company with the sole purpose of selling a better third-party accessory. But they stumbled onto a more lucrative reality: mobile phones, once niche luxury items, are now ubiquitous centerpieces of our digital lives. Each of these phones, and all the products that connect to them, need their own cable and plug. And each and every day these devices die before we want them to. PowerCore 10000. If there’s anything you should know about smartphone development over the last 10 years, it’s this: batteries are not lasting longer. Phones may be thinner and faster, with larger screens and better cameras, but they don’t stay powered for longer than a day, perhaps 36 hours at best. The culprit is the fundamental science of lithium-ion batteries, which are tremendous at storing energy but only within limited size and capacity constraints. The lithium-ion batteries we have today operate at about a fifth of their potential storage capacity, says Lynden Archer, a professor of chemical engineering at Cornell University. And yet that’s still at about 90 percent of the maximum potential today’s battery science allows. “A breakthrough would require a new paradigm,” he says. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough.” That stagnation has allowed Anker to flourish. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough,” says Joanna Stern, a technology columnist and gadget reviewer for The Wall Street Journal. “They saw that accessories needed to be made to address customers’ pain points. They’re making the chargers, the cases, the cords — and they’re making it for affordable prices so you can have one of these in every place you are.” Mobile battery packs weren’t the company’s initial goal. In the late 2000s, Yang identified a consumer need not being met: well-built, reliable laptop battery replacements. “You have a Dell or HP laptop — let’s assume you got it in 2009 — and in 2011 the battery is dying and you want to get a new one,” he says. Back then you had two choices: buy directly from Dell or HP, with a high price tag, or buy a white-label battery that’s cheap but poorly made. “Which one do I want to buy?” asks Yang. “The answer is neither of them.” Yang saw a desire for a better type of accessory — one that wouldn’t cost as much as a replacement straight from the original manufacturer, but that would be of a high enough quality to earn consumers’ trust. Before he could sell that product, he needed to figure out how to make it. It was a long and painful process. After he quit his job at Google in July 2011, Anker took 12 months just to prototype its first laptop battery. That was even after Yang and the core team moved to Shenzhen to find reliable manufacturing partners. “I knew that if I stayed in California and had people FedEx me prototypes in a week, it was just not going to work,” he says. Many hardware companies, especially crowdfunded ones in the US, learn that lesson the hard way, missing deadlines and hitting snags that lead to months-long delays. A solid supply chain is so crucial to a hardware company’s survival that there’s an entire consulting industry around helping startups find suppliers and set expectations. Critical to avoiding these pitfalls was Dongpong Zhao, Google’s then-head of sales in China. Zhao joined Anker in early 2012, and helped Yang build out the company’s supply chain. Anker was made up of around ten people at the time. “Think of it as a small family business instead of like an actual company,” Yang says. The company tirelessly built out a supply chain in its first year and began testing its first products — the laptop chargers and batteries it would begin selling direct to consumers on Amazon. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity. That got us quite the reputation.” From there, Anker ventured into smartphone batteries with a replacement unit for the HTC Sensation. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” Early on, Anker developed close relationships with suppliers in Asia, including Panasonic and anode supplier BTR, to help test and quickly develop new batteries. Yang says he and Anker’s small team “definitely saw the explosion of smart devices” as its biggest and most obvious opportunity, and Anker started aggressively expanding into portable battery packs, wall chargers, and cables. By the end of 2012, after shifting more resources toward portable chargers, Yang says Anker went from selling 100 to 1,000 products per day. “The challenge wasn’t selling products,” Yang says. “It was making products and making sure they were high-quality as well. That’s why we spent a majority of our effort on R&D and product development.” The company does a majority of its sales directly to consumers over Amazon Marketplace, where a combination of strong reviews, low prices, and prominent placement in search rankings can turn a single product into a lucrative line. For the accessories market, which tends to piggyback off trends in mainstream consumer electronics, a true breakthrough is rare. But Anker found one in charging, based on the realization that while batteries may not be improving, charging time certainly was. According a study conducted last year by PhoneArena, it took more than two hours on average to charge a device to 100 percent in 2013. Today, it can be done in almost half the time. So Anker set out to make the fastest chargers available. Take the PowerPort 5, a matte black rectangle no larger than a deck of playing cards, with five USB ports. When it was first introduced in 2015, it was the only accessory on the market capable of charging five devices simultaneously at optimal speed. Or the company’s standard PowerCore portable charger, roughly the size of a credit card and just under one inch thick — a white block encasing 10,000mAh of lithium-ion battery cells. It has four pinholes that light up in LED blue when you press an elliptical button on the top to check its remaining charge. It can refill a depleted iPhone 7 in just over 60 minutes nearly four times over before it needs to be recharged. Most Anker charging products have one signature: the PowerIQ logo. Launched in 2013, the company’s proprietary charging standard is now present on nearly all of its batteries and wall plugs. The technology, carried by a small chip inside each charger, identifies whatever device is being plugged in, be it an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, or an iPad Pro 9.7-inch, in order to detect and deliver the maximum current the product allows. Anker says the technology can shave hours off the amount of time it takes to reach a full charge. A next-generation version of the chip, a sequel to PowerIQ, is slated to start shipping in new Anker charging products later this year, allowing for smaller and lighter accessories. On top of its products’ technical advantages, Anker banks on looks to make its chargers stand out. Brand manager Elisa Lu says every device’s packaging is carefully thought out from the moment customers receive the product, to when they open it and use it. Devices come in a white-and-light-blue box with the name Anker printed in all caps across the front. Inside is a meticulously packaged arrangement of lightweight cardboard. Anker products carry that new gadget smell — a blend of peculiar odors from the evaporation of chemical compounds in the plastics and the epoxy coatings of the device. Beside its red cables, which Anker offers in both standard and braided nylon versions, and a single one-off red battery pack, the company sells products in only two color options: black and white. All this has a strategic business purpose. “When our consumers receive our products, we want to make sure they know they are getting it from a reliable and trustworthy company,” Lu says. Brand trust is a pivotal consideration when purchasing what may seem like random electronics off Amazon. Inside the the box with Anker’s larger products, you’ll also find a small square piece of paper with two questions: are you happy, or are you unhappy? If you’re unhappy, a block of text instructs you to contact Anker customer support via phone, email, or on its website. If you’re satisfied, it asks you to tell your friends or family. Better yet, leave an Amazon review. PowerCore Slim 5000. In many ways, Anker’s success is born from the failures of premier manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Where those companies introduce points of friction — like ever-thinner devices with short battery lives — Anker offers a remedy. “My feeling is that Anker is a success because Apple offers such subpar and expensive accessories,” says Stern, who’s often recommended Anker products in her WSJ column. It may be surprising that Apple sat idly as the accessory market ballooned around it; it took the company years to develop its own battery case for the iPhone to compete with Mophie. But Apple has always favored high margins on premium products, even the cables and earbuds it sells in the Apple Store. This has given ample room to companies like Anker, with the low overhead of an e-commerce business, to sell similar products of near-identical quality for $10 to $20 cheaper. And where Apple and others failed to develop products of their own like multi-port wall plugs and portable chargers, Anker saw the opportunity and capitalized on it. The company is quick to fill gaps created by smartphone manufacturers. When Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, for instance, Anker saw a giant opportunity to begin producing new dongles and other cable adapters to help consumers adjust. But mastering Amazon was the real key to securing Anker’s future. Search for a generic accessory like “cellphone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results If you head over to Amazon.com right now and peruse the retailer’s most popular smartphone accessories and you’ll find Anker products at the top. Search for a generic accessory like “cellphone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results, typically with a 4.5 or 5-star rating. In fact, Anker products take up the first five slots on Amazon’s list of best-selling portable batteries. And alongside the ratings, you’ll find thousands of customer reviews — reviews that the company scans meticulously for ideas on how to improve their development process. Two years before he left Google, Yang became intimately familiar with Amazon’s Marketplace when he built an automated system for a friend who was selling third-party products on Amazon as a side business. It essentially took care of aspects of the business like inventory, logistics and fulfillment, and sales tracking. “It took me two months, evenings and weekends, to develop this system,” Yang explained in a video produced by Amazon last year to promote entrepreneurship on its platform. “Within a month, she was fulfilling 300 orders a day.” Building this system gave Yang invaluable insight into how third-party selling on Amazon functioned. He discovered what worked and what didn’t, and how entire brands could crop up overnight and fade into obscurity the next day. Anker thrived by borrowing infrastructure from Amazon and relying on engineering and support in China. “Amazon provides loads of services — financial services, fulfillment. It actually makes selling a low-barrier thing,” Yang says. Although the company attempted to handle its own fulfillment in its early days, it eventually discovered it could not compete with what Amazon offered. Now, about 95 percent of Anker’s products are listed as “Fulfilled by Amazon.” You can build an online retail business off Amazon, but making sure your products get exposure is the hard part. “The biggest challenge for Anker is not sales. It’s customer perception,” Yang says. “People think they need [Apple’s] cube charger and stock cable.” Teaching people that there is a superior product out there, and then convincing them to keep buying, is Anker’s core challenge. “Amazon reviews were really enormously helpful,” Yang says. “The Amazon reviews just come and come automatically.” PowerLine+ USB-C to USB 3.0. Silicon Valley is full of breathless mission statements designed to inspire and justify the power and influence of technology, like Apple’s famous “think different” slogan, and Google’s ominous and now defunct “don’t be evil” mantra. Facebook, back in 2012, celebrated its billion-user milestone with an ad comparing the social network to chairs, bridges, and even nations. Anker has never aspired to such grand ambitions. “At Anker, we can't exactly help you unwind,” the company admits on its Amazon sellers page. Instead, Anker takes a more straightforward approach by solving the inevitable problems technology creates. “Say goodbye to first-world tech woes like oppressive low batteries and limited ports,” the page says. “Say hello to an easier, smarter life.” Yang is trying to extend this simple philosophy to categories like headphones, speakers, phone cases, and now smart home appliances under a new brand called Eufy. Launched last September, Eufy is Anker’s avenue for selling things like Roomba clones, desk lamps, and bathroom scales. Expanding into more product categories is a logical evolution for Anker, but it’s also a response to a looming existential threat: Yang says he foresees a future where portable chargers won’t be necessary due to advancements in both fast charging and wireless charging. “I think we all agree that the portable charger isn’t forever,” Yang says. But consumers will always need wall plugs and cables, and Anker sees its goal now as keeping pace with changing standards, like the introduction of USB-C. PowerCore 5000. In the meantime, Yang says it’s diversifying with a future expansion into audio, smart home, and automotive product lines. Anker already produces Bluetooth headphones and speakers, but it has aspirations to compete with the likes of Harman Kardon and Bose. Key to the success of those products is moving to brick-and-mortar retailers. Terrence Wang, the company’s chief marketing officer hired from Procter & Gamble in 2015, says having a presence in Best Buy and Walmart, a process that began last year, is the next stage of Anker’s evolution. “Expanding from online to offline is critical actually,” Wang says. “We are trying to get as many people to know that they have a simple, convenient, portable, fast solution rather than just have to bring their own charger wherever they go. That’s the original brand vision.” The company’s focus on storefront retail is a response to a second very real threat — dependence on a direct-to-consumer, online-only model. The company has found it difficult these days to launch new products on Amazon. Older products have thousands of reviews, while newer ones need to earn placement in the search rankings and collect testimonials before more cautious buyers pull the trigger. “We’re seeing a bit of a dilemma on that one,” Yang says. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices.” The company is also struggling with its complex product line, with a dizzying number of choices that may alienate consumers who are looking for a simple choice. “We’re converging to this generation approach,” Yang says. “So we’ll try to release a generation of products every 18 to 24 months.” Choosing which products to promote at Best Buy, which to discontinue, and where to put resources for the future are all part of Anker’s growing pains. The company’s success hinges on convincing — or “educating” — their consumers about the value of what they’re offering. Yang likes to tell a story about a moment he sees play out on repeat every single time he’s at an airport, anywhere on the planet. He sees people, smartphones in hand, rushing from outlet to outlet, looking for space with “the little Apple cube in their hands” and running out of options. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices, in their mind,” he says. “I look at those people and I always want to go up to them and talk to them.” Instead, Yang and the Anker team started conducting an annual consumer survey. It has only one question: how often does your smartphone run out of battery? Once every day? Once a week? Once a month? Or perhaps never? “Forty percent of people say their battery ran out at least once last week, another 40 percent say at least once last month,” Yang says. “As long as these numbers don’t go down, I think we have a lot of work to do.” Good Deals Amazon Echo Dot flash deal: $10 off, today only Apple Apple reportedly plans to perform 5G internet tests in Cupertino Circuit Breaker Prynt made another printer that turns photos into AR video experiences View all stories in Tech Loading comments...

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple hires first VP of diversity by Sara Ashley O'Brien   @saraashleyo May 23, 2017: 1:53 PM ET Apple unveils new "spaceship" headquarters Apple has hired its first head of diversity. Longtime Apple employee Denise Young Smith has taken on a new role as vice president of inclusion and diversity. The company hasn't had someone heading up those efforts since Jeffrey Siminoff left the company to join Twitter in 2015. He had been director of inclusion and diversity since 2013. Smith, who has been at Apple since 1997, will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook, a source familiar with the company told CNNTech. The news of Smith's new position was first reported by 9 to 5 Mac. Smith, who started in her new role on Monday, had already updated her LinkedIn page with her new title. Related: Twitter mostly meets its modest diversity goals Smith has held prominent positions at Apple. Most recently, she was vice president of global talent and human resources; she was also part of the leadership team that built out Apple's retail business. Cook has said that diversity is a "readily solvable issue," explicitly saying in 2015 that he wanted to hire more women. The company's latest diversity report revealed a workforce that's still predominately white and male. Although Apple did report a slight increase in hiring female and black technical employees in the U.S. compared to 2014.

REUTERS By Jussi Rosendahl and Tuomas Forsell HELSINKI (Reuters) - Apple has settled a patent dispute with Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia and agreed to buy more of its network products and services, sending Nokia shares up 7 percent. The deal means Nokia will get bigger royalties from Apple for using its mobile phone patents, helping offset the impact of waning demand for its mobile network hardware. Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia's digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France's Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. "There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel," said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an "accumulate" recommendation for Nokia shares. "I have not given any value so far for Nokia's digital health business, but might apply an option value to it." INDUSTRIAL DEAL Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told the company's annual general meeting later on Tuesday that the deal would help expand network sales beyond telecom operators to global internet and technology giants. "(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centers," he said. "It's a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it." Under the patent license agreement, Nokia will receive a "significant" upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. "It's interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure," said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped to their highest since February 2016 and were up 6.7 percent at 5.89 euros by 1509 GMT (11:09 a.m. ET). A previous patent license contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. "(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners," Nokia's Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. QUICK RESOLUTION Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution of the dispute between Apple and Nokia. "Nokia told analysts in April don't calculate on any license revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia's legal expenses," said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. "For Nokia, it's good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact," said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. "The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros." Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the U.S. company's patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia's overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia's patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world's dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents. Nokia's total sales in 2016 were about 24 billion euros.

Problem Solving | 22 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (15) Never Be Late or Forget a Task Again with “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders” by Scholle McFarland [Tonya Engst here. Little is more embarrassing than showing up late for a meeting or missing an important deadline due to forgetfulness. The go-to solution for Apple users is to offload your fallible human memory to Apple’s Calendar and Reminders apps, which are built into macOS and iOS. But even worse than forgetting a meeting or task is messing up due to a misconfiguration or misunderstanding in Calendar and Reminders. Been there, done that. These apps are the focus of the first Take Control book to be published since we sold the series: Scholle McFarland’s $10 “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders.” It’s a classic Take Control title that explains all you need to know about real-world usage of these heavily used but under-documented apps. I helped Scholle develop and edit the book, learning a lot about Calendar and Reminders that I didn’t know along the way. To give you a taste of her advice, here’s a slightly modified excerpt from the troubleshooting chapter, which addresses a few common problems that can prevent you from using Calendar and Reminders successfully. Whether you’re suffering from one of these problems now, suspect that a family member is, or want to avoid future mishaps, read on for Scholle’s solutions to some common conundrums!] How Can I Change the Default Calendar for New Events on My Mac? -- If new events are showing up in the wrong calendar, choose Calendar > Preferences > General and then pick a calendar from the Default Calendar pop-up menu at the bottom of the preference pane. Now, whenever you create a new event, it will appear in this calendar automatically. Note that the default, Selected Calendar, adds new events to whatever calendar you last selected, which can produce some unexpected results. Why Do Events I Add with My iPhone End Up on the Wrong Calendar on My Mac? -- When you add events with an iPhone, you can use Siri or do it in the Calendar app. Either way, events are placed in your iPhone’s default calendar, so make sure you’ve designated the one you want to use. On your iPhone, tap Settings > Calendar > Default Calendar and choose the calendar you want from the list. How Do I Prevent Calendar Spam? -- It started in November 2016. Suddenly, Mac users were inundated with calendar spam — bogus event invitations from counterfeit companies hawking cut-rate Ray Bans, Ugg boots, and other supposed bargains, often in Chinese (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). Calendar spammers take advantage of the macOS and iOS feature that scans Mail messages for calendar invitations and then sends you a notification. What’s worse, if you click Accept, Decline, or Maybe, you notify the spammer that your account is real and ready for more. To prevent calendar spam, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, click the Settings icon (it’s a red gear), and choose Preferences > Advanced. Then, change the Receive Event Invitations radio button to Email To email address. Now, instead of appearing as notifications, calendar invitations will run through your email account, which undoubtedly checks for spam. You can also safely delete messages there without alerting the spammer. How Do I Remove Duplicate Events? -- If you open the Calendar app and your calendar is littered with duplicate events, try this: On the Mac, choose View > Refresh Calendars (or press Command-R). Or, on your iOS device, tap Calendars to see your list of calendars. Swipe down to refresh. If that doesn’t work, check whether you have an On My Mac calendar that is identical to one of your iCloud calendars. Hide it by deselecting it in the Calendars list and see if duplicates disappear. If they do, you can either keep this calendar hidden or delete the calendar altogether by Control-clicking its name in the Calendars list and choosing Delete. How Do I Delete Duplicate Birthdays? -- If Calendar’s special Birthdays calendar shows a birthday more than once, you can remove the extras. First, on the Mac, choose Calendar > Preferences > General. Deselect the Show Birthdays Calendar checkbox and select it again. If that doesn’t work, duplicate contacts are probably to blame. Open the Contacts app and choose Card > Look for Duplicates. If the app finds them, choose Merge. You may need to repeat this step. If some duplicate birthdays still appear in Calendar, go into Contacts and manually delete the stubborn duplicates that the app is unable to detect. Your duplicate birthdays should disappear. How Do I Get Rid of Duplicate iCloud Calendars? -- If identical iCloud calendars appear to be multiplying like bunnies, first try launching Calendar and choosing View > Refresh Calendars. If you are having trouble verifying whether two calendars have completely duplicated events, try making them different colors (Control-click a calendar in the Calendars list to pick a color). Deselect all other calendars in your Calendars list besides these two. Now you can scan more easily to check for non-duplicated events. If you find a non-duplicated event, move it to the calendar you want to keep. If you are sure you need to de-duplicate, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, and see if the duplicate calendars appear in the list there: If duplicates appear on the iCloud Web site: To be safe, go back to your Calendar app and make a backup of each of the affected calendars by selecting them in turn and choosing File > Export > Export to create calendar (.ics) files labeled with their names. Once that’s done, go to iCloud.com and delete the duplicate calendar(s) from the Web site, by clicking Edit at the bottom of the calendar list and then clicking the Remove button next to a calendar. A warning asks you if you’re sure. If you are, click Delete. Now, return to the app and refresh your calendars by pressing Command-R. Duplicates should disappear. If duplicates don’t appear on the iCloud Web site: That means the problem is on your end. Choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and deselect Calendars. Your iCloud calendars disappear from the Calendars list. Then, choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and select Calendars. As iCloud re-populates your calendar data, this time it should get it right. How Do I Move a Calendar to Another Computer? -- Here’s the beauty of cloud accounts such as iCloud or Google: your calendars show up on any other device that’s connected to that account, no effort required. If you use local On My Mac calendars, though, and want to move one to another computer, you must export a copy and then import it elsewhere. To export a calendar so you can move it to another computer, share it with someone else, or make a local backup: Select the calendar’s name in the Calendars list. Choose File > Export > Export. Choose a location and then click Export. The events are exported to a calendar (.ics) file. Here’s how to import a calendar (.ics) file: Create a new calendar that will hold this file’s events, or choose an existing calendar you want to add its events to. Make sure your choice is selected in the Calendars list. Choose File > Import. (You can import a calendar archive (.icbu) file with the File > Import command, but when you do, it replaces all of your current calendar and reminders information, so make sure you get a .ics file here.) Select the calendar file and then click Import. Alternatively, drag a calendar file from the Finder to the Calendar window to add its events to whichever calendar is selected in the Calendars list. How Can I Merge Calendars? -- If you were over-enthusiastic about making calendars, so long as they are stored in the same account (or are all in On My Mac), you can merge them after the fact. Select one of the calendars in the Calendars list and choose Edit > Merge Calendar. Calendars that you can add events to appear in the submenu. If you can’t merge the two calendars you want, instead consolidate them by exporting the contents of one and then importing it into another, as described earlier in this excerpt. Why Won’t My Calendar Show Maps or Travel Time? -- To see travel time related to a calendar event, you must turn on Location Services on the device where you are working with the event: Mac: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy. Click Location Services, and then click the lock icon and enter your administrator name and password at the prompt. Click Location Services. Then, in the list to the right, select the checkbox next to Calendars. iOS: Open the Settings app, tap Privacy > Location Services, and turn on the Location Services switch. Still on the Location Services screen, tap Calendar and ensure that Never is not selected. With these settings on, Calendar can determine your approximate location using information from Wi-Fi networks, and if your device has cellular data turned on, from the cellular network. Apple asserts that this is collected in a way that won’t personally identify you. Why Can’t I See Any of My Reminders on My iPhone? -- If you’re faced with a blank screen when you try to check reminders on your iPhone or another of your iOS devices, you may be saving them to iCloud elsewhere, but not be using iCloud on this one. Tap Settings > Your Name > iCloud. Now tap iCloud and make sure the Reminders switch is On. How Can I Get an “On My Mac” Option? -- If you want to store a calendar or reminders list locally on your Mac, you need to choose On My Mac from the submenu when you create the calendar or list. If you don’t see that choice, and you don’t have an On My Mac heading in the app’s left-hand Calendars list or sidebar, you can solve the problem by turning off all accounts associated with calendars or reminders and then turning them back on. To see an On My Mac option in Calendars: Go to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts. Select each account listed there in turn and uncheck the Enable This Account box. Your account-based calendars disappear from the Calendars list — do not be alarmed! In fact, if they don’t disappear, try quitting and relaunching Calendar. Choose File > New Calendar and a new calendar appears in your Calendars list under the header On My Mac. If you want to view your account-based calendars in addition to your On My Mac calendar, return to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts and select those accounts’ Enable This Account box. To see an On My Mac option in Reminders: Choose Reminders > Accounts to open the Internet Accounts pane of System Preferences. For each account listed at the left, select it and then see whether the Reminders checkbox is selected. If it is, deselect it. Your account-based lists disappear from the Reminders sidebar — this is okay! An On My Mac option appears. Return to the Internet Accounts pane and for each account where you do want to view its reminders on your Mac, select its Reminders checkbox. Solving any one or the above described problems may put your calendaring and remembering system back on track.

I've found the iOS option to have them display, but they only show until the time of the event. Once the event has passed they mysteriously disappear from the iOS calendar. This inconsistency between iOS and macOS calendars is driving me crazy. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 12:56 Hi Simon, Open Calendar on your iPhone, tap the word Calendars (in red) at the bottom of the screen. Then scroll all the way to the bottom. You'll see a Show Declined Events slider. Toggle that on. Declined events show up in your Inbox. (Which is a bit odd.) Go to Calendar's Year view, tap Inbox at the bottom of the screen, and then tap Replied. A list of events--Declined or not--should appear there. Does that work? Reply Simon  2017-05-23 13:21 Thanks, but as I already mentioned I know how to get them to display. That's not the problem. The problem is they only display in the calendar until the time of the event. However, once the event time passes, they mysteriously get removed from the calendar. So you have no way of going back and checking events in the past if you had declined them. This is highly inconsistent. The macOS calendar does not do this. Events there don't just disappear oon their own. To make matters worse, as far as I can tell there's no option to change this behavior. Apple just decided that nobody would ever need to know about a past event if they declined it. And we users are stuck that on iOS. Argh. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:23 Do you still see them in the Inbox, though? I can see my older declined events there. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:26 I do see older suggested events in my calendar (even from more than a year ago), but only if I didn't accept or decline them. (Once you tap Add To Calendar, they become a regular event.) Reply Simon  2017-05-23 13:28 No, only future events are listed there. Both accepted and declined, but nothing from the past. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:29 Actually, I see that the declined events in my Inbox are in the future (there's just no year with them). I'll research this some more. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 12:32 I started using Reminders recently and was just getting into it when one day all my Reminders were gone. They weren't in iCloud and not on my computer. Just gone. Makes me hesitant to rely on it. Any idea what caused my reminders to disappear after working reliably for months? Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:00 There are a few things that might make this happen. Probably the most likely is that Reminders got turned off for an account. Go to Reminders > Accounts and click on the account the reminders belonged to (or take a look at all the accounts if you're not sure). Reminders should be selected in the account's list. If this is what happened, when you select Reminders for the account again, they will reappear. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 13:36 I did what you said and checked Reminders. However, this did not cause the missing reminders to reappear, even after quitting and restarting Reminders. What else can I try? Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:40 A couple of questions: What kind of account were the missing reminders in (iCloud, On My Mac, etc)? Also, are they missing on a particular device or on all your devices (Mac, iPhone, etc.)? Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 14:11 I entered them into the Reminders app on my iMac. I never used them on iCloud or my iPhone. I have checked now and the iCloud and iPhone have similar lists (with no entries except a few completed items). On the iMac it's different--there's just nothing where there used to be several recurring reminders. Reply Peter U   2017-05-23 21:17 Do you discuss time zones in Apple's Calendar app? I moved from Europe to the US 10 years ago and never managed to change the time zone in Calendar (still on Central European time). Changing to Eastern Time messes up all my future (and past) appointments, i.e. moves them to 6 hours earlier. When I am in a different time zone I like to use the LOCAL time in my calendar not the time zone I live in. Not sure why the damn app doesn't understand that. Thanks :) Reply Peter U   2017-05-23 21:21 PS: I meant the macOS Calendar v7.0 (currently still in OS 10.9.5, sorry, different story). Reply Simon  2017-05-23 21:42 I've had exactly the same problem. It appears the problem is Calendar does not offer support for local time. It's hell bent on being smart so as soon as you move, either all your past or your future appointments will shift to weird times in your calendar. It's frustrating. Apparently it was designed by people who cannot imagine life beyond a single time zone.

According to the data, which features several new request categories, Apple is making an effort to be as clear as possible about the types of information governments around the world have asked for. Apple's report is the most detailed report the company has produced yet. Worldwide, Apple received 30,184 device requests, covering 151,105 devices. Apple provided data for 21,737 device requests, which equates to a 72 percent response rate. In the U.S. specifically, Apple responded to 3,335 requests out of 4,268 (78 percent). According to Apple, device-based requests cover fraud investigations as well as customers who have asked law enforcement to help locate lost or stolen devices. Apple received 2,392 financial identifier requests worldwide, covering 21,249 devices. Apple provided information for 1,821 of the requests, which are related to cases where law enforcement officials are working on behalf of customers who have asked for help with fraudulent credit card activity. When it comes to worldwide government account requests, Apple received 2,231, rejecting 175 of those, and providing no data for 471. Non-content data was provided for 1,350 requests, and content was offered up in 410 cases. A total of 8,880 accounts were affected. In the United States, Apple says it received between 5750 and 5999 National Security Requests under FISA and National Security Letters, which affected 4750 to 4999 accounts. Apple is not allowed to provide specific numbers, but offers up the narrowest range permissible by law. U.S. National Security requests increased significantly in the second half of 2016 compared to the first half of the year. In its first 2016 transparency report, Apple said it received 2750 to 2999 National Security orders affecting 2000 to 2249 accounts. According to the data, Apple also received one "declassified" National Security Letter from the FBI. National Security Letters are traditionally kept secret via a gag order that prevents companies from sharing information about them, but following the USA Freedom Act, the rules have been loosened and tech companies are now able to publish National Security Letters when declassified. Apple is able to publish the content of the letter, but has not done so. Apple's data is broken down into multiple additional categories, covering government requests for emergencies such as missing children, account deletion/restriction requests, and account preservation requests, all of which can be viewed directly in the report. The company also provides more information on government account requests by legal process type, including search warrant, wiretap orders, subpoenas, pen register/trap and trace orders, and other types of court orders.

They were authorized by the Patriot Act shortly after 9/11. And the patriot act was one of the worst invasions of privacy in recent decades and has provided no real benefit. Rating: 9 Votes ThunderSkunk 13 hours ago at 11:29 am We have a network of computers that can access the internet, and a seperate quarantined network of computers that are physically not connected to those machines or the internet whatsoever, for high-security projects and to ensure our cnc machines and other critical systems stay impervious to hacking or stuxnet-like malware run amok. The "internet of things" can go take a flying leap. It seems to me this is what anyone concerned about their privacy would do as well. Keep your sensitive data on a strictly offline computer, and use essentially a dumb terminal to access the internet. Have no accounts, and obfuscate your digital identity with misinformation wherever possible to screw things up. It really wouldn't take much effort, just a decision to not put all your info on a platter and then complain when it's a smorgasbord and Uncle Sam or the Kremlin (same thing now?) come along and make a meal out of it. Probably too late for Facebook and google users though. Rating: 5 Votes nt5672 11 hours ago at 01:35 pm . . . . . I could care less if the government sees what I text my significant other, if it means potentially protecting the lives of people I care about (or people I've never met before). I understand that right now, but history tells that what the government and what the people considers important, changes when the government is given unlimited power. Once they get the power they may decide for example, that you only get one child, or that in order to support diversity you can only marry someone from another race, or maybe that your race or political outlook becomes out of favor and the police are looking to arrest people with your beliefs. In fact, is currently impossible for people to live normal lives without breaking some law someplace. Why is that? Now one might think it is for order in society, but in fact, when there are so many laws that people can be arrested anytime, the laws can be used anytime to control anyone. For example the government can and does take property every day without due course. What happens when they decide to take yours? Total control is what the government wants and they consistently scare people into thinking it is necessary. Life without risk is impossible. For example, if you were a conservative, then under Obama the IRS targeted you. Who knows, it may be that under Trump he will target liberals with the IRS. I'll bet I can tell what your political leaning is by monitoring your communications with your significant other. People in general need to wake up. This discussion is not about today, but is about what happens when one political party controls the administration, congress, the media, and the supreme court. And right now we are pretty darn close. People don't realize because the media is controller by democrat dogma that when Obama threw out 100 years of law regarding bond holders in the GM take over. He also (well his GM czar) in Illinois closed all GM dealerships with Republican ties. I don't personally know about other states, but I'll bet it was nationwide. You really want to live under a government that is that powerful? That can decide that 100 years of law don't matter anymore? That can decide at any point that you don't have any rights. Well I don't and if we are forced to I don't want the government to be able to monitor me. The worst threat to American people today is the American government!

Even if they don't, Apple provides easily understood explanations for each category and each sub-category. The report stands on it's own without the need to defend it or make accusations based on it. It just is what it is. Plenty of companies generate these.

Smith has since confirmed the role on her LinkedIn profile. Prior to Smith, the role was held by Jeffrey Siminoff, a director at Apple who left the company in late 2015 to join Twitter. Because Siminoff was only a director-level employee, he still reported to Smith, who then reported to Cook. Now, because of the significantly higher rank of Smith’s prior VP role, she’ll have a direct line to Apple’s CEO. According to TechCrunch, Apple employees sees Smith’s role as a “significant upscaling of responsibility.” Prior to heading up the global HR team, Smith ran HR for Apple’s global retail operation. Apple, like many tech companies, is predominantly white and male — its latest diversity report indicates that the company’s workforce is 68 percent male and 56 percent white. Only 12 percent of Apple’s workforce identifies as Hispanic, while only 9 percent is black. Smith’s role is primarily aimed at helping to improve those numbers, both through outreach in the education community and through examining the company’s hiring practices and workplace culture. The goal is to ensure that Apple is not losing employees to competitors early on, or fostering an environment that discourages minorities and women from applying for positions at Apple.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 24, 2:39 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Apple, Samsung Lose Market Share In Q1 2017 Due To Trio Of Chinese Brands By Ken Manbert Salcedo On 05/23/17 AT 1:38 PM Close The global smartphone market grew by 9.1 percent in the first quarter of 2017 thanks to the Chinese phone makers Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Meanwhile, Apple and Samsung both saw their market shares drop in the same period. “The top three Chinese smartphone manufacturers are driving sales with their competitively priced, high-quality smartphones equipped with innovative features,” Gartner research director Anshul Gupta said. “Furthermore, aggressive marketing and sales promotion have further helped these brands to take share from other brands in markets such as India, Indonesia and Thailand.” Oppo achieves the best performance during the quarter retaining its number one spot in China. Photo: Gartner The combined market share of Huawei, Oppo and Vivo now accounts for 24 percent of the global smartphone market, which is up by 7 percent from the same period in 2016. Global smartphones sales totaled 380 million units in the first quarter of 2017. Samsung’s smartphones sales declined by 3.1 percent. Although preorders for the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are up by 30 percent year over year, the absence of an alternative to the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 is one of the major reasons Samsung is losing market share, TechCrunch reported. As for Apple’s iPhone, Gartner reported iPhone sales were flat. Apple’s sales declined by 1.1 percent with a Q1 2017 market share of 13.7 percent. Apple’s performance is being threatened by  Oppo, Vivo and other brands which may have hindered Apple from selling more iPhones in China. Although Samsung and Apple’s global smartphone market shares are down from the same period last year, the two brands remain on top. Samsung takes the No. 1 spot with 78.6 million units sold in Q1 2017 while Apple takes second place with 51.9 million units. Huawei appears to be catching up with Apple with 34.18 million units sold, followed by Oppo and Vivo with 30.9 million and 25.8 million units, respectively. Although Huawei is getting closer to Apple’s numbers, it’s also under pressure from competing Chinese brands. The Huawei P9 and P9 Plus, which has been out now for more than a year, remains popular, helping Huawei to position itself in the third spot. With the Huawei P10 and P10 Plus, the phone maker could continue doing well in the second quarter. Vivo has sold nearly 26 million units during the first quarter of 2017. The brand was able to achieve a market share of 6.8 percent, up from 4 percent from Q1 2016. This accounts for a growth of 84.6 percent. Sales for Vivo smartphones grew more than 220 percent thanks to its popularity in emerging markets in Asia/Pacific. Oppo, which is quickly catching up to Huawei, saw a 94.6 percent increase in worldwide smartphone sales in Q1 2017. Oppo had the best performance in the quarter and has retained its No. 1 spot in China. One of the reasons  Oppo continues to do well is because it focuses on improving its cameras and fast charging capabilities. Another reason is Oppo’s strategy when it comes to selling its devices. The company focuses on selling its smartphone through retailers instead of relying heavily on selling its products online. As for the operating system market, Google’s Android OS remains No. 1 while Apple’s iOS stays in second. Android market share grew by 2 percent while iOS only grew by 0.9 percent year over year, MacRumors reported. Android’s continued growth is due to the increasing acceptance of the OS by Chinese brands that have manufactured high-end smartphones.

But for every coveted job, there are far more applicants than can ever be hired. If you want to get through the door at one of these notoriously exclusive companies, you want to talk to someone like Gayle Laakmann McDowell. She worked as a software engineer at Apple, Microsoft and Google, where she sat on the corporate hiring committee—and was once at the top 1 percent in terms of interviews conducted at the tech giant. McDowell has also worked with Amazon, Facebook, Uber and Yahoo to help them attract and retain top talent. McDowell, who has a bachelor’s and master’s degree in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA from Wharton, is also the author of three tech books, including Cracking the Coding Interview, which is the No. 1 selling book in three Amazon categories: software development, job hunting and interviewing.   When the Observer spoke to McDowell, her advice struck us as bigger than just getting past the gatekeepers at top tech companies—it’s filled with key lessons for how to be successful in business and in life. Here’s everything you need to know, as told by McDowell to the Observer: Before the Interview Understand the culture. It sounds funny but Silicon Valley’s top tech companies tend to shun the business side of their operations. Engineers see themselves as working for engineering shops not stuffy businesses. What drives engineers is their love of engineering and building really cool stuff for customers—not enhancing the bottom line. The Google headquarters. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images It’s not all about the degree. There’s this mistaken idea that you need a computer science degree to get a job at one of Silicon Valley’s top tech companies. But that’s really not the case at all. The biggest hurdle that candidates without a computer science degree face isn’t a lack of knowledge, it’s an insecurity that they’re missing that “secret sauce” during the interview process. As soon as I ask a question that seems “academic,” they say they can’t do it even though they absolutely have the knowledge and skills to tackle it. What they fail to realize is that the problems are designed to be difficult for everyone. Recognize the technical bias. Tech companies have a huge bias toward candidates with technical skill, even if you’re not applying for a job as a coder. If you want to work at a tech company, in virtually any role, you need to demonstrate a passion for technology. Anyone can spend a weekend online learning the basics of how to write really simple code. No, you won’t build an iPhone app in a weekend. But you can learn enough of the basics to get a decent understanding of what the software development process is all about. Trust me: It’s not as scary as you think.   Build something on your own. If you’re already working at Google and you want to move to Facebook, you probably won’t have a problem making the jump. But what if you’re a coder at an insurance company in the Midwest? If you send your resume to Google, you’re not likely to stand out. So what can you do? One excellent strategy is to start a project—any project—on your own. The details are less important than the fact that you’re taking ownership of something and showing initiative and drive. So start a small business. Build an app of your own. Do whatever it takes to demonstrate your entrepreneurial mindset. You’ll also develop new skills in the process, and it can make a huge difference in how you’re perceived. Don’t get married to one skill. Whatever your role may be, don’t be married to just one skill, one technique, or one way of seeing the world. If you’re a programmer, that means not being totally attached to a single language. Sometimes, when people interview, they can clearly be very smart—but incredibly attached to one programming language. When it becomes clear that they don’t want to work with anything else, that’s worrisome. The fact that the candidate hasn’t felt the need to learn more skills is worrisome. Needs change, projects change, teams change. Tech companies value open-mindedness and flexibility. Even if you are particularly passionate about one thing, stay open to moving new directions. Facebook employees walk past a wall of graffiti at the Menlo Park headquarters. Robyn Beck/AFP/GettyImages Nine-to-5 isn’t enough. At top tech companies, extracurricular work isn’t a differentiating factor— it’s the expectation. Even if you don’t have time to build something fully on your own, as recommended above, you need to keep tinkering on the side. I once worked with a candidate at Google for a product manager role. During the interview, he started talking about how he kept chickens at his house. He was extremely passionate about building a door for the coop that opened and closed automatically to control the chickens’ movements. It sounds silly, and it had nothing to do with his 9-to-5 job description, but it demonstrated his passion for applying technical solutions to real-world problems. Practice, Practice, Practice. Regardless of the role you’re applying for, top tech companies will assess your capacity through problem-solving tests. Your performance will improve with practice—so it’s essential that you do so. Companies are so aware of the importance of practice that they now send preparatory material to candidates directly.  (Google recruiters refer candidates to my books and Facebook has hired me to teach an interview prep class for their candidates.) You can be sure of this: Your competition is practicing. During the Interview Dress to blend. If you walk into a tech company wearing a suit and tie, you’re going to look out of place and signal that you don’t understand their culture. You’ll look like one of those stuffy business folks. At tech companies, the standard interview uniform is jeans and a nice top or shirt; on the job attire might be even more casual. I recall quite clearly one candidate walked into a job interview at Apple in a suit and tie. He was extremely smart, had an MBA from Wharton, and he quickly realized he was overdressed. As the interview progressed, he started loosening his tie, then took it off entirely, and finally threw his jacket over the back of a chair. He got the job. Your interview will be challenging: Get used to it. Understand that the purpose of an interview with a tech company is to assess your skills in real-time. An interview at Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple is not just a chat about your past achievements. This is true of interviews for every role. If you’re a coder, it means you’d better know your core computer science concepts—and practice answering challenging questions about them. If you’re applying for a product management role, it means you need to be ready to demonstrate your product design and quantitative skills on the fly. If you’re in marketing, you can count on having marketing problems thrown at you. Don’t. Give. Up. Ever. Often times people get a problem that they don’t think they know the answer to immediately and then they just quit on themselves. Here’s what they don’t realize: The interviewer assumes that you don’t know the answer to the question. What they’re testing is your ability—and your willingness—to tackle problems that seem completely baffling. They are looking for you to keep working toward a better and better answer. If you’re ever about to give up remember this: The interview process is designed to challenge you, and even the best candidates feel “stumped.” The question is this: What do you do next? One Google candidate asked his lunch interviewers where all the “hot chicks” were…. Needless to say, the candidate didn’t get an offer. Show initiative even at the risk of failure. No matter where you’re interviewing, you want to convey a sense of initiative. Even teams at the biggest tech companies tend to believe that they operate like a startup. They value moving—and even failing—fast. At tech companies, the ethos is that it’s better to try and fail than not to try at all. I once interviewed a candidate for Amazon who hid what I thought was the best part of her resume. She’d started a gaming company that had to close its doors within six months. She didn’t bring it up because she saw it as a failure. But, in our minds, starting a company in the first place was a huge win for her. Never be lazy. There’s a category of candidate I describe as “mentally lazy.” They may be very smart, but as soon as they get a tough problem—one where the best answer doesn’t jump out at them—they either give up or ask for help. That’s a big red flag. One candidate I interviewed at Facebook was absolutely brilliant—but only when I forced him to be. Guess what? Tech companies know that in the real world, you won’t have an interviewer forcing you to give your all. It doesn’t matter that you can tackle tough problems if, ultimately, you won’t. (Nope, he didn’t get the job.) Apple’s new ‘spaceship’ 175-acre campus dubbed “Apple Park” in Cupertino, California, is nearing completion. It will house 13,000 employees. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Don’t say something stupid and screw it all up. Tech companies go to great lengths not to come across as “corporate.” Because of that, candidates can sometimes get overly chummy during the interview process during, say, an informal lunch. One Google candidate asked his lunch interviewers where all the “hot chicks” were. Lunch interviewers don’t generally submit candidate feedback but this one made an exception. Needless to say, the candidate didn’t get an offer. Tech companies aren’t stuffy—but the office isn’t a frat party. After the Interview Life is a team sport. And so is software development. I clearly remember one candidate at LinkedIn who was a brilliant developer—as long as he worked alone. But he got incredibly defensive with his teammates whenever anyone offered even a benign suggestion. It had a serious impact on his career. Another candidate, who I worked with during the interview process at Google, would dismiss all of my feedback with a quick “yep-yep-yep”—including, ironically, my feedback to him that he came off as dismissive when he did that. Interviewers are always on the lookout for those kinds of red flags. Don’t be one of those people. Stay up to date and commit to lifelong learning. There’s an expectation at top tech companies that you learn quickly and that you enjoy the learning process. When someone knows 10 different flavors of Java and nothing else, I wonder if they’ll be willing to learn the necessary skills for a new role. Technologies and approaches change rapidly and you need to be able to adapt at the same speed. There’s no better way to guard against professional obsolescence than to develop a passion for learning new things—even if it doesn’t directly relate to your job right now. Amazon’s European headquarters, nestled in the Clausen Valley in Luxembourg. Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images Always build your network. Whether you get a job offer or not, keep in touch with as many of the people that you met as possible. Even an interview that doesn’t result in an offer is still an opportunity to build your network. Tech companies are fueled by talent and knowing the right person is often the gateway to your next opportunity. The goal is to keep your network as broad as possible. Most people, including me, didn’t get referred by a friend but by a friend of a friend. Top tech companies are so starved for great talent that referrals don’t need to be close ones. Send a thank you note or a LinkedIn request to your recruiter and stay in touch. It’s never over until you quit applying. Tech companies set a high bar and they understand that they often reject good people. Maybe you, or your interviewer, just had a bad day. Or maybe you need to develop your skills set a little further. Either way, it’s very common for a candidate to get rejected and then get an offer a year or two later. Never be afraid to reach out again. Your past “failure” won’t count against you. How can I be so sure? I got rejected when I first applied to Google for an internship. The following year, when I applied for a full-time role, the recruiter expedited my interviews because I had done well, though not well enough, the last time around. When I did get hired, I went on to interview many more previously rejected candidates. I don’t care if the candidate got rejected in the past I only care about what they can do right now.

Apple will resume carrying Nokia digital health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in Apple retail and online stores, and Apple and Nokia are exploring future collaboration in digital health initiatives. Regular summits between top Nokia and Apple executives will ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This agreement will strengthen our collaboration,” said Basil Alwan, President of Nokia’s IP/Optical Networks business. “We look forward to supporting Apple. While details of the agreement remain confidential, Nokia will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple, with additional revenues during the term of the agreement. The value of the agreement will be reflected partially as patent licensing net sales in Nokia Technologies and partially as net sales in other Nokia business groups. Nokia will follow its existing practices for disclosing patent licensing revenue in its quarterly announcements and expects that revenues for the agreement will start to be recognized in the second quarter of 2017, including an element of non-recurring catch-up revenue. Due to the up-front cash payment from Apple, Nokia intends to provide a comprehensive update of its capital structure optimization program in conjunction with its third quarter 2017 results. ← ‘Maj Rati Keteki’ – Review High Voltage Wires Cause Deaths Of Rare Black-Necked Cranes In Arunachal → You May Also Like Over Decade Later, Tax Hikes Still Proposed To Pay For Romneycare – OpEd February 2, 2017 John R.

While some reports say there is no delay expected, other reports state that there will be a delay after all. If the iPhone 8 release date is delayed, will it only be a short delay or a much longer wait? There is no denying that the new iPhone 8 may very well bring about the biggest upgrade cycle seen by Apple’s smartphones. This is because Apple’s iPhone has remained virtually the same in most respects since the iPhone 6 was released in 2014. This also marks the year when rumors began circulating that Apple had plans to enlarge their iPhones in the future. While both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus did actually have larger displays coupled with a new design, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus haven’t broken any new ground, and Apple users are clearly clamoring for a new design, which may account for Apple’s sales slump with iPhones, BGR reports. With the promise of a redesign and so many exciting changes and features to the new iPhone 8, this explains why users are keen to find out the exact release date for the iPhone 8. [Image by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] There are a few new reports that are now suggesting that the iPhone 8 release date may actually be pushed back and slated for November, as Fox News reports. However, other reports are appearing to remain cautious, yet optimistic, and state that October may be a more realistic release date for the new iPhone 8. But why does the release date for the iPhone 8 appear to keep changing and what is the rumored reason why there would be a delay? Apparently, the OLED display for the iPhone 8 reportedly is to blame for the delay, but there are also rumors suggesting that Apple’s various partners who they rely on for different components of the iPhone 8 won’t be able to supply enough of the needed products to make the iPhone 8’s September release date a reality. An exclusive first look at the iPhone 8’s final design irl https://t.co/LuW55gYeAx pic.twitter.com/arE5lfkD9y — Zach Epstein (@zacharye) May 17, 2017 On the other hand, there are still indications and rumors that the iPhone 8 will be released much faster and without the delays that many are expecting. A Morgan Stanley research note has stated the iPhone 8 will actually be in an Apple store near you much sooner, possibly at the start of September to the middle of September. Morgan Stanley also alleges that they have not discovered rumored production problems or delays because of Apple’s partners to be true. While some investors have become frightened at the prospect of low yields for the various components of the iPhone 8, Morgan Stanley believes that the production for the new iPhone shouldn’t be delayed and that the iPhone 8 release date may still be on target. “Morgan Stanley’s Greater China Technology Research colleagues have not yet seen delays in the supply chain and still expect new iPhone production to start on time for most of the components, including OLED.” [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] With the new iPhone 8 will come camera modules that are extremely advanced and will allegedly feature the support needed for augmented reality along with facial recognition. As far as the actual design for the iPhone 8, several independent reports have claimed that the new smartphone will have a stainless steel frame set between a couple of 2.5D glass panels, which will bring an extremely modern look to it. The new OLED display of the iPhone 8 that has been talked about so much is alleged to have a screen-to-body ratio even better than those of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, which would mean that it would have to be higher than an 83 percent ratio. The iPhone 8 may actually be called the iPhone 8, yet there are other rumored names that Apple may give its new smartphone. ValueWalk report that iPhone X is alleged to have been discussed as a possible new name. There is even the suggestion on a Japanese blog that the smartphone could go by the name of iPhone Edition, although iPhone 8 or iPhone X are probably safer bets for names. Apple’s new iPhone 8 is sure to dazzle users, despite a possibly pushed back release date for the iPhone 8 later this year.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple and Nokia Bury the Hatchet, 8 Years Later The two mobile giants have settled their legal differences, and Apple will start sending licensing payments to Finland. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) May 23, 2017 at 12:30PM After eight years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) finally agreed to bury the hatchet. In a joint press release posted early Tuesday morning, the two mobile titans announced the end of all litigation between them. A brief history of Nokia vs. Apple Nokia was the undisputed leader of cell phone sales on a global level, back in the day when music-playing features and built-in cameras counted as high-end touches. Apple changed all of that in 2007 with the launch of the original iPhone. The game-changing device immediately started cutting into Nokia's then-dominant market share. The Finnish company filed its first patent suit against Apple in the fall of 2009, alleging that the iPhone was implementing Nokia's wireless networking technologies without paying the proper licensing fees. This was the start of a long and occasionally intense legal battle, fought on a global scale. Both companies fired fresh volleys as recently as December 2016. Image source: Getty Images. And now, the war is over The settlement of all legal actions between Nokia and Apple includes a multiyear general patent license deal as well as cash payments from Apple to Nokia. Keep an eye out for Nokia's next couple of earnings reports to get a sense of the size of these payments, since the companies declined to reveal those details in their press materials. The checks will be large enough that Nokia promised to update its capital structure plans along with its third-quarter report. Nokia should have that document ready by late October or early November. Moreover, Apple will sell Nokia-branded digital health products in its retail and online stores, and the two companies are partnering to create new digital health products going forward. Maria Varsellona, Nokia's chief legal officer, called the settlement "meaningful" for both companies. "It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers," Varsellona said in a prepared statement. What's next? Nokia stopped making phones in 2014, when the entire handset division was sold to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in a $7.2 billion deal. Since then, the company has focused on wireless infrastructure products and services. Microsoft later sold the branding rights for Nokia phones back to a Finnish company run by former Nokia executives, recording a $7.6 billion goodwill writedown in the process. But Nokia held on to its portfolio of mobile technology patents, which explains why Nokia is the company slated to receive Apple's license payments. So Nokia walks away with a new licensing revenue stream of unknown dimensions and the opportunity to win more partnering opportunities with its longtime enemy in Cupertino. Apple is winding down its sprawling web of legal disputes, leaving the company room to refocus on innovation instead of litigation.

Health care companies like makers of scientific instruments and drugs are higher as well. Download our Expert Edition e-book, Cyber: Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation.

FIAT CHRYSLER-DIESELS US says Fiat Chrysler used software to beat emissions tests DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government is suing Fiat Chrysler, alleging that some diesel pickup trucks and Jeeps cheat on emissions tests. The lawsuit filed today alleges that nearly 104,000 Ram pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees have software that makes them perform differently during normal driving than during lab tests by Environmental Protection Agency. NEW HOME SALES Congress asks: Are federal employees overpaid? US new-home sales fell 11.4 percent in April, most in 2 yrs WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. sales of new homes last month registered the biggest drop in more than two years. The Commerce Department says new-home sales skidded 11.4 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000. It was the biggest monthly drop since March 2015. Economists had expected a more modest retreat from March sales of 642,000, which were the highest since October 2007. Sales in April were still up 0.5 percent from a year earlier. Sales fell in every region, led by a 26.3 percent plunge in the West, the biggest drop there since October 2010. The median sales price of a new home slid 3 percent to $309,200. There were 268,000 new homes on the market in April, the most since July 2009. CEO PAY CEOs got biggest raise since 2013 NEW YORK (AP) — The typical CEO at the biggest U.S. companies got an 8.5 percent raise last year. The study by executive data firm Equilar says those CEOs each raked in about 11.5 million in salary, stock and other compensation, giving them the biggest pay increase in three years. The bump reflects how well stocks have done under their watch. Boards of directors increasingly require that CEOs push their stock price higher to collect their maximum possible payout, and the S&P 500 index returned 12 percent last year. The biggest pay raise went to Broadcom Corp. CEO Hock Tan, who got a 513% pay increase, boosting him to $24.7 million. The study says CEO pay fell last year for companies whose investors complained the loudest about executive pay. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi (kahz-roh-SHAH’-hee) got a 97 percent pay cut. He made $2.4 million in 2016. TARGET-DATA BREACH SETTLEMENT NY Attorney General: $18.5 million settlement with Target NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s attorney general says 47 states and the District of Columbia have reached an $18.5 million settlement with Target Corp. to resolve the states’ probe into the discounter’s massive pre-Christmas data breach in 2013. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says the agreement is the largest multistate data breach settlement to date. Target’s breach, which occurred between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 of 2013, affected more than 41 million customer payment card accounts and exposed contact information for more than 60 million customers. The breach forced Target to overhaul its security system and the company offered free credit reports for potentially affected shoppers. The settlement requires Target to maintain appropriate encryption policies and take other security steps. GOOGLE AD TRACKING Google aims to connect online ads to real-world sales SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google is keeping an eye on what you’re buying offline in addition to monitoring your online shopping in its latest attempt to sell more digital advertising. The offline tracking of most credit and debit card transactions will help Google to automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Google believes the data will show a cause-and-effect relationship between online ads and offline sales. If it works, it could help persuade merchants to increase their digital marketing budgets. The Mountain View, California, company already runs the world’s biggest online ad network, with $79 billion in revenue last year. The store sales measurement tool is being unveiled Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference that Google hosts for its advertisers. FINLAND-NOKIA-APPLE Nokia and Apple settle long-running legal disputes HELSINKI (AP) — Nokia and Apple have settled their numerous legal disputes after signing an agreement to work together. Nokia describes the pact as “meaningful. Nokia was one the world’s No. 1 cellphone maker. It became a networks provider after selling its ailing mobile phone sector to Microsoft in 2014. Nokia and Apple have been involved in a number of patent infringement claims over the years. Nokia, which owns a huge portfolio of patents, says it will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple, with additional revenues during the term of the agreement. MICROSOFT-SURFACE Microsoft Surface gets battery boost, better viewing angles NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft is refreshing its Surface Pro tablet with longer battery life and more viewing angles for the screen. The new, fifth-generation device — simply called Surface Pro — won’t look or feel drastically different from its predecessor. But Microsoft is hoping its under-the-hood improvements will help it compete with newer laptop-tablet hybrids from Samsung and others. Microsoft is making the announcement in China, a reflection of the company’s expectations of growth there. The Surface has an optional keyboard cover that turns the tablet into a laptop. Although Microsoft pioneered this type of device, Samsung and others have been making their own, contributing to a 26 percent revenue decline in the Surface business in the most recent quarter. The new Pro ships in mid-June for about $800. ELECTRIC RANGE DEATH-RECALL 6,300-plus stoves recalled following electrocution death PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) — The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission says there’s a voluntary recall of 6,300 electric stoves after a plumber was electrocuted last year. The recall is for Blomberg and Summit electric ranges, which the commission says can become energized, posing electric shock and electrocution hazards. A screw wasn’t installed to secure the grounding strap during manufacturing. The rangers were manufactured by Arçelik A.S. of Turkey, and were imported by Beko of Bolingbrook, Ill. Last year, a 52-year-old New Hampshire plumber was electrocuted while installing a dishwasher. WAL-MART-MILITARY SERVICE Wal-Mart expands military leave-of-absence policy LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Wal-Mart says it’s expanding its military leave-of-absence policy by offering differential pay to all eligible employees who are on military assignments lasting more than three days. Wal-Mart says the differential pay will cover the duration of military leave, including basic training, for employees whose military salary is less than what they earn working for Wal-Mart. The company says its employees took more than 4,400 military leave of absences last year. The new policy takes effect June 24. Wal-Mart senior director for military programs, retired Brig. Gen. Gary Profit, says employees who want to serve in the military will now be able to do so more easily. The company also says it’s giving a $100,000 grant to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, a group that helps those grieving the death of a loved one who served in the Armed Forces. DODGE DEMON-PRICE For $1, you can add more muscle to Dodge’s newest muscle car DETROIT (AP) — If you want a car with 840 horsepower that can go from zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds, it’ll cost you $84,995. Plus another dollar. That’s the starting price for the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon, which Fiat Chrysler says is the most powerful production car ever. The Demon comes standard with a mere 808 horsepower. But for $1, you get a crate of parts that set it up for the drag strip. This includes a high-performance powertrain control computer with a high-octane fuel setting that adds 32 horsepower. The Demon is a one-seater. But another dollar gets you a front passenger seat, and the rear seat costs another buck. The Demon’s price includes a $1,700 federal gas-guzzler tax but does not include shipping. The car will reach showrooms in the fall.

We got a little break between, say, Windows 95 and 98 or between Mac OS 8 and 9. But in 2011 Apple started releasing new versions of its Mac and iPhone operating systems every single year. Unfortunately, when you pile on new features that often, sooner or later the OS suffers. It gets harder to learn, harder to use and sometimes buggier. At this moment, Apple is working on iOS 11 for the iPhone. If history is any guide, it will come out in September. As a public service, therefore, I thought I'd helpfully point out a few things in iOS 10 that need fixing. C'mon, Apple—here's your chance to make things right! (Note: These are design fails, not features I'd like to see. I could offer plenty of those, too.) • Clean up the hard presses. The screens on the latest iPhone models (the 6s and 7) have what Apple calls 3D Touch, meaning that they're pressure-sensitive. In many spots, touching the screen hard produces one result; pressing lightly delivers another. But how hard is hard? If you use the wrong pressure, you get a result you didn't intend. A classic example: To move or delete app icons on the iPhone's home screen, you're supposed to touch any app's icon for a couple of seconds. At that point, they all begin to—what's the technical term?—wiggle. Now you can manipulate them. But if you try that on a 3D Touch model, you're likely to open a shortcut menu instead because you're pressing too hard. You have to cancel out and try again, remembering to press lightly but longer. No way is that intuitive. • Make hard-press features available to all! Some useful features are available only to iPhones with 3D Touch. For example, only with a hard press can you adjust the brightness level of the “flashlight” (the LED on the back of the phone) or clear all the notification bubbles at once. There's no reason Apple couldn't make these features available to the millions of people who own older phones. Why couldn't a long press perform the same function as the hard press? • Fix the Control Center swiping. In iOS 10, Apple reinvented the Control Center—the settings panel that appears when you swipe up from underneath the screen. Specifically, Apple split it into three “panes”: one with the traditional controls (brightness, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, et cetera); one that contained music-playback controls; and a third that controlled accessories in your home. Until iOS 10, you could adjust the screen brightness by dragging horizontally on the Brightness slider. But now horizontal swiping means: “Switch to the Music controls.” If your finger's aim on the Brightness slider isn't absolutely pixel-perfect, you wind up opening the Music page by accident. Happens all the time. • Make a decision about the Genius playlist. Previous iOS versions offered something called a Genius playlist, which automatically generated lists of songs with similar musical styles. That's gone in iOS 10. But the on/off switch for the feature is still there, in the Music Settings; it does absolutely nothing. Oopsie. • Let us clear our music queue, please. It's easy to create a “queue” of songs or albums that you want to hear next in the Music app. It's not so easy to clear that queue all at once—it's impossible. • Let us choose our preferred apps! Years ago Microsoft got in trouble for bundling its own apps with Windows, making it harder for independent companies to make inroads with their software. Apple is now doing the same thing with its apps for mail, calendar, browser and maps. For example, if you ask Siri to give you directions somewhere or hit the Get Directions button on an address, the iPhone uses Apple's built-in Maps app to guide you. There's no easy way to direct it to use the far superior Google Maps. That's just 800-pound gorilla-ism. So there you go, dear Apple: a to-do list for the next release of one of the world's most popular operating systems. Please remember the principle that put you on the map in the first place years ago: simpler is usually better.

By Emily Bary May 23, 2017 11:53 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Getty Images In the U.S., people want new iPhones, even though Samsung beat Apple to the punch on a number of new functions. In China, however, Apple’s lack of unique features seems to be hurting the company. After a series of meetings in China and Taiwan, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz concluded that “the lack of compelling differentiation” in both hardware and software is why Apple continues to lose market share in China. Smartphones these days tend to have very similar feature sets, and local companies offer much cheaper phones. More from Barron’s Next What if Apple Becomes Tesla Before Tesla Becomes Apple? Here’s Why Tesla Can’t Go Far in China How Apple Is Trying to Fix This Weak Link Meanwhile, while the general Apple ecosystem is why many people stick with their iPhones, it isn’t as big of a draw in China. “The mobile user experience in China is heavily dictated by Tencent and other local Internet companies, making Apple’s software and services ineffective as key differentiators,” he wrote. He expects a “temporary rebound” in market share when the much-hyped iPhone 8 comes out later this year. But looking farther ahead, he doesn’t believe Apple is innovating enough, which is “a sign of weaker control on its relationship with users.” Big Picture: One analyst says that Apple’s inability to come up with unique smartphone features is hurting the company in China.

German publication iPhone-ticker.de reports that Ikea is readying a software update to its Trådfri app to make its smart lighting products controllable not only via Apple’s HomeKit system, but also through Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home smart speakers. The new firmware update should arrive in the summer. HomeKit will let you use Siri to voice-control Ikea’s smart bulbs and incorporate HomeKit-enabled Ikea products in your custom scenes through Apple’s Home app on iPhone and iPad. The official Trådfri app, seen below, allows different family members to easily customize the light and atmosphere however they want, depending on their activity (i.e. choose a light for early mornings, another for late evenings and a third for cooking or working at home). Announced in March 2017, Ikea’s extensive smart lighting lineup sports plug-and-play simplicity at significantly lower prices than similar systems from the likes of Philips and others. Starting at $12 a piece, for instance, Ikea’s smart bulbs cost half as much as Philips’ Hue range at $30 per white bulb (goes all the way up to $50 per bulb if you want color). With Ikea’s app, you can dim, turn off, turn on and switch your Ikea smart bulbs from warm to cold light. The full range of smart lighting systems from Ikea includes LED bulbs, dimming lights, illuminated panels, a motion sensor kit and a gateway device. It was unclear at the time of this writing whether or not Ikea is planning on eventually making its whole range of smart products for the connected home compatible with the HomeKit platform, which would be splendid.

REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File Photo 1/2 left right FILE PHOTO: Nokia Lumia smartphones are pictured in a shop in Warsaw, January 11, 2013. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/File Photo 2/2 By Jussi Rosendahl and Tuomas Forsell | HELSINKI HELSINKI Apple has settled a patent dispute with Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia and agreed to buy more of its network products and services, sending Nokia shares up 7 percent. The deal means Nokia will get bigger royalties from Apple for using its mobile phone patents, helping offset the impact of waning demand for its mobile network hardware. Such legal battles are common in the industry but can drag on for years and analysts had not been expecting such a quick resolution to the dispute that started in December. Under the deal announced in a joint statement from the companies on Tuesday, Nokia will also supply network infrastructure products to Apple, and Apple will resume sales of Nokia's digital health products in retail and online stores and look at further collaboration in health. Digital health is one of the areas Nokia is targeting as it tries to develop new businesses to offset the industry-wide slump in demand for network equipment. Last year, Nokia bought France's Withings S.A., a small firm with products such as activity trackers and baby monitors built on digital platforms. "There could emerge big future value from this as Apple could become an important distribution channel," said Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg, who has an "accumulate" recommendation for Nokia shares. "I have not given any value so far for Nokia's digital health business, but might apply an option value to it." INDUSTRIAL DEAL Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told the company's annual general meeting later on Tuesday that the deal would help expand network sales beyond telecom operators to global internet and technology giants. "(The deal) involves a business collaboration ... in particular in areas of IP and optical equipment, which is quite key to webscale players when they build their data centers," he said. "It's a good deal, a multi-year licensing deal, and I love it that it has an industrial deal and aspect to it." Under the patent license agreement, Nokia will receive a "significant" upfront cash payment and additional revenues from Apple starting from the current quarter. The companies did not give further details but analysts said the revenue was likely to be far higher than a previous deal. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said it was a smart move to collaborate on digital health products. "It's interesting for Nokia in a five- to 10-year perspective since I think it will be hard to be profitable within mobile infrastructure," said Heydorn, whose firm does not hold any shares in Nokia. Nokia shares, which fell in December when the patent dispute was announced, jumped to their highest since February 2016 and were up 6.7 percent at 5.89 euros by 1509 GMT (11:09 a.m. ET). A previous patent license contract between the companies expired last year, and both sides took legal action in December. Apple complained of being overcharged and Nokia responded by accusing Apple of violating technology patents. In the absence of a new deal, Nokia cut its annual run-rate forecast in December for patent and brand licensing sales to 800 million euros ($900 million) from 950 million euros previously. In its latest quarterly report released in April, Nokia stopped giving an annual run-rate forecast altogether. "(The agreement) moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners," Nokia's Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona said in a statement. QUICK RESOLUTION Analysts were surprised by the relatively quick resolution of the dispute between Apple and Nokia. "Nokia told analysts in April don't calculate on any license revenue from Apple, not even in 2018, so this is a positive surprise. It will also limit Nokia's legal expenses," said Djurberg who said he would probably raise his Nokia estimates. "For Nokia, it's good news they got this out of the way, but we still have to wait for details about the financial impact," said OP Equities analyst Hannu Rauhala. "The previous annual rate was 150 million euros, so I assume this to be more, around 500 million euros." Rauhala said Apple might have been willing to settle with Nokia as the U.S. company's patent battle with chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has escalated. Patent royalties represent only a sliver of Nokia's overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from telecoms network equipment. But licensing payments are highly profitable and the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. Nokia's patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. Once the world's dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 to focus on its network business and large portfolio of mobile device patents. Nokia's total sales in 2016 were about 24 billion euros.

EU states approve plans to make social media firms tackle hate speech BRUSSELS European Union ministers approved proposals on Tuesday to make social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube tackle videos with hate speech on their platforms. The proposals, which would be the first legislation at EU level on the issue, still need to be agreed with the European Parliament before becoming law. But EU lawmakers have similarly pushed for social media companies to do more to tackle hateful content on their platforms.
