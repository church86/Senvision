Shares could exceed $1,000 by summer and gain 20% in a year. By Jack Hough Biography Updated May 6, 2017 1:46 a.m. ET As Amazon.com stock nears its 20th birthday, its long-term holders have already enjoyed many happy returns. The price has soared from $2 to $934, adjusted for splits, since the first day of trading on May 15, 1997. That puts Amazon’s market value at $450 billion, making it the fourth-largest U.S. company, behind Apple (ticker: AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT). No company has ever reached such a size with so little in cumulative profit—about $5 billion since going public. Alphabet, by comparison, has earned $90 billion over just the past five years.

PHOTO: REUTERS Citigroup listed seven companies as potential takeover targets for Apple, including Netflix, Walt Disney and Tesla , as a way to put its cash hoard of more than $250 billion to work. With over 90 per cent of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10 per cent repatriation tax would give Apple $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients. US President Donald Trump’s tax blueprint, which was unveiled last month, proposes allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10 per cent versus 35 per cent now. Apple starting US tech manufacturing fund with $1 bn “Since one of the new administration’s top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use,” Suva said. The analyst is rated three out of five stars for his recommendations on Apple, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Apple unveils updated iPad at lowest-ever price The other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive Software as well as video streaming service Hulu. The analyst said the targets were screened considering five criteria – strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple’s share price. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its cash hoard, Apple recently boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share buyback program by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 per cent.

The survey released Thursday by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 percent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. “The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence,” said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China’s Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 percent global market share, ahead of Fitbit’s 13.2 percent. “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market,” said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. “Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 percent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models.

For most users the reasons to install macOS Sierra outweigh the drawbacks, but for there are still some important reasons to wait– even for smaller updates. Some users may be tempted to wait for the macOS Sierra 10.13 update that we expect Apple will announce at WWDC in June and likely release later this fall, but it is premature to wait for this major upgrade before moving to macOS Sierra. The macOS Sierra update brings more than just a brand new name for the software that runs on your Mac, MacBook, and iMac. This latest update adds new MacBook Emoji and other important updates. The new macOS Sierra 10.12.4 update adds Night Shift to your Mac. Apple began automatically downloading the macOS Sierra update to many computers earlier this year and you may see it show up on your Mac unexpectedly. This is prompting more users to install macOS Sierra even though it is not a required upgrade. Since the announcement last fall, we’ve seen the macOS Sierra 10.12.1, 10.12.2, 10.12.3 update and the macOS Sierra 10.12.4 update that is now live. If you haven’t upgraded or installed the latest updates. You can also choose to sign up for the macOS Sierra 10.2.5 beta if you want to test out the latest version. What you need to know about the latest macOS Sierra updates. Many users are asking if they should upgrade from OS X El Capitan to macOS Sierra or upgrade from OS X Yosemite to macOS Sierra and this will help you make that decision based on your specific situation. Here’s Why You Should Update to macOS Sierra: Install if you have OS X El Capitan Problems Install for Night Mode On Your Mac Install if you have the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Install if you need better security Install macOS Sierra for Siri Install for Better Messages & New Emoji Install to Unlock with the Apple Watch Install for Apple Pay on Mac Install to get more storage space back Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Install macOS Sierra; Don’t install if you aren’t prepared Don’t install if you are worried about macOS Sierra problems Don’t install if you use a really old Mac Don’t install if you’re traveling Should I Install macOS Sierra? Here’s what you need to know. The macOS Sierra release date arrived in October 2016, delivering a fresh look and a fresh set of features to your Apple computers. One of the most interesting is that you can now login to your MacBook or iMac with your Apple Watch. Apple spent the better part of the last year delivering small and important upgrades to OS X El Capitan, which may leave it the best option for many users as 2017 draws on. After a lengthy developer and public beta period that squashed many bugs, there are still some macOS Sierra problems that users need to keep in mind before upgrading. Users can install the macOS Sierra update and keep their data, apps and photos in place right from the App Store. If you’re experiencing major OS X El Capitan problems, it’s a smart idea to perform a clean macOS Sierra installation and start fresh. The macOS Sierra update is free, and the free offer doesn’t end like the Windows 10 free upgrade did. If you are still on the fence, here is a look at the reasons to install macOS Sierra and the reasons you shouldn’t upgrade yet. After you learn about what the macOS Sierra update includes and the potential issues you can decide if the time is right for you to update. To turn off the automatic macOS Sierra download, go to System Preferences -> App Store -> Uncheck Download newly available updates in the background. If you need to delete the macOS Sierra update that already downloaded to stop the prompts to update or to get some space back you can find it using Finder and delete it. Here’s what’s new in macOS Sierra 10.12.4 that is out now for Apple computers; Adds Night Shift for automatically shifting the colors in your display to the warmer end of the spectrum after dark. Adds Siri support for cricket scores, schedules, and player rosters from the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. Adds Dictation support for Shanghainese. Improves right-to-left language support for the Touch Bar, toolbar, and visual tab picker in Safari. Resolves several PDF rendering and annotation issues in Preview. Improves the visibility of the subject line when using Conversation View in Mail. Fixes an issue that may prevent content from appearing in Mail messages. Adds support for more digital camera RAW formats. If you haven’t installed macOS Sierra yet there are still reasons to hold off, but not as many as we saw in April. We’ll start with the reasons to install macOS Sierra and then move into the reasons not to install macOS Sierra 10.12.4 yet. Install if You Have OS X El Capitan Problems   1 / 13 Do you have OS X El Capitan problems? If your WiFi is unreliable, your Mac is slow or acting odd, a macOS Sierra update may be just the thing your computer needs. In addition to delivering smart features there are bug fixes and performance upgrades in macOS Sierra as well. If your computer is really acting up, you may want to spend the time to perform a clean install of macOS Sierra. This allows you to start over fresh with no apps or data to mess up your installation. Users that go this route should make sure that they have important data backed up someplace else.   1 / 13 54 Responses 09/22/2016 nameisrequired Reply Nothing is perfect and Mac OS Sierra is no exception. Actually this article mainly talks about the advantages of the new system. But we can not deny that Sierra also leads to some problems like Mac app damage, Safari crash. This article reveal both the problems and solutions. Hope it will be helpful http://bit.ly/2d3d7gE 10/13/2016 Pete Reply >Nothing is perfect and Mac OS Sierra is no exception.

I’ve never seen anyone in such an egotistical stupor in my life 04/13/2017 JIMJFOX Not even Barry Soetoro Barack Hussein O’Bama?? 12/28/2016 Leonard Wichard Reply Hi There, this post is something we call bait. It suggests on Google Search Results to deal with certain issues. Then when reading the post, it quickly becomes clear that this post doesnt deal with anything of any importance. — LG 09/26/2016 Nic S Reply Installed it this morning. I’m now about to uninstall it as there is nothing worth upgrading for. Novelties like Siri and picture in picture aren’t worth the trouble for all the software that Sierra breaks. I’m staying with Yosemite. 10/07/2016 WES Reply Hello. Do you know if there is a way to uninstall El Capitain and go back to Yosemite ? 10/12/2016 Parker Tubman Reply There is a way to go back to Yosemite because that is what I did. I did not like El Capitan. Here’s how to do it. If you did back up before installing El Capitan … : 1. First get a hardware drive with lots of memory 2. Back up your entire computer through Time Machine app. 3. Then when you upgraded Yosemite, go on to Time Machine with your hard drive attached to the USB point on the computer, and select the last backup file with the date that you did the last backup before El Capitan came on your computer. It will have Yosemite on it. If you did NOT back up Yosemite before installing El Capitan … : 1. First get a hardware drive with lots of memory 2. Go on to Time Machine with your hard drive attached to the USB point on the computer, and select the last backup file that you did on your hard drive. If its something older an Older OS system on there you can choose that and not have El Capitan anymore. 09/29/2016 Rob Reply This article if pretty shallow 09/29/2016 Cooper Jackson Reply Is it really even an “article” ??? More like a way for someone to get hits to their site. 09/30/2016 Richard T Fishall Reply Sorry but this article has zero value. 09/30/2016 Chris Burbridge Reply I totally disagree with Mister (or Misus) “zero value”. Very helpful! I will not install. Thanks. 02/14/2017 Sean Hyland Reply You’re kidding me right? “I will not install” Based on what information because there was none. 10/01/2016 Bhosadda Reply Lol….early adopters with “Software Update OCD” always get screwed, and yet they never learn….. Just because an OS is released today, doesn’t mean you should immediately install it thinking it’s going to somehow make your computer “better”, or “faster”, ideas of “update” is in your head. Stick with El Capitan, it’s rock solid; as with any OSX update, it’s _ALWAYS_ wise to wait for the second incremental (i.e 10.12.2) patch before even considering upgrading. 02/28/2017 pat Reply Early adopter = guinea pig :) 10/01/2016 kay ringold Reply The title doesn’t match the content. It doesn’t give any real opinions on the upgrade 10/01/2016 Zac Paul Reply WHAT IS THIS? This article really misses some significant points. And when I say “significant points”, I mean almost every point of meaning. THE BIGGEST FEATURE OF SIERRA, WHICH IS GOING IGNORED BY MANY PUBLICATIONS The biggest single upgrade with Sierra is the pending APFS, Apple’s new file system that will replace the two-decade old HFS+. This is a massive undertaking. You can ONLY upgrade to APFS with Sierra, and you WILL be able to upgrade file systems WITHOUT having to do a clean install. Right now, early 2017 is when APFS should be pushed to general users. This file system has better data integrity, better multi-tasking abilities, is optimized for high-speed flash storage, and offers MAJOR improvements in encryption options. In the future, by using APFS on OS X, this will allow OS X to have a degree of interaction with iOS that was never before possible (currently, as iOS uses APFS, and Mac HFS+, there are some compatibility issues between Macs and other Apple portable devices that APFS can lift.) BRAND NEW OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE ALMOST NEVER AS SECURE AS THE MATURE PLATFORMS THEY REPLACE. As for security, expecting a brand new OS to immediately be more secure than a mature platform is a risky assumption. Beta testing has the limitation that the quantity of beta testers are a tiny fraction of real-world users of the stable version, so beta and pen testing provide valuable data, but there are limited. Apple, like Microsoft, doesn’t drop support on one version of OS X the moment the next comes out. The security flaw you are referencing IIRC has been pushed out to all versions of OS X dating back to Mountain Lion. As of right now, the XTS-AES whole disk encryption used by FileVault2 is secure on all recent implementations of OS X. When Sierra gets APFS, users will have more encryption options, and the potential for greater security. As for general usage, the greatest security vulnerabilities are usually attacking add-ons and extensions in browsers (such as Flash.) Using a modern browser, keeping it updated regularly, using a site like SSL Labs to test a website you are about to buy from but want to know if they use good cryptography. Users worried about security and privacy should consider Little Snitch, Murus, BitDefender, 1Password, good password habits, encrypting internal & external drives, as well as flash & SD cards & drives, and ensuring their use of cloud computing is secure. No operating system can compensate for bad security habits. FIX PROBLEMS BY FINDING AND RESOLVING THE ACTUAL PROBLEM!!! Doing an in-place OS update on a malfunctioning system is like replacing your brakes if you need new tires and hoping that things turn out OK. If you are having problems with a current release of El Capitan, it is unlikely that upgrading to Sierra will fix this and it increases the chance that you screw things up even worse than before. Think about that for a second…you are having issues with a mature operating system that has proven reliable, so you upgrade to a new one with far less known? El Capitan is an extremely reliable operating system…if you are having an issue, you need to determine if it is related to the OS, Apple software, 3rd party software, or hardware failure because the course of action to fix the issue is completely different. A free program such as Onyx can fix many OS issues, and along with utilizing Disk Utility, resetting PRAM/NRAM/SMC, Apple’s hardware testers, and a utility that pulls SMART data from the local drive, you can get a good idea of what is going on and may be able to fix it. If there are issues with severe disk corruption, upgrading without a clean install will not do a thing, and the only application that reliably repairs severe corruption that even OS X itself cannot is DiskWarrior. OVERALL, THIS MINOR UPDATE HAS BIG POTENTIAL Functionally, Sierra is not currently all that different from El Capitan. As El Capitan is extremely reliable, this makes sense so Apple has a solid base for the OS leading us to APFS, where a mid-life update (or what replaces Sierra) may then implement larger changes that makes the interaction between different devices a far better process, with greater ease and improved productivity. Apple also likely realized that with such a rapid update schedule, minor changes to OS X are better than radical changes because reliability suffers with changes as such. Leopard, Lion, (and Mavericks and Yosemite to a lesser extent) all introduced awesome features but had a lot of issues. Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion, and El Capitan introduced few new features and instead vastly improved reliability. MAKE A CLONE BACKUP IN ADDITION TO OR IN PLACE OF TIME MACHINE Before updating, I advise having a CLONE (not a TimeMachine backup) of the disk you are going update. A program like Carbon Copy Cloner makes a superior backup and one of the optimal quality desired should you need to revert back to your older OS without doing a fresh install. Clones can be made bootable, where Time Machine cannot. USING VIRTUAL MACHINES TO TEST NEW OPERATING SYSTEMS SAVES A LOT OF CUSSING TIME If someone has compatibility concerns, consider purchasing VMWare Fusion, Parallels, or downloading a free player. These virtual machine apps allow you to run Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. operating systems on your Mac in an isolated environment. You can then ‘test’ the new OS to ensure it works reliably enough for your needs and has no issues with your older Apps. The $100 or so spent on this software can save a ton of grief, and many hours of your time by preventing you installing an OS, finding it doesn’t work right, and then manually having to downgrade (which still may have issues.) —- So, should someone update to Sierra? As of right now, my opinion is… YES, if: -the need to have the latest-and-greatest ASAP is more important than reliability, compatibility, and security -you want to immediately benefit from improvements made with iCloud -you strongly like the updates to Mail and Messages (IMO they are very minor compared to iOS10) -you love Siri and feel it will be useful for you with your desktop/laptop -you frequently use multi-monitor displays with a MacBook Pro -you want to take advantage of the benefits of APFS (this will apply sometime in early 2017) NO, if: -reliability is the single-most important thing to you (wait until 10.12.1 or 10.12.2, as these updates always address the most significant issues of the first release. -security is the single-most important thing to you (wait a bit, same as above.) -you use a lot of older software that is no longer supported by the Maker(s) -you are not comfortable manually downgrading the OS should Sierra not work well on your machine (also wait a bit.) 10/04/2016 J Reply Josh Smith, Bless you for posting instructions for deleting the auto-download and removing the install notification. 10/05/2016 Kim Reply Major regrets installing this upgrade. My external harddrive is now “read only”. I can’t export any photos to it from lightroom. I have tried changing permissions, etc. with no luck. It won’t let me. Wish I had stayed with Yosemite as I have many many photos to get to clients. Put me in the unprepared column. So discouraged. I guess I’ll have to purchase new external hard drive. 10/11/2016 James Bond Reply Jesus, this site is horrible. Full of advertisements and tracker.

Thanks to you, I decided to wait although Apple is annoying with its constant messages to upgrade. 10/18/2016 Gemma Correll Reply Cant “zoom text only” anymore! What a stupid upgrade!! 10/18/2016 Daisy Reply Hi guys, I have OSX Lion, and every time a new upgrade comes out I am very reluctant to upgrade to them, and had no issues with my old Lion. Two weeks ago I updated my iPhone 5 and now my photos won’t sink into iPhoto in Mac. I tried unlock the iPhone as the popup window would ask, but nothing happened. I called apple support and they told me to upgrade the software to Sierra. And again I don’t want it especially after reading above comments. So I wonder if anyone knows the way to transfer iPhone pictures to Mac? 10/25/2016 jackiebp Reply Worthless article. It does not discuss the reasons not to install. Does not discuss possible conflicts and bugs. This is exactly why you need to PAY professional writers for articles. They do research and write substance. Shame on you. 10/25/2016 Mark Stratman Reply macOS Sierra is a disaster. I upgraded my 2014 MacBook Air, and have spent 3 totally unproductive days trying to get basic tools that I count on every day to minimally work. To no avail. The Apple phone techs are useless. There are no “geniuses” at any ‘Genius Bars’. macOS and Sierra are enhancements for toys, not real-life business tools. If the concept of ‘planned obsolescence’ is now the center of Apple’s marketing plan, then I will end my 30+ year reliance Apple products and buy elsewhere. 11/08/2016 Steven V Reply I have a Mac Book pro with Yosemite, I was wondering if an update was going to give me a lot of new stuff but it doesn’t seem like much there from the comments.

(Had early problems with key board on BookAir, replaced x2) As for Sierra, nothing seems to work with it i.e. Browser (neither Chrome nor Firefox) Outlook, and most prominently the Parallel Desk (with Win10), even though have updated to latest Parallel. Everything crashes, impossible to complete even this note, .. inordinate frustrations, in trying to remedy things with relatively mediocre skills, but otherwise quite apt, for a non-geek, and it would be certainly insolent of this company to expect me to be under the hood all the time. My cry ought to be seen as an indictment of this Apple Company which is overall sloppy in releasing stuff like this, frivolous and mostly dedicated to ‘social toys’, inconsiderate, and ultimately unserious. Will have to ask Hillary where she got that sledge hammer Merry Christmas to all 12/13/2016 Dave Reply MY concerns with these additional features that Apple so enthusiastically offers are that I have a Macbook Pro mid 2012 machine and it seems to be the general consensus that Apple are deliberately trying to make any machine that is 4 years and older obsolete by deliberately slowing its processing speed down where it becomes unusable which therefore encourages the user to go and buy a new and latest version of the macbook pro. Thoughts on this anyone? (not Apple obviously) 12/14/2016 Allen Reply It’s a useful article – maybe not if you want Rules Handed Down from On High, as it doesn’t do that – it just outlines some problems, some advantages, and leaves it up to us to decide. Fine by me. Me? Oh, I’ll stick with El Capitan for now, for a few months, and see how things pan out. That’s the technique I’ve applied to the past few updates! Cheers. Allen, London. 12/15/2016 Paul Brodie Reply Apple seem to be falling into the Microsoft trap of updating and releasing software updates before they are fully tested, ISO 10.12.1 has brought several problems that were not needed or wanted, Photos CUP usage 100%, why do this?? 12/16/2016 Tina Garnett Reply After installing new MacOs Sierra 10.12.2 I had problems with Safari freezing, when going into Activity Monitor the CPU was up loading fast and memory going over the roof some thing in the background was running fast (but slowing the computer) could not be found why. The wi-fi disconnecting and asking for password , as well as a very slow computer. iPhoto download once iPhone connected had to be download automatically with editing a manual response. I have now switched back to Yosemite and no problems and quick and easy and a fast internet once again. No thanks to Sierra too many problems to thrash out. There is a way to get Yosemite back from Sierra as follows: There is a way to go back to Yosemite because that is what I did. I did not like Sierra. Here’s how to do it. If you did back up before installing Sierra :- 1. First get a hardware drive with lots of memory 2. Back up your entire computer through Time Machine app. 3. Then when you upgraded Yosemite, go on to Time Machine with your hard drive attached to the USB point on the computer, and select the last backup file with the date that you did the last backup before Sierra came on your computer. It will have Yosemite on it. If you did NOT back up Yosemite before installing Sierra :- 1. First get a hardware drive with lots of memory 2. Go on to Time Machine with your hard drive attached to the USB point on the computer, and select the last backup file that you did on your hard drive. If its something older an Older OS system on there you can choose that and not have Sierra anymore. Worked for me!

Engst We’re approaching another of those inflection points where Apple leaves some apps — and their users — behind. When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader too, but only TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps. If you are a TidBITS member, access the full-text feed by logging in and clicking the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use. Happily, you can easily replace it with any RSS reader, including Apple’s built-in News app. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Atkinson  2017-05-05 11:04 I appear to be one of the 50 daily users and have appreciated having a one-stop shop for TidBits content. Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying….. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:37 Even though Tidbits is not listed in Favourites, the Tidbits news items are still being shown…..

The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Entertainment Image Source: Harrison Weber, Flickr Apple TV may finally get Amazon Video this summer Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 5th, 2017 at 10:13 PM Share Tweet The Apple TV is a well-rounded set-top streaming machine, provided you don’t need access to Amazon Video. The competitive rivalry between the two companies has caused Amazon to keep its streaming service off the Apple TV, but a new report suggests that could be about to change. Don't Miss: The Galaxy Note 8’s best new feature is supposedly coming early Recode has spoken to sources who suggest that Amazon and Apple are “close to a deal” to bring a streaming app to the Apple TV. If things go to plan, the app should go live in the fall. Any deal is likely to involve Amazon putting the Apple TV back on sale on the Amazon online store. Amazon pulled the Apple TV from its store two years ago, saying that it didn’t want to sell a streaming box that wasn’t compatible with its own services. Amazon is an important retailer for set-top boxes, and the lack of availability of the Apple TV hurts it against Chromecast, Roku, and Amazon’s own Fire TV stick. For Amazon, a discussion over Apple’s revenue split in the App Store could be up for discussion. Currently, Amazon doesn’t offer “in-app purchases” or subscription purchases through its iOS apps, because doing so would mean that Apple gets a cut of every subscription sold, every movie rented or every Kindle book bought. Apple has been loath to change those terms in the past, but some kind of deal could be worked out in private that would bring Amazon to the Apple TV.

Citigroup’s Apple analyst James Suva threw his hat into the ring Friday, covering every conceivable base. Suva suggests the most likely options for Apple are Netflix (40 percent odds) and Disney (25 percent odds). Citi also suggested Apple might even scoop up Elon Musk’s electric-car manufacturer Tesla (5 percent odds), or video-game makers including Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, or Take-Two Interactive (10 percent each). Suva’s odds-making is prompted by bets that the globe’s most profitable company will benefit from the Trump Administration’s desire for US corporations to bring cash back into the country in return for a lower tax rate. Apple has some $257 billion in cash on its books and has not provided many clues about how it will spend it. But some, including Citi’s Suva, believe Apple could be considering a move to buy a video streaming service. The company’s business selling downloadable music and media has seen declines as consumers move to online streaming instead. SEE ALSO Apple execs vying for original movie, TV deals 0:0 Senior Apple executives have reached out to some of Hollywood’s... Talk of an Apple-Disney combination has also been heating up in the past few months. The Associated Press pointed out a merger would create the world’s first trillion-dollar company. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told the AP in an interview published on Tuesday, “We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward.” Apple CEO Tim Cook has historically been cautious about big deals. Many thought Apple would go after Time Warner, which instead accepted an offer from AT&T. Apple shares closed the Friday session at $148.96, up 1.7 percent. Cook did spend $3 billion in 2014, acquiring Beats Electronics to help it carve an identity for its Apple Music streaming service.

Amazon Video is reportedly coming to Apple TV this year. (Apple Photo). Anyone with an Apple TV has likely noticed the conspicuously absent Amazon Video app. The device, which allows viewers to stream video from HBO, Netflix, and other services to their TVs has been missing a convenient way to watch Amazon content — until now. According to anonymous sources cited by Recode, the Amazon Video app will be arriving on the Apple TV set-top box this summer. Some of Amazon’s devices compete directly with Apple products, like the Fire TV stick, which also allows viewers to stream content to the TV. So far, the two companies haven’t been able to reach an agreement to bring an Amazon Video app to the Apple TV. The standoff led Amazon to stop selling the Apple TV on its retail site in 2015, as Recode notes. “We want our player, our Prime Video player, to be on the device, and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms … and if you can’t, then we don’t want to sell it to our customers, because they’re going to be buying it thinking they can watch Prime Video and then they’re going to be disappointed,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said at Recode’s Code Conference last year. “And they’re going to return it.” An agreement between the two tech titans could be a sign of Amazon’s increasing dominance in the streaming video world, as more Apple customers expect access to the content.

Reuters/Jonathan Alcorn Latest reports suggest that Amazon Prime video app may come to Apple TV very soon. It looks like Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos have finally buried the hatchet and Apple and Amazon have reached a truce. Currently, there is no easy way to watch Amazon Prime content on Apple TV. Users have to use AirPlay with another Apple device to do so. The absence of the app from the Apple device is surely a casualty of both the companies’ desire to be the best go-to video streaming service. Reports now claim that this lock could be released soon, as both the companies have put customers at the forefront and not their personal differences. The companies have reportedly gotten into an agreement. Amazon Prime video app could be on Apple TV as soon as the third quarter of this year. This is great news for Amazon Prime subscribers who also own Apple TVs. Once the gap is bridged, they won’t have to rely on streaming video over an AirPlay connection. Even though the number of Amazon Prime subscribers who own Apple TVs are very less, it still is a big step forward. According to Recode, it is not known whether this truce means Apple and Amazon have also settled other disputes. It is also unclear what led the two to go for a settlement, though industry experts believe Bezos and Cook may have met in person to talk business. The deal is happening at a time when Amazon’s video business is becoming really important to Prime. The truce would also mean that the Apple TV will show up on Amazon’s online store. Currently, it does not do so, as Amazon doesn’t want to push such a prime competitor to its Amazon Fire product range. The truce is mutually beneficial. The pact will allow Amazon to take advantage of Apple’s pretty impressive and large Apple TV devotees, as they will now be able to sign up to Amazon’s video platform. Moreover, the ability to slot Amazon Video along with other supported video apps will result in more Apple TV sales. However, in case the Amazon app does come to Apple TV, it would be a reminder of a couple of shortcomings, such as Apple TV’s “inability to support either the 4K resolution or high dynamic range streams Amazon has been offering for well over a year now,” writes Forbes. On the other hand, there are rumours that the Cupertino tech giant may unveil a brand new 4K HDR-capable Apple TV in June at the WWDC. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the pact between Apple TV and Amazon Prime video app. Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Apple Watch soars: Apple now world's number one wearables seller Amazon officially heads to Australia with vast selection and fast delivery at low prices Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 $20,000 visa allows parents of migrants in Australia for 10 years 0 Shares 2 Acer Leap Ware fitness smartwatch specs, features, price and release details 0 Shares 3 Harry Styles Live On Tour: Tickets on sale May 5 0 Shares 4 Lakers Trade News: Paul George dreams of succeeding idol Kobe Bryant in LA, claims insider 0 Shares 5 ‘MasterChef Australia 2017’ update: 'Brain-fade' and plate smash eliminate first Season 9 contestant 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’ season 3 ‘heard on the set’ 0 Shares 7 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Diana Gabaldon explains Rollo casting 0 Shares 8 ‘Pokemon Stars’ could be a completely new sequel 0 Shares 9 ‘Prison Break’ Season 5, Episode 5 update 0 Shares 10 ‘Vikings’ season 5: Cast members undergo ‘physically tough battle scenes’; Lagertha has bloody and beaten up face 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Caltex Australia announces $20 million fund to compensate underpaid employees Back to the old fashioned way: Sales of physical books rise, E-book revenue falls Mike Pence assures Trump’s tax reform will benefit Australia Aramco CEO says global oil market moves closer to balance despite US boom Qantas crowned Australia’s most attractive employer NT okays $800m Northern Gas Pipeline, Jemena poised to solve Australia's gas crisis More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance FDA to require restaurants to post nutritional info for their menu starting May 5 Melania Trump welcomes Queen Rania of Jordan, heads to an all-girls school Pump hydro storage can help build 100 percent renewable energy grid Study shows Western Australians are unhappiest at work; older, female employees are more satisfied Egyptians unite after church bombing; Abdel Fatah el-Sisi declares state of emergency Trump to visit China; Xi approves 100-day trade talks plan More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East NBA Trade News: Thunder determined to trade Enes Kanter this offseason Cloud of uncertainty shrouds future of Los Angeles Clippers Tony Parker Injury Update: Spurs point guard likely out for remainder of 2017 NBA Playoffs NBA Trade News: Dwight Howard would only fetch a second-round pick, per insider Jay Cutler follows Tony Romo broadcasting career with NFL stint on hold Big Baller Brand debuts Lonzo Ball ZO2 kicks with LaVar fingerprints all over More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More 'Tekken x Street Fighter' may resume development Fitbit wearable specs revealed 'Red Dead Redemption 2' PC compatibility will not be announced soon Facebook denies targeting young Australians, Kiwis based on their emotional state Xbox One and Xbox 360 Deals With Gold until May 9 announced: ‘Street Fighter X Tekken’ and ‘DmC: Definitive Edition’ among the best deals Gaming writer Chet Falizek parts amicably with Valve, ‘Half-Life 3’ future bleaker More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Quantico': Priyanka Chopra talks about season 3 'Winds of Winter' theory: Euron Greyjoy and the Long Night ‘Outlander’ season 3: Diana Gabaldon explains Rollo casting Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip health speculation rife as entire household staff called to ‘emergency meeting’ 'Fast & Furious' is first franchise to receive MTV Generation Award over an individual ‘The 100’ season 4 episode 10 recap: Twist to the Conclave More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

By Corazon Victorino On 05/05/17 AT 10:12 PM Close Apple’s Phil Schiller just shared his honest thoughts about the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers. He also indirectly pointed out what he thinks is lacking in these devices.  Gadgets 360 has finally published its interview with Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing when he was in Bengaluru, India last March. When Schiller was asked to comment on the famous smart speakers Amazon Echo and Google Home, he responded that he won’t give specific comments on each device. He then candidly added, “My mother used to have a saying that if you don’t have something nice to say, say nothing at all.” Schiller continued by saying that he’ll just tackle the general concepts. He first pointed out that there is definitely a market for voice-driven assistants that’s why Apple is working so hard in developing and improving Siri. However, he noted that a voice assistant device without a screen is only important at times when it’s convenient to have this type of device. He set two examples to back his statement. First, he said that a device without a screen is perfect for when one is driving. Next, he stated that this technology is also useful for when one is listening to music from a device across the room because there’s the advantage of switching songs without walking over and back to the device. READ: Amazon Prime Video coming to Apple TV this year Schiller stated that there are many other times when a voice assistant device is beneficial, but he thinks that this does not mean such devices should not come with a screen display. For this, he used asking for directions as an example. The Apple executive said that while a voice assistant can say the directions out loud, it would still be better if one can see the directions on a map. “I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route and what I’m going to do,” he said.  According to Schiller, another aspect where the voice-only assistants fail is photography. Voice assistants could never work with this application because photography requires a screen nowadays. He linked this downside to social media saying, “All the social networking apps… are now embracing photos more and more.” He also said, “The idea of a device without a screen, well it’s not really useful for that whole category of photos that we all share.” Lastly, Schiller tackled the disadvantage of voice-only devices when it comes to gaming. “The biggest category of all of apps is games, and I have yet to see any voice-only games that, for me, are nearly as fun as the one that I play on my screen,” he said. Because of this, he firmly believes that the role of the screen is very important in the tech industry, and it will remain that way.  READ: Apple Pay updated with 21 more U.S. banks While Schiller’s comments are vague, AppleInsider reports that they could be providing insight as to what Apple is planning for its voice assistant technology long-term. At present, the Cupertino giant is rumored to be working on a Siri-based smart speaker that would surely be a direct competitor to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Details about the device are scarce, but it’s not that hard to imagine that it would feature a display given Schiller’s sentiments.  Phil Schiller gave his honest thoughts on the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.

This is certainly an excellent question, especially as there are rumors swirling that Apple may not be launching their 10th anniversary iPhone 8 at all this year. This rumor has allegedly come from an analyst at Deutsche Bank who has made public a research note which states that Apple doesn’t feel comfortable releasing the iPhone 8 in 2017 because of “key component shortages and technical challenges,” as the Daily Mail has reported. Business Insider was the first to report on this rumored note of the delayed U.S. release date of the iPhone 8 from the analyst, which originally came from a report by ValueWalk. “As we have written in previous research notes, several supply chain reports have suggested that key component shortages and technical challenges could delay the release of a high-end iPhone 8 device this fall. We believe this report further underscores the uncertainty around the timing of Apple’s next-generation iPhone model.” There are many rumors around the anticipate release date of the new iPhone 8. [Image by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] The rumor is that ValueWalk released insider information from an anonymous source from somewhere within the Foxconn Corporation. This source claims that there won’t be any packaging materials at all for the new iPhone 8 until June, which would certainly not leave a ton of time in the year for Apple to release the iPhone 8. PC Advisor, while also mentioning the Deutsche Bank analyst rumors, have stated that if Apple keeps to their traditional schedule, then the iPhone 8 should have a U.S. release date in September 2017. They do note that there are still rumors about a delay in the iPhone 8 due to the glass OLED screens which may end up pushing the release date for the iPhone back a little later until November. However, a November 2017 U.S. release date for the iPhone 8 would still be preferable to it not being released at all this year. New Apple iPhone 8 possible first look. pic.twitter.com/RNDpyfIFg7 — MVAMAGAZINE (@MVAMAGAZINE) May 3, 2017 While the media and everyone have been calling Apple’s new 2017 phone an iPhone 8, have they definitely settled on a name yet? The rumors are that it could go by other names, such as the iPhone 7s, iPhone X, or even iPhone Edition. As far as the new iPhone 8 design is concerned, there is now a leaked technical drawing of the phone which corroborates other leaks about its camera. Apple appears to be turning the camera assembly so that it will now be vertical, with a 90 degree difference from what it used to be. One of the biggest leaks which seems to get the most news is the rumor that the iPhone 8 will be using OLED technology, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy X7, instead of the older IPS technology. What OLED would do would be to ensure that the iPhone 8 has immensely better colors as well as contrast. While nothing is set in stone regarding the new OLED technology, Apple did allegedly order 70m panels directly from Samsung. It is also rumored that the iPhone 8 will now feature a 5.8 inch display. This would make the screen a little curved, although not as much as the Galaxy S8, of course. Will the new iPhone 8 featured OLED technology? [Image by Cole Bennetts/Getty Images] Another much-touted rumor about the new iPhone 8 is that there will be a touchscreen sensor that users will find embedded into their screens. It is also quite possible that some sort of function area will be placed near the bottom of the screen so that it will be similar to the Touch Bar that Apple users also find on the MacBook Pro. On the other hand, one source from Foxconn has alleged that the Touch ID will actually be placed onto the back of the phone. As far as charging the iPhone 8 goes, reports suggesting that Apple will be using USB-C rather than Lightning to make charging the phone go faster are alleged to be false. It is now thought that Apple is working to make charging faster with a Lightning cable rather than using the previously suggested USB-C. Are you excited for the release of the new iPhone 8, and do you think the U.S. release date will still be this year despite rumors to the contrary?

The weekend has arrived once more, and that means it’s time to pause and catch our breaths, as we look back on another exciting week across the tech world. There were some major announcements, a few juicy rumors, and one or two surprises – and as ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you know exactly what’s been happening. Our journey begins this week in China, where authorities are apparently preparing to launch an alternative to Wikipedia, bringing together "the biggest, most high-quality author team" in the world. Underneath the obnoxiously large watermark in the image above, you'll see Fitbit's new smartwatch, which was revealed in leaked pictures alongside a new set of Bluetooth earbuds. Qualcomm is reportedly preparing to ask the International Trade Commission to enforce an import ban on iPhones entering the United States. Apple recently stopped paying royalties to some of Qualcomm's partners in China, amid a bitter dispute between the two companies over Qualcomm's licensing fees. Next week, Qualcomm will announce details of its new Snapdragon 660 processor chipset Mobile Platform for upper-mid-range devices. Rival chipmaker Intel finally patched a security vulnerability that has existed in some of its products for almost a decade. An email phishing scam attempted to ensnare users by linking to a shared Google Docs file, which routed users through a legitimate Google sign-in page, before a fake app requested authorization to access their emails. Meanwhile, Google made changes to Gmail's security warnings to offer greater protection against phishing attempts. O2, part of Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica, revealed that some of its customers had had their bank accounts accessed by unknown third parties, as the result of a phishing attack combined with a known flaw in the SS7 protocol. A hacker, going by the name 'The Dark Overlord', leaked episodes of the upcoming season of hit Netflix show Orange Is The New Black, after the company ignored demands for a ransom payment. The same hacker claims to have possession of a further 36 unreleased movies and TV shows, and has again threatened to release them online unless a payment is made. Netflix content can now be viewed in 4K via the Microsoft Edge browser or the official Netflix app on Windows 10, thanks to a new preview driver from Nvidia for its GeForce GTX 10xx-series graphics cards. Samsung is hoping to attract more buyers to its Galaxy S8 flagships by offering them a free six-month Netflix subscription, 64GB microSD EVO+ card, and a Clear View Standing Cover. Samsung began rolling out a software fix for red-tinted displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in Europe, and on T-Mobile in the US, but another issue popped up this week, causing some of those devices to randomly reboot. Buyers of LG's new G6 on T-Mobile can now get the device with $150 off, along with a free Google Home speaker and an LG G Pad X 8.0 tablet. LG is reportedly working on a 'G6 mini', which could prove popular among those who prefer a more compact flagship. HTC won't officially unveil its new U 11 flagship until later this month - but thanks to a leak, it seems we now know all of its key specs. OnePlus confirmed that its new Android flagship (gosh, there sure are a lot of flagships these days...) will be called the OnePlus 5, and will launch this summer. The company is skipping over the 'OnePlus 4' moniker as that number is considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Google published its latest breakdown of Android usage, revealing that just 0.5% of active devices are running the latest Android release, version 7.1. Android 7.0 is now up to just 6.6%, almost nine months after its rollout began. That long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 edge and S6 active on AT&T Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ on T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) Honor 6X Google released its latest monthly Android security update, and published new factory and OTA images for its supported Nexus and Pixel devices. Details emerged of a new Android tablet in development by Motorola, with a 'premium look and feel', cellular connectivity, and a 'productivity mode', enabling users to pin apps to the nav bar. With Google's latest update to Chrome on Windows, version 58.0.3029.96, users with a 64-bit version of the OS running a 32-bit version of the browser will be automatically migrated to the 64-bit browser, if they have auto-update enabled. Google is getting ready to launch a major redesign of YouTube, including support for a dark theme - and it's got some big names onboard to support its stylish new look. Google and The Raspberry Pi Foundation teamed up to offer a low-cost cardboard kit that makers can use to build their own version of Google Home, including voice control support through the Google Assistant SDK. We've known since November that Amazon is working on a new Echo device, powered by its Alexa digital assistant, featuring a touchscreen and improved speakers - and the first images of that device appeared on Friday. Apple will reportedly unveil its own high-end rival to the Amazon Echo at its Worldwide Developer Conference next month. The new voice-controlled speaker is said to have a cylindrical design, similar to that of the Mac Pro, and - unsurprisingly - will support Apple's Siri digital assistant. Apple published its latest earnings report, revealing details of a very strong quarter for its services business, but a slight decline in iPhone sales, and a big drop in iPad sales. Apple promised to invest $1 billion in US manufacturing, and claimed that it's responsible for creating two million jobs across the country, despite only employing 80,000 people. Kensington released a new fingerprint scanner for PCs, priced at $50. The VeriMark sensor connects to a device via a USB port, and supports Windows Hello and FIDO. Toshiba's new Portégé X30 is a Windows 10 notebook that also supports Windows Hello biometric authentication, and promises enterprise-class security through a range of features, including TPM 2.0, BitLocker Drive Encryption, a Smart Card reader, and more, priced from $1,449. You don't need to spend a fortune to get Windows Hello support, though. The ASUS Transformer Mini is a 10.1-inch Windows 10 tablet that weighs just 790g with the keyboard attached, and has 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a kickstand similar to Microsoft's Surface tablets. The best bit is the price: it's now available in the US for just $249, including the keyboard and pen. Microsoft is offering some big discounts on its Surface products in the UK. All Surface Pro 4 models are now available with up to 19% off, while Surface Book i7 models (excluding those with the new Performance Base) can now be purchased with up to £665 off, along with free Bowers & Wilkins headphones worth £119.99. Microsoft also introduced its new Surface Arc Mouse, priced at $79.99, and available in three colors. Two of the Arc Mouse colors match those of the new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft unveiled on Tuesday at an education-focused event in New York City. Unlike previous Surface devices, the Laptop isn't attempting to define a new product category - beneath its (very!) pretty design, it's a surprisingly ordinary notebook, with its only truly distinguishing feature being the Alcantara fabric trim applied to its keyboard area. And while it has a touchscreen, and supports the Surface Pen, the display can't even be pushed back 180-degrees, so if you want to write on its screen, you'll have to do something like this: Here it is. RT @SurfaceProArt @thurrott From a reader at TabletPCReview forums. pic.twitter.com/1f8a71oNth — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) May 4, 2017 The Surface Laptop certainly has premium pricing to match its premium styling - the entry-level model, which has just 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, costs $999, or £979 in the UK. For unexplained reasons, the four color options are only available on one model - the Core i5 version with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD; but in the UK, and other markets, only the silver ("Platinum") color is offered across the entire range. And even though you could be paying up to $2,199 for the range-topping model, you'll still have limited connectivity options: you'll only get one USB 3.0 Type-A port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There's no microSD slot, and no USB-C support either, even though one of Microsoft's own promotional videos showed a Surface Laptop prototype with two USB Type-C ports. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the Surface Laptop to find out more. The Surface Laptop is also the first device to come with the new Windows 10 S edition, previously known as 'Windows 10 Cloud'. Windows 10 S only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store, offering more security on devices, and limiting the impact of malware and viruses. It should also deliver better battery performance, thanks to restrictions on background tasks and services for apps installed from the Store. It will also prevent users from changing the default browser (Edge) and search engine (Bing). Windows 10 S is primarily intended for the education market, but it still comes pre-installed on the Surface Laptop for consumers, although Microsoft is offering a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for those who buy the device until the end of the year. Anyone else who wants to upgrade a device that comes with Windows 10 S to the Pro edition will have to pay around $49 to do so. Since Windows 10 S devices can only run apps from the Windows Store, Microsoft also announced that its Office 365 desktop applications are also "coming soon" to the Store. Spotify is coming to the Windows Store as well - but as it will be a simple Desktop Bridge 'conversion' of its existing desktop app, it will only be available for Windows 10 PCs, and not for other devices like phones or the Xbox One. Cloud storage service MEGA will soon launch an app in the Windows Store too, built on Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform, and available on PCs and phones. By the way, Microsoft has another launch event coming up later this month. The company revealed on Thursday that it "will show the world what's next" at an event in Shanghai on May 23, where it's likely to unveil its new Surface Pro 5. Last weekend, Neowin exclusively revealed that Microsoft is planning to separate development of its Edge web browser from Windows 10 when it releases its next major update to the OS in September. The Windows 10 Creators Update, which is currently rolling out to consumers, is the most recent such update for the OS. This week, Microsoft detailed some of the improvements to Edge that that update includes for IT pros and enterprise admins. Meanwhile, Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains stagnant, while Chrome has increased its share to 63.45% since last month. Microsoft brought its Focused Inbox feature to Outlook 2016, making it available to all users in the Office 365 First Release program - a big step towards rolling it out for everyone. The company also released a new Outlook for Mac Insider Preview to the Fast ring, and finally added Outlook to its Office Insider Program on iOS. Microsoft Teams - the firm's "chat-based workspace" app for Office 365 - got a big update with some handy new features on iOS and Windows 10 Mobile. Last week, when Microsoft published its quarterly earnings report, I pointed out that its phone hardware business is now dead, with negligible revenue, and no new devices coming anytime soon. But Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman went even further this week, effectively declaring that the era of the smartphone is over: "The phone is already dead," he said. "People just haven't realized." Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella had a slightly different take on things, saying: "I'm sure we will make more phones, but they will not look like phones that are there today." Could he be referring to Westworld-style foldable phones? Well... we can dream - but it's probably best not to get your hopes up. Microsoft is continuing to work on Windows 10 Mobile in a separate 'feature2' branch, having split its development from the main Redstone 3 (RS3) branch a few weeks ago. It released a new Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15210, to the Fast ring on Wednesday. On the same day, Windows 10 build 16188 rolled out to PCs in the Fast ring from the RS3 branch, bringing a range of additions and improvements, including a new Cortana section in the Settings app, new Edge PDF Reader functionality, a better update experience, and more. The fixes and known issues for that build can be found here. It seems clear that Windows 10 development for PCs is currently proceeding at a far greater pace than for phones. Windows 10 has apparently reached a plateau on Valve's Steam gaming platform, after hitting an all-time high of 51.2% of gamers there last month. Valve announced an overhaul of its gifting system, and revealed a range of improvements to its customer support system. Xbox chief Phil Spencer said he believes that Microsoft's first-party studios should be "a beacon of innovation for how our platform is being used". He cited Gears of War 4 as an example of this, with its introduction of cross-play between Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs. Gears of War 4 got its latest update this week, with two new maps, multi-GPU support on Windows 10 PCs, and more. Microsoft added five more Xbox 360 games to its list of those playable on the Xbox One through its Backward Compatibility program. That list has been growing fast lately, and it won't be long before it reaches the next milestone of 400 titles. Nearly 11 years after the original game was released, the new Prey made its official debut on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. Nvidia's latest GeForce driver update includes optimizations for the game. Sony revealed that it will hold its media briefing at the E3 gaming expo on June 12. Expect to see plenty of exciting announcements there, including a ton of awesome new games. However, Oculus confirmed that it's giving E3 a miss this year - the first time the virtual reality firm will be absent from the show since 2014. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week with the beginning of a new journey across all of time and space. BBC iPlayer - which is exclusively available in the UK - will be streaming a special edition of this week's episode of Doctor Who, featuring immersive 3D binaural audio. But if you're not in the UK (or even if you are), you can enjoy a new Skype game bot developed by BBC Worldwide and Microsoft, in which you can help the Doctor to discover the pieces of the Key of Time, "an ancient and powerful artifact than could decide the fate of the universe". I've suddenly got a craving for some fish fingers and custard... Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Microsoft's spotlight was shining on its Surface Laptop this week, but the company also showcased a range of much more affordable PCs, some of which were priced as low as $229. Rich Woods took a closer look at some of those devices, which run Microsoft's new Windows 10 S edition. And Rich also got his paws on LeEco's new Le Pro 3, a flagship-class handset with a Snapdragon 821 processor, at a mid-range price point. Check out his unboxing video, including first impressions of the new device. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Sells $7 Billion in Bonds, Total Debt Now Over $100 Billion That's a lot of paper. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) May 5, 2017 at 6:10PM Just a couple months after conducting a bond offering in February, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is back to tap the capital markets once again. The last U.S. offering came in at $10 billion (it raised a modest $1 billion in Taiwan as well), and brought Apple's total debt to nearly $100 billion after including commercial paper, which is a short-term debt instrument often used for working capital purposes. After reporting earnings earlier this week, Apple filed a prospectus for another $7 billion offering. Here's how it priced out. Principal Fixed or Floating Rate Maturity $500 million Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 7 basis points 2020 $750 million Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 35 basis points 2022 $1 billion Fixed 1.8% 2020 $1 billion Fixed 2.3% 2022 $1.75 billion Fixed 2.85% 2024 $2 billion Fixed 3.2% 2027 Data source: Prospectus. While most of Apple's debt carries fixed coupon rates, it typically enters into interest rate swaps to effectively convert those to floaters. At the end of last quarter, Apple had $88.5 billion in term debt. Total debt including commercial paper was $98.5 billion. With this week's offering, total debt including commercial paper is approximately $105.5 billion. Apple Park, the company's new corporate headquarters. Image source: Apple. Wait, where'd all the money from the last offering go? At the end 2016, Apple's domestic cash position was $15.9 billion. At the end of the first quarter (before this most recent offering), that figure was $17.2 billion. So if Apple raised $10 billion in February, where'd all that cash go? Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. Share repurchases. Apple bought back roughly $7 billion worth of stock last quarter, consisting of $4 billion in open-market purchases and a fresh $3 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. ASR programs require a large upfront payment initially, before the investment bank completes the program in subsequent months. That's why Apple's domestic cash only increased by about $1.4 billion sequentially, despite raising $10 billion during the quarter. Bond offerings are becoming more frequent It's worth noting that the frequency of Apple's bond offerings is accelerating, and that trend isn't likely to let up anytime soon. The company now has about $60 billion of remaining authorization on its share repurchase program, but that figure will inevitably get updated in about a year. Meanwhile, domestic cash is at the low end of Apple's comfort level, which is usually around $15 billion. Every time domestic cash dips that low, it boosts it with debt. Over the past two years, Apple has repurchased on average $8.9 billion worth of stock per quarter, and with domestic cash running low, that begs the question of how much debt Apple will need to take out to keep funding the program. Winning favors with Trump? The ideal solution is the frequently discussed topic of repatriating some foreign cash. In the fall of last year, CEO Tim Cook said in a radio interview that Apple was actually already planning on repatriating several billion dollars as early as 2017, and that the company had "provisioned several billion dollars" to cover taxes. But that was before Donald Trump won the presidency, and since then Trump has talked an awful lot about a 10% repatriation tax. (The current repatriation tax rate is still 35%.) You can even see it scribbled on the whiteboard in this picture taken in Steve Bannon's office earlier this week. Separately, Apple just announced a plan to invest $1 billion in a fund intended to promote the creation of domestic manufacturing jobs, which is sure to win some political goodwill with our Tweeter in Chief. That puts Apple in a precarious position, since the uncertainty will lead to inaction. You don't choose to repatriate at 35% if there is a very real possibility of a 10% tax on the horizon. In the meantime, Apple may just need to keep selling paper as it waits for more visibility around the tax environment. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Car Wars Elon Musk Can’t Stop Throwing Shade at Apple Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Car Wars Elon Musk Can’t Stop Throwing Shade at Apple The billionaire doesn’t seem to think too highly of Tim Cook’s efforts to develop a self-driving car. by Maya KosoffMay 5, 2017 3:30 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Taylor Hill/Getty Images. Tesla, the electric-car company founded by Elon Musk, may be crushing Detroit and worth nearly $50 billion, but it’s hardly in the same league as Apple, the world’s most valuable public company. Still, that doesn’t mean that Musk is fazed by his bigger tech rival—and he’s decidedly unimpressed by its efforts to develop an autonomous vehicle. “I don't know what they're doing on the car front,” Musk said on an earnings call Wednesday when an investor asked whether he’d consider partnering with Apple on self-driving cars, or whether he sees the company as a competitor. “It's not clear.” But Musk, who admitted he owns an iPhone, did offer up some faint praise. “It's a cool company,” he added. “If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.” Twitter It’s not the first time Musk has taken a shot at Apple for encroaching on his territory. When he was asked in 2015 about Apple’s rumored plans for an electric car, his response was savage. “They have hired people we’ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard,’ ” he told German newspaper Handelsblatt. “If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.” “Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?” he asked. “No, seriously: It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches.” Musk may have reason to be tetchy. While Apple’s secretive self-driving car endeavor, code-named Project Titan, has reportedly been beset by obstacles—including a recent staff shakeup—C.E.O. Tim Cook also has nearly $250 billion in liquid assets at his disposal. That’s enough to buy up a number of its self-driving competitors if it chooses, including Tesla and all of Detroit. Indeed, Apple was previously rumored to be interested in outright purchasing a car company—like McLaren—and even approached Musk about the possibility of scooping up Tesla. (Musk said he wasn’t interested.) Luckily for Tesla, Apple now appears to have other plans. Under the direction of Bob Mansfield, who developed the iPad, the company is currently focusing its efforts on developing driverless car technology, as opposed to an actual driverless car. And Apple appears to be making progress. Last week, after getting clearance from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Bloomberg spotted an Apple self-driving car in the wild: a white Lexus RX450h S.U.V. decked out with commercially-bought sensors, driving around the streets of Silicon Valley. Tesla, meanwhile, seems set on eventually challenging Apple for the title of world’s most-valuable company. When a Barclays analyst asked Musk on Wednesday’s earnings call about a scenario he had previously outlined in which Tesla could achieve a $700 billion market cap—an amount he noted was in line with Apple’s valuation at the time—Musk gave an eyebrow-raising response. “Well, now I may want to preface this by, of course I could be completely delusional, but I think I see a clear path to that outcome,” he said. “The set of steps necessary to achieve that outcome seems pretty obvious. I am heavily involved in Tesla [getting] incredibly good at the machine that builds the machine, which involves, by the way, a tremendous amount of software.” Some investors seem less sure of Musk than he is of himself: though Tesla is nearing the value of General Motors, it had a loss of $675 million in 2016. By comparison, General Motors reported $9.4 billion in earnings. Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn said Wednesday that Tesla is “reminiscent of the March 2000 dotcom bubble.” Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

For the second year in a row, 100% of Apple’s tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (3TG) smelters and refiners are participating in independent third-party audits. Apple has also partnered with numerous NGOs to drive positive change on the ground, including Pact, who are working to provide essential health and safety training to artisanal mining and building programs to help children stay in school. In 2016, Apple trained more than 2.4 million workers on their rights as employees. Since 2008, over 2 million people have participated in Apple’s Supplier Employee Education and Development (SEED) program. It offers opportunities to earn higher education degrees, attend vocational training, and take classes in arts, finance and language skills.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple takes supplier clean energy program to Japan Ibiden’s products help bring together the integrated circuitry and chip packages in Apple devices. Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

In March, Apple replaced the iOS 10.3 update with iOS 10.3.1. The iOS 10.3.1 update delivers bug fixes and an important security patch but its also brought some annoying problems to many iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners. iOS 10.3.1 problems emerged on release day and complaints about the update’s performance have grown louder as we’ve moved into May. With those complaints in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about these iOS 10.3.1 problems. This roundup takes a look at the current state of problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It looks at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users are running into a number of frustrating iOS 10.3.1 problems. The list includes the usual suspects. iOS 10.3.1 users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID problems, 3D Touch issues, Hey Siri problems, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. We’re also hearing about UI lag on older devices, random reboots, issues with sound, and various problems with the App Store including broken downloads. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter continue to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 Sensing that iOS 10.3.1 may have introduced a few Bluetooth reliability issues. Anyone else? — Michael Firth (@TechFirth) April 10, 2017 iOS 10.3.1 is reallly bad on battery… — Mathieu L. (@mletourn) April 18, 2017 ios 10.3.1 destroys my battery life — Erzy Pratama F (@erzypratama) April 14, 2017 Is it just me or in iOS 10.3.1 bluetooth audio is flawed? The sound is interrupted briefly but it's ANNOYING! — Claudio Coletta (@ClarkColet) April 16, 2017 thanks for not letting wifi work ios 10.3.1 🙃 @AppleSupport — ✨ s t a r i o s a ✨™ (@dcheungsta) April 21, 2017 @AppleSupport Can't download any apps/updates from AppStore (iOS-Germany) on any device (wifi&cellular). (iOS 10.3.1) Known issues? — Jan Hambsch (@TeachHam) April 23, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. Where to Find Feedback As we push further away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into this ongoing iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also put together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update at the one month milestone. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5, and the iPad. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about the current version of iOS 10. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can’t Downgrade We’ve got some bad news for those of you dealing with iOS 10.3.1 problems. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1 which means you can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to improve your device’s performance. This is a permanent change and it means those of you who are experiencing iOS 10.3.1 problems are on your own. Apple’s next iOS update is probably a few weeks away. Those of you who haven’t made the move to iOS 10.3.1 yet should take note. Once you upgrade, there’s no going back to whatever version of iOS you’re on. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. It’ll help you prepare for next time. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. We’re currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 and we suspect an official release is close. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. You might even try the iOS 10.3.2 beta on your device. You can always drop back down to the iOS 10.3.1 update if you decide to install the beta on your phone. iOS 10.3.2 Release & Time: 5 Things to Expect & 4 Not To iOS 10.3.2 Release Date   1 / 9 Apple rarely announces iOS release dates ahead of time so its silence regarding the iOS 10.3.2 release date hasn't been surprising.  It's difficult to predict an exact release date but the beta and Apple's tendencies can help us narrow it down a bit for you.  Apple is currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 which means the company has released updates to beta testers. That's a lot for a small maintenance update like iOS 10.3.2 and it probably means we're getting close to the official roll out. The last maintenance update to go through a beta, iOS 10.2.1, saw four beta releases before it was released to the public.  Apple also tends to release new iOS software on Monday. This isn't guaranteed but the company's been pretty consistent lately.  At this point we'd be shocked if we made it out of May without a release. Look for iOS 10.3.2 to land on one of the four remaining Mondays (May 8th, May 15th, May 22nd, May 29th) in the month.    1 / 9 17 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/16/2017 B Reply Me too 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. 04/09/2017 Brooke Reply Updated to 10.3.1 last night and less than 12 hours later my 6 plus has died. Will not turn on and can get no response from it. 04/12/2017 Dot parnell Reply Since I downloaded 10.3 my Facebook does work – anyone know what I can do. 04/13/2017 W Stephen Wilson Reply The update destroyed my IMAP path functionality so I can no longer do email. 04/13/2017 Rosie Reply Ever since I purchase iPhone 7Plus I had nothing but problems. I uploaded the 10.3.1 on 4/11/2017 with the following problems: It’s stuck on the iCloud setup Delete email in Allmail and it creates a duplicate; therefore I have to delete the mail twice. Apple why don’t you hire some computer technology people that know what they’re doing. This will be costing you money and making you look inadequate to the world. 04/14/2017 David Pearcey Reply I tired to update but it messed up my iCloud authentication somehow. It goes into a password authorization loop and disabled my iMessage, FaceTime and Family services functions. The update actually failed during Verifying Update phase of the install. It didn’t install (probably a good thing), and after it failed I got the above mentioned issues. I called apple support and they couldn’t fix it.They upgraded my issue to the engineering department and I haven’t heard from them since. After waiting a couple of days I decided to try doing a full reset and restore on my iPad Air2 and it fixed the issue. I will not be installing 10.3.1 until I hear back from Apple. Very uncharacteristic instability coming from Apple these days :( 04/16/2017 Gourmetdrummer Reply iOS 10.3.1 slows down the search function in contacts if you have a large contact list. I tested this with less than 5,000 contacts and it worked fine, but when I loaded the full 12,000+ contacts it takes 3-4 minutes to pull up a searched contact. I then restored to my backup with the older software version and it worked fine. Is anyone else seeing this? 04/20/2017 Hee Reply I not sure is it whether is ios 10.3.1 problem or my package data problem. I can’t buff the video in instagram story and facebook video. IS that an issue about that? 04/24/2017 Billy Reply Another problem with 10.3.1 is that photos taken on an ipad cannot be uploaded directly from the ipad into other applications, such as ebay. You have to enlist the help of a desktop computer. 05/04/2017 Jason Reply Sad, my brother’s iPhone 6s home button is causing some issue. When pressed sometime it straight away goes to power off option (he is just tapping). 05/05/2017 KASH Reply after release update 10.3.1 we received huge amount of iphones 5s,6,6plus,6s WIFI disable AFTER UPDATE 10.3.1 iphone 6 x 6 pcs so far iphone 6 doesnt charge after update x 3 pcs so far iphone 6 plus doesnt turn on after update x 1 pcs so far iphone 6s wifi doesnt work after update x 1 so far iphone 6 battery issue after wifi x 4 pcs so far Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Engst We’re approaching another of those inflection points where Apple leaves some apps — and their users — behind. When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari.

Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying…..

By Emily Bary May 5, 2017 5:35 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple commanded a 15.9% share of the global wearables market in the first three months of the year, according to new research. Illustration: Spencer Platt/Getty Images The wearables market keeps growing, but Fitbit’s not reaping the gains. In fact, Apple overtook Fitbit as the top wearables vendor in the first quarter, research firm Strategy Analytics said Thursday. Apple doesn’t disclose sales numbers for Apple Watch, but Strategy Analytics estimates that the company shipped 3.5 million wearables during the quarter. That was good for 15.9% share of global industry shipments, the firm said. More from Barron’s Next Why Smartwatches Probably Can’t Save Fitbit Two Years with the Apple Watch: A Love/Hate Relationship The One Number That Shows Trouble At Verizon On Apple’s earnings call earlier this week, CEO Tim Cook said the watch is “already a big business and [we] believe over time it will be even larger.” Fitbit, meanwhile, fell to third place, behind Chinese company Xiaomi. Fitbit accounted for 13.2% of all wearables shipped globally during the first quarter, down from 24.7% a year ago, according to Strategy Analytics. In its earnings report Wednesday, Fitbit said it sold 3 million devices during the quarter. “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market,” Strategy Analytics director Cliff Raskind said in a press release. “Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment, and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Fitbit declined to comment on the report. The company pioneered and excelled in the basic activity tracking segment but it’s now expanding its focus to more advanced wearables, including a new smartwatch that’s in the works. Big Picture: Apple has taken over the No. 1 spot in the wearables market, according to a new market research report.

The new feature is especially useful for families with children, as each can have their own iCloud, iTunes, and App Store accounts, with their own passwords and preferences and purchasing capabilities that must be approved by the parent. However, one thing we ran into very early on with the new Family Sharing feature was that Apple didn’t appear to provide any means to convert an existing account into a child account. Let’s face it, until Family Sharing came along with its support for Children’s Accounts, the only way to create an Apple ID for a child under the age of 13 was to fudge the child’s birthday, and there are undoubtedly more than a few folks who took that approach just to make sure that their children could have their own parentally-supervised Apple IDs. Of course, it seems that Apple has been tacitly aware of this all along as well, and although there are no obvious support articles or other instructions to walk you through the process, Apple has provided a loophole by which you can “come clean” and convert your children’s “teenage” Apple IDs into proper “Children’s Accounts” without having to set up entirely new Apple IDs for them. To start the process, first ensure that your child’s Apple IDs has been added to Family Sharing, and then log in to your child’s Apple ID on the web at appleid.apple.com and edit their account information to enter their correct birthday. As soon as you enter a birthday that places them under 13 years of age, you’ll get a prompt alerting you that parental consent is required, that this process will convert the account into a “children’s account” and an e-mail request will be sent to the family organizer. Keep in mind that as the warning prompt suggests, this process is irreversible, and the account will be permanently converted to a children’s account until the child reaches 13, based on the new date of birth that you’ve entered. It’s also important to mention here that once you’ve completed this process, you won’t be able to change the date of birth without contacting Apple support, so double-check to make sure you’ve entered it correctly before continuing. Clicking “Continue” will send an email to the family organizer (which should be you in this scenario), although until it’s been approved, the request can still be cancelled. An e-mail should appear in your inbox shortly asking for your approval to update your child’s birthdate and change their account into a children’s account. Clicking the “Approve Request” button will take you to the Apple ID sign-in page in your web browser of choice, and once you’ve signed in you’ll be shown the birthday change (where you’ll have another chance to correct it if needed) and a Parent Privacy Disclosure and will need to confirm the change by entering the security code from whichever credit card is assigned to the primary payment method for your family; the payment verification method is more or less the same procedure required to set up a children’s account from scratch, as detailed in Apple’s knowledgeable article on Family Sharing and Apple ID for your child. Once you’ve approved the request, your child’s date of birth will be updated and their Apple ID will be irrevocably converted to a children’s account and associated with your family. Children’s accounts must be associated with a family until they’re 13 years of age, however Apple has provided a way to transfer children’s accounts between families should you ever need to do so.

But now there's one person who's going out on a limb and saying it could happen sooner. Much sooner. iPhone 8 concept. Credit: Martin HajekMore iPhone 8 concept. Credit: Martin Hajek In a note to investors on Wednesday (May 3), JP Morgan analysts said that there is a "high likelihood" of Apple announcing the iPhone 8 at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. According to 9to5Mac, which obtained a copy of the research note, the analysts believe Apple will use its stage at WWDC to showcase its new iPhone, and promise more information and updates later in the year. Over the last several months, rumors have been flying fast and furious that Apple is planning three new iPhones for this year. Two of them, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, will deliver minor upgrades over last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The third handset, believed to be known as the iPhone 8, could come with several upgrades, including an OLED screen, wireless charging, and an all-new, all-glass design. While some of the rumors disagree on features and what Apple might have planned, they have all agreed that the company won't unveil the handset until later this year. And it likely won't launch the iPhone 8 until the early fall, at the earliest. MORE: Leaked iPhone 8 Outsexes Galaxy S8 Exactly why Apple would unveil the iPhones at WWDC is unclear. While the company has released new hardware at the show in the past, it hasn't actually done so since 2010, when it showcased the iPhone 4. Since then, Apple has largely focused its show on software. Credit: Martin HajekMore Credit: Martin Hajek For their part, the JPMorgan analysts provided little insight into why they believe Apple might unveil the iPhones at WWDC, according to 9to5Mac. They did say, though, that Apple is anticipating weaker sales this summer, and might showcase what it has planned to ready widespread demand. In an earnings call this week, Apple said that iPhone sales slumped in the last quarter because of widespread reports on what it might have planned for a future iPhone. Whether that might alter its announcement schedule, however, is unclear. Still, this rumor makes Apple's WWDC keynote all the more interesting.

Increase / Decrease text size James Nunns   - Deputy Editor 5th May 2017 Add to favorites Apple may have around $220bn cash to spend according to Citigroup. Cash rich Apple could have around $220bn to splash on the likes of Netflix, Walt Disney, and Tesla. That’s according to Citigroup which listed seven companies as potential takeover targets for the iPhone manufacturer. The reason for this potential shopping spree is because Apple has over 90% of its cash sitting overseas and President Trump’s tax blueprint proposes that a multinational can bring in profits overseas at a tax rate of just 10%, rather than the standard 35%. This would mean that Apple’s $250bn overseas would still be $220bn when brought back. Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients: “Since one of the new administration’s top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use,” according to Reuters. In addition to the likes of Netflix and Disney, Apple could also choose from the likes of Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take Two Software, and Hulu. Read more: Biggest tech acquisition rumours in 2017 The companies were chosen due to fitting five criteria – strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets, and likely to impact on Apple’s share price. Anne de Kerckhove, CEO of Iron said: “With over 90 per cent of Apple’s cash sitting overseas, clearly acquisition activity is on the cards. “Tesla and Netflix are rumoured as the favourites but if this is the case, what does it really tell us about Apple’s investment strategy? Obviously, buying up companies that pose a threat to Apple’s constantly diversifying product line could, the tech giant will hope, neutralise the competition and pave the way for a smoother exploration into other technologies. “But Apple needs to consider companies that don’t have a billion dollar plus price tag. The cash might be there, but they need to look at longevity rather than simply current tech trends. What will their customers in 10, 20, 30 years want and need from them?” Analysts at RBC recently mused about the potential for Apple to acquire Disney but gave it a greater than 0% probability. However, if Apple were to buy Disney then it would create a media/tech juggernaut that would dominate numerous markets.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 100 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing. Bernhard Mähr Waiting since two years for a good 7" table with recent Android version.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Review Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 review: A great tablet, if you still need one Will Shanklin May 5, 2017 We review the Galaxy Tab S3, the best Android alternative to the iPad Pro (Credit: Will Shanklin/New Atlas) View gallery - 6 images Samsung's high-end tablet line took the year off in 2016, but the company recently dived back in with the Galaxy Tab S3. While it serves as a viable alternative to the 9.7-in iPad Pro, big-screen smartphones are getting better and better – posing the question (once again) of whether you need a tablet at all. Read on, as we review the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. As an owner of the iPad Pro 9.7, I found the Galaxy Tab S3 to be very familiar from the start. Compared to the iPad, the new Tab has nearly identical dimensions and is just a smidge lighter, they both have the same screen size (and 4:3 aspect ratio) and pixel resolution is even. If Apple's industry influence has waned some in recent years, it certainly hasn't faded completely. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW While the Tab S3 may not be forging much new ground, it does successfully play the part of the best Android alternative to Apple's best 9.7-in tablet. Apart from the possible exception of Google's tablet app selection, I can switch from one slate to the other without noticing a major drop-off one way or the other. One advantage the Tab S3 brings to the table, though, is that its stylus is included with the device. You get an S Pen in the box (just like the ones that ship with Galaxy Note smartphones), while the iPad's Apple Pencil rings up as a separate US$99 purchase. The Apple Pencil's build does look and feel higher-end, but unless you're using it to make art (Apple's has tilt sensitivity that allows shading), I wouldn't say the Pencil is worth $99 more than the Tab's S Pen. The Tab's display looks terrific, and its AMOLED screen offers richer colors and deeper blacks than the iPad's IPS screen. For the first time, Samsung brought its glass back/aluminum frame smartphone design language to the world of tablets. It sounds like an odd choice for a tablet, but feels smooth in hand. While we didn't dare drop test our review unit, the potential for greater breakability of glass may be something to consider if you're clumsy with your tablets and don't use cases. Speaking of cases, Samsung offers an optional keyboard case that's a big improvement over the one in 2015's Galaxy Tab S2. Not because of a much-different typing experience, but because the S3 tablet magnetically connects to the case. The combination of Galaxy Tab S2 and keyboard required snapping nubs into place: It was difficult to connect and could lead to a scratched device. No such worries with the S3 and its $130 keyboard. The keyboard unfortunately has a fixed screen angle, but it's the same situation on Apple's iPad Pro Smart Keyboard. Another minus in the keyboard's column is that the Tab's screen doesn't automatically turn off when you fold the keyboard cover over it. If you're considering the Galaxy Tab S3, the question isn't whether it's a high-quality tablet – it is – but whether you need a tablet at all. And if you do, whether you have any reason to pick it over Apple's similar (and identically-priced) offering in the iPad Pro 9.7. While large-screen smartphones have been eating into tablet sales for several years, the tablet's odds got a little worse recently with the release of the Galaxy S8, S8+ and LG G6 (and likely again late this year, with the rumored iPhone 8). They all have screens that span nearly the entire face of the phone, making bigger displays a reality for folks who don't want a device that feels like a Sherman tank in hand or pocket. While their size doesn't come anywhere close to that of a 9.7-in tablet, they can serve many of the same purposes – perhaps saving you an extra purchase and whittling your mobile device collection down by one. What about picking between the Tab S3 and iPad Pro 9.7? If you're platform agnostic, then I'd give the edge to the iPad – not because of hardware advantages, but because, in the tablet app department, the App Store is still a bit friendlier than the Play Store. If you own other Android devices, though, or just aren't a fan of Apple's hardware or ecosystem, the Galaxy Tab S3 is as an excellent alternative. The Galaxy Tab S3, a standout product in a waning category, costs $600 for 32 GB storage (expandable by microSD) and bundled stylus. It's available now.

Recode cites people familiar with the goings-on who say that they’re expecting the app to land on Apple’s TV set-top box this summer. As it stands now, Amazon subscribers have been limited to using Airplay to connect to Apple TV over WiFi. So why did the two tech giants decide to put aside their differences — at least on this front — after all these years? It’s unclear, but whatever it is, it likely involved CEOs Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos working something out, industry observers tell Recode. Back in 2015, Amazon announced it would no longer sell video-streaming devices from rivals Google and Apple that weren’t compatible with its Prime video service. As for whether that will change now that Apple and Amazon are simpatico, that remains to be seen.

A study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners said Apple grew its iPhone customer base in the U.S. to 136 million in the first quarter of 2017. However, the iPhone growth rates are slowing down compared to prior years. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group May 5, 2017 at 1:54 pm Top of the Order:   All About The Base: When Apple reported its second-quarter results on Tuesday, the company could point to several signs the company has recovered from a slightly disappointing 2016. Earnings and revenue rose from a year ago, and those figures also topped Wall Street analysts’ expectations. Shipments and sales of Mac computers were solid, and services and revenue from “other products” such as the Apple Watch also improved. And iPhone sales edged up by 1 percent from last year. However, the number of iPhone units sold actually declined by 1 percent from a year ago, leading some Apple watchers to wonder if the iPhone’s days of glory are behind it. Those sentiments were countered with the argument that many consumers could be holding out on buying new iPhones until they see what Apple has in store to mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone later this year. But there is more evidence that while the iPhone is still growing, that growth is occurring at a slower rate than in years past. A new study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) says that in the U.S., the iPhone could be reaching a saturation point. The CIRP study, which was released Friday, says the iPhone’s installed base in the U.S. reached 136 million phones at the end of the first quarter of this year. That was a gain of just 4 million phones, or 3 percent, over the 132 million iPhones in use at the end of 2016. The iPhone’s user base in the first quarter also rose 15 percent over the same period a year ago. By comparison, iPhones in use in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2016 rose 37 percent over the first quarter of 2015, according to CIRP. CIRP also said that much of the current iPhone installed base consists of phones released since 2014, when the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were released. And people who are buying iPhones are holding on to them for longer lengths of time before getting a new model. “Growth in the U.S. installed (base)  has slowed considerably in the past year,” said Mike Levin, partner and co-founder of CIRP, in a statement. “Many factors contribute to this, including the lengthening ownership cycle, a diminishing number of first-time buyers, and increased Android loyalty.” Levin said that while iPhone growth may be flattening out in the U.S., the size of the user base offers up an opportunity to set up services as its next major area of growth. “It makes sense that Apple has turned to services revenue as it seeks to monetize this stable base of customers.” But, with growth in Apple’s biggest market showing signs of cooling down, Levin said that the company is also facing the matter of how much it can grow in developing regions, and whether services will become the next big thing in Apple’s history of innovation. “The question remains, what is iPhone’s saturation level in less mature markets around the world,” Levin said. “And to what extent growing service revenue can compensate for flattening U.S. iPhone sales.” Middle Innings: Virtually Gone: So much for Oculus VR’s film studio. Oculus, which is owned by Facebook, said it will shut down the studio, two years after it got of the ground, and will shift its focus to content from outside producers. Driving In: Porsche Digital is coming to Silicon Valley in order to be closer to the area’s booming automotive-technology industry. Porsche said it will have 100 people in its Santa Clara office when it opens and begins working on digital and mobility technologies for cars. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Movin’ on Up: Zynga shares rose 12.7 percent, to close at $3.20 following upbeat reaction to the digital gaming company’s first-quarter results. Gains also came from Gigamon, Imperva, Coherent and Tesla. In the Red: Decliners included Ubiquiti Networks, Lending Club, Infinera, QuinStreet and Align Technology. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.4 percent to 6,100.76. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 percent to finish the week at 21,006.94. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose by 0.4 percent to finish at 2,399.29.

An ever-present figure at nearly all major Apple events since Steve Jobs made his return to the company, Schiller is perhaps best known to the more casual Apple observers for his “Can’t innovate any more, my ass!" remark while introducing the 2013 Mac Pro. The Senior Vice President Worldwide Marketing at Apple was in Bengaluru recently to inaugurate the company’s app accelerator facility in Bengaluru where he a spoke to group of Indian app makers that included CEOs of popular apps like Zomato and Practo, as well as developer of the indie app Avaz. “This [the app accelerator] is a unique new thing we haven't done anywhere else in the world," Schiller told the app makers. “We have created the idea of this app accelerator where developers like yourselves can come here in large number week-in and week-out and get help with whether it's design expertise and I think that's something Apple has a lot of knowledge on to share, as small as to be able to experiment and play with the technologies that we are working on." Later during the trip, Gadgets 360 got a chance to sit down with Schiller and pick his brains on a wide variety of topics, both developer- and consumer-focussed. Before you ask, yes, we did quiz Schiller on the state of neglect that the Mac Pro finds itself in, but just three days after our conversation, news broke that Apple is completely revamping the Mac Pro, so it made no sense to share that bit of our conversation. Here are excerpts of our conversation with Phil Schiller. Gadgets 360: With all the recent changes in the App Store, can developers expect to see upgrade pricing next? Phill Schiller: The reason we haven’t done it is that it's much more complex than people know, and that's okay, it's our job to think about complex problems, but the App Store has reached so many successful milestones without it because the business model makes sense to customers. And the upgrade model, which I know very well from my days of running many large software programmes, is a model from the shrink-wrapped software days that for some developers is still very important, for most, it’s not really a part of the future we are going. I think for many developers, subscription model is a better way to, go than try to come up with a list of features, and different pricing for upgrade, versus for new customers. I am not saying it doesn't have value for some developers but for most it doesn’t, so that's the challenge. And if you look at the App Store it would take a lot of engineering to do that and so would be at the expense of other features we can deliver. For example, the App Store has one price for an app, when you see it, you see if there's a price on it, that's the price. It doesn't have multiple prices for multiple tiers of customers so to engineer that in, it's not impossible, but a lot of work for a small segment of software that we hope for many of them, subscription pricing is a better model, the one where the customers are comfortable with. So we’ll keep talking to developers about what's most important on their list, we want them to keep telling is if that [upgrade pricing] is high on the list or not, and we’ll keep an open mind to it, but it's harder than people realise. Gadgets 360: Personally, what are your thoughts on devices like Google Home and Amazon’s Echo? Phill Schiller: Well, I won't talk to either one specifically, [I] don't want to. My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all. So, instead, let’s abstract the conversation just briefly to some of the general concepts and talk about those, because it's really interesting. First of all, there is a lot of talk in the industry about voice-driven assistants and we believe deeply in voice-driven assistants that's why invest in Siri, but there is interest in a voice-only assistant, where there is no screen, and we think it's important to that there are times when it's convenient to simply use your voice when you are not able to use the screen. For example, if you're driving [and] you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing. Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to - you don’t have to walk over and back [and you can use Siri instead]. So there's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations. For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do. Or, for example, with photography, and one of the most popular reasons for our products is photography now, and photography requires a screen. So the idea of a device without a screen, well it’s not really useful for that whole category of photos that we all share. and all the social networking apps that are now embracing photos more and more, well, it doesn't work really so great in voice-only assistants. Or the biggest category of all of apps is games, and I have yet to see any voice-only games that, for me, are nearly as fun as the one that I play on my screen. And so I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful, their intelligence is going to grow, they’re gonna do more for us, but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this. Gadgets 360: But I don't think anyone is suggesting that they are going to replace our phones, right, so is that a fair comparison? Phill Schiller: With billions of people, there’s somebody always suggesting something everywhere [laughs], but there is an interesting question about role of voice-only products in comparison to the products that have voice, and screen, and touch, and I think that's an interesting discussion about when is each appropriate, and what can they do in our lives. I think that's interesting. Apple Siri Speaker Tipped to Launch at WWDC, Will Take on Amazon Echo Gadgets 360: How has the response to Swift been so far? Phill Schiller: First of all, Swift is going incredibly well, better than what we imagined when we first started working on it. It has got incredible adoption, it has got incredible adaptability, from school children to the biggest developers in the world [..] I don’t think we’ve seen this before - a brand new language designed around mobile products to help us make better code for all the uses we see with apps, this is a unique new thing and, I have seen in some stats, [it’s] the fastest growing language in the world. So we are really excited about that. We are continuing to evolve [Swift], as you say, we were very upfront about it from the beginning that we knew we would learn a lot in the first versions of Swift, and we have been [learning]. So developers are aware of that and we’ve been very transparent about that, and there will be a lot more about that at our upcoming developer conference, so for the remaining part of your question about what’s coming with Swift, there’s a lot to come, stay tuned for news on that. The other thing that I just bring up with Swift is there's been a lot of excitement around the new Swift Playgrounds that we've put there out for iPad that allows children in school to learn to code in a fun and entertaining way but it's real coding. I think this is phenomenal. The idea that school children at elementary school ages can begin to learn about programming I think that is incredibly important. When we grew up, I grew up - and I’m much older than many of you - it was mandatory to learn a foreign language in school because it's useful in general and it exercises part of your brain that wouldn't otherwise be exercised, and makes you more likely to learn other languages in the future because you’ve really learned that process. I think today it's even more important that school children learn a programming language, as much we used to have to learn a foreign language. Because not that everyone will grow up to become a programmer, but that everyone can understand the concepts of programming, because software is gonna be a part of everyone's life no matter what your job, whether you're a software developer or you work with software developers understanding that is going to help every child get a job at some point in their life. In addition, if you start at a younger age like in elementary school, there are lot of students that by the time they get to high school with peer pressure they might decide that they don't want to become a programmer. Before they know whether that's actually something they are very passionate about. So if you can teach children [a] little bit about programming and get them excited about the concept of creating software, before social pressures discourage some [kids], then people would discover love for something early enough that they can explore that on their own. And I think through a process like that, we’ll get a larger diversity of people who are going into programming whether male or female, [irrespective of] their ethnic background, their economic background, they can discover this passion on their own, while they are still very young. I think that's a really important thing in society to enable. Disclosure: Apple sponsored the correspondent's flights and hotel for the trip to Bengaluru.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Champion mentality: Apple Valley cancer survivor works to inspire others Friday May 5, 2017 at 3:16 PM May 5, 2017 at 3:16 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Tears streamed down a sea of faces as cancer survivor Tasha Champion shared her story of battling the disease that has affected most of her family. Champion spoke to those gathered at Relay for Life Victorville just before she and her family held the “Survivors — Celebrating Life” banner and led the procession of walkers through the Victor Valley College campus on April 29. “It was such an honor to speak at my first Relay for Life,” said Champion, 37, a life coach who lives in Apple Valley. “It was an overwhelming feeling of honor and love, and something I can barely put into words.” Champion, a single mother of four who battled breast cancer, said she was diagnosed with the disease after she was tested for the breast cancer “susceptibility” gene about two years ago. The testing came as a precaution after her mother and several members of her family were diagnosed with the same disease over the last two decades. “Most people know it as the Angelina Jolie gene because she was diagnosed with the hereditary gene,” Champion said. “My mother was tested for the gene and she was positive — that led me and my three sisters to be tested, and we all tested positive.” Calling it a “hard decision,” Champion elected to have a double mastectomy and have her “female reproductive system” totally removed. She said she chose the surgical route because she did not want her children to see her struggle like their grandmother, Priscilla Smith. During their mastectomies, doctors found a cancerous tumor in Champion and her older sister, something a mammogram hadn’t detected six months earlier. Champion said she’s grateful that the “aggressive cancer” was caught in time. “The cancer had already spread to my sister’s lymph nodes, but it hadn’t spread in me,” said Champion, who eventually endured several intense rounds of chemotherapy that ravaged her body. “My children became my caregivers, my doctors, my voice and my media as they let others know how I was doing,” Champion said. “Without them, I could never have gotten through it. My kids are truly my champions.” Champion created an online outlet, www.letterstocancer.com, for her kids and others to express their feeling about the disease that has struck many families. “I hope by them sharing their feelings, it gives others, especially children, the power to heal,” Champion said. “Many have survived this battle and others have gained their wings. No matter which side you are on, none of us battle alone.” Champion said the only thing that made her “break down” during her medical ordeal was the “courage and love” her children displayed with they carried their mother to bed after she had collapsed. Two years after her surgeries, Champion said she’s back to work and has found a new purpose, which includes inspiring women and those affected by cancer. “My goal is to make sure women have their checkups, that they know their family’s medical history, that they understand their bodies and aren’t afraid to go to the doctor,” Champion said. “I lost one cousin because she waited too long to see the doctor because she was afraid.” Champion said it’s important for women not to “face cancer alone,” but to find a support system made of people who will “love, pray, talk, encourage and laugh” with them through their battle. “There’s never a good time to get cancer, but my struggle woke me up to greater and beautiful things,” Champion said. “This whole ordeal has taught me to slow down and to appreciate everything, like the flowers, the sun, the mountain and even the dry desert.” Champion said she looks forward to visiting Relay for Life Hesperia, which is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Saturday at Civic Plaza Park, 9700 Seventh Ave. “My cancer has been a bigger blessing than it’s been a heartache,” Champion said. “It’s given me strength and the opportunity to inspire woman in the High Desert and around the world.” For more information on Tasha Champion or cancer support, visit www.tashachampion.com or www.hdcancersupport.com.

Research firm Strategy Analytics said late Thursday that Apple claimed the No. 1 spot in the first quarter with a 15.9% market share. China's Xiaomi, which makes low-cost fitness bands, grabbed the No. 2 spot with a 15.5% market share. Activity-tracker maker Fitbit came in third with a 13.2% market share. Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple shipped 3.5 million smartwatches in the first quarter, up 59% year over year. Meanwhile, Xiaomi's wearables shipments fell 11% to 3.4 million units and Fitbit's device shipments tumbled 36% to 2.9 million units as it dealt with an inventory glut. In last year's first quarter, Fitbit led the global wearables market with a 24.7% share, followed by Xiaomi with 20.9% and Apple with 12.1%. Shipments into the sales channel are different from sales through to consumers. Wall Street analysts estimate that Apple sold about 2.8 million Apple Watch units in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1. Apple doesn't disclose Apple Watch sales figures. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday that Apple Watch sales in fiscal Q2 "nearly doubled year over year." Meanwhile, Fitbit announced Wednesday that its sold 3 million devices in the first quarter. Fitbit CEO James Park said underlying demand was stronger than the company's Q1 results showed because Fitbit is working to reduce channel-inventory levels. Fitbit is working on a smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch. It's expected to be released later this year. Fitbit's current product lineup ranges from basic activity trackers to more advanced fitness bands that track heart rate. It also offers two fitness watches: Fitbit Surge and Fitbit Blaze. IBD'S TAKE: Apple remains firmly atop IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products Group with a Composite Rating of 89. Fitbit? Not so much. In the Consumer Products-Electronics category, Fitbit has a near rock-bottom rating of 2. See more on Apple in its Stock Checkup page. On Monday, Yahoo Finance posted images purporting to show Fitbit's first "proper" smartwatch along with Bluetooth wireless earbuds that will pair with the device. The Fitbit smartwatch is said to have built-in GPS, a heart-rate monitor and support for mobile payments. It also will be able to store music from Pandora (P) for wireless streaming to the Bluetooth headset, Yahoo Finance said. The Fitbit smartwatch was originally scheduled for release this spring, but was pushed back to the fall because of manufacturing hiccups, the article said. It is rumored to cost about $300. The Bluetooth earbuds are likely to cost about $150, it said. The new smartwatch is likely to leverage the assets that Fitbit acquired last year from the defunct Pebble for $23 million. Fitbit also disclosed earlier this year that it bought another smartwatch company, Vector Watch, for $15 million. Meanwhile, Apple is preparing to launch its third-generation Apple Watch, probably called Series 3, later this year, 9to5Mac reported last month. The new Apple Watch is likely to sport performance and battery-life improvements, the website said. Apple also could come out with an LTE wireless version of the Apple Watch, which would allow the device to have a data connection without needing to be paired with an iPhone. Apple shares rose 1.7% to 148.96, hitting a record high after falling slightly in the prior two sessions. Fitbit slid 3.45% to 6.15.

She also fancies herself a bit of a rock star in her town and spends too much time reading comic books.  If she's not typing away at her keyboard, you can probably find her at Disneyland or watching Star Wars (or both). Malware for Mac is on the rise. Be aware of a possible attack disguised as an Adobe Flash installer. A decade-old Windows malware trojan wormed its way into the macOS ecosystem, complete with a signed (likely stolen) Apple developer certificate. The exploit appears as an Adobe Flash Player installer. Once permission is granted, it hides itself deep inside macOS folders. Its certificate has already been revoked by Apple, but it's good to be aware of your enemies. According to Fox-IT, Snake, a malware framework that has been infecting Windows software since 2008, and more recently Linux, is now targeting Mac. Now, Fox-IT has identified a version of Snake targeting Mac OS X. As this version contains debug functionalities and was signed on February 21st, 2017 it is likely that the OS X version of Snake is not yet operational. Fox-IT expects that the attackers using Snake will soon use the Mac OS X variant on targets. Snakes are dangerous and here's why Similar to the Dok trojan that we heard about earlier this week, Snake popped up with an authenticated developer certificate, which means the Mac's built-in security system, Gatekeeper, would consider it legit and allow the installation process to complete. It's important to note that Apple has already revoked this fake or stolen developer certificate, so Gatekeeper will block it. However, there is still a slight chance of someone downloading Snake by accident if they've found it through dubious channels. Malwarebytes explains: Fortunately, Apple revoked the certificate very quickly, so this particular installer is no further danger unless the user is tricked into downloading it via a method that doesn't mark it with a quarantine flag (such as via most torrent apps). How Snake slithers into your Mac Just like most malware attacks, Snake doesn't just magically appear on your Mac one day. There isn't someone shooting corrupted files through your ethernet cable directly into your software. Snake has to be welcomed into your operating system by you. Think of it is a vampire. If you don't invite it into your home, it can't attack you. The file, named Install Adobe Flash Player.app.zip, will appear to be an Adobe Flash installer (Say what you will about Flash, but there are still a lot of people that have to use it for school or work). From Malwarebytes: If the app is opened, it will immediately ask for an admin user password, which is typical behavior for a real Flash installer. If such a password is provided, the behavior continues to be consistent with the real thing. Interestingly, once the installation is complete, Flash is actually installed on the Mac, making it even more difficult to tell that it's a trojan. How you can protect yourself against Snake As noted above, the fake/stolen developer certificate that allowed Snake to get a pass from Gatekeeper has already been revoked, so it's likely that, even if you download the zip file and try to open the app, your built-in security program will say, "Nope Dope!" But to refresh best practices, if you receive an email with an attachment at all, do some due diligence to make sure it's from a legitimate source. Check the sender address to make sure it is from an address you recognize. Click on the sender's name to view the email address it was sent from to make sure it's not a spoofed email. If you're still unsure, confirm with the sender by texting, calling or sending a separate email asking if the attachment is legit. Specific to the Snake trojan, avoid downloading any zip files with the name Install Adobe Flash Player.app.zip. What to do if Snake already bit you Do you like my snake puns? If you think you might have managed to accidentally install the Snake trojan onto your Mac, you can find and delete the following files: /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.adobe.update.plist /Library/Scripts/installd.sh /Library/Scripts/queue /var/tmp/.ur-* /tmp/.gdm-socket /tmp/.gdm-selinux Next, delete the stolen/fake signed Apple Developer certificate. Launch Finder. Select Applications. Open your Utilities folder. Double-click on Keychain Access. Select the certificate named Adobe Flash Player installer with the signed certificate issued to Addy Symonds. Right or Control + click on the Certificate. Select Delete Certificate from the drop down options. Select Delete to confirm that you want to delete the certificate. Lastly, change your administrator password to ensure that you're backdoor is rekeyed so the hackers can't get back in. Remember best practices for staying safe It is unlikely, at this point, that Snake will slither through your Mac's backdoor. For one, Apple has revoked the certificate, which makes it nearly impossible to make it through the installation process without you knowing about it. To reiterate, don't open attachments from unknown sources. Double check the sender email address to make sure it is not spoofed. Don't open suspicious-looking files or give administrator permission to unknown programs. You can protect yourself from attacks if you stay safe. If you do end up with malware on your Mac, take a moment to relax and know that everything will be O.K. You can remove malware on your own, but if it seems too difficult for you to tackle, you can talk to Apple support. Someone will be able to help you.

Even Adobe always warned people to only download flash from there site and not others no matter the warnings 0 8 hours ago Reply Emeroid This. The same as every other software vendor. Guess what, when I download OSX from a site other than Apple there’s a chance it’s full of even more holes than this fake flash. 0 1 sec ago Reply cuttheredwire If you need Flash, fire up Chrome. When you're done with flash, switch back to Safari. Never install Flash. Don't use Chrome more than you have to.

Straight Talk offers cheap monthly plans with plenty of minutes, texting and 4G LTE data. It is a very attractive option for users who want the new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus but need a lower monthly bill. With the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus buyers pay the full price for the new iPhone, but the cheaper monthly plan prices still lead to savings over traditional carriers. A Straight Talk iPhone 6 sounds like a great deal, but there are things that buyers need to know before signing up and paying $650 for a new iPhone. You can bring your current iPhone to Straight Talk, or you can now buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 direct from the carrier or at Walmart. What you need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before you buy. A Straight Talk iPhone plan starts at $45 a month and $60 a month for international calling. For the lower price there are some trade-offs that you need to be aware of before you buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6. This is a pre-paid carrier, but you can set up an auto-pay plan so you aren’t always entering in codes and remembering a monthly payment. You’ll need to compare a variety of plans to make sure you are getting a deal, but for the same $45 a month you get vastly less data and need to pay for the phone each month on Verizon or $60 a month for just 1GB of data. Here are 7 facts buyers need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before buying the new iPhone on this popular pre-paid carrier. Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus The great news is that you can buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 or Straight Talk iPhone 6 Plus. Normally we see some limitations on other carriers, but Apple is letting anyone get in on the iPhone 6 Plus demand. All of these details apply to both of the new iPhones. Read: iPhone 6 Plus Review The Straight Talk iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 6 Plus a 5.5-inch display. The iPhone 6 Plus features a higher resolution 1080P display and a camera with optical image stabilization. Both new iPhones use an Apple A8 processor, come with many sensors and an all metal design. 16GB Only, But All Color Options There is no 64GB Straight Talk iPhone 6 available. Like Walmart, the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are only available with the lowest amount of storage. Although a 16GB iPhone 6 is enough for some users, there are good reasons not to buy the 16GB iPhone 6. Straight Talk offers all colors, but only 16GB options. On the upside, you can buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in all three colors. This includes gold, solver and space gray. Here’s help deciding which iPhone 6 color to buy. 4G LTE Data for the Straight Talk iPhone 6 Straight Talk started offering 4G LTE data last year, which means consumers can enjoy the same speeds as on major carriers. This is key to a good iPhone 6 experience, since many apps and services assume you are using a fast connection. Watch the iPhone 6 speed test in the video below. Same Network as Major Carriers As the iPhone 6 speed test video shows, 4G LTE speeds and coverage vary between carriers. The good news about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 is that it connects to the same networks as the big names in wireless. Straight Talk does not list the specific networks but it is very likely that the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus purchased from Walmart will run on AT&T. There is a chance it will run on Verizon, but it is less likely. Here’s a look at Straight Talk coverage. Unlimited Data With a Catch When you look at the Straight Talk iPhone 6 plans you’ll see unlimited data listed, but it isn’t unlimited. Despite the need for an asterisk, Straight Talk is more up front than in earlier years. You aren’t cut off after a set amount, but your data is slowed down after you use 3GB of high-speed data in a 30 day period. You’ll still connect, but it will likely be at slower 3G speeds. At the end of the 30 day period you’ll get your high-speed data back. Straight Talk still reserves the right to cancel your line if you use too much data, but the new terms better explain limits and use. Customer Support isn’t Up to Big Names The last time Gotta Be Mobile used Straight Talk and needed support, we ended up bounced between Straight Talk and Tracfone with no real resolution to our problem. Friends and family who switched to Straight Talk and brought their own iPhones found little help when data connectivity failed, despite a simple software solution. You may receive good support, but there is not the same store and support agent availability as with the bigger carriers, so keep that in mind. No Tethering There is no support for tethering or personal hotspots with Straight Talk. That means you can’t use the new Instant Hotspot between your Straight Talk iPhone 6 and Mac running OS X Yosemite. No hotspot or tethering options on the Straight Talk iPhone 6. In fact you can’t use any type of hotspot or Internet Sharing. It is not included in any plans and if you are eventually able to use an iPhone 6 jailbreak to do this, you risk cancellation by Straight Talk. 23 Responses 10/30/2014 Alex Reply What’s wrong with this picture? 10/30/2014 Randal Reply Check out this line of iPhone compatible projectors, display your pictures, iTunes content, and any other apps while on the go with one of these PICO projectors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjECbaLd_ac&list=UUAgQDzRklgm9Ku7EVkqBbHA 11/16/2014 Amina Reply Is there a trade in option with straight talk? Like if I have iphone 5 and I want 6, can I trade in and top up for iPhone 6? We really need that with straight talk. 03/05/2015 Crystal Reply How do you change the apn settings for the iPhone 6 to get the LTE to work? 05/22/2015 Brittany Reply They have videos on YouTube that show you 06/10/2015 Casey Reply Great article however I wish there was some kind of wrap up.

She has been without work for eight months but last month her income was $21480 just working on the laptop for a few hours. view it now>>>>> Get More 09/09/2015 Olivia Reply @Joserblack, Your buddy’s mother-in-law makes $63/hr, and $21480/mth, last month (from posting) was July. There are 31 days in July, which means your buddy’s mother-in-law would have worked $21480/$63=341hrs, or 341/31=11hrs/day. 11*7=77hrs/wk. I mean, if I was making $63/hr, I’d probably be working 77hrs/wk too, because I’d be making $258k but I don’t think that 77hrs/wk is classified as “a few hours”. 10/20/2015 D Reply Straight Talk customer service is worse than horrible 11/27/2015 J Reply Why do you need customer service? 12/07/2015 A Reply I bought the iPhone 6s and have had a horrible month of the internet working when it wants to 12/18/2015 Stacy Snider Reply I paid a lot for the 5c iPhone in March & half the time or more the Internet doesn’t work, if I hadn’t spent so much for the phone I wouldn’t be as upset as I am.

Photo by iphonedigital (some rights reserved) The comments were framed as being an example of how Apple is creating/supporting US jobs, it should be noted, but it’s hard to take that angle too seriously considering that “advanced manufacturing” more or less means “less work for humans.” Presumably, the news is related to the company’s self-driving vehicle plans, but who can say for sure at this point? The Apple CEO made the comments in an interview with CNBC, where he also revealed that the first investment related to the new fund would be announced sometime in May. He also made comments about programs to teach people to write code. “The announcements were the latest in a series of disclosures to highlight how Apple, the world’s largest company by market valuation, contributes to job creation in the United States. Apple came under fire from President Donald Trump during his campaign because it makes most of its products in China,” Reuters notes. Going on: “In February during the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Cook said Apple spent $50 billion in 2016 with its US suppliers, which include firms like 3M Co and Corning Inc, the first time Apple has disclosed the metric. “Cook reiterated that point during the CNBC interview, along with Apple’s claim that it has created 2 million jobs in the United States, 80,000 of which are directly at Apple and the rest coming from suppliers and software developers for the company’s app ecosystem. “Apple is highlighting its US presence at the same time lawmakers consider a major tax proposal by Trump that would let Apple, along with other large companies, bring back accumulated profits from overseas at potentially lower tax rates. 93% percent of Apple’s $256.8 billion cash is held overseas.” Interestingly, Cook alluded to the fact that, if this tax proposal goes through, the cash for the new $1 billion investment fund could come from that … otherwise the company will “have to borrow,” Cook stated.

Engst We’re approaching another of those inflection points where Apple leaves some apps — and their users — behind. When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader too, but only TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps. If you are a TidBITS member, access the full-text feed by logging in and clicking the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use. Happily, you can easily replace it with any RSS reader, including Apple’s built-in News app. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Atkinson  2017-05-05 11:04 I appear to be one of the 50 daily users and have appreciated having a one-stop shop for TidBits content. Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work?

Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me.

Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver.

The evidence is piling up: Blue light from phone and computer screens could make it harder for you to fall asleep.  Apple and Microsoft have tackled this issue by baking new features into their operating systems. You can now turn on nighttime settings to filter out the blue tones that trigger the nervous system to become more wakeful, interfering with sleep for people who use the devices before going to bed. The science behind these features is convincing, according  to James Stringham, a psychology researcher at the University of Georgia. “There’s a plausible rationale for blue light filters to work," he says. "Fundamentally, if you reduce blue light with a yellowish filter, that certainly would help.” Insomnia is a problem in need of solutions. In a Consumer Reports survey, 27 percent of U.S. adults said they had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep most nights, and 68 percent—or an estimated 164 million Americans—struggled with sleep at least once a week.  Using 'Night Shift' on Your iPhone or iPad Settings > Display & Brightness > Night Shift Apple introduced Night Shift last year, a feature that allows you to adjust the color of your screen based on the time of day. Any iPhone or iPad running iOS 9.3 or later automatically enables this feature.  In the Display & Brightness section of the Settings menu, you can set Night Shift to start and end automatically, either by specifying hours or by clicking on Sunset to Sunrise. You can also adjust the intensity of the "color temperature" in this menu, sliding a control toward "more warm" for less blue light to "less warm" for more blue light. To turn Night Shift on or off manually, go to the Control Center, which you access by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.  Using 'Night Light' on Your PC Start Menu > Settings (or Gear Icon) > System > Display > Night Light Microsoft included its blue light filter, Night Light, in the Windows 10 Creators Update released a few weeks ago. As with Apple’s Night Shift, you can schedule this function to automatically turn on and off at sunset and sunrise. If you're an early riser, you can set your own schedules here, too. Or you can toggle the feature on and off manually. You can customize the intensity of the color shift by moving a slider. Move it to the left to make the display appear more red (with less blue light); move to the right to reduce the effect. Note: If the slider is grayed out, you might have to update your display's driver. Using 'Night Shift' on Your Mac Apple Menu > System Preferences > Displays > Night Shift Apple added Night Shift to computers with the macOS Sierra 10.12.4 update earlier this year. It works the same way as the iPhone version. You can schedule when you want the function to start and adjust the intensity of the color temperature change. You can also turn Night Shift on or off manually by using the Notification Center on your desktop, either by clicking the icon on the top right corner of the screen or by doing a two-finger swipe on your trackpad or Magic Mouse.  Other Steps to Take "It's more than just the blue light that's keeping you awake" when you're using a phone or laptop at bedtime, Stringham says. "If you're working, obviously you're engaged in something." Social media feeds and videos of kittens doing cute stuff are stimuli that tend to keep people awake and clicking.  Standard bedtime advice applies whether you have a blue light filter or not: Set a schedule, avoid caffeine at night, create a comfortable sleeping arrangement, and, of course, avoid any electronics before bed (that includes TV). All of these steps will be conducive to a good night's rest.

Amazon’s Prime Video app is notably not available for Apple TV, which is a casualty of both companies’ desires to be the go-to video streaming service for customers. A new rumor claims that this could be changing soon, as Apple and Amazon have apparently put their differences aside. Recode has heard that Apple and Amazon could soon bury the hatchet, with Prime Video finally appearing on Apple TV. That’s according to sources close to the deal who say that the two companies have hammered out an agreement. Talks between the two companies could have even reached the point of a one-on-one between Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Regardless of who was on each side of the handshake, the sources Recode spoke to say that Amazon Prime Video could appear on Apple TV as soon as the third quarter of this year. This would be a very exciting development for Amazon Prime subscribers who own an Apple TV, since it would mean that they no longer need to rely on streaming video over an AirPlay connection. Of course, the number of Amazon Prime subscribers who own an Apple TV might be fairly slim, as Amazon doesn’t offer Apple TV boxes through its store. Bezos has said that the reason why Amazon doesn’t offer Apple TVs is because the device doesn’t support the Prime Video app. If Apple decides to let a Prime Video app for Apple TV go live, perhaps Amazon will change its tune? It certainly wouldn’t be shocking to see Apple TV land on Amazon’s storefront if Apple begins allowing Prime Video through. Neither company has commented on these rumors, but if they’re true, we should see some official development sometime within the next few months. Stay tuned.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 100 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Universal Display Offers Vague Possible Clues About the OLED iPhone Will OLED panels be a bottleneck for the next flagship iPhone? Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) May 5, 2017 at 2:58PM Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) reported first-quarter results last night, and shares have promptly soared to new all-time highs today. Fellow Fool Steve Symington breaks down the headline numbers here, but the short version is the results were strong. Among other bullish signs, the company boosted full-year 2017 guidance by about $30 million at the midpoint. Date Provided 2017 Revenue Guidance May 4, 2017 $260 million to $280 million Feb. 23, 2017  $230 million to $250 million Data source: SEC filings. Of course, easily the biggest potential catalyst for this year is the prospect of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) releasing an OLED iPhone. Like most Apple suppliers, particularly the smaller ones, Universal Display is undoubtedly bound by a slew of non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, so the company can't say much about the iPhone maker possibly adopting OLED display technology for the first time. OLED emitter materials. Image source: Universal Display. Still, there were some vague hints in the conference call. (These are excerpts instead of full quotations with all emphasis added.) Reading between the lines CEO Steven Abramson started off with prepared remarks: We continue to be encouraged by the growing customer discussions and pipeline activity that we are seeing in the OLED display and lighting markets. Since our last earnings call, the OLED landscape continues to expand from new product launches, new investments and robust amount of OEM design activity. ... We're also growing our business to capture the tremendous market opportunities before us, consisting of new materials and technology, new customer agreements and new OLED commercial products, all of which we believe will contribute to our growth in the coming years. ... We are expanding our customer collaborations, significantly stepping up our R&D efforts, increasing our technical field capabilities and fortifying our product development engine.  Goldman analyst Brian Lee tried to pry out some clues, asking, "So curious how you're thinking about potential upside drivers from here moving through the year, or if you would temper that type of analysis with a view that maybe the cadence for this year, first half versus second half will be very abnormal versus what you typically see." Apple launches iPhones in the fall and that could contribute to a back-loaded year, which is what Lee is getting at here. However, CFO Sid Rosenblatt skillfully dodged that part of the question, reiterating that OLED trends are very bumpy and it's hard to make granular forecasts on a quarterly basis, which is why Universal Display only provides full-year outlook: Thanks, Brian. And I clearly expected that question, to be honest, and it is a good one. We believe that it's still early in the OLED multi-year capex cycle and how it plays out quarter-to-quarter. It is not always predictable. Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini asked about manufacturing capacity going forward: "You, recently, a couple of months ago, changed your contract manufacturing with PPG. And given the traction you have seen so far in the year and what you would expect over the next 12 to 18 months, do you foresee going back to PPG and actually increasing the minimum capacity or modifying it, given the strongest start to the year?" Rosenblatt again: "But we're always looking at our capacity. We believe even with the increase, because we expected a significant increase this year, we have enough capacity in place today, and then with this new capacity to meet our needs for the foreseeable future." Gabelli analyst Hendi Susanto asked about the rest of the year: And then Sid, the new revenue guidance is $30 million higher. How much incremental guidance is attributed to the strong Q1 result? And how much is for your stronger expectation for the remaining of the year? Rosenblatt noted that it's all tied to ramping capacity: Our capacity, our revenue guidance is really fueled by what we sell, and that's based upon running capacity. We expect to see new capacity coming on in the second half and the first half of next year and the second half. And it really depends how quickly these are then turned on, actually producing product versus whether they're being ceded and worked on to start production. And those things are really out of our control, and that's some of the issue of pushing it in or pulling it out and how fast our revenues will grow. But really, it's based upon new capacity that's coming online that's actually making product. To be clear, a lot of these comments are vague enough that they could refer to the general growing adoption of OLED throughout various markets. Display makers are investing billions of dollars in ramping capacity to accommodate demand for a wide range of end markets. But with expectations of an OLED iPhone running high, there has to be some Apple embedded in there. There have been numerous reports that the OLED iPhone could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including technical challenges and component shortages. With what we know of the OLED capacity ramp and lofty volume requirements for flagship iPhones, OLED panels could be one of those bottlenecks.

Stock investors are hoping the "repatriated" cash would be spent on shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Patti Domm | @pattidomm 11 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Trump's 'tax holiday' could be a windfall for these stocks    Thursday, 4 May 2017 | 3:26 PM ET | 01:40 The White House is angling to get U.S. companies like Apple and Pfizer to bring back the $1 trillion cash pile they have stashed overseas so they can invest in America. Stock investors are hoping that same "repatriated" cash would be spent on shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks — just like when President George W. Bush gave multinationals a tax break in 2004. But something that's also possible — and not much discussed — is that companies could bring home the cash, spruce up their balance sheets and pay down debt. "We expect that to happen with a good portion of the cash. Ultimately, a lot of this money has really been borrowed to finance dividends and share repurchases," said Jon Duensing, head of corporate credit at Amundi Smith Breeden. He said companies may hold onto some of that cash and use it to retire debt as different maturities come due, but a smaller group may even pay off debt before it is due. "Certainly we as credit investors or lenders to companies would be concerned if companies paid out all that cash (in dividends, buybacks) and then we were left with all the debt and just the future cash flow generation" Duensing said. U.S. corporations have been tapping the corporate debt market at a record pace, as the era of super-low rates potentially hits its twilight phase. Apple, for instance, raised $7 billion in the debt market Thursday in a deal that was nearly three times oversubscribed, according to Informa Global Markets. That deal follows another $10 billion in February, and both were earmarked for share buybacks. Apple had about $84 billion in long-term debt, as of is last earnings filing. show chapters JPMorgan CEO thinks repatriation would create a big economic stimulus    Wednesday, 15 Mar 2017 | 10:19 AM ET | 00:53 "They've gone from zero debt" since April 2013, Duensing said, noting Apple's debt load is relatively small for the technology giant. What Apple has done with its debt proceeds is clear. It's been a buyback "monster." Apple shares outstanding topped out in 2013 at about 6.6 billion. Since then, the number has declined every year and now stands at 5.2 billion. "They went from being a technology company where debt wasn't really important or necessary for their capital structure," Duensing said. "The point is they went from being a very infrequent or nonexistent issuer in the corporate bond market to one that's been a more regular issuer." Duensing said there's an estimated $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion in offshore profits, but $1 trillion is considered liquid and invested in short-term holdings. That's the cash horde the market has focused on but ultimately more of the profits could be brought back, he said. Peter Tchir, managing director, macro income strategy at Brean Capital, said he's been advising clients to buy the older debt of some of these multinationals. He said companies may find that they want to retire some of the older outstanding issues. "They could manage some of their earnings around which bonds they retire. It would be natural as they pull some of the cash back, that they'd retire some of their debt," he said. UBS equity strategist Julian Emanuel, in a recent report, analyzed the overseas profits and holdings of U.S. companies, based on their year-end filings. "Our analysis uncovered more than $2.4 trillion of unremitted foreign earnings and more than $1.0 trillion of cash held offshore from our line item analysis of the annual filings. Indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings grew by $185 billion over the past year," according to the report. Of companies with the biggest cash piles, Apple topped the list, followed by Microsoft, Cisco, Alphabet and Oracle. "In general, I'm biased toward liking the big tech companies with a lot of offshore debt. I think their bonds are attractively priced with some upside," said Tchir. How much of their overseas cash would be diverted to debt repayment is tough to gauge. "It depends on what the tax code looks like," said Tchir. "It could be a relatively small amount or a lot." President Donald Trump would like a tax holiday, with some low rate, to lure the cash back into the U.S. and then future profits would be taxed at a new lower U.S. tax rate. But the final shape of the corporate tax bill is far from clear, with the House of Representatives pushing its own plan. The current system where a U.S. company can defer the profits of a foreign subsidiary as long as they are invested overseas would likely go away. There is one proposal that would have a huge impact on the corporate bond market and affect the behavior of not only multinationals but all indebted companies. There is a proposal to limit the deductability of interest. That might encourage companies to use more of the overseas cash to pay down debt, Tchir said. "I do think that people are overestimating the potential that this is going to be paid back in big dividend payments or buybacks. They also borrowed this money, using the offshore cash as collateral against it," said Tchir. Companies may be in some way restricted from using the overseas funds to buy back stock, after the 2004 repatriation failed to generate anticipated investments. "The love affair with allowing people debt financing for their equity purchases or dividends has gone away. I think they'll be discouraged from that. I think there's a whole array on the table that ends up being much better for bond people," he said. Duensing said technology and pharmaceutical bonds got a bid on the repatriation idea just after the election but that's since faded. Tchir said there is potential that spreads for those companies could tighten if it looked like they would pay down debt. "It's really going to be dependent on how interest payments are treated and what the exact repatriation looks like," said Tchir.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Can’t rename your AirPods as “AirPods”? Here’s the fix. Christian Zibreg on May 5, 2017 1 I’m the kind of guy who prefers to name all my Apple hardware with the actual name of the product. For example, my phone is named “iPhone 7 Plus,” my Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ is named “Apple Watch Nike+”, my computer has the “MacBook Air” name and so forth. I got my Apple wireless earbuds the other day and the very first thing I did after pairing was venture into Settings and rename them from “Chris’s AirPods” into just “AirPods”. But, alas, they’d stubbornly switch back to the default name whenever I reconnected to them. AirPods keep renaming themselves As mentioned, my AirPods revert back to the default “FIRSTNAME’s AirPods” name every time I switch to them from my Apple TV or Mac and back to my iPhone. The same thing happens if I put them in the charging case. While my Mac and Apple TV keep the “AirPods” name, the earbuds automatically revert to “Chris’s AirPods” as soon as they re-connect to the phone. TUTORIAL: How to use your AirPods like a pro It’s unclear whether that could be an iCloud issue. I’ve tried unpairing and re-pairing the earbuds, to no avail—they keep renaming themselves using Apple’s default naming scheme. Yes, all my devices have the latest OS updates installed and my AirPods are running version 3.5.3 of the firmware, the most recent firmware at the time of this writing. TUTORIAL: How to find out your AirPods firmware version This first-world problem only manifest itself when you rename your AirPods as “AirPods”. Give them any other name—like “My AirPods” or “Apple AirPods”, for instance—and it sticks across iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. If you’re the type of person who cannot be bothered to rename your AirPods into anything else other than “AirPods,” we have a workaround for you. How to rename your AirPods as “AirPods” The inability to remember the “AirPods” name is likely a bug in the firmware that may be fixed with a future software update. Until Apple address the issue, you can simply add a trailing space to the “AirPods” name. 1) On your iOS device, go to Settings → Bluetooth. NOTE: Be sure that your AirPods are paired with your iOS device and connected to it. On iOS, you can connect to any of your paired wireless headphones in Control Center: swipe your way to the Now Playing card and select your AirPods in the audio output menu at the bottom. 2) Locate your AirPods underneath the My Devices section, then tap the “i” icon. 3) Tap the Name field. 4) Now name your AirPods as “AirPods ” (with the trailing space). 5) Tap the Done key on the keyboard to save the changes. Going back to the previous screen without hitting Done on the keyboard may not save the new name properly. Again, you cannot rename AirPods if they’re not paired with your phone. TUTORIAL: How to locate your misplaced AirPods You can also rename AirPods on your Mac. Open System Preferences and click the Bluetooth icon. With the earbuds connected to the computer, right-click them in the list and choose the Rename option from the popup menu. Now type “AirPods ” in the field (crucially, don’t forget to append that important trailing space at the end!), click the Rename button to confirm the action and you’re good to go. And that’s all there’s to it, folks! Your earbuds will now keep that “AirPods ” name, even if you connect and re-connect to them from any of your iCloud-enabled devices. The old name may still appear in the menus on your devices until the changes propagate via iCloud. Don’t worry, as soon as you connect to them the “AirPods ” name shall be displayed in the menus. TUTORIAL: How to install software updates on your AirPods With this simple trick, you will finally be able to use the “AirPods” name for your earbuds. And because that trailing space isn’t visible in the menus, you’ll soon forget it’s there to begin with. Related tutorials The following how-tos on renaming Apple products should be useful, too. How to change your Mac computer’s name How to rename your Apple TV How to rename your iPhone or iPad It’s a wrap-up! And that’s it, ladies and gents.

Here’s how to send voice messages from Apple Watch. Sony A6500 Prior to watchOS 3, the default behavior in the Apple Watch’s Messages app when using voice input was to ask you if you wanted to send a text transcript or a voice recording. Apple changed the default with watchOS 3, likely with the goal of making the interaction faster (and more people probably used voice-to-text), but you can easily change it back to restore the option or always send as a voice recording. How to send voice messages from Apple Watch Start by launching the Watch app on the iPhone. From the My Watch tab (the first tab), swipe down to the Messages section. Tap to reveal options for Messages on Apple Watch including a section called Dictated Messages. Tap this option to change the default ‘Transcript’ option to ‘Audio’ or ‘Transcript or Audio’ depending on your preference. Here’s how Apple describes the default option on watchOS 3: By default, when you’re done dictating a message, Apple Watch sends a written transcript of what you said. You can change this setting to send an audio clip instead, or to choose which option you want every time you dictate a message. Personally, I prefer the option to send either the transcript or audio. I sometimes dictate a message using voice-to-text on my Apple Watch, but I also enjoy using my Apple Watch as a sort of walkie-talkie to send quick voice recordings to friends and family. (Also, my dictation voice is much more formal than my voice recording voice.) If you never send voice-to-text dictated messages, however, you can use this section to only send voice messages every time and save yourself the step of selecting the audio option every time. Once you select your preferred option, give it a try on the Messages app for Apple Watch. Look for the microphone button when replying to a new message, then speak away. The recipient can then playback the audio over iMessage from Messages for Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac and respond with text or voice … walkie talkie style.

According to people familiar with the two companies, Amazon employees are expecting that the tvOS app could arrive in the third quarter of the year, allowing Amazon Prime Video subscribers to stream TV shows and movies to Apple’s set-top box. Currently, Amazon does provide an iOS app that will allow users to stream to the Apple TV using AirPlay, but it lacks the elegance and simplicity of a native tvOS app. It’s unclear what has prompted this sudden change of heart for Amazon, which has snubbed the Apple TV for almost two years now, beginning with banning sales of the Apple TV and other products competing with its own Fire TV hardware back in Oct. 2015. While many hoped for an Amazon Prime Video app when the new app-enabled fourth-generation Apple TV arrived around the same time, Amazon remained the one major holdout — a decision that, according to Apple, was entirely up to Amazon.   While Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has generally been quiet about his company’s decision to drop the Apple TV from its online store, he has generally implied that there is some dispute between the two companies, telling an audience at last year’s Code Conference that “private business discussions should remain private,” and adding only that Amazon stopped selling the Apple TV because he wanted the Prime Video player to be “on the device with acceptable business terms.” Bezos’ comments of course imply that Apple has been unwilling to provide Amazon with the terms that it’s been seeking for deploying Prime Video to the Apple TV, although it’s less clear if this is something related to a conflict with a general App Store policy or if Amazon has been asking for something above and beyond the normal terms available to other tvOS application developers.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 05, 2017 3:06pm   Comments Share: Friday is proving to be one of the more interesting non-earnings trading sessions. Warren Buffett confirmed he sold around one-third of his entire International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) stake while at the same time the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)–Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) merger rumor received support from a top Wall Street analyst. Notable investor, "Shark Tank" personality, and former candidate to lead Canada's Conservative Party, Kevin O'Leary, was a guest on CNBC's "Halftime Report" to offer his take on these two headline-grabbing stories. 'Buffett Curse' According to O'Leary, IBM was a victim of the "Warren Buffett curse" in which the notable investor buys a large stake in the company only for it to underperform. In IBM's case, its reputation will now be "tainted forever" and could drop to the $130 level. O'Leary did note that the "Buffett curse" is very rare and hard to find. But the fact it happened to IBM is reason enough to taint its image for O'Leary. "It will be where you put money to go and die," he said. "So I think it is over until they do a massive change including management, board change, you name it. That's the Buffett curse." Apple Shouldn't Buy Netflix Simply put, it would be "sheer insanity" for Apple to go out and buy Netflix. O'Leary believes such a transaction would be incredibly dilutive, but more important, doing so would send one-third of its installed base of shareholders fleeing the stock. O'Leary noted that the Apple–Netflix tie-up is a classic example of nearly every pitch he sees on "Shark Tank." "You show me your valuation, and I ask you this," O'Leary explained. "Given that amount of money, can I go emulate exactly what they did? There is absolutely nothing proprietary about Netflix."

Engst We’re approaching another of those inflection points where Apple leaves some apps — and their users — behind. When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader too, but only TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps. If you are a TidBITS member, access the full-text feed by logging in and clicking the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use. Happily, you can easily replace it with any RSS reader, including Apple’s built-in News app. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Atkinson  2017-05-05 11:04 I appear to be one of the 50 daily users and have appreciated having a one-stop shop for TidBits content. Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying….. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:37 Even though Tidbits is not listed in Favourites, the Tidbits news items are still being shown…..

The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use.

Nearly one year ago, the Wall Street Journal published an article claiming that Apple was breaking from its longstanding tradition of redesigning the iPhone form factor every two years; and when Apple introduced the iPhone 7 a few months later, it was clear that the Journal’s sources were spot-on. Indeed, the iPhone 7 form factor effectively featured the exact same form factor as both the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6S. But buried later in the story was an interesting blurb regarding Jony Ive’s ideal iPhone design. Don't Miss: Elon Musk laughs off the idea of Apple buying Tesla “For years, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has expressed a desire for the iPhone to appear like a single sheet of glass,” the Journal noted, citing people familiar with Apple’s plans. “The current design ideas for the 2017 iPhones are expected to push the handsets in that direction by eliminating much of the bezel around the display with the OLED screen.” With the iPhone 8 release date now just a few months away, it appears that Ive’s vision of the perfect iPhone design will soon become a reality. According to a number of credible sources, Apple’s highly anticipated iPhone 8 will feature an edge to edge OLED display with incredibly thin bezels. In fact, if the rumor mill is to be believed, the bezels surrounding the iPhone 8’s display will be just 4mm, good enough to make the device discernibly sleeker than the already svelte Galaxy S8. With barely any bezels to speak of, the available screen real estate on the iPhone 8 will be expansive and perhaps even jaw-dropping. According to reports, the size of the iPhone 8 display will be about the same as the screen currently gracing the iPhone 7 Plus, albeit in a form factor that more closely resembles the more compact iPhone 7. That being the case, a new iPhone 8 concept video provides us with an incredibly eye-catching look at how the iPhone 8’s immersive screen might actually look and feel. We’ve certainly seen a large parade of iPhone 8 concept videos and mockups over the past few weeks, but this video in particular really does a great job of showcasing why current iPhone owners are chomping at the bit to upgrade. On the off-chance that you’re not terribly excited about or interested in the iPhone 8, this video might have you singing a different tune. While there’s little to no chance that photos will actually stretch all the way up to and around the iPhone 8’s ear speaker, renderings like the one below still help illustrate how truly game-changing the iPhone 8 is going to be once it finally hits store shelves. As a final point of interest, below is an iPhone 8 render next to the current Galaxy S8 Plus.

Coren May 05, 2017 How are your metrics? (Reuters / Alessandro Di Meo/pool) Share Written by Michael J. Coren May 05, 2017 The great contradiction at the heart of the Silicon Valley’s self-image is that it helps the world while becoming fabulously rich. The record, to say the least, is mixed. Facebook, Google, and Apple undoubtedly benefit millions of peoples’ lives while generating enormous, unprecedented wealth (for some). Yet the human toll—lost jobs, exploited contractors, massive concentration of wealth at the expense of the lower and middle class, and shuttered newspapers and small companies—are just as real. This doesn’t touch on more unsavory practices such as a wage fixing cartel by Apple, Google and others that depressed workers’ incomes, as well as outright deception by companies such as Theranos. Can companies that aim for huge profits while doing good deliver on the latter? A venture capitalist, inspired by Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical on the environment, is starting an accelerator in Rome to try. Stephen Forte, a serial entrepreneur and founder of Fresco Capital , announced on Medium on May 4 that he is starting the Laudato Si’ challenge to “invest in companies that are aiming for huge profits while also caring about doing good in the world.” These companies will specifically focus on climate change. For the challenge, Forte says founders will start out in a virtual program advised by mentors to hone their business models and accelerate growth. The in-person program runs from July through early September in Rome and culminates in a Demo Day at the Vatican in December (Forte does not say whether the program has an official relationship with the Vatican, and did not respond to inquires at the time of publishing). The program offers an optional $100,000 equity investment for 6%-8% equity stake in the company. Companies are expected to have a prototype and some sales or customer adoption, although not raised a large venture capital round. Climate change is the unifying theme but the “mission-driven, for-profit startups” can work in energy, food, water, conservation, finance and other fields. Forte argues companies who want to put social missions at the center of their business cannot find enough funding. To fix this, the accelerator will back “for-profit mission driven companies that focus on the challenge and values of the Laudato Si,’” citing Pope Francis’s On Care for our Common Home encyclical as the “perfect opportunity…to act.” Pope Francis’ 80-page edict seeks to enshrine environmental stewardship of humans’ common home at the heart of Catholic theology. Caring for the Earth, he argues, is inextricable from caring for each other. “How wonderful would it be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation would come along with more equality and social inclusion,” the Pope said in a 2017 TED talk on the topic. “Only by educating people to a true solidarity will we be able to overcome the ‘culture of waste,’ which doesn’t concern only food and goods but, first and foremost, the people who are cast aside by our techno-economic systems which, without even realizing it, are now putting products at their core, instead of people.” Most Popular The psychological importance of wasting time Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Apple leads smartwatch market Technology Friday 5 May 2017 - 6:29pm Apple has leapt to the lead in wearable computing on strong sales of its smartwatch, a market survey shows. Photo: REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon WASHINGTON – Apple has leapt to the lead in wearable computing on strong sales of its smartwatch, a market survey shows. The survey released on Thursday by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 percent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. READ: Low-key launch as Apple Watch finally goes on sale “The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence,” said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China's Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 percent global market share, ahead of Fitbit's 13.2 percent. READ: Smartwatch market suffers on Apple decline “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market,” said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. “Fitbit's shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 percent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models.

However, the two companies may soon bury the hatchet. An Amazon Video app is going to launch on Apple TV in the third quarter of this year, say sources speaking to Recode. This means that you could easily watch Amazon Video shows and movies using an app on your Apple TV. While it is technically possible to get Amazon Video on your Apple TV right now, that requires you to Airplay the video from your iPhone or iPad to an Apple TV. A dedicated Amazon Video app on the Apple TV would be much easier and would surely please any Amazon Video users that also own an Apple TV. Do you have an Apple TV?

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Takes Heat from Qualcomm Fight, Chinese Competition By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MAY 05 2017 Stung by Apple's recent decision to withhold royalty payments for its technologies in iPhones, chipmaker Qualcomm is reportedly planning to ask the Washington, D.C.-based International Trade Commission (ITC) to prevent importation of the devices into the U.S. Apple relies on Asia-based manufacturers to produce its flagship smartphones, and is already reported to be experiencing supply challenges ahead of its next big iPhone launch, expected in the fall. Citing "a person familiar with the company's strategy," Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Qualcomm is preparing to ask the ITC to block new iPhones from entering the U.S. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is facing multiple lawsuits recently filed against it by Apple in the U.S. and China, as well as allegations of unfair practices filed in January by the Federal Trade Commission. 'Need the Courts To Decide' The complaints stem from the royalties Qualcomm charges for Apple's use of its broadband processors, which enable mobile phones to connect with cellular networks. Qualcomm's modem chip design was used to set the industry standard for mobile communications, and the company agreed to license its technology to phonemakers on "FRAND" ("fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory") terms. In a lawsuit filed in January, Apple accused Qualcomm of unfairly charging royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with," adding that the company had withheld nearly $1 blllion in fees owed to Apple as "retaliation" for providing information about Qualcomm to regulators in South Korea. Last Friday, Qualcomm announced that Apple had begun withholding payments to manufacturers "for the royalties those contract manufacturers owe under their licenses with Qualcomm for sales during the quarter ended March 31, 2017." Qualcomm added that action would lower its expected third-quarter revenues by around $500 million. On Tuesday, during Apple's second-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said that he didn't believe case law would support an attempt to block iPhones from being imported into the U.S. "In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount," Cook added. "You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that." Tablet Troubles, China Slowdown While its dispute with Qualcomm continues, Apple is also facing challenges on several other fronts. Two recent reports from the analyst firm IDC show the company is slipping in its smartphone market share in China, and also feeling a pinch from global declines in tablet sales. Huawei and OPPO now hold the top two spots after double-digit growth over the past year, according to IDC's report on first-quarter smartphone sales in China. Apple's sales during the same period dropped nearly 27 percent, IDC said. But Apple retains the top spot in worldwide tablet sales, although first-quarter sales declined by 13 percent, according to a separate IDC report. The overall global tablet market shrank by 8.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2016, IDC added. IDC's smartphone report also noted that the next iPhone release this fall could improve Apple's position in China. "Apple has been seeing double-digit YoY declines for the fifth quarter in a row, but we believe that Chinese consumers are holding out for the launch of Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone at the end of the year, and this will help Apple to see a rebound in the China smartphone market," IDC analyst Tay Xiaohan said in a statement.

The Birth of Payment Service Venmo Next Article > Apple Offers New Tools for iOS Application Developers By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MAY 04 2017 Mobile app developers hoping to gain a little more insight into how users discover their apps are in for some good news. Apple announced yesterday that it has updated its App Analytics tool to provide developers with exactly that. The latest version of the tool will offer information such as what users were searching for when they discovered the apps, where they were on the iTunes app store, and where they previously had been on the Web. The service will also include new information, such as metrics on source types, so that developers can analyze which referring apps and Web sites are the most effective at driving users to their products. That should help developers aiming to optimize their marketing campaigns. More Love for Developers The App Analytics tool made its debut two years ago as part of the Apple Developer Program to help developers measure user engagement, optimize marketing campaigns, and monetize their iOS apps. Developers have also been using App Analytics to gain insight into how frequently their apps crash on different versions of the iOS operating system, filter groups of users based on the demographics captured in their Apple ID profiles, and measure the number of sessions, active devices, and retention of users. This week’s upgrade features four new data sources: App Store Browse, App Store Search, App Referrer and Web Referrer. The new information will help developers determine if new customers found their apps on Featured, Categories, or Top Charts listings in the App Store or by searching on specific keywords. The new tools are likely to be particularly helpful for smaller developers trying to squeeze the most out of modest marketing budgets. Apple has been showing its smaller iOS developers much more love recently, with a revamped version of its developer Web site that offers more videos, reference documents, and features such as the ability to respond directly to customer comments. App Store Driving Revenue The new features arrive at a crucial time for Apple and its app store. On Tuesday, the company reported that revenues for the store were up 40 percent year-over-year, setting a new quarterly record. Apple’s “services” category, which includes the App Store, helped generate around $7 billion over the last quarter, up from about $6 billion over the same period last year. Part of that is being driven by the company’s ability to monetize customers of the App Store. Premium and in-app purchases reached $40 per device in 2016, up from $35 per device the previous year. The strong performance of services in general and the App Store in particular is surely welcome news for Apple, which has been grappling with the challenge of delivering continued sales growth as sales of two of its key products, the iPhone and iPad, have begun to flag.

With billions in the bank though, it’s been asked why the Cupertino company wouldn’t just buy its way into the market with a major acquisition rather than starting from the ground up with its own efforts? To this affect, Tesla has repeatedly been tipped as the brand of Apple’s affections. According to the car company’s founder and owner Elon Musk, however, no such deal is on the table. “Yeah, I don’t think they want to have that conversation,” Musk is quoted by IBTimes as having stated. “At least I’ve not heard any indication that they do.” Related: Uber pulls its self-driving cars from the road after crash He added: “Obviously Apple continues to make some great products and, yeah, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it’s cool. I mean, I don't know what else to say.” He’s previously suggested that an acquisition would be detrimental rather than beneficial to Tesla’s development process. “I’d be very concerned in any kind of acquisition scenario, whoever it is, that we would become distracted from that task which has always been the driving goal of Tesla.” Last month Tesla made its brilliant Model S more accessible to the masses by knocking 10% of the vehicle’s asking price. A discount of around $7,500, the move made the Model S 75 significantly the cheapest motor in Tesla’s fleet. WATCH: iPhone 8 Would you buy an iCar or should Apple stick to phones?

I want to share how I earn money through EyeEm. In the first four months of 2017 alone, the royalties I received through them added up to $1,254.93 and I’m hopeful this will continue to improve. Full disclosure: I do contract work for EyeEm, but I am not getting paid for promoting their market nor do I get any benefits in exchange for writing this blog post. This post is written purely from my view as an independent stock photographer. I am supplying about a dozen agencies and I am also doing contract work for other agencies. The royalties I have made with #EyeEmPaid in 2017 I have been doing stock photography for more than a decade. For the first half, it was as a hobby on the side of office jobs, and for the last couple of years it has been as a major part of my photography business. So I’m not a beginner just starting out and looking around — I pretty much know what I’m doing. This certainly helps me in thinking ahead, as I already know all the pitfalls of trying to shoot for stock. I have been writing a blog about the stock photo business since early 2013, and I even wrote a book on stock photography which is available in German language at the dpunkt Verlag or any book seller. Three things you need to consider when shooting with stock in mind 1. Avoid logos, brands and designs in your images as those will prohibit commercial use 2. Be sure to spend the time needed (it might be just two minutes) to prepare every single image before uploading 3. Be selective but consistent in uploading fewer shots covering a wide variety of topics Logos are the biggest issue as there are plenty of them around us all the time. The little Nike swoosh on the shoes or even worse adidas’ three stripes along the pants, the Ray-Ban logo on the sun glasses, the Apple logo on the iPhone or the Mercedes star in the city scape. Many of those can be fixed in post processing using tools like Snapseed of Photoshop Fix on the phone or editing software like Lightroom or Photoshop on the computer. However, it is so much easier when you already know what to look for while shooting. Sometimes a slight change of angle will already hide that small logo that was visible a second ago. Train your eye to look out for them and you’re half the way of getting more images approved for commercial use. Design products are a bit more difficult: Apple, Samsung, Google have all sued each other for many years, fighting for their products to stay unique enough to give them an advantage. In the same way, they don’t like to see the most important protected elements of their designs in stock images as well. Using an iPhone as a prop in a stock image requires you to not only hide the Apple logo on the back but most of the unique physical features like the Home button and the antenna strip on the back. For modern cars, the same is true: Even just the head lights or the silhouette of a car can give away the brand and needs to be avoided if possible. Try to read up and learn quickly what can be done and what is a strict no-go if you want to make more from shooting images. I also want to mention the importance of being focused on uploading better images rather than more images. Volume certainly helps in increasing sales but if you upload another 10,000 random images of flowers on a meadow in spring time, you are rather unlikely to make significant amounts of royalties. Being selective in what you shoot, how you shoot, how you select the best of them and how you post process your images. After three years of uploading to EyeEm, I have managed to get around 1,000 images into the Market so far. That isn’t a big number, and there are others who have ten times more. But from what I have seen in numbers shared, I believe that I have a rather high hit-miss ratio and certainly make more than some of those who basically upload the whole set of images from their camera. I prefer to spend a few minutes on every image to optimize the contrast, the colors, if needed I crop for a better composition. I also try to add at least ten relevant tags (albums) to each of my images, even though EyeEm uses image recognition to add tags themselves. The most relevant ones (where I have been, what exactly it is that I have shot and how I shot it) are regularly missed. I am convinced: Spending more time on less images gives my images a certain advantage over those who are less selective in what they upload. Three tips for getting the kind of images that might do better than average 1. Go the extra mile Once every year I make the effort to get up extra early around 4am, take the first train down town to the center of the city and be among the few first ones around. Being able to picture places that are crowded in most of the images other people upload gives my photos an edge that others can’t provide. Find that extra mile that you can go to make your images stand out from all the similar from the same locations. 2. Beyond the beauty shots When it comes to shooting people, there are basically two kinds of photographers: Those who don’t dare to take images of people at all, and those who primarily shoot female subjects in the range of 18-30 years. Well, at least that’s what 98% of images on the internet suggest. I won’t try to talk you out of that, if you can get model released images with a young woman in beautiful places, you’re likely to still sell images. However, thinking outside of that box of people who are seen all the time might also work well. Luckily, I have a very willing and cheap model working for me voluntarily all the time: Me. And since I don’t have any jobs that require representation, I can allow myself to grow my beard a bit longer than usual every couple of months, have my hair grow a bit longer, get dressed however I like and much more. Add some light that goes beyond the all-flat-no-shadows-softbox light in common microstock photography, and you might have a unique image of a person. Even a character sometimes. 3. Show something common in an uncommon way Food photography is among the most popular themes in recent years, so many blogs around that topic and lots of people shoot their own beautiful images of any kind of food. It isn’t impossible to stand out of the crowd if you are really good at what you do. However, if you are more like me, you’ll never manage to get “above average” food images. I try to compensate by shooting unexpected images in themes where I can’t compete with the best. You can spend lots of time to prepare and arrange your food – but what food photographer takes an image of the plate after dinner is finished?

I recently caught up with Anthony Jabbour, the company's chief operating officer. The conversation turned to and stayed on fintech competition. As Jabbour sees it, the number of banks that use FIS puts it in a position to leverage that power in taking on changes in payments, lending and other parts of the banking ecosystem. The following is an edited transcript of that conversation. Digging In “Banks look at payments right now and they feel strongly they can’t lose the payments franchise,” says Anthony Jabbour, chief operating officer of FIS. How concerned are your customers these days about fintech competition? ANTHONY JABBOUR: Fintech is a top-five concern for our customers in all countries. When I was in Singapore, we were talking about disruption. There was a banker there who said, “The most disruptive thing about disruption is all the discussion about disruption.” Everyone has an opinion on it. Every board member has a smart phone and they’ve used Apple Pay with it. We’re trying to say, how do we look through the clutter and find opportunities that make sense for everyone? There’s a whole grouping of fintechs that are beneficial to both the banks and the fintech companies, and then there’s a whole other group of them that are competitively positioned to banks. Everyone is worried about what happens in three years. Will the rules change, will revenue drop? My brand is prominent right now with this fintech. In three years, will my brand get dropped off? The banks want to move forward, but they’re all afraid if they do, are they helping create their demise? What’s the longer-term impact if I work with them, and how can I trust that they’ll continue to do what they said they were going to do? When Apple Pay came out, banks weren’t running to Apple Pay because they thought it would drive new streams of revenue for them. A lot of them did it because they were afraid the bank across the street would offer it and they would suffer by not offering it. One thing we’re trying to do that’s a little different is, if we believe there’s value for our customers, we want to have the disruptor connect to the FIS network and have our banks connect to it from the FIS network, so we can leverage our banks’ negotiating power with the fintech. We want to be in a position to enable our banks to say, "If you change the rules we’re going to disconnect you, fintech, from the FIS network." Which will disconnect you from thousands of banks. Then the banks wouldn’t worry about, the bank across the street may have it, if I don’t, will I be in the newspaper? Are there fintechs with whom you have established this kind of relationship already? There are some we’re having discussions with right now, I can’t share their names. Is this model a little like working with a data aggregator where there’s a connection whereby the banks share data with fintechs? That could be a candidate. That one has been out there for a long time. We have a number of clients that use Intuit, we’ve got a broad partnership, they use us for bill pay. This is more focused on the new wave of tech companies that’s coming that can drive new revenue streams. Then you’re going to help that fintech grow its customer base by enabling it to partner with the bank and that’s where we want to make sure their success doesn’t come at the expense of our banks’ success. What are some of the types of companies you’re thinking of—alternative lenders, PFM app providers, billing companies? Payments would be one. The banks that I speak to look at lending and they say banks lost the lending franchise and exclusivity and other companies popped up over the years and took a major portion of that. And they look at payments right now and they feel strongly they can’t lose the payments franchise. Are you thinking of companies like Amazon and Facebook that have been inching their way into payments, or brand-new startups that have something different to bring to the table? It’s a combination of both. I was speaking to a super-regional bank’s board of directors. And they had just signed on for Apple Pay and they were complaining how it was a one-pager with no negotiating, they seemed upset that they did it. I asked them, why did you do it? And they said didn’t want to be the bank that didn’t offer it. It hit me in that meeting how it played out with Apple Pay. So had this been in place, for example, and we connected Apple Pay to the FIS network then to all of our banks and Apple Pay changed in three years’ time, we’re a large company, we have a large population of bank customers where we have deep partnerships, and we also have large banks as part of that. How do we leverage all of this bulk for our clients, to help them stay relevant, compete and grow? Because our business model is predicated on their success. Have you spoken to Apple? No. We’ve connected many banks to Apple Pay. We created special programs to say if your bank wants to come on at the end of June, last week of July, we gave them a simple, one-page online think, click and accept. But we didn’t have this formalized, in a way. It was what I’m thinking we need to do for the next one. And Apple is a fintech disruptor, but they’re different than the others, they’ve got a compelling pull, unlike a lot of other fintech companies. It’s on the phone, they control it. Banks felt railroaded by Apple to accept Apple Pay quickly and they felt they had no control. A group of banks in Australia tried to push Apple to give them access to its hardware and let them build their own wallets. They took this to a regulator who sided with Apple. So it seems like it’s a great idea to take the dominant position over a company like that, but in reality, it’s pretty hard. Are you confident that if it had been you in a situation like that, you would have prevailed? No. Apple would be a bad example. To their credit, they have all the consumers already. That’s what you’re starting with. If you look at Australia, there are only four major banks there that cover the vast majority of the population. I would have gone down a path of saying I choose not to integrate with Apple Pay. I would have turned to a QR-based mobile wallet that works at these merchants so all customers can use a mobile wallet if they want, versus trying to get access to the Apple hardware devices. I’m not surprised they lost that battle in court. I would have fought a different fight. Do you think that banks can take back market share in U.S. person-to-person payments with Zelle? We think that has a lot of potential. We offer Zelle to our clients. I believe we can create a capability for P-to-P for our banks that would be better than any fintech’s because we could make it real-time and it would be accessible from an ATM. I could send you money and you can go to an ATM with your mobile phone and withdraw the cash without having a bank account. We could also tie it with prepaid cards, so instead of me sending you $500, I could send you a $500 Home Depot gift card as a housewarming gift. It’s P-to-P, but it’s more thoughtful because we’re integrating it with prepaid. What does it take for a payment platform to work? It takes brand recognition so people know it exists, and it needs ubiquity, it needs to work in every place you would want it to work. It’s never about the technology. I like with Zelle that banks said look we have to find a way to solve the brand issue, and if we all use the brand Zelle, that’s going to help. And I think it will. Generally, can banks stay relevant in the face of fintech competition? When you look at companies that have been disrupted, it’s rare to see them strike back. The record labels never struck back at Apple when it came out with iTunes. The book stores never struck back at Amazon when they started selling books online. Even now you look at Apple with Spotify music streaming, Apple’s been so late to the party on music streaming and they’re so far behind. You look at banks and with a lot of the surveys we do with clients and customer video testimonials, one of the common things we hear from them is, “If my bank offered this, I would use it.” Banks can’t rest on their laurels and think this will last forever. It’s highly unusual to have clients who will wait for you to get it and come back to you. I could see that argument, but you could argue that banks are late to this P-to-P payment party and that PayPal’s Venmo is the clear leader. Do you think the Zelle brand can win hearts and minds? Without question, banks are late to a number of capabilities. When you look at P-to-P, Venmo is the brand, it’s a verb. Whether or not banks can catch up with Venmo comes down to how compelling they make the offer, what else they can wrap around it, how much do they ultimately invest in it. What I know is, if they hadn’t pursued Zelle, they would have fallen further behind. Editor at Large Penny Crosman welcomes feedback at penny.crosman@sourcemedia.com.

The transaction would give Apple shareholders 7 percent upside. Apple could also increase buybacks with the cash leftover from a Netflix acquisition. Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Apple could use its massive cash hoard to buy Netflix or one of six other major U.S. companies, to the benefit of shareholders, according to a Citigroup analysis. On Tuesday, Apple reported another increase in its cash holdings to a new record of $256.8 billion, 93 percent of which is overseas. Many analysts speculate Apple could soon bring back those profits if the Trump administration follows through on a proposed cut to the tax rate on those returning funds. Mergers and acquisitions "may make the most sense for some (or all) of Apple's excess cash" since Apple would likely take "too long" to use its cash for accelerating its pace of share repurchases, Citi's Jim Suva said in a Friday note. show chapters Should Apple buy Disney?    Thursday, 13 Apr 2017 | 9:15 AM ET | 01:24 "We identified a handful of potential M&A targets. Three are media firms: Netflix, Disney and Hulu. Three are video game developers: Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two. And, one is an auto maker: Tesla. Each target confers some strategic benefit to Apple," Suva said. He has a buy rating on Apple. Investors in Apple could see as much as a 20 percent gain from an Apple acquisition of Disney, or 7 percent from a purchase of Tesla or Netflix, Suva said. The iPhone maker could also use part of the cash to increase buybacks, he said in the note, resulting in "a significant 20 percent lift" in the share price. Attractiveness of acquisition candidates (deal size, probability, impact to Apple shares) Source: Citi Research Apple did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. Management said on the earnings call that it was difficult to speculate on what might happen on tax reform. The Citi report is also not the first time analysts have speculated about the tech giant buying companies like Netflix or Tesla. Suva's team of analysts found that Netflix was the most logical target after examining five factors: strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple's share price. show chapters Why would Apple buy Tidal?    Friday, 1 Jul 2016 | 4:15 PM ET | 04:26 "Like Apple, Netflix is global, has no non-core assets (like Disney) and is disrupting the global video ecosystem. Apple could help accelerate this disruption," Suva said. Non-core assets refer to those not essential to a company's operations. To be sure, respected Wall Street academic on corporate valuations Aswath Damodaran told CNBC earlier this week that the best thing for the iPhone maker to do with the cash is "probably nothing." "Cash is not the problem. It's what they could do with the cash that could potentially be a problem," Damodaran said. "It can become a problem if people stop trusting management and you know what could cause people to stop trusting management? A big acquisition." The iPhone maker has also avoided large acquisitions. The only transaction over $1 billion during the last six years was a $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014, according to the Citi report.

Engst We’re approaching another of those inflection points where Apple leaves some apps — and their users — behind. When you launched an older 32-bit app in iOS 10, it first warned that the app might slow down your device. That was, as far as I could tell, not the case, but it was still disconcerting. With iOS 10.3, however, Apple went further, stating in no uncertain terms that the app would stop working with some future version of iOS. As to when that will be, there’s no telling, but iOS 11 would seem to be likely. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor, and since it shipped in September 2013, developers have had the option to have their apps run in 64-bit mode. Starting in 2015, Apple has required apps to run in 64-bit mode to receive App Store approval. The practical upshot of Apple’s iOS warnings is that most apps that haven’t been updated since 2015 will likely be rendered inoperable by whatever future version of iOS pulls the plug on 32-bit apps. I can’t imagine that there will be any way to keep running such apps, short of refusing to update to that version of iOS. In iOS 10.3, Apple made it possible to see which of your apps will be affected. Navigate to Settings > General > About > Applications. The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. Tap any app to see its listing in the App Store, from which you can tap through to the developer’s Web site and theoretically ask if there will be an update. In most cases, the answer will likely be no. To bring that question home to roost, what about the TidBITS News app? The answer is, you guessed it, no, we will not be updating it. Written by Matt Neuburg and last updated in January 2013 for iOS 6, the TidBITS News app simply isn’t used by many people, and most of those who are using it have updated to iOS 10. As you can see in the stats for April 2017, fewer than 50 people per day are using it. It should continue to work in current versions of iOS for now. At its heart, TidBITS News is just an RSS reader dedicated to TidBITS, so you can easily replace it with Apple’s built-in News app. To add TidBITS to your Favorites list in News, search for TidBITS in News and either tap the heart icon next to the appropriate search result, or tap the search result itself and then the heart icon in the upper right corner. From then on, just tap Favorites in the News toolbar and then the TidBITS tile to see all our articles. If you want to add an RSS feed to News but can’t find it with a search from within News, you can use Safari. Navigate to the Web site in question, tap the share icon, and then tap Open in News in the share sheet. Once you’re in News, tap the name at the top of the screen to go to the main article list, and tap the heart button there. You can, of course, use any other RSS reader too, but only TidBITS members get access to the full-text RSS feed for use in other apps. If you are a TidBITS member, access the full-text feed by logging in and clicking the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site.   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. The writing is on the wall for 32-bit iOS apps that haven’t seen updates in years — they will stop working in a future version of iOS. That includes the TidBITS News app that a few people still use. Happily, you can easily replace it with any RSS reader, including Apple’s built-in News app. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Atkinson  2017-05-05 11:04 I appear to be one of the 50 daily users and have appreciated having a one-stop shop for TidBits content. Thank you for stepping through the Apple News/RSS alternative, which I'll do today. Farewell, TidBits News app! Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:11 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Apple's News app should work just fine for you. Reply david cuddy   2017-05-05 13:17 Not if you're in Canada. The iOS News app still isn't available here. Probably because we don't have 'Fake News'. Oddly, the News widget does appear on my Today page, and the -1 Home page. But there's no way to control the sources of the news feeds it uses. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 13:22 Still? Sheesh... sorry about that. Reeder or Feedly should work in that case. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 18:41 I seem to be one of the 50 also, but also no Apple News app on my iPad. I'm in The Netherlands (aka Holland). I do have Newsify, will that work? Otherwise, back to reading with Safari? Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 19:06 I haven't used Newsify, but from what I see on their product page, yes, it should work. Just get the RSS feed URL from the RSS link in the upper left of our Web site (full text for TidBITS members). Safari's Reader view does a pretty good job too for individual articles. Reply Lewis Butler   2017-05-05 11:20 How it was explained to me is that iOS 10 doesn't load 32 bit libraries until it has to, so running a 32-bit app can easily slow down your entire device depending on how much memory you have and how much you switch apps. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:24 Could be, but in practice, I never noticed any change after running such an app on my iPhone 7. Perhaps it had sufficient RAM and CPU power to mask any slowdowns. Reply Martin Stoermer  2017-05-05 11:37 Quite a few paid apps on my phone are marked as being on this scrap heap. Some have new versions available with a new name for new $, which I'm a bit grumpy about. In the case of the free ones it's a bit bit annoying but meh. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 11:41 I totally understand and empathize with the irritation of needing to buy new apps, but you should lay that blame squarely at Apple's feet, since they created a situation where developers have no choice but to chase new sales instead of supporting loyal customers. If developers were allowed to charge for upgrades, there would be financial incentive to keep up with existing apps. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-05-05 19:01 I agree. With non-paid updates/upgrades Apple has done developers a big disservice. But not only developers, users also. When you have to switch to a new app, you cannot acces your data in the old app, unless the data is in a cloud storage or the developer has provided a way to transfer it. If the old app does not work anymore on the new OS, you would loose all your data if you were not able to transfer it before the app stopped working Not a great user experience I would think, for which only Apple is to blame. Reply Christopher Smith  2017-05-05 19:33 While I can certainly understand that developers wish they could charge for upgrades (and why it incentivizes improvements to apps), it seems to me that allowing one's app to languish into obsolescence will definitely inhibit future sales. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2017-05-05 13:43 I knew Glyder would stop working some day. Oh well. But it will be a while yet since I gave up and now only update software and hardware when I have to. Not as secure, but less expensive and so much easier (except that I make even more offline backups to be safe). Reply Anonymous  2017-05-05 14:55 What I would like to comment on is have an iPhone 4s iPad 4/128 both still running iOS 9.3.5. I have been reluctant to move the iPad to iOS 10, I keep erasing the software update (hanging in storage) because of the tricks Apple keeps trying to make me update the iPad 4. Since I have a fixed income and cannot see sense in a new iPhone 5s or 4SE that are 64bit and I haven't been won over with possibilities iOS 10, and without possible compatibility between devices. So this is what I am wondering? 1.What if I update one but not the other, anyone with insight or expertise foresee problems between iProducts? 2.This is in reference to the below info (under FYI), if I update the iPad to 10, I know I cannot go back is it worth it. Any help? 3.Since this is a sandbox world closing in, is it time to just freeze my technology now before it made useless by having to afford the latest and greatest Apple product (or Microsoft)every 2-5 years? Just an FYI: Also my two Mac Pros are is similar place one a 2006/8 2,1 I upgrade the hardware my self to an 8-core so I frozen myself to 10.9.5 world with (64on32) and the used 2010 5,1 model can run 10.11 or 10.12 which seem to iffy, with all the beta crashing of Sierra I had.. At least I can roll back to my macOS of choice 10.9.5 on a different boot drive of the Mac Pro 5,1. ~Barry Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:45 It's hard to make concrete recommendations without knowing all the details, but it sounds like it might make sense to keep iOS 9.3.5 on both your devices, particularly if that matches with your Mac Pros and the equivalent version of iTunes (honestly, I don't know what versions match up offhand). If you start upgrading things piecemeal, you will end up in a situation where something won't talk to something else, but it's hard to predict how that will happen. The main thing to be aware of is that you aren't getting security updates, so you should be extra careful to avoid dodgy parts of the Internet. At some point, some hardware will probably fail and force you to get something new, and that may be the event that encourages upgrading everything to the latest and greatest. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:14 There is definitely a problem with upgrading iDevices if you connect them to a Mac and the Mac is not running a very recent version of OS X. Basically, older versions of iTunes will not talk to newer versions of IOS. What you get is a dialogue every time you plug in the device telling you this and advising you to upgrade iTunes - very annoying, since newer versions of iTunes will not run on older versions of OS X! So say you are running OS X 10.8 with iTunes 12. Your iDevices are running IOS 9.3.5. This works fine. You then decide to upgrade to IOS 10 on a device. If you try to do it through iTunes, it will say you need to upgrade iTunes - this warning is pretty vague, and does not raise any alarms. Unfortunately, iTunes 12 is the last version that will run on OS X 10.8. So your only option is to upgrade OS X which may not be acceptable. So you upgrade the device to IOS 10 over the Internet directly. Then plug it in to your Mac and get a warning from iTunes that it cannot talk to the device. Oops! No more backups of your device. No copying data files from apps to your Mac. No managing apps on your Mac. What does work is that iPhoto will still transfer photos, and probably Image Capture too. Third party file access apps on the Mac can also access the device. It seems to just be iTunes that does not work. Beware also that if you buy a new iDevice, it will not work with iTunes on your old Mac either. Sadly there is definitely no going back after the upgrade. You are stuck with IOS 10. Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 16:23 "The number next to Applications is the total number of apps installed, but when you tap Applications to see what’s inside, you see a list of 32-bit apps that have no updates available. " I'm not seeing exactly what you describe in the article, on my iPad 4 with iOS 10.3.1. When I tap on Applications, I see the number of apps (100), and "inside", I see the text you list about "These apps may slow down your iPad...". No app names appear directly below that. Then I see in grey text "Updates available". Below that are app names, including apps that I upgraded today. I haven't counted, but I think all 100 apps might appear in this group. This includes major apps like App Store, Remote, FaceTime, Google, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Dropbox, etc. It doesn't make sense to me that these are all 32-bit applications, but it's likely that some of the apps I have installed are. I haven't been able to guess the ordering system for this list. It isn't alphabetical. It isn't by age, install date, or most recent update. Tapping an arrow next to most apps will take me to the App Store, and show me that no update is available. A few say that the app is not available in the App Store. Below the last app on this list is grey text saying "No Updates Available". There are no apps listed under these words. Can you give us a few more words about this app list, and how to interpret the groupings and ordering? Thanks. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:41 My best guess is that it's confused. :-) What I'd try is going to the App Store app, making sure that everything is updated, and then restart the iPhone (hold down both buttons until it restarts). Reply Derek Roff   2017-05-05 17:15 Thanks for your response, Adam. A restart changed nothing for me, and the App Store shows no updates available. I guess I will wait and see what happens with the next iOS upgrade. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 17:17 The other thing you could try is signing out in Settings > iTunes & App Stores. Then sign back in and see if it has figured things out better. Reply Timothy Pearson  2017-05-05 16:22 Reading TidBITS in Apple News doesn't work for me. Following your prescription, I added it to my favorites; but it only shows one article since 3 October 2016, and several unrelated articles about "Tidbits" from other sites. If the iOS app stops working, I guess I will have to use the webpage instead. Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-05 16:47 It sounds like your search hit "Tidbits" as a topic, rather than "TidBITS" as the publication. Try again, and make sure the one you're selecting has our capitalization. Tap it, and make sure it's our content, then tap the heart icon at the top right. Reply brent  2017-05-05 18:18 thanks guys! guess i wasn't the only one to ask, lol. i liked the app, really just to catch specific articles i see noted in FB or tweets. but the apple news will do. irony, i had never used apple news until now. keep up the good work, you are still my "go to" resource. Reply Roland G  2017-05-05 19:28 I'm an iOS developer since 2009. I have updated many apps to support 64bit and it really isn't a big deal. The developers of these apps just need to update their apps to support both 32/64 and all is well. At some point Apple needs to move on with their OS and I fully support that. If you don't want to update to 11, don't update, simple as that. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:24 I use the app occasionally, when in waiting rooms or travelling, but generally prefer the weekly roundup that arrives by e-mail. That said, I prefer the app's layout to News. News just shows the first few lines of each article to give you an idea of what it is about. This is often not helpful. In the app, there is a paragraph summarising the article, which often meant you did not even have to read the article if it was not of interest - a huge time saver. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:31 I am having trouble adding the member version of the RSS feed. I logged in with Safari and clicked on RSS feed. It asked me if I wanted to open it in News. I said yes, then it told me the story could not be found. Tidbits does not appear in the favourites list. Going back to repeat this process, when I click on RSS, I get a message from Safari: Cannot open page Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid. Any ideas? Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:35 I quit News, and started again. Safari asked if I wanted to open the link in News. I said Yes. It showed the list of headlines, then said: Story unavailable. This story is not available in News. Given that I had not touched a story, this is mystifying….. Reply David Morrison   2017-05-05 22:37 Even though Tidbits is not listed in Favourites, the Tidbits news items are still being shown…..

In an industry where double-digit margins are exceptional, Ferrari entered unprecedented territory with its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization climbing to 29.5 percent of sales in the first quarter from 26.3 percent a year earlier. That compares with a 31.6 percent profit margin at Apple and about 36.5 percent at luxury goods icon Hermes International SCA. Ferrari's automotive peers don't come close. Former parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's margin is about 11 percent and General Motors about 13 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "Those profit margins show how Ferrari fishes in the same pool as the luxury brands," said Massimo Vecchio, an analyst with Mediobanca in Milan. "It simply uses its cars as bait." The Italian supercar maker is tapping into the increasing wealth of the world's elite, which has helped propel demand for all kinds of luxury goods. Hermes reported a better-than-expected 11 percent sales gain, while LVMH and Gucci owner Kering were also boosted by improving consumption in China and rebounding demand in Europe. Deliveries of Ferrari's models with top-of-the-line V12 engines surged 50 percent in the first quarter on demand for the Aperta convertible, which sold out last year before its official debut, as well as the $300,000 GTC4Lusso and the $380,000 F12tdf. Sales of V8-powered cars declined 3 percent. "We just found an additional level of motivation to move the organization forward," Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne told analysts during a conference call Thursday, referring to Hermes' increase in profit margins. "I think that really is the target" for Ferrari. Backed by demand for big-engine vehicles and customers adding more custom features, Ferrari's revenue jumped 22 percent to 821 million euros ($898 million), more than outpacing the 6 percent gain in vehicle shipments. Adjusted Ebitda climbed 36 percent to 242 million euros. To drive further growth, Ferrari in March unveiled its new flagship 812 Superfast, the speediest production car in its history. Annual output, which was previously capped at 7,000 vehicles, is now on track for 9,000 by 2019. The Italian manufacturer stood by its forecast that 2017 adjusted Ebitda would rise to more than 950 million euros. Deliveries are projected to increase to about 8,400 cars this year from 8,014 in 2016. Marchionne said Ferrari is studying how to expand beyond 10,000 cars a year as the carmaker will give an update on its strategy after the end of this year. He also said that the 2017 targets are a "minimum" level as the carmaker could upgrade them in the next quarters. With the latest earnings performance, Marchionne, 64, is making good on claims made in the run-up to Ferrari's October 2015 initial public offering. At the time, he argued the company deserved to be valued as a luxury-goods maker rather than an auto manufacturer, even though there's little track record of success for a stand-alone niche carmaker. Ferrari stock has surged 39 percent this year, valuing the company at $15.2 billion. To bolster its aura, Ferrari's Formula 1 racing team is back at the top of the standings after a series of disappointing seasons. Meanwhile, the Ferrari Land theme park opened in Spain last month, boasting Red Force, an attraction that gives a flavor of the company's cars by propelling riders to 180 kilometers (110 miles) per hour in five seconds. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Interestingly, Apple has been cagey about Apple Watch sales. Unlike it does with iPhones, iPads, and Macs, and instead relegates the device under its “Other Products” category. The category also includes the Apple TV, Beats products, iPods, AirPods, and other accessories, making it nearly impossible to determine if Apple Watch revenue has doubled over the last two years. The 59 percent annual saw Apple Inc. capture 16 percent of the global market, helping the Cupertino company dethrone Fitbit. Meanwhile, Fitbit shipped an estimated 2.9 million wearable devices during the same quester. The key metrics – revenue, profit, unit growth, and costs - for Fitbit looks bleak, but the company healthy cash reserves will buy them enough time to get on the path to recovery. The 2016 Apple Watch 2 Fitbit’s Cratering Sales The fitness wearables company’s year-over-year growth has slowed every quarter since Q2 2015, a big reversal from the nearly doubling of its sales three years ago. To restore growth, Fitbit layoff 6 percent of its workforce, saving $200 million from its $1.1 billion in annual spending. Competition from the likes of Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp. has blunt the company’s growth. Moreover, analysts blame this descend on its delayed entry to the emerging smartwatch market. Xiaomi held second place to Apple, as shipped an estimated 3.4 million wearable devices. The Chinese company’s success is solely based in China, on account of lack of expertise and brand recognition for international expansion. Xiaomi is selling in over 20 countries, and yet it is in no rush to expand internationally. During Apple’s recent earnings call, chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple saw shipments of the Watch nearly double year-over-year. The strong performance is attributed to a prominent feature of the Apple Watch, i.e. the fitness and health tracking. With AirPods and Beats headphones sales, Apple’s wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 500 company. More Trouble Ahead For Fitbit For consumers with primary focus on fitness, Fitbit is the go to wearables. The Apple Watch offers a lot more than fitness tracking and heart-rate monitoring. Moreover, the ever-expanding Apple Watch app ecosystem makes the Watch a more versatile wearable than fitness bands. And the new Apple Watch, of course is waterproof with built-in GPS, creating a proper activity tracker. Moreover, Apple Watch users don’t need to get a Fitbit or thirty-party apps, or a dedicated sports watch from Polar, Suunto, or Garmin. Fitbit expects to burn its reserves in 2017 as it works to regain its position as a market leader in the wearables sector. It is likely to release a smartwatch that could go up against the Apple Watch. Layoffs and other cost-cutting measures have defined Fitbit’s quarters for the past couple of month. With demand for its products not materializing, the wearables company faces the difficult task of slashing costs to regain growth. The year 2017 will prove to be a tough one for Fitbit and its shareholders as it steers this new reality, and only time will tell whether the wearables company can turn things around.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Mobile Apple Becomes World’s Largest Wearable Vendor, Overtakes Fitbit In Growth By Ali Salman 13 hours ago 11Shares Share Tweet Submit While Apple itself does not unveil any sales figures, we usually get a good idea from various analytic companies. Seemingly, Strategy Analytics has released a set of numbers in which it states that the Cupertino giant has managed to sold 3.5 million Apple Watch units in the first three months of calendar 2017. While the company sold 2.2 million units of the wearable in the same three month time period last year, it suggests a massive 59 percent annual growth. So, let’s dive in to see some more details on the sales figures and where does Apple stand in the wearable industry at the moment. Apple Watch Surpasses Fitbit In Terms Of Growth And Sales Figures According to the details shared, the global wearable shipments during the first quarter of 2017 rose to 22 million. This is an increase of 21 percent compared to the first quarter of 2016. Apple’s achievement of 59 percent growth saw the company capturing 16 percent of the total wearable market share. With that said, Apple has overtaken Fitbit to become the world’s largest wearable vendor. Related Apple’s Free App Of The Week Is A Tricky Puzzle Title – $2 Value Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, Neil Mawston said: “Apple captured 16 percent global marketshare and overtook Fitbit to become the world’s largest wearables vendor. The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence. Xiaomi shipped 3.4 million wearables for 15 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. Demand for its popular Mi Band fitness range was broadly flat across its core markets of Asia.” In comparison to the Apple Watch, Fitbit saw a decline with just 2.9 million units selling in the first quarter of 2017. Comparatively, in last year’s first quarter, Fitbit sold 4.5 million units. So even though Apple has surpassed Fitbit in terms of sales, it is still not as big as Fitbit was in the previous year. Advertisement Another note worthy vendor in the list is Xiomi with its Mi Band which has managed to capture 15 percent of the market share, selling an impressive 3.4 million wearables. Check out the chart for more details.

Image 1 of 19 Share twitter linkedin facebook google+ email Adam Shepherd Vs 5 May, 2017 Verdict  Apple's iPhone 7 is an excellent device, but it's just no match for the Samsung Galaxy S8. With a gorgeous design, a stunning display and more features than you can shake a stick at, Samsung has finally claimed its place as the best smartphone on the market. Apple and Samsung have been duking it out over the title of 'world's best smartphone' for years now. While Apple's comfortably taken the top spot in years past, the Korean manufacturer has been steadily creeping up on it of late, with devices like the Galaxy S7 offering a pretty compelling iPhone alternative. With the Samsung's newest flagship freshly arrived on shelves, the fight is on between the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S8. Does Samsung have what it takes to finally topple Apple's throne, or will the iPhone 7 be crowned victorious once again? Design iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 Thickness 7.1mm 8mm Weight 138g 155g Straight off the bat, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is a much nicer-looking device than the iPhone 7. Samsung's curved and virtually edgeless Infinity Display is breathtaking to look at, creating a unique and alluring package that the iPhone just can't match. On top of that, there's no unsightly camera wart where the lens housing protrudes from the back. On the other hand, the iPhone 7's matte-black and red colour schemes are much more attractive than any of the options for the S8, and the aluminium chassis will be much less prone to picking up greasy fingerprints than the the S8's glass backing. Overall, however, it's the S8 that takes the cake in terms of design and visual appearance. The iPhone 7 may be nice, but it's nothing that we haven't seen time and time again, whereas the Galaxy S8 feels different and exciting - it's impossible to mistake it for any other phone. Winner: Galaxy S8 Display iPhone 7 Samsung Galaxy S8 Screen size 4.7in 5.8in Display type IPS AMOLED Resolution 750 x 1,334 1,440 x 2,560 Pixel density 326ppi 570ppi sRGB coverage 95.8% sRGB 99.9% sRGB Max brightness 540cd/m2 416cd/m2 The Galaxy S8's screen knocks the iPhone 7 into a cocked hat in terms of resolution, with the QHD+ screen running rings around Apple's panel. It's much larger, too, measuring almost 6in across the diagonal compared to just 4.7in. It's just as impressive when you get down to the nitty-gritty - although the iPhone 7's 95.8% sRGB coverage is nothing to be sniffed at, Samsung goes one better with a whopping 99.9% result. It's brighter than the iPhone 7 to boot, and thanks to the AMOLED panel, it's got rich, vivid colours and perfect contrast. As a final treat, the S8 is one of the very first HDR-enabled phones, which translates to brighter highlights and deeper shadows when viewing compatible content. The Galaxy S8 takes the crown here, but not on resolution - at this level, the extra pixel density over the iPhone 7's display just doesn't make that much of a difference. Instead, it's the extra vibrancy, colour accuracy and contrast provided by that AMOLED screen that nets it the win. The fact that it's wrapped up in a gorgeous edgeless display doesn't exactly hurt, either. Winner: Galaxy S8 Specs and hardware iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 CPU Quad-core A10 fusion Octa-core Exynos 8895 RAM 2GB 4GB Single-core performance 3489 1994 Multi-core performance 5652 6629 Generally speaking, Apple's hardware is unparallelled when it comes to performance, but the Galaxy S8 comes closer than ever to closing that gap. According to our Geekbench 4 tests, it was more than 15% faster than the iPhone 7 at multi-core operations, and closer than any other phone we've tested to matching its single-core speed. Under the hood, the S8 packs an Exynos 8895 octa-core CPU (or possibly a Snapdragon 835, depending what territory you're in), with 4GB of RAM. The iPhone, meanwhile, uses Apple's quad-core A10 Fusion processor paired with 2GB of memory. In practice, both devices feel sufficiently nippy - you're unlikely to notice much of a difference between them unless you're pushing them to the absolute limit, and even then it'll be negligible at best.

With the first iPhone launched back in 2007, the launch of the iPhone in 2017 will mark the 10th anniversary of Apple’s iPhone line and we are expecting Apple iPhone 8 to carve a remarkable leap on the graceful occasion. Three iPhone handsets will be launched in 2017: the two models of iPhone 7s and the much anticipated iPhone 8. But the Cupertino tech giant is breaking the records of staying lip tight and so we don’t have any clear news about the time of release. The upcoming release in the current year is Apple’s 10th-anniversary release. However, will Apple release only iPhone 7s models or will iPhone 8 lead the launch lane on the big occasion is yet a stealth story. While Apple makes big announcements or not, others surely would do with the surmises until we have something concrete to get our hopes high on. We cannot stop the rumours and the words revolving in the tech world. There are certain leaks on the media platforms and predictions about Apple’s upcoming the iPhone 8. So let us see what Apple’s most awaited iPhone will bring to the table? Design and features The premium Apple iPhone 8 will bear a price tag of $1,000 for the base model. The three upcoming models, iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s plus and iPhone 8 will have size 4.7-inch, 5.5-inch, and 5.8-inch, respectively. As Apple could source sufficient OLED’s, we would see OLED screen in only one of the 2017 iPhone. We can for sure spot that the bigger size iPhone 8 would use the OLED edge-to-edge display. However, PC Mag marks that Apple ordered 100 million OLED display panels from the Samsung Display for its embedment in the iPhone 8. The amount now has changed to 160 million; worth $4.3 billion. Image credit: Gabor Balogh The iPhone 8 will sport a sophisticated look – a black masterpiece composed in a svelte design giving rich speculation. The front will be made up of stainless steel metal instead of the aluminum metal as in the current iPhones. The back side of the phone will also be of glass giving it a rich look. There will be no bezels as the OLED would be in a cut-to-cut fix with the chassis. The $1,000 2017 iPhone will have an updated processor A10X or A11; likely to show the performance necessary to meet the current speed demands. The water resistance rating would also lift up from IP67 to IP68. Apple iPhone 8 Camera is an Augmented reality portal? The $1,000 iPhone will pack a vertical dual lens camera. Relatively, we can even count on the incorporation of high-end 3D cameras that will be used for the new AR and VR technology. Also, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that the camera technology of Apple’s $1,000 iPhone would potentially reinvent user experience. Battery life and wireless charging iPhone 8 having sleek model may put on the battery of 2700 mAH. We are wondering how Apple would fit such big battery in the slim model. But rumors suggest that Apple has made many changes in the architecture by modifying certain components. The 2700 mAH battery is almost on par with the iPhone 7 battery which lasts around 9 hours and 15 minutes. Moreover, we can almost count of the wireless charging on the premium iPhone. The CEO of PowerMat, Dubzinski dropped hints about the wireless charging in the $1,000 iPhone. No Home button Image credit: Gabor Balogh Apple will give up on the Home button and would instead augment a touch function area. The new functional touch area will be adaptive to whatever context users need for the functioning, says Kuo. According to a source, the packaging material for the premium $1000 iPhone will make its way at Foxconn in the last week of the sixth month, reports ibtimes. We cannot rely totally on these aspects for all these are just revolving whispers in the market. We are waiting to clearly witness what would the brand new iPhone 8 infuse under the hood? Also, how would Apple commemorate its 10th anniversary?

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) May 5, 2017 at 1:23PM Many of the stocks held in Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio are at or near all-time highs, and to be perfectly honest, some are looking a bit too expensive. However, there are still some bargains to be found in the Oracle of Omaha's stock portfolio, and here are two examples that are worth a look in May. Company Symbol Recent Share Price Apple AAPL $146.47 Goldman Sachs GS $226.64 Share prices current as of 5/4/17. Solid growth and a massive hoard of cash In a relatively short time, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become one of Berkshire's largest stock holdings, and it's not difficult to see why Warren Buffett likes it so much. The company has some pretty strong competitive advantages that should protect its market share for years to come, including its brand name and fiercely loyal customer base. Image source: The Motley Fool. For the most recent quarter, Apple beat earnings estimates and grew its revenue by 5% year-over-year. Service revenue (sources like Apple Music, AppleCare, and Apple Pay) was a particularly encouraging part of the earnings report, up 18% year-over-year. Another reason to take a look at Apple is that the company could be well-positioned to capitalize on a potential repatriation tax holiday. Apple revealed that its cash hoard has grown to a staggering $256.8 billion, and with Republicans proposing a one-time repatriation tax holiday with a 10% rate. This could save Apple about $64 billion as compared with the current corporate tax rates, and could finally incentivize Apple to bring home its cash and put some of it to work. Even with its dominant market position and the projection that as many as 300 million iPhones could be set to upgrade later this year, the stock still trades for just 16.4 times this year's expected earnings. This may not sound like a tremendous bargain, but consider that excluding the monster cash hoard, the company's P/E drops to just 10.9. Buy the dip in the smartest guys on Wall Street Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is a "buy the dip" situation, with the stock down about 10% over the past two months and a disappointing earnings report. For the first quarter, the company posted a rare earnings miss, which was especially troubling to many investors because most other banks' results were quite strong. For example, Bank of America met or beat expectations on most metrics. Trading revenue was a major weak spot for Goldman, with equities trading revenue falling 6% year-over-year and flat bond trading revenue. Rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup both reported strong trading revenue. In fact, JPMorgan beat trading revenue estimates by more than $1 billion and saw 17% year-over-year growth in bond trading, and Citigroup saw its trading revenue rise by 19% and 10% in bonds and equities, respectively. So, it's easy to see why this could be an area of concern for Goldman's investors. To be clear, the first quarter was a disappointment. However, there was some good news that investors need to keep in mind. For one thing, Goldman was number one in announced M&A activity as well as equity and common stock offerings so far in 2017. Also, the bank's revenue rose 27% year-over-year, but expenses grew by just 15%. Investing and lending revenue was the highest it's been in four years, and investment management revenue increased by 12%. Shareholders also got a 15% dividend increase and Goldman authorized an aggressive 50 million share buyback program, which represents about 13% of the total shares outstanding. The bottom line is that it's important not to make the mistake of assuming that one poor quarterly report is an indicator of a longer-term trend. When Warren Buffett first invested in Goldman in 2008, he referred to his investment as a "bet on brains" and called Goldman the best firm on Wall Street. Buffett's original reasons for investing still apply today, so now could be a smart time to add Goldman to your portfolio since the stock has retreated a bit from its highs.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 100 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display. Data is preliminary and subject to change. Company shipments are branded device shipments and exclude OEM sales for all companies.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing.

For iPhone users, however, Fridays are bittersweet because they mean there’s only one more list of paid iPhone and iPad apps on sale for free to enjoy. Well, it’s here, and hopefully it’s good enough to tide you over until Monday. If not, you can always check back in Thursday’s post, where you’ll find a few more premium apps that are still free downloads. Don't Miss: There’s one thing that really has me worried about the iPhone 8 These are paid iPhone and iPad apps that have been made available for free for a limited time by their developers. There is no way to tell how long they will be free. These sales could end an hour from now or a week from now — obviously, the only thing we can guarantee is that they were free at the time this post was written. If you click on a link and see a price listed next to an app instead of the word “get,” it is no longer free. The sale has ended. If you download the app, you will be charged.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Takes Heat from Qualcomm Fight, Chinese Competition By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: MAY 05 2017 Stung by Apple's recent decision to withhold royalty payments for its technologies in iPhones, chipmaker Qualcomm is reportedly planning to ask the Washington, D.C.-based International Trade Commission (ITC) to prevent importation of the devices into the U.S. Apple relies on Asia-based manufacturers to produce its flagship smartphones, and is already reported to be experiencing supply challenges ahead of its next big iPhone launch, expected in the fall. Citing "a person familiar with the company's strategy," Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Qualcomm is preparing to ask the ITC to block new iPhones from entering the U.S. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is facing multiple lawsuits recently filed against it by Apple in the U.S. and China, as well as allegations of unfair practices filed in January by the Federal Trade Commission. 'Need the Courts To Decide' The complaints stem from the royalties Qualcomm charges for Apple's use of its broadband processors, which enable mobile phones to connect with cellular networks. Qualcomm's modem chip design was used to set the industry standard for mobile communications, and the company agreed to license its technology to phonemakers on "FRAND" ("fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory") terms. In a lawsuit filed in January, Apple accused Qualcomm of unfairly charging royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with," adding that the company had withheld nearly $1 blllion in fees owed to Apple as "retaliation" for providing information about Qualcomm to regulators in South Korea. Last Friday, Qualcomm announced that Apple had begun withholding payments to manufacturers "for the royalties those contract manufacturers owe under their licenses with Qualcomm for sales during the quarter ended March 31, 2017." Qualcomm added that action would lower its expected third-quarter revenues by around $500 million. On Tuesday, during Apple's second-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said that he didn't believe case law would support an attempt to block iPhones from being imported into the U.S. "In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount," Cook added. "You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that." Tablet Troubles, China Slowdown While its dispute with Qualcomm continues, Apple is also facing challenges on several other fronts. Two recent reports from the analyst firm IDC show the company is slipping in its smartphone market share in China, and also feeling a pinch from global declines in tablet sales. Huawei and OPPO now hold the top two spots after double-digit growth over the past year, according to IDC's report on first-quarter smartphone sales in China. Apple's sales during the same period dropped nearly 27 percent, IDC said. But Apple retains the top spot in worldwide tablet sales, although first-quarter sales declined by 13 percent, according to a separate IDC report. The overall global tablet market shrank by 8.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2016, IDC added. IDC's smartphone report also noted that the next iPhone release this fall could improve Apple's position in China. "Apple has been seeing double-digit YoY declines for the fifth quarter in a row, but we believe that Chinese consumers are holding out for the launch of Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone at the end of the year, and this will help Apple to see a rebound in the China smartphone market," IDC analyst Tay Xiaohan said in a statement.

Apple Takes Heat from Qualcomm War 2. Apple Emphasizes Economic Impact 3. 6 Critical Android Patches Released 4. Apple Cash Stash Spurs Buy Rumors 5. Electronics Giant Sony Back to Black Next Article > Apple Steps Up Efforts To Emphasize Its Economic Impact By Michael Liedtke and Christopher S. Rugaber PUBLISHED: MAY 04 2017 Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook [pictured here] first described the manufacturing fund an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. Threats to Apple Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." Apple in the States Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report came after years of complaints about labor practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company's major contractors in China, drew more attention to Apple's reliance on overseas factories. Apple to also issues a separate "supplier responsibility" report reviewing the labor conditions in those facilities. The Wednesday report on U.S jobs is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Apple's decision to provide detailed information about the locations of its U.S. employees could help the company win support from lawmakers eager to protect jobs in their states, Enderle said. "It gives senators something to push back with, recognizing that Apple is a real risky company to target anyway because its products are so popular with people." Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. App Economy The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple's iPhone "ecosystem." That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps. Such "spillover" effects are widely recognized, although economists sometimes spar over their magnitude. But for a company to claim credit for all or most of the jobs in a particular industry is a stretch, Swonk said. The vast majority of app developers, for example, also produce apps for Android phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. The Public Policy Institute only found 1.7 million jobs in the entire "app economy" -- and 1.35 million of those were associated with Android apps. Most of those overlap with the jobs linked to Apple. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: Apple.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Takes Heat from Qualcomm Fight, Chinese Competition By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: MAY 05 2017 Stung by Apple's recent decision to withhold royalty payments for its technologies in iPhones, chipmaker Qualcomm is reportedly planning to ask the Washington, D.C.-based International Trade Commission (ITC) to prevent importation of the devices into the U.S. Apple relies on Asia-based manufacturers to produce its flagship smartphones, and is already reported to be experiencing supply challenges ahead of its next big iPhone launch, expected in the fall. Citing "a person familiar with the company's strategy," Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Qualcomm is preparing to ask the ITC to block new iPhones from entering the U.S. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is facing multiple lawsuits recently filed against it by Apple in the U.S. and China, as well as allegations of unfair practices filed in January by the Federal Trade Commission. 'Need the Courts To Decide' The complaints stem from the royalties Qualcomm charges for Apple's use of its broadband processors, which enable mobile phones to connect with cellular networks. Qualcomm's modem chip design was used to set the industry standard for mobile communications, and the company agreed to license its technology to phonemakers on "FRAND" ("fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory") terms. In a lawsuit filed in January, Apple accused Qualcomm of unfairly charging royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with," adding that the company had withheld nearly $1 blllion in fees owed to Apple as "retaliation" for providing information about Qualcomm to regulators in South Korea. Last Friday, Qualcomm announced that Apple had begun withholding payments to manufacturers "for the royalties those contract manufacturers owe under their licenses with Qualcomm for sales during the quarter ended March 31, 2017." Qualcomm added that action would lower its expected third-quarter revenues by around $500 million. On Tuesday, during Apple's second-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said that he didn't believe case law would support an attempt to block iPhones from being imported into the U.S. "In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount," Cook added.

Apple Might Delay Next iPhone Next Article > Some Cling to Landlines, But Cell-Only Homes Now Dominate By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: MAY 05 2017 Deborah Braswell, a university administrator in Alabama, is a member of a dwindling group -- people with a landline phone at home. According to a U.S. government study released Thursday, 50.8 percent of homes and apartments had only cellphone service in the latter half of 2016, the first time such households attained a majority in the survey. Braswell and her family are part of the 45.9 percent that still have landline phones. The remaining households have no phone service at all. More than 39 percent of U.S. households -- including Braswell's -- have both landline and cellphone service. The landline comes in handy when someone misplaces one of the seven cellphones kicking around her three-story house in a Birmingham suburb. "You walk around your house calling yourself to find it," she says. It's also useful when someone breaks or loses a cellphone and has to wait for a replacement. The Patterns Renters and younger adults are more likely to have just a cellphone, which researchers attribute to their mobility and comfort with newer technologies. The in-person survey of 19,956 households was part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey, which tracks landline use in order to assure representative samples in ongoing health studies. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point. Cellphone-only home have other commonalities. "Wireless-only adults are more likely to drink heavily, more likely to smoke and be uninsured," even after factoring for age and income, says Stephen J. Blumberg, the study's co-author (and a landline user himself). "There certainly is something about giving up a landline that appeals to the same people who may engage in risky behavior." Why that's so will require further research. The survey doesn't get into why people ditch or keep landlines, though landline users cited a number of reasons for hanging on in phone interviews and email exchanges with The Associated Press. No Choice in the Matter Plenty of people would get rid of their landlines if they could. It goes beyond complaints about cellular reception at home. Joe Krkoska, a supply chain director, needs a traditional copper wire for his home security system in Zionsville, Indiana. Getting rid of the line would require crews to drill holes in his home and put batteries in the bedroom. No thanks, he says. Chris Houchens, who works in sales and marketing, says his phone company forces him to get a landline with internet service. There's no cable TV alternative where he lives in rural Smiths Grove, Kentucky. And those who could drop phone service might pay more after losing package discounts. Martin Axel, a retired hospital administrator in Seal Beach, California, says dropping the landline would increase his cable bill by more than $40 a month. Emergencies Traditional copper phone lines have their own power supply, so those landlines still work during blackouts. Internet-based phones through the cable or phone company aren't true landlines, although the CDC counts them that way. The internet modem for these phones still needs power. Both kinds of landline phones are more dependable for 911. Even if you can't give dispatchers your home address, they would often have that already. Cellphones primarily use GPS for location, which means the dispatcher might know which building you're in, but not the specific apartment. For that reason, Trey Forgety of the nonprofit National Emergency Number Association recommends landlines for those who live alone and have a disability or medical condition. He says cellphone location accuracy is improving, but there's still work to be done. Spam Magnets In many households, the landline is a honey trap for telemarketers. "We never use the landline, and the only calls I get on it are from someone looking to sell me something," says Matt Lawrence, a management consultant in O'Fallon, Missouri. On the other hand, it's comforting to have a device just for calls -- without "all of the irritating bells and whistles of smartphones," says Brad Cooney, a Navy veteran in Brandon, Mississippi. "I can shut the (cell) phone off and still have a landline if someone needs to call me." Phone Nostalgia The landline harkens to an era in which a number is tied to a family and not an individual. You can call your parents' home and not play favorites in choosing Mom or Dad. Children can talk to Grandma at once from separate phone extensions. "My parents had landlines, as did their parents," says Axel, the landline user in Seal Beach. "It's probably a habit. It just feels more comfortable to me." Cynthia Dibblee, a retired teacher in Merced, California, has elderly parents who "can't remember our cell numbers but know the landline by heart." The Future USTelecom, a trade group for traditional phone companies, estimates that true landlines -- the copper kind -- now connect fewer than 20 percent of households. The group says companies have adapted by offering other types of services, including video and, for some, cellphones. Even so, phone companies get new landline customers now and then. Shawn Fisch, a 37-year-old teacher in New York, got his first landline after becoming a dad. When his son is old enough, he says, he'll need "an extra way to phone home." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

With over 90 per cent of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10 per cent repatriation tax would give Apple $US220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link With over 90 per cent of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10 per cent repatriation tax would give Apple $US220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients. Photo: Scott Brinegar US President Donald Trump's tax blueprint, which was unveiled last month, proposes allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10 per cent versus 35 per cent now. "Since one of the new administration's top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use," Suva said. The analyst is rated three out of five stars for his recommendations on Apple, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive Software as well as video streaming service Hulu. The analyst said the targets were screened considering five criteria - strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple's share price. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its cash hoard, Apple recently boosted its capital return program by $US50 billion, increased its share buyback program by $US35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 per cent. Shares in Apple were up 1.4 per cent to $US148.55 on Friday afternoon trade (Saturday morning AEST) in New York, extending their year-to-date advance to more than 28 per cent.

It was both a great time-saver and a boon to your productivity, especially on large screens. For reasons unknown, Apple has removed that functionality from the iTunes 12 update which was overhauled around a single-window workflow. Thankfully, the company has reinstated the ability to open playlists in new windows with iTunes 12.6. Here’s how to open your playlists in their separate windows using iTunes for Mac. How to open your playlist in a new iTunes window 1) Launch iTunes on your Mac. 2) Choose Music from the menu near the upper-left corner, then click the Library tab. 3) In the lefthand column, right-click or Control (⌃)-click your playlist underneath the All Playlists heading, then select the option Open In New Window from the popup menu. This will open a new iTunes window containing the selected playlist, as shown top of post. You can drag songs at will between the playlist windows and open as many playlists in separate windows as you like. I don’t have that many playlists created in iTunes so I was able to open “only” four playlist windows, but it worked like a charm. How to open an Apple Music playlist in a new window Playlists on Apple Music cannot be opened in their separate windows unless they’re in your iTunes library. To do so, follow the steps below: 1) Launch iTunes on your Mac. 2) Choose Music from the popup menu near the upper-left corner of the window, then click either the Library or the For You tab. 3) Find a playlist on Apple Music and click the three dots in the lower-right corner of playlist graphics to bring up the contextual menu, then choose the option Add to Library. 4) With the selected Apple Music playlist now in your iTunes library, switch to the Library tab, right-click it underneath the Apple Music Playlists heading in the lefthand column, then select the Open in New Window command. Just like that, the selected Apple Music playlist from your library opens in a new window. iTunes playlists windows and Split View Sadly, playlists windows in iTunes don’t support macOS’s useful Split View feature. If iTunes supported Split View properly, it could have been a great multitasking feature. In other words, you cannot browse your iTunes library in the main window and have your favorite playlist in its separate window in macOS’s Split View mode. And that’s it, boys and girls!

This is good news for Amazon Prime members who own the Apple TV 4 and are sick of the current method of streaming Amazon Videos to the Apple TV. Currently, users who want to watch Amazon Prime Video content on the Apple TV need to use an iPhone or iPad to AirPlay the content to the Apple TV. This is a hassle and not as reliable as simply watching content with an Apple TV app. Airplay issues are a common Apple TV problem. Apple and Amazon are often at odds with each other over how consumers can use their content and how Apple devices work with Amazon purchases and content as both players want a share of your money. This leaves consumers in a bad spot. Expect an Amazon Prime Videos app for the Apple TV later this year. Recode reports that high-level talks between Apple and Amazon finally reached a point where we will see an Amazon Prime Video App for the Apple TV later this year. The app is expected in Q3, which could certainly appear on stage at an Apple event for an iPhone 8 and potentially a new Apple TV. Read: Exciting Things the Apple TV Can Do It is unknown exactly what the App will support as Apple often limits what users can do in an app without the publisher sharing a part of any fees with Apple. While there is hope that you will be able to rent and buy movies on an Amazon Videos app for the Apple TV, this feature is not available on the iPhone or iPad. Instead, you must make all purchases on the Amazon website. Amazon stopped selling the Apple TV, due to disagreements between the two companies, and as Amazon focuses on selling the Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick. There is a chance that this will change with the introduction of an Apple TV app for Amazon Videos. 17 Exciting Things You Can Do With the Apple TV Rent Movies & TV Shows   1 / 17 The Apple TV is the center of your home entertainment system. You can stream movies and TV shows from a wide range of services.  This includes watching new releases from iTunes or watching your favorite TV shows on Hulu Plus. You can use Netflix and other streaming services so that you are covered when it comes to watching old, new, odd and super popular.   You'll also find CBS News, The Weather Channel, Vimeo, YouTuibe, Facebook Videos, VEVO, PBS and many other apps that allow you to stream videos and movies to your TV with a purchase or with a subscription.      1 / 17 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

For the last couple of years, Fitbit had led wearable sales, suggesting fitness trackers, not smartwatches, would be king moving forward. But then Tim Cook announced Apple Watch sales had “nearly doubled” since last year, and now a report by Strategy Analytics suggests Apple has overtaken Fitbit for the first time since the original Apple watch was released in 2015. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT The report claims Apple has shipped approximately 3.5 million smartwatches, up from 2.2 million last year, for a total of 15.9 percent of the wearables in the US. Fitbit, by comparison, shipped 2.9 million devices, 35 percent less than last year. But here’s some good news for everyone involved: wearable shipments have increased overall year over year, from 18.2 million in 2016 to 22 million this year. There’s some hope for the smartwatch yet.

The survey released by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 per cent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. "The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence," said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China's Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 per cent global market share, ahead of Fitbit's 13.2 percent. "Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market," said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. "Fitbit's shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year." Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 percent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models.   TAGS AppleiPhoneApple WatchApple gadgetsApple smartwatch World China's 'One Belt, One Road' project causing anxiety: US From Zee News 10 Photos which prove Zaheer Khan – Sagarika Ghatge make an...

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / General Tech / Music streaming services call for European Commission to end ‘app store abuse’ Music streaming services call for European Commission to end ‘app store abuse’ Matthew Wilson 14 hours ago General Tech It looks like rival music streaming services are getting sick of Apple and Google’s app store dominance, causing the likes of Deezer and Spotify to send in their complaints to the European Commission. The letter accuses Apple and Google of abusing their position as the largest app store holders, asking that an anti-competition investigation gets underway. According to a report from the Financial Times, a letter signed by the CEOs of Spotify, Deezer and several other companies has gone off to the European Commission, citing “troubling” app store practises from Apple and Google. The letter goes on to say that app stores have gone from being gateways into gatekeepers, implying that these app stores don’t do enough to highlight rival services. The EU has launched several investigations into both Apple and Google in the past, now with companies banding together with letters like this, there may be another one. One of the other key points in the letter is that when a customer signs up through an app store, these companies don’t get to see that data, though this is likely down to strong privacy policies. KitGuru Says: We don’t know if the European Commission will launch a new investigation into app stores at this point. However, the EC hasn’t exactly been shy about launching antitrust investigations over the last few years, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see a new one spring into action after this.

Print Story X Print Story Business May 5, 2017 Share Advertisement Apple starting US tech manufacturing fund with $1 billion SAN FRANCISCO: Apple chief Tim Cook on Wednesday announced Apple is creating a fund to get more people in the US to do "advanced manufacturing," kicking it off with a billion dollars. Apple investing in high-tech manufacturing in the United States would come as rare common ground with US President Donald Trump, who hammered away at the theme during his campaign for office last year. "We are creating an advanced manufacturing fund," Cook said in an interview broadcast on CNBC. "We are initially putting one billion dollars in the fund." Cook pointed out that apple spent more than $50 billion in the US last year -- buying from suppliers such as Corning Glass, working with developers behind applications for the California company´s devices and more. Apple has about 80,000 employees in the US and plans to hire thousands more "in the future," according to Cook. "A company should have values because a company is a collection of people, and people should have values," Cook said. "One of the thing you should do is give back." Apple planned to borrow money for the new fund despite having a fortune in coffers overseas because of the tax hit that the company would suffer if it brought profit home, according to Cook. And while Cook has been among Silicon Valley stars critical of Trump when it comes to limiting immigration, he endorsed a push for comprehensive tax reform. "To invest in the US, we have to borrow," Cook said. "Comprehensive tax reform is so important to this economy." The first investment of the new fund will be announced later this month, according to Apple. Cook described it as wise to explore common ground with the administration while standing up when there are disagreements. "Most people, if you disagree and say why, you have a good chance at influencing things," Cook said "You look to find common ground; if you don´t show up, I think that is the worst scenario because then you are quiet, and it doesn´t do your cause any good." Taiwan´s tech giant Foxconn in January announced a $7 billion investment to make flat panels in the United States in a joint project with Japan´s SoftBank.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory 11 martyred in Afghan forces’ attack on Chaman border SC forms six-member JIT Political leader told a lie, misled people: Justice Ejaz Army sparing no effort to serve nation: Gen Bajwa Lion will take away closed-eyed pigeon in 2018: PM View more... see all opinions Opinion Babar Sattar Panama: take two Aijaz Zaka Syed Echoes of Gaza in Kashmir Muhammad Aqeel Awan How to save the planet Murtaza Shibli Manufacturing optimism for all sides Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani Tolerant Pakistan Maya Goodfellow Media and sensibility see all opinions Newspost Out of water Poverty Child labour Work in progress A deadly virus View more... see all opinions Editorial Firing at Chaman Hidden report View more... see all opinions National PPP submits motion to discuss PM-Jindal meeting in NA No PC-1 approved emoluments to CPEC project employees PM asked to tell details of Jindal meeting SC takes notice of power abuse by feudal lord NAB’s meeting discusses monitoring and evaluation system View more... see all opinions World S Sudan ‘man-made’ famine could be catastrophic, charity warns China stresses security needed for new Silk Road initiative EU official angers Hungary with ‘anti-Semitism’ charge Polls show Le Pen lagging Macron by over 20 points in Sunday’s runoff ‘SL embassies sheltered criminals’ View more... see all opinions Sports Disappointed Misbah rues missed opportunities Azhar moves to number eight in Test rankings Abid Qadri named chef de mission for Islamic Games Pressure mounting on BCCI to name CT squad Aravinda de Silva quits as SLC chairman View more... see all opinions Business Asian Development Bank’s lending hits all-time high in 2016 Revenue board documents Rs56 billion real estate transactions in 5 months ADB delivered on most development targets in 2013/16: report Cement dispatches reach 33.88MT in 10 months Private sector credit rises 54 percent to Rs457 billion View more... see all opinions Karachi MQM lawmakers boycott PA session over custodial death of party activist Special home secretary to head probe committee World needs Sufism in the face of increasing polarisation, says Bilawal Focal person appointed for Chikungunya control efforts Abducted businessman rescued, kidnapper arrested View more... see all opinions Lahore CM assures farmers of due return for produce Swedish envoy calls on CM Missing boy found dead US diplomat meets CM Patwari held for corruption View more... see all opinions Islamabad ICT Health Department to launch awareness campaign to avoid outbreak Students urged to work hard for excellence in life AIOU, Unesco enter into agreement to promote non-formal education Reception hosted in honour of visiting Japanese minister NCSW holds seminar on cultural diversity and social impacts View more... see all opinions Peshawar see all opinions Advertisement PRIVACY POLICY | CONTACT US | BACK ISSUES © 2017 THE NEWS INTERNATIONAL Back To Top

Amazon will bring the Amazon Video app to the Apple TV in the third quarter of this year, according to Recode. With the app, users will be able to easily watch content from Amazon’s back library. As with competitors like Netflix, Amazon has invested heavily in bringing licensed and original content to Prime subscribers. The company acquired the Oscar-winning film “Manchester by the Sea” at last year’s Sundance Film Festival and has also produced or shown critically acclaimed TV shows like “Catastrophe” and “Transparent.” Read: HBO Classic Shows Including “The Wire” And “The Sopranos” Will Be Taken Off Amazon Prime Previously, Apple users with Amazon subscriptions had to rely on AirPlay to stream videos from a separate device to the Apple TV. Apple is considering to bundle its music, news and books with its planned video and TV service. Photo: REUTERS/Stephan Lam The move puts a temporary cap on some minor feuding between the two companies, as both have wanted to make themselves the exclusive place for users to buy and stream multimedia content. This dispute has popped up in several areas: while Apple hasn’t publicly made moves against Amazon, its policy of taking a 30 percent cut of in-app transactions has been onerous to the online retailer. For Amazon’s part, the company stopped selling Apple TVs in 2015. At last year’s Code Conference, Amazon chief executive officer Jeff Bezos said the Apple TV’s incompatibility with the Amazon Video app played a role in the move. “We want our player, our Prime Video player, to be on the device, and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms,” Bezos told Recode. “And so, you can always get the player on the device; the question is can you do so with acceptable business terms. And if you can’t, then we don't want to sell it to our customers, because they’re going to be buying it thinking they can watch Prime Video and then they’re going to be disappointed.” Read: Apple TV Rumors: tvOS 11 Could Allow For Multi-User Support With Tailored Profiles There’s no indication yet that the goodwill from this new policy will carry over to Amazon’s various iOS apps. iOS versions of apps like Comixology and the Kindle reader feature identical functionality to Amazon and Google Android versions, but because of Apple’s in-app transaction fees, Amazon took out the ability to make purchases in most of its iOS apps. But as Recode points out, the new deal would likely have needed approval by Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Amazon Prime Video’s move onto the Apple TV also underscores the increasing importance of video for Amazon. Unlike other social media networks’ recent investment in video and content, Amazon doesn’t need to worry about ad revenue. Instead, as with companies like Netflix and Hulu, it comes down to giving potential Amazon Prime subscribers a reason to stay with the service and continue to pay for it. For Amazon’s part, users that come for streaming TV shows and movies are just as likely to stick around and do their shopping on the service, too.

It's been two years since rumors about an "Apple car" first emerged. Not surprisingly, the notoriously secretive company hasn't divulged any details about its plans. But if a car is on the horizon, Cupertino can't stay quiet for too long. You can hide a smartphone in a lab, but it's difficult to not have a public presence when developing a vehicle, which requires road testing, typically in plain sight. Even if testing occurs at a private facility, it's almost impossible to hide from the prying lens of spy photographers, who make a living hanging around test tracks capturing car companies' heavily camouflaged prototype vehicles. Apple-specific details that have leaked out include an initial hiring binge that scooped up top automotive talent, inquiries about an autonomous car testing ground in Northern California, and even a trip to Germany for Tim Cook to reportedly inspect BMW's assembly process for its i3 electric vehicle. But despite reports that Apple's car project had hit the skids, the California DMV last month granted Apple a license to test autonomous vehicles on the state's highways. And last week, images of an autonomous Lexus SUV Apple is apparently using for self-driving R&D was spotted rolling through Silicon Valley. While this is a sign Apple is still in the game, there are other indications the tech icon is trailing the pack. Apple Is Behind The California DMV is a big step forward for Apple's autonomous car program, but also puts it behind 29 other companies already testing in the Golden State, not to mention elsewhere in the country. As for the Apple-outfitted Lexus recently spotted on public roads, MIT Technology Review declared that it looks more like "some of the vehicles that rolled into the DARPA Urban Challenge back in 2007 than it does with those being tested by Waymo or Uber." While Apple's self-driving test vehicle looks less refined than those from Ford or Hyundai—which better integrate various sensors and cameras—even more telling of potential problems are the people behind the wheel. Last week, the Wall Street Journal revealed that engineers serving as Apple's requisite "safety drivers" during on-road tests are PhDs in robotics from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The article suggests that having rocket scientists piloting test cars shows Apple "is still in the early phases of testing its technology." Jeremy Carlson, an automotive analyst with research firm IHS Markit, told MIT Technology Review using such high-level engineers could allow Apple to accelerate autonomous vehicle development. But Waymo employs trained technicians for this role, as I learned when I took a test ride in a Google Lexus. Related Apple's Project Titan Is Not About Building a Car Apple's Project Titan Is Not About Building a Car Meanwhile, Business Insider recently noted that Apple's new director of AI, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, is overseeing the Project Titan hiring process, implying the company is behind in building a team at a time when top self-driving talent is at a premium. Of course, Apple can afford to mess around with emerging tech, and you can never count it out when it comes to disrupting an industry. But it's clear Apple has some catching up to do.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 100 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing.

Those devices include, it is widely believed, Apple's forthcoming "iPhone X." Bulls see plenty of potential upside even past the company's new, higher forecast for the year. But bears still raise issues of competition and think investors shouldn't chase the stock gains -- the shares have almost doubled this year. By Tiernan Ray Updated May 5, 2017 12:49 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large A diagram of an "organic light-emitting diode" structure, or OLED, curtesy of Universal Display. Illustration: Universal Display Inc. Shares of Universal Display (OLED) are up $21.50, or 24%, at $111.35, adding to last night’s after-hours gains, after it handily beat Q1 expectation and raised its year outlook, citing "momentum" for products that use its organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology. OLED technology has steadily been working its way into the smartphone world and the television set world, as a replacement for the longstanding “liquid-crystal,” or LCD, technology. It shows up in the “Galaxy S8” phone introduced by Samsung Electronics (005930KS), which is, incidentally, Universal’s largest customer. And most Street observers expect Apple’s (AAPL) forthcoming “iPhone X” to use the technology for the first time in an Apple phone, this fall. Samsung is believed to be the screen maker for Apple, which would be nice for Universal’s sales of materials to Samsung, one would assume. Bears are regretting their caution today, in some cases, but not yet willing to “believe,” as the bulls urge. Goldman Sachs’s Brian Lee, reiterating a Buy rating, and raising his target to $125 from $100, writes this morning that it’s “time to start believing,” and that the revised outlook from the company doesn’t full capture the potential for sales this year. “We estimate that if revenues were to flatline off 1Q levels and one were to add in the $90mn Samsung licensing payment that is due for 2017, full-year sales would easily exceed $300mn. Lee notes the company’s going to earning “close to $1” this quarter, which would be almost as much as all of 2016. Looking at the $10.8 million in materials sales last quarter, Lee writes that there should be more “volume momentum” in that part of the business as Apple’s iPhone comes around in the fall, “based on our checks." Some bears still can’t believe it. Canaccord Genuity’s John Quealy reiterates a Hold rating, though he raises his target to $90 from $65, writing that "we’ve been flat out wrong sitting on our legacy, mildly bearish call on OLED adoption/monetization, as the inflection point for technology- enabled device adoption (TVs, handsets) has provided significant fuel to Universal’s business model near-term." Still, he writes, “while we acknowledge the compelling market potential of OLED technology, in the near to medium term, monetization pathways for the company need to become further de-risked." What does that mean? He’s still watching chemicals giant Merck to see what they can do that could push Universal out of the box: Looking at the larger picture, we view recent advancements in TADF and soluble emitters (and to some extent micro-LEDs) as risks to watch longer-term. Certainly, Universal’s phosphorescent materials and IP hold the throne in terms of performance, lifetime, and efficiency, but certain initiatives (e.g. Merck’s “HyperOLED” or CYNORA’s TADF) may possibly close the gap. That said, this quarter’s results have tempered our expectations in the urgency of a timeline for any larger shake-up in Universal Display’s dominant capture of the materials market. The next catalyst for Universal Display (and OLED shares) will be DisplayWeek 2017 in Los Angeles during the week of May 22. We expect a number of new announcements from the above mentioned companies and other advancements in materials tech from various research institutes and universities. Among other views today, Robert Stone with Cowen & Co., reiterating an Outperform rating, and raising his price target to $115 from $105, writes that the 400% surge in “development materials,” is an indicator of “upcoming new products” using the technology. And the year outlook raise is “driven by rising AMOLED display capacity plans across the industry,” he writes. While a lot of the royalty revenue this year depends on the success of products from Samsung and others, he sees other potential positives: Management noted increased confidence in commercializing a blue emitter, but timing remains hard to predict. If successful, a new blue PHOLED would also carry blue host material with it. A commercial partner for OVJP (organic vapor jet printing) could boost OLED TV penetration from our 2020E single digits. The TV market accounts for ~40% of total display industry sales, ~2x smartphones. Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna FinancialGroup, who has a “Positive” rating on the shares, raises his target today to $120, from $105, and writes that investors need to "consider the L-T growth drivers,” for the business, "such as increased penetration of WOLED TVs." TVs would have much higher dollar value for Universal, he observes: We estimate UDC's Emitter content in smartphone (SP) to be ~$0.20 vs. an estimated $12-$15 for Emitter content in WOLED TV. In this context, we remind investors UDC's secular story is not limited to just 2017 (with Apple's i8 adopting OLED) as L-T growth drivers such as WOLED TVs are expected to help sustain the growth well beyond 2017. He drills into the TV bit a little more: For illustration, we point to the recent report by LG Display. LGD’s reported Mar Q revenues was up 31% Y/Y and 24% Q/Q, which we only expect to accelerate into 2H17 as LGD ramps quarterly (White) OLED TV display production from 300k units/quarter to 500k units/quarter. This certainly bodes well for UDC’s Green Emitter sales growth. Additionally, we point to UDC’s Development Material sales in the Mar Q, which was up nearly 60% Q/Q and up 550% Y/Y. This is the key leading indicator of additional Emitter material sales in the future quarters as new customers, particularly in China, finalize their OLED manufacturing recipe before mass production starts. In short, TV application and China are two drivers that in our opinion will extend the Emitter Material sales growth well beyond 2017. Needham & Co.'s James Ricchiuti, reiteraing a Hold rating, writes "we would not chase the stock, and would look to become more constructive on a pullback." Ricchiuti, digging through the quarter's details, notes that the 21.7% operating profit margin was "an impressive metric for what normally is a seasonally weak quarter with at best modest profitability." Ricchiuti thinks its actually a little hard for the company to forecast its own materials sales: The obvious question is whether mgmt is still under-estimating the strength of the materials business, particularly considering that the 2017 revenue forecast has already increased $30M in just over two months since the initial guidance was provided. The answer may be that forecasting the materials business with its largest customer is simply too difficult to reflect with any degree of accuracy at this stage of the industry’s ramp-up. Gabelli & Co.'s Hendi Susanto, reiterating a Buy rating, writing that he sees "significant potential upside to Universal Display's financial projection." It's not just smartphone and TVs, he notes, it's also wearable technology -- "adoption of green emitter materials is still to come -- and virtual reality devices, "which require OLED displays, not LCD displays, Period." The "next big thing" is here, writes Susanto, with a swarm of investment in OLED capacity by Samsung and others: Worldwide competition for market leadership in OLED display production will ramp up and intensify among display manufacturers in Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. We continue to expect a significant increase in the global OLED display capacity building in 2017 and 2019, subject to new manufacturers' ability to achieve high production yield and scale out production volume rapidly. Samsung will invest $9 billion into new OLED display production facilities including expansion of its Gen- 6 fab, conversion of an existing Gen-6 LCD display fab to Gen-6 flexible OLED production, and new OLED assembly lines in Vietnam. LG Display shared its bullish goals: i) OLED sales to account for >50% of its total revenue in 2020, ii) from 2016 to 2020 its OLED TV production capacity will be 6x larger and flexible OLED display capacity will be 14x more, and iii) LG will invest in Gen-5 OLED lighting fab that will ramp production starting from 15,000 to 90,000 substrates/month in the future. Sharp is planning to invest $900 million to build an OLED display fab that produces 30,000 substrates/month in 2018. Apple can be the next big thing for Universal Display and major OLED display manufacturers. Speculation that Apple will adopt OLED displays in its next iPhone version is getting stronger and stronger.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Apple destroyed the value of apps by not allowing for demos and upgrades. No, wait. Developers destroyed the value of apps by flooding the market and racing to the bottom. No, wait. Customers destroyed the value of apps by only in-app paying for instant and ego gratification. No, wait... One of the most frequently recurring narratives surrounding the App Store is that it's responsible for the destruction of apps as a viable business for independent developers. Most recently, Matt Gemmell brought it up again: No company has done as much damage to the perceived value of software, and the sustainability of being an independent developer, as Apple. Not that other companies wouldn't have done the same thing — they would have. It's just that Apple was the successful one. Here's what I wrote in 2013, roughly four years ago today in the Market for paid apps and the sum of all compromises: Apple wants to keep [App Store] simple, so they compromise on features. Apple does not allow for demos or upgrade pricing, which means all purchases are, for all intents and purposes, one time, up-front, as is, and (mostly) sight-unseen. Customers want to avoid risk and paying any more money than they have to, so they compromise on buying apps they're not certain about. Since there's an abundance of cheap and free apps, absent urgent and immediate need or factors like addiction or ego-gratification, most people don't spend any significant amount of money on apps. Developers need to make a living, given the previous two realities, they compromise on direct income by holding sales, dropping prices, or trying alternate business models that involve corporate or VC funding, or value-added services. And here's what I wrote in 2016, just a year ago, in the App Store disconnect: Apple could — and I still strongly believe the company should — use its considerable power and influence to help shape the App Store economy into one more hospitable to indie developers. After all, those are the apps I love and the ones that dominate my home screens. But the truth is, even if Apple gave indie developers everything they wanted, it wouldn't matter much over the long term. It may help a few for a while, and a very few for a while longer, but the app economy and apps themselves are evolving. Since I wrote that, Apple has extended subscription options to many more types of apps, reduced review times, built out a response mechanism for app reviews, added search ads, and more. Yet, the pace of change has only accelerated. Even disruptors get disrupted In hindsight, it should have come as no surprise. Before the App Store, we lived in a dark age where only a tiny few could create, find, and benefit from apps in general, much less mobile apps. Now, apps are everywhere, for everyone, and for everything. They've gone from scarce to beyond abundant, from niche to beyond mainstream. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and other marketplace providers have afforded different levels of relative freedom and support, but it's the market that's driven the changes. Few want to hear or accept it, but the advent of ubiquitous, approachable, connected computing — primarily driven by the smartphone — made it inevitable. And it's hardly the first industry to be transformed in this way. It likely just came as a surprise to some that the traditional software business was as "traditional" as any other, and open to the same kind of disruption in the face of increased supply, availability, and competition, as any other. It's like going from local eateries in every village to McDonald's. But with digital, not McDonald's franchises — a single McDonald's that can instantly replicate copies of its food for everyone, everywhere. And one that's likely owned by a search or social company, or funded by venture capital, and is willing to give food away for free just to get that billion burger sign to twenty billion. (That's a clumsy analogy. Perhaps a better one would be mom-and-pop retailers in the age of Amazon.) Indie opportunities There's this rose-colored myth that, when iPhone launched, anyone could learn to code, make an app, sell alongside the oldest and biggest in the industry, beat them at their own game, and make a million or more bucks doing it. And a few certainly did, back when an incredibly smart app with incredibly good timing could take advantage of a nascent, relatively empty market. But that market is no longer so nascent nor so empty. As I've said numerous times over the years, I love my indie apps. You'll have to take PCalc and Tweetbot and Fantastical and 1Password and iStat and Linea and — you get the idea — from my cold, dead phone. And I think there will remain opportunities for those apps and apps like them for a while to come, because they offer a superior experience, provide compelling value, and target very specific pain points. Those apps and their developers achieved success on the App Store; they weren't entitled to it. I don't think anyone has ever suggested you should be able to make the 37th calculator, to-do app, or text editor in the App Store and expect to retire off the profits. But I do think some saw the initial gold rush and didn't expect things to be as tough or become as competitive as they have. The truth it, there's precious little space for even the third calculator, to-do app, or text editor anymore. Especially when home screens are dominated by the likes of Snapchat, Uber, and Pokémon Go — apps that are transformative but with complexity and scale most of us couldn't have imagined when the App Store launched. The only constant Most industries with indie communities don't have a company like Apple behind them. And Apple, for its part, seems actively engaged. The company continues to run promotions for indie apps, include indie developers in pre-release workshops, host them on stage during events, and will continue to provide new tools and, hopefully, new opportunities. I'd be interested in seeing what would happen if Apple added demos and paid upgrades, if only to remove them from the perpetual narrative one way or the other. I'd also be interested in seeing other creative solutions. In this industry, like many industries, there's probably a discussion to be had around everything up to and including "basic App Store income" — where a portion of market profits are used to support the most popular, most acclaimed, or otherwise most deserving apps and their development. If anyone can figure out which those are and how to handle them changing over time. No doubt the advent of the ubiquitous, connected devices like iPhone and Android, and unified, on-device marketplaces like App Store and Google Play, hastened not just the mainstreaming of apps but their commoditization as well. But only hastened. Scrivner is still viable for now in the age of Google Docs, but not at for the same $500 Wordstar used to charge, and the 37th Scrivner-like app probably isn't viable at all. Just like the traditional concept of apps has changed, the traditional concept of indie app development is and will have to continue to change along with it. Reader comments Indie dev in the age of App Store 7 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating Waziwoo I agree that Apple could do more to help Indie Developers by allowing them to offer paid upgrades and demos. I also think Apple could do a better job in restricting the sharing of Apple IDs among employees in small and large business organizations. Many small businesses (less than 10 employees) share a single Apple ID. One user buys the app and then the other nine employees download the app onto their iOS device. Thus, the developer only receives revenue for the first app purchase instead of for the other nine puchases. Example: App costs $10. If all 10 users buy the app, the developer receives $100. If one user buys the app and shares it with nine employees, the developer receives $10. The cause of this problem is partly Apple’s fault. It is not possible to buy multiple licenses via the App Store. They require you to register for a business Apple ID via the Volume Purchase Program or buy multiple gift cards. Neither of these options are practical or known by most end-users, so the default choice is to buy one license and share it with multiple employees. Solution: If Apple were to change their App Store policy and 1) Allow more than one license to be purchased at a time via the App Store or 2) Not allow multiple employees to share an app without paying for the additional licenses, then I think most Indie Developers would be very pleased as they would be earning additional income for what they feel they are entitled to. 0 13 hours ago Reply Bill Ewer I have been advocating for a robust free-trial feature for years. As of late I sent this to Tim Cook: A Case for allowing limited-time trial versions of apps into the App Store Trial versions of applications have been used extensively throughout the computer software industry to give potential buyers an opportunity to take a “test drive”. Many software developers and publishers offer fully functional versions for a specified time period. When the time is up the potential buyer is prompted to purchase. Where Trial Programs work best… As the purchase price of an app increases the buyer is more reluctant to purchase out-of-hand, preferring to either get assurances from other users or actually try out the app. App Reviews on the App Store leave a lot to be desired, especially when the only time a user will usually bother writing a review if the app doesn’t meet with user expectations. No one, especially business/productivity app users, want to take the time (and when asked for a review give it one star for being annoying). Further, current version App Reviews are removed when a new version supersedes it, even if the change is not in the app itself but for a contextual change or spelling correction the App’s App Store product page. These problems go away if the buyer could download a trial version. This especially true if the app is for business/enterprise/productivity. Few if any businesses will purchase any app without determining whether it meets their needs. Without the opportunity to test an app’s features and how well it does the job efficiently reduces the chances of getting a sale. It would seem to be an easy addition to the App Store (or, perhaps a “Business App Store). Apple would make allowances for two versions on the App Store, with one being the limited time period, the other unfettered. For its effort, Apple could take a bit more percentage (31%) for handling the transaction. The procedure for converting a trial app would entail the trail app to alert the user of the trail time period and would stop functioning at the end of the period. If the user then purchases the app the trail app gets updated from the App Store. 0 13 hours ago Reply masaoota I'm happy to pay a decent price for software if I'm confident it will do the job I need of it effectively. I need to be able to trial it before making the decision though as I can't afford to try 10 apps in the hope of finding one that works. There are some very simple Mac Apps which are utilities with limited but necessary functionality that I use. I used the free trial - it solved my problem- I paid $20 and another $10 ever year with every upgrade to Mac OS requiring an upgrade to the utility. I'm not thrilled by the cost but at the end of the day it is a model that works for me and the developer. 0 12 hours ago Reply TaptileApps Hi masaoota, as my experience as a developer with business apps in the iOS and the macOS AppStore, you are one of the very few, that seems to be willing to pay for an app and even an upgrade. The negative reviews and feedback emails, we got and get for taking a price over 2.99 ... or for releasing a paid upgrade after 3 years of free updates, were and are ... really annoying. So ... the reality for me is ... in our special case with our business apps ... the price is not driving more downloads if cheaper ... but the feedback you receive gets a lot more rude, if you sell your app for less. So ... for making a living, you will have to have more apps ... and much luck with marketing, to sell your apps. 0 10 hours ago Reply masaoota I should add that the apps purchased were direct from developers website - not from the apple app store. 0 0 sec ago Reply mikesax I wrote up a few comments.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this It's not too late for Apple TV 4K and HDR may not be enough for Apple TV to win the living room Why Apple is making its original TV content push now Video What happens to companies that depend on the iPhone? Amazon Prime Video has some of the best original TV shows and Oscar-worthy new movies (Best Picture winner Moonlight is coming soon), which is why it infuriates me that I can’t stream that content directly on my Apple TV. But that’s about to change. Recode is reporting that Apple and Amazon are working out their long-standing differences to bring a Prime Video app to the Apple TV App Store sometime this summer. Insert literally all the raised hands emojis here. My current workaround is to open the Prime Video app on my iPhone and then use AirPlay to beam whatever I’m watching to my Apple TV. It’s easy enough to do, but when faced with the choice of going through those extra steps or just watching whatever’s new on Netflix, I almost always choose the latter. (This is why I’m still not caught up on the third season of Transparent. I know, I know, don’t @ me.) [ Further reading: The best media streaming devices ] No word on whether Amazon plans to start selling the Apple TV again—the company kicked the device out of its store almost two years ago. At the time, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said that decision was because the Apple TV didn’t support Prime Video. Why? Money. Bezos said a Prime Video app wasn’t available for Apple TV because of a lack of “acceptable business terms.” When asked by The Verge whether those business terms involved Apple’s 30 percent App Store cut, Bezos said “private business discussions should stay private.” If Amazon Prime Video ends up on the Apple TV this summer, it’s because “acceptable business terms” have been agreed to. Whatever those terms are, it’s good news for avid TV watchers like myself. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Apple is no longer China's favorite phone manufacturer. The Silicon Valley giant has dropped out of the top three best-selling phones in China, according to new reports compiled by market researchers International Data Corporation (IDC) and Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Thankfully, it remains in the top five. Analysts have seen Apple pushed out by Chinese brands Huawei, Oppo and Vivo since last year. The brands account for one in every two phones purchased in China. Globally, Apple and Samsung snagged the top two positions in IDC's report on the global phone market share last week, with Huawei, Oppo and Vivo hot on their heels. While Apple has long enjoyed popularity in China and consistently maintains a presence in the top 10 list, it has seen declining sales in recent days. In an email to CNET, Counterpoint's industry analyst Neil Shah suggested it could be due to "iPhone fatigue" -- that is, existing users may not be upgrading "fast enough" to newer iPhone models. IDC previously attributed the reason for slowing sales to Chinese consumers waiting for Apple to unveil the next iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed similar views at an interview on Wednesday.

InvenSense, a California-based firm, is currently the main motion sensors supplier for Apple. However, the Cupertino company has reportedly placed orders with German company Robert Bosch GmbH, which was recently added to Apple’s list of suppliers. Bosch already supplies barometric pressure sensors for iPhones. The firm will now supply the iPhone with some of its motion sensors, pushing Apple’s need of InvenSense aside. The new order with Bosch will reportedly make up as much as half of Apple’s total amount needed. Read: Apple Potential Patent Violation: Supplier Imagination Technologies Launches Dispute Process With iPhone Maker The motion sensors contain gyroscopes, which can tell when the device is being held horizontally or vertically, when it’s shaken or pointing in a certain direction. The motion sensors also contain accelerometers, which detect other movements, like side-to-side motion. The sensors allow the smartphone to measure step count and are useful for games and augmented reality applications, Bloomberg said. The move will affect InvenSense, since Apple makes up 60 percent of InvenSense revenue. InvenSense supplied motion sensors exclusively for the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7. InvenSense CFO Mark Dentinger seemed to have previously suggested that the company could lose Apple as a business partner during an investor conference in 2014. “We’re still the largest player, but we are splitting some share now with our primary competitor,” said Dentinger at the time. “Historically, it’s unlikely that most of our customers will have just one supplier over a long, long period of time.” Meanwhile, InvenSense is looking to seal its $1.3 billion sale to TDK Corp. Apple’s plan to back away from InvenSense comes as the Cupertino company cuts its dependence from other suppliers. Read: Qualcomm Wants To Stop Apple From Importing iPhones Into US, Report Says Last month, Apple ended its contract with British firm Imagination Technologies, which supplied graphics-related components. Imagination Technologies supplied Apple with its PowerVR graphics processing units (GPUs), which were installed into every iPhone. Apple is Imagination’s biggest customer, making up about half of its revenue, less than what InvenSense makes from Apple. Imagination, which receives royalties from every sale of an Apple device that features its designs, including the iPhone and iPad, said Thursday it had begun a dispute resolution procedure" with Apple after the companies were unable to resolve a licensing disagreement. Imagination Technologies said Apple notified the company it was developing its own graphics processors for iOS devices last month. However, Imagination Technologies said last month it doubted Apple could go on without violating its patents. Another Apple supplier facing problems is Dialog Semiconductor. Apple is said to be developing its own power management chips, cutting the need to use chips from Dialog Semiconductor. Meanwhile, Apple is in a legal battle with chip supplier Qualcomm after filing lawsuits against the company. In response, Qualcomm countersued Apple last month and said the iPhone’s success wouldn't have been possible without the chip supplier’s technologies.

Wearable device shipments are on the rise, as are Apple’s sales, but Fitbit’s numbers are declining and the company laid off over 100 employees earlier this year. Apple knocks Fitbit from top wearables spot According to data from Strategy Analytics, about 3.5 million Apple Watch units shipped during the first quarter. That gives Apple 15.9% of the wearables market, up from 12.1% during the same quarter last year. In contrast, Fitbit dropped 35% year over year from 4.5 million units to 2.9 million. Those numbers put the company in third place behind Apple and Xiaomi with a 13.2% market share. This time last yer Fitbit held 24.7% of the market. “Fitbit shipped 2.9 million wearables worldwide in Q1 2017, falling a huge 36 percent annually from 4.5 million in Q1 2016,” said Strategy Analytics Director Cliff Raskind. “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitnessbands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market.” Fitbit’s Wearables Decline Fitbit was once the undisputed king of the wearables and fitness tracker market with products like the One, Blaze, and Surge. The company’s lead has been eroding as consumer interest shifts away from its more traditional fitness tracker products to smartwatches. Raskind added, “Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Fitbit has had to rethink its product lineup to respond to smartwatch makers including fitness tracking features in their products. Apple Watch is a perfect example, and Apple’s product design and marketing has gone a long way towards propelling the company’s device above Fitbit. Since Apple doesn’t share Apple Watch sales numbers—they’re pooled with Apple TV, iPod, and accessories sales—Strategy Analytics had to use other means to estimate its numbers. Considering the “other products” category that includes Apple Watch jumped up year over year from US$2.19 billion to $2.87 billion, and CEO Tim Cook said watch sales doubled, odds are pretty good SA is at least in the ballpark. For Fitbit, the numbers don’t look good. The company fell behind consumer trends, didn’t get into the smartwatch market early enough, and still insists on keeping customer data locked into its own platform. The company isn’t dead in the water, but it’ll have to deliver something really impressive to take back its position as the top wearables maker.

Insider sources say Amazon and Apple have finally come to terms, which should make many Apple TV owners very happy. With Netflix and Hulu available on Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video stands out as a glaring omission. Currently, streaming video from Amazon requires an iOS device sharing to Apple TV via AirPlay. Alternately, viewers can cut Apple TV out of the mix and watch via Amazon’s own Fire TV devices, but that typically means more remotes and switching TV inputs. Amazon Prime Video coming to Apple TV this summer Sources speaking with Recode say whatever was keeping Amazon off Apple TV has been resolved. Neither company is ready to confirm they’ve struck a deal. Bringing Prime Video to Apple TV makes sense because it extends Amazon’s reach into our homes, which is exactly what the online retailer wants. Amazon wants to be our first choice for shopping and entertainment, so being everywhere is a key strategy. Prime Video is also a strong driver for getting and retaining customers. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said, “We’ve been able to monitor the people who use Prime Video…they renew [Prime memberships] at higher rates and they convert from free trial at higher rates.” For Apple, Prime Video makes Apple TV a much more viable all-in-one entertainment appliance. Instead of needing multiple devices to watch our favorite shows and videos, we can watch everything through Apple TV, regardless of where it streams from. This may also finally end Amazon’s ban on Apple TV sales. The online retailer blocked Apple TV and Google Chromecast sales in 2015 because neither offered Amazon Prime Video support. Ironically, that support needed to come from Amazon. With Prime Video coming to Apple TV, online shoppers may soon be able to buy the device from Amazon again. They’ll also be able to watch Prime Video natively on their Apple TV instead of using AirPlay or a Fire Stick, like an animal.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Survey ranks Apple as #1 wearables maker Christian Zibreg on May 5, 2017 0 In a report issued Thursday market research firm Strategy Analytics said that Apple has overtaken Fitbit to become the world’s leading vendor of devices worn on one’s body, capturing sixteen percent of the global market for wearables in the March quarter. Apple sold an estimated 3.5 million watches during the three-month period ending in March, a 59 percent increase over the 2.2 million Apple Watch units sold in the year-ago quarter. According to Strategy Analytics data, rival Fitbit shipped 2.9 million units in March, marking a significant 36 percent drop from the 4.5 million Fitbits shipped in the year-ago quarter. Strategy Analytics stated: Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitnessbands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market. Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and they have a major fight on their hands to recover this year. The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling “relatively well” in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to “enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence,” said the research firm. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Chinese startup Xiaomi shipped 3.4 million wearable units, good for a cool fifteen percent marketshare worldwide. Demand for Xiaomi’s popular Mi Band fitness range was broadly flat across its core markets of Asia. Fitbit thus far has mostly focused on fitness bands and related accessories. That could change soon as the company is expected to add smartwatches to its portfolio. However, if an image leaked earlier this week (above) is anything to go by, Fitbit’s upcoming smartwatch slated for release this fall won’t win any beauty contest. Fitbit also plans on releasing a pair of Bluetooth earbuds, codenamed “Parkside” internally, alongside the smartwatch, according to two of Yahoo Finance’s sources. A photo of the upcoming $150 earbuds (below) was leaked to Yahoo Finance earlier this week. Last December, Fitibit acquired software assets of the struggling smartwatch maker Pebble for a mere $40 million. Following the acquisition, Fitbit put the last nail in Pebble’s coffin by cancelling all new hardware that Pebble had in the pipeline. Global wearables shipments reached 22 million units during the March quarter, marking a 21 percent increase year-over-year from 18.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Stronger demand for new smartwatch models in North America, Western Europe and Asia drove the uptick, said Strategy Analytics. The full Wearables Market Data repot is available on the Strategy Analytics website.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Amazon may launch its video streaming app for Apple TV in the summer Christian Zibreg on May 5, 2017 0 After pulling all Apple TV hardware from Amazon.com in December 2015 because it didn’t “interact well” with its video-subscription service, online retail giant Amazon has at long last warmed up to the idea of permitting owners of Apple’s set-top box to use its service. Recode reported Friday that the two companies are “close to an agreement” that would bring Amazon’s Video app to Apple TV in the third quarter of the year, possibly coinciding with the introduction of a next-generation Apple TV with support for 4K video streaming and more. “It’s unclear what got the two companies to reach an agreement, though some industry observers suggest that any pact would have been worked out, at a high level, by CEOs Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos,” said Recode. That app would let Amazon Prime Video subscribers watch TV shows and movies directly on their Apple TV set-top box without having to use AirPlay. It’s unclear if Apple TV hardware will be returning to Amazon.com anytime soon and whether or not the two tech giants might have settled other disputes involving their rival video ambitions. Last year, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said why they stopped selling Apple TVs: We want our player, our Prime Video player, to be on the device, and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms. And so, you can always get the player on the device; the question is can you do so with acceptable business terms. And if you can’t, then we don’t want to sell it to our customers, because they’re going to be buying it thinking they can watch Prime Video and then they’re going to be disappointed. And they’re going to return it. Currently, Apple TV owners and Prime members must use AirPlay to wirelessly send movies and TV shows to their Apple TV via Amazon’s pretty limited Prime Video app for iOS, which still won’t let you buy or rent individual programs without visiting Amazon.com first. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube “As we have already succeeded in developing an app for iPhone and iPad, we hope to make an app separately for the Apple TV,” said the online retailer a year and a half ago. The app was supposed to release before the end of 2015, but negotiations between the two tech giants obviously took a lot longer than expected. Earlier this year, Apple hired Amazon’s former Fire TV chief to head up its Apple TV business. Meanwhile, Amazon’s shopping app is available on the fourth-generation Apple TV with purchasing support for Prime members and other features.

Andrew Cunningham - May 5, 2017 4:12 pm UTC Enlarge / The fourth-generation Apple TV. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 87 Share this story At long last, Amazon will release an official Prime Video app for the Apple TV—at least, if a new report from Recode is to be believed. Citing "people familiar with the two companies," the report indicates that Amazon and Apple are "close to an agreement" that would bring Amazon's app to Apple's box sometime over the summer. Currently, watching Prime Video on an Apple TV requires you to sling it from the Prime Video app on an iPhone or iPad via AirPlay, a clunky-at-best solution that doesn't always work well and (from my own personal experience) reduces video quality relative to a direct stream. Because Amazon doesn't want to give Apple a cut of any of its video revenue, the current iOS app will only play video that you've already bought on Amazon in a browser or on some other platform. The Apple TV app will presumably have the same limitations. Further ReadingAmazon is apparently making a video app for the new Apple TV after all The arrival of a Prime Video app on the Apple TV would cap off almost two years of feuding between the companies. In October of 2015, shortly after the announcement of the fourth-generation Apple TV, Amazon said that it would no longer sell Apple TVs or Chromecasts in its stores. That remains true today—a search for "Chromecast" returns Roku and Fire TV sticks, while a search for "Apple TV" returns Roku and Fire TV boxes mixed with third-party Apple TV accessories. At the time, Amazon said that it pulled the hardware because they didn't offer Amazon Video apps; assuming that was the real reason and not just a convenient excuse to stop selling competitors' hardware, we ought to see the Apple TV return to Amazon sometime after the Prime Video app is released.

The survey released by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 per cent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. "The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence," said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China's Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 per cent global market share, ahead of Fitbit's 13.2 percent. "Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market," said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. "Fitbit's shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year."

The win comes at the expense of InvenSense, currently Apple's main supplier of those components. Bosch may supply as much as half of these components for the new iPhone, with InvenSense supplying the rest, the person said. Bosch already supplies barometric pressure sensors for the iPhone, according to product teardowns by iFixit and other firms that analyze the guts of gadgets. Bosch and InvenSense both make gyroscopes and accelerometers which are used to detect the position and motion of your smartphone. Last August, InvenSense Chief Financial Officer Mark Dentinger hinted that Apple was planning to add another supplier. “We’re still the largest player, but we are splitting some share now with our primary competitor,” Dentinger said. “Historically, it’s unlikely that most of our customers will have just one supplier over a long, long period of time.” Sourcing components from multiple suppliers allows Apple to negotiate cheaper prices and ensure a stable supply.

The survey released yesterday by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 per cent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 per cent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. “The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence,” said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 per cent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China’s Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 per cent global market share, ahead of Fitbit’s 13.2 per cent. “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market,” said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. “Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 per cent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week 25th anniversary: Five ways to play ‘Wolfenstein 3D’ today Experts say email is most favoured mode of cyber attacks in Malaysia Apple jumps to lead wearable computing with smartwatch ‘Dota 2’ expands appeal with storyline expansion ‘Smart’ denim promises touchscreen tech clothes Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ go on sale in Malaysia tomorrow Can an AI burglar alarm predict break-ins before they happen?

The news comes from Recode, which cites "people familiar with the two companies" as providing the leak. Amazon Video is the last major video app missing from Apple TV, not including All 4 and ITV Hub, and its addition would make the Apple TV a more attractive option as a set-top box. Netflix, Now TV and BBC iPlayer are all already available to use with the box. It's not been impossible to watch Amazon Video through an Apple TV up until now, as you can use Apple AirPlay to mirror your MacBook or iPhone's screen, but having a dedicated app will be much better for everyone involved. It's not clear if Apple and Amazon will come to agreements in other areas, such as the Apple TV being available to buy through Amazon's online store. You can't currently buy it as it's a direct rival to Amazon's own Fire TV box and Fire TV Stick. Similarly, you can't buy a Google Chromecast for the same reasons, although you can get the Roku players. If an Amazon app does come to Apple TV, you still won't be able to watch any content in 4K or HDR, as the Apple TV can't support it. However previous rumours have suggested that may soon change.  Neither Apple nor Amazon have officially commented on the matter, so we can't say for sure if this will actually happen. But if it does, the app should appear on Apple TV later in the summer.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Samsung and Apple Smartphone Shipments Fell Behind Local Brands in Q1 2017 in China By Zara Ali 16 hours ago 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Latest data from Counterpoint Research for the first quarter of this year has come in, and the trends don’t look encouraging for both Apple and Samsung. Apple’s iPhone shipments witnessed a steep fall of 15% year-on-year in China in the first quarter, resulting in a drop from 12.3% in Q1 2016 to 10.1% Q1 2017 for the Cupertino giant. Facing the worst of the fall is Samsung, whose shipments shrank by 60% year-on-year in China in the Q1 2017. Samsung witnessed a drop from 8.6% in Q1 2016 to 3.3% Q1 2017. Related How to Connect Samsung DeX to the External Display One of the primary reasons behind the decline of the giants is the rise of homegrown brands in China. The local brands are giving stiff competition to both Apple and Samsung. Brands like Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei witnessed a surge in their market share in China. In the report, Counterpoint states that Oppo’s shipments grew by 81%, Vivo’s shipments soar by 60%, and Huawei by 25%. Surprisingly, “Apple of China” – Xiaomi saw a fall of 34% in its shipments. Chinese smartphone market as a whole expanded by 4%, registering the fastest growth for mid-range devices that generally fall below Apple’s product catalog. Advertisement Commenting on smartphone segments, Research Director, Neil Shah notes in the report: The mid-tier $100-$199 and $300-399 segments were fastest-growing segments, mainly driven by Huawei, Oppo and vivo with strong offline plays. However, Apple has not been able to grow at the same pace in this segment which has capped its total-addressable-market to the 4000 RMB or $600+ wholesale segment. This is one of the key reasons that has put the brakes on Apple’s growth in China. Related Galaxy Note7 Refurbished Models Could Get an Early Release Thanks to the Latest FCC Approval In the super-premium tier, Apple still rules the chart with its latest devices grabbing 80% share. The company hold top five slots when it comes to premium devices costing 4000 RMB and above. On the other hand, Samsung only holds one slot in the premium segment with its Galaxy S7 edge, but even that comes after Huawei’s Mate 8 128GB and Vivo’s XPlay 6. On the whole, top-selling smartphones sales share (costing 4000 RMB or more) in China in Q1 2017 is ruled by Apple and Huawei with five and three devices on the list, respectively. Well, this report by Counterpoint shows that Samsung and Apple need to pull up their socks in China to stay in the game.

Carscoops Your daily scoop in automotive news About Contact RSS Mobile Social Media HOME NEW CARS SPIED CONCEPTS FUTURE CARS VIDEO GAMES OFFBEAT BRANDS TUNING REVIEWS Visual Comparisons Carscoops.com Elon Musk Says Robots Will Allow It To Exceed Apple's Market Cap | By Brad Anderson | ShareRedditPinTweetPlus Elon Musk is no stranger to crazy statements and in his latest proclamation, the Tesla chief executive says he believes Tesla can be worth as much as Apple. During a recent earnings call, Musk said that Tesla’s robot software that’ll drive the machines building the Model 3 and the batteries for it, will be so advanced and prove so profitable, that all other manufactures will try to replicate it. “I think this is just going to be a very difficult thing for other manufacturers to copy. I don’t know what to do if I were in their position,” he said. Musk prefaced his belief that Tesla could exceed Apple’s $700+ billion market cap by saying “I may be completely delusional” but remains confident in “going at the machine that builds the machine. “Which involves, by the way, a tremendous amount of software,” he said. “This is not just a bunch of robots that are sitting there. It’s programming of the robots and how they interact. And it’s far more complex than the software in the car.” Compared to Apple which uses overseas contract manufacturers, Tesla will manufacture most of the Model 3 in-house. Nevertheless, Market Watch rightly points out that in the last decade, Apple has sold over a billion iPhones, iPads and Macs and Tesla has yet to even build a million cars, let alone return anything close to consistent profits. In 2015, Musk described how he believed Tesla could hit the same market cap as Apple. “If we’re able to maintain a 50% growth rate for 10 years and achieve 10% profitability number and have a 20 P/E, our market cap would be basically the same as Apple’s is today. Now, that’s going to require a bit —on the order of $700 [billion]. Obviously, getting there will require some significant capex,” he said.

Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested people are waiting for the new phone instead of buying older ones. Apple posted quarterly iPhone sales of 50.76 million handsets in its earnings call this week. In the same period in 2016, sales stood at 51.19 million. Although revenue has continued to grow this year – up to $11.03 billion from $10.52 billion – the continued decrease in year-on-year iPhone shipments has surprised analysts and investors. Commenting after the announcement, Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested the company blames the iPhone 8 rumour mill for the flagging sales of last year's handsets. After being asked by UBS analyst Steve Milunovich to address recent findings that purchase intent is at a nine-year low, Cook said widespread media reports about the iPhone 8 "could" be responsible for the lower demand. "We're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones," MacRumours reports Cook said. "And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don’t know, but we are seeing that in full transparency." Although the iPhone 8 is still at least four months away, interest around its new features is already very high. The media has been behind the launch since the iPhone 7 was unveiled nine months ago, suggesting this year's handset, timed to coincide with the device's 10th anniversary, could be the most distinctive yet. Analysts have also chipped in, leading to talk of a "supercycle" that will drive massive sales of the new device. Apple hasn't changed the basic design of the iPhone in three years, making the iPhone 7 look conservative next to its contemporary Android rivals. The company will introduce a radical new look with its next handset, using a glass and metal body. The screen is expected to be an edge-to-edge panel incorporating an embedded home button and Touch ID sensor. With the iPhone 8 shaping up to be the most substantial generational upgrade in the device's history, it's likely that some buyers have decided to wait for the device rather than buy an iPhone 7 this year. Despite recent reports that the phone could be delayed by months, enthusiasm for the launch is still running high on social media. Analysts are anticipating multiple sales records to be broken again. Apple is now thought to be planning a launch in late 2017, just in time for the critical holiday season. It's considered probable that the company will unveil the handset during its traditional September devices event, leaving excited customers waiting a little longer to get their hands on the phone after it is announced.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Qualcomm could consider “nuclear option” in ongoing royalty dispute with Apple Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, May 5th, 2017, 05:46 Category: Hardware, iPhone, News Things are getting ugly between Apple and Qualcomm. Qualcomm, which has been in a heated dispute with Apple over patent royalty payment, may exercise the nuclear option by asking the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) to block iPhone imports. At the root of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm are cellular communication technology patents that Apple and others license from Qualcomm for a hefty fee. The tensions, which have been brewing for months, finally hit a new peak in January when the Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of anti-trust practices. Essentially the deals it was making with companies like Apple were considered unfair. Part of the issue was that Qualcomm was charging Apple a licensing fee for every single iPhone, whether or not every device used Qualcomm’s cellular technologies. As of the iPhone 7, Apple started mixing in Intel baseband processors to the iPhone mix. A few days later, Apple filed suit against Qualcomm for $1 billion. Qualcomm eventually filed its own countersuit. The subject of the royalty suits surfaced during Apple’s Q2 2017 financial report call on Tuesday when an investor asked Apple CEO Tim Cook why Apple was still withholding royalty payments from Qualcomm, thereby risking Qualcomm withholding future cellular modem sales to Apple or Qualcomm “potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world.” Cook stated that Qualcomm and companies like it must offer licenses to partners at fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Qualcomm, according to Cook, has not done that. Cook also made it clear that Apple believes it owes Qualcomm something, just not the amount Qualcomm is charging. It’s hard to say where this will go, but some industry watchers feel Qualcomm is dead serious in its threat. “I firmly believe that Qualcomm will pursue an iPhone import block and they are doing it to get paid for the IP Apple is consuming for free,” said Moor Insights & Strategy President and Principal Analyst Patrick Moorhead. “Apple isn’t going to come back to the table and Qualcomm isn’t going to change their 3gpp ETSI-agreed licensing process unless a court requires it.” Still, Qualcomm has yet to make such a move “No complaint has been filed with the Commission at this time,” U.S. International Trade Commission Public Affairs Officer Peg O’Laughlin said via email. The lack of paperwork doesn’t mean Qualcomm, which would not comment on this story, isn’t considering the move, but it makes it seem less like a dangerous action and more like something else. “Yes, it is a negotiating tactic,” said Analyst and Creative Strategies President Tim Bajarin, adding, “[Qualcomm] would probably not be able to get an injunction but could use this move to force Apple to be more proactive in dealing with this problem.” Should Qualcomm’s threats lead to a delay in the next-gen iPhone, this would be bad for both Apple and Qualcomm, but also lead to the vilification of Qualcomm among users and the media alike. This, in turn, would make it that much harder for Qualcomm to land deals with other device makers looking to incorporate their technology. Qualcomm will also get paid nothing. In effect, Qualcomm’s nuclear option could mortally wound Qualcomm. And when the dust clears, Apple would pick itself up, brush itself off, and eventually ship the next-gen iPhone with Intel’s cellular technology. Someone else would end up owning Qualcomm’s patents, probably a patent troll, but Apple would still have an easier time dealing with them. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

But the process itself is actually quite simple. We'll walk you through everything you need to know. Read More recently, I’ve become a user of both operating systems. Which means I need something that will work on all of my devices. I decided to take a look at Microsoft’s note-taking app, OneNote. Does it beat out Notes as my new favorite? Here’s what I found. Why I Love Apple Notes For a long time, I used Evernote. And I still think it’s a fantastic tool. But when I just want to jot a few things down, Evernote is overkill Thinking of Switching From Evernote to Apple Notes? Here's How Thinking of Switching From Evernote to Apple Notes? Here's How Apple has a free notes app, and it received a rather substantial overhaul with iOS 9 and El Capitan. But should you ditch Evernote for it? That depends. Read More . Formatting and organizational options fill up the screen and provide a more visually cluttered experience. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but I tend to prefer very simple apps to more complicated ones. Especially if I don’t need the full power of something more complex. Notes lets me add notes to different groups, but I only use one or two, whereas my Evernote account had dozens of notebooks and hundreds of notes. In short, it’s Notes’ simplicity that appeals to me. Especially on my phone: You can add text formatting with keyboard shortcuts or through the menus, but the menu bar doesn’t get cluttered up with panes and buttons. Typing an asterisk followed by a space starts a bulleted list. A number with a period and a space starts a numbered one. Links to web addresses are automatically added when you paste a URL. Folders sync with iCloud, and you can sync your Google Keep notes 4 Google Keep Tips And Tricks For Better Notes, Lists And To-Dos 4 Google Keep Tips And Tricks For Better Notes, Lists And To-Dos Read More as well.

Sketch with your finger or a stylus. It still doesn’t pack as much power as more full-featured note-taking apps. But it manages to strike the right balance between a text editor and an organizational system. OneNote: A Different Beast Microsoft’s OneNote, on the other hand, is quite different. It’s more of a competitor to Evernote than it is one to Apple’s Notes app. Notebooks, like stacks in Evernote, are high-level organizational categories. Sections separate things within each notebook, and each section can also have a number of pages. Sections can be combined into groups OneNote's Best Organization Feature Is Hidden in Plain Sight OneNote's Best Organization Feature Is Hidden in Plain Sight One of OneNote's best organization features is hiding in plain sight. Here's how to use the section groups feature to organize your books. Read More , which is a hugely useful organizational feature. Each page can contain text, images, links, tables, lists, and just about anything else you want to keep there. You can even embed YouTube videos just by including the URL. Like in Notes (and many other modern apps), you can sketch with your finger or a stylus. The formatting pane in the main window lets you add some cool symbols — almost like a bullet journal How to Use Evernote as a Bullet Journal How to Use Evernote as a Bullet Journal There are many ways to use calendars and to-do apps. Take Evernote, a journaling system called the Bullet Journal, and no coding experience whatsoever, to create a completely tailored organization system for yourself.

(You can see the star and question mark I added with this method in the image above.) If you decide to adopt this system, it turns OneNote into a great way to take notes. And its mobile options mean you can use it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android. As you might expect, OneNote has a bunch of other cool features owing to the fact that it’s a full-featured app. Many of these features set it apart from Notes. For example, OneNote can do math for you. Just type in an equation and OneNote will run the calculation. You can also click anywhere on the page to start a new paragraph, making it easy to comment on images or organize your notes the way you see fit. The web clipper, quick notes templates, custom tags, note links, version history, and very useful docking all set OneNote apart from Notes. There are a lot of other really cool things it can do 7 Little-Known OneNote Features You Will Love 7 Little-Known OneNote Features You Will Love OneNote is 100% free and packed full of advanced features. Let's check out some of the ones you may have missed. If you're not yet using OneNote, these may win you over. Read More , too. Which Is Right for You? As you can tell, these two apps are very different. In many ways, OneNote is much more similar to Evernote than it is to Apple’s Notes app (though there are some notable differences Evernote vs. OneNote: Which Note-Taking App Is Right for You? Evernote vs. OneNote: Which Note-Taking App Is Right for You? Evernote and OneNote are amazing note-taking apps. It's hard to pick between the two. We compared everything from interface to note organization to help you choose. What works best for you? Read More there, as well). Unsurprisingly, the two apps are likely to appeal to different types of users. One of the biggest determining factors is if you’re using a non-Apple device. Notes Pros When I use my Windows computer, I can access Notes through the iCloud website. It’s just like using the app, except that it’s browser-based. If you don’t mind using a browser for your note-taking, this is a great way to go. OneNote Pros OneNote has an online version as well, but because you can download the app on pretty much any device, you’re less likely to need it. Having notes synced between different devices with different operating systems is a huge benefit to using OneNote. Ties Both apps store notes on their company’s cloud storage (iCloud for Notes and OneDrive for OneNote), so that’s not likely to be a determining factor in your decision. And because both are completely free, that’s not going to help you either — though it does make OneNote a compelling alternative to Evernote Migrating From Evernote to OneNote? Everything You Need to Know! Migrating From Evernote to OneNote? Everything You Need to Know! OneNote is one of the best alternatives to Evernote and it's free. We'll show you how OneNote is different and show you the tools to migrate smoothly. Read More . The Decision In the end, it’s likely to come down to whether you want a more full-featured app or a simpler one. Notes is only a couple steps beyond a text editor. It has some very useful features, but it does its best to stay out of your way. It’s a very uncluttered interface. OneNote, on the other hand, presents you with a lot of great tools. You can get rid of the ribbon at the top of the screen to clean up the space, which is nice (there’s even a keyboard shortcut for it). But a lot of what makes OneNote great is contained in that ribbon, so you’re giving up easy access to what might make you choose OneNote in the first place. Similarly, hiding the navigation is great for working on a single note, but makes it harder to move between the things you need to work with. Your Note-Taking Priorities Sorted Much like many other software choices, you’ll have to think about your priorities. Will you give up cross-platform compatibility to keep a simple and uncluttered interface? Will you want the power of tagging, drawing, and more organizational options? The answers to these will likely determine which app you’ll want. As for me, I think I’ll be sticking with Notes. Er, maybe converting to OneNote. But probably… well, who knows? Do you use either of these apps? How did you choose between them? Do you have a cross-platform alternative for Notes? I’d love to hear about it! Share your thoughts in the comments below.

autoevolution cars moto news car reviews spyshots driven cars newspaper green Compare Cars BAC Calculator   Editorial Coverstory Motorsport Testdrives archive Auto Shows Tuning Car Finder Photo of the Day Glossary of automotive terms Masthead RSS Feeds Elon Musk Is Amused by the Idea of Apple Buying Tesla   5 May 2017, 14:45 UTC · by Vlad Mitrache / Home / News / Industry Wouldn't this be the equivalent of Brad Pitt marrying Angelina Jolie? Can you imagine the combined coolness of Tesla and Apple coming together one way or another? The simple idea is probably giving fanboys of both brands the goosebumps. Well, we're not so sure Elon Musk would be too crazy about it, though. And that's because the only way the two giants could become one is if Apple decided to buy Tesla. No matter how much Tesla has grown over the past four years (its value has increased tenfold, if you need to ask), it's still only a sardine compared to the shark that is Apple. The Cupertino company now has a cash reserve of over a quarter of a trillion dollars. That's $256.8 billion, to be exact, ready to be spent at any time. And what could Apple do with that money? If it took part in a beauty pageant, the answer would probably be "save the world and put an end to poverty and hunger," but since Apple's single goal is to make even more capital, the real one might vary a little. Despite never graduating from the rumor level, Apple is believed to have tried and failed to enter the car industry with its Titan project, now reshuffled to focus solely on car connectivity and self-driving technology. If that interest is still present, the IT giant might be tempted to take the shortcut and buy an already established name, especially since Tesla's market cap revolves around a mere $46 billion. Morgan Stanley analyst Adan Jonas did the math and took advantage of Tesla's earnings conference call two days ago to pop the question. Elon Musk was visibly amused, but apart from implying there's no reason to talk about something like this, he didn't have much to say. Here is how the conversation went about, as reported by BGR: Adan Jonas: "Apple has enough net cash I think to buy Tesla, like more than three times over. Is there anything that Apple does or has, besides having more money than they know what to do with, that could be helpful in Tesla’s mission to accelerate the transition to shared autonomy and sustainable transport? Could they be the type of firm you could partner with, and is this something you could talk to Tim about?" Elon Musk: "Yeah, I don’t think they want to have that conversation,” Musk answered. “At least I’ve not heard any indication that they do. Obviously Apple continues to make some great products and, yeah, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it’s cool. I mean… I don’t know what else to say.” We don't know what car Tim Cook is driving, but we're pretty sure that if it's an electric, it has to be a Tesla. So even though the gap in the companies' value is so great, when it comes to their CEOs using each other's products, it's a draw.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile There’s one thing that really has me worried about the iPhone 8 Image Source: Vianney le Masne Zach Epstein @zacharye May 5th, 2017 at 10:29 AM Share Tweet At some point this summer while I’m cursing myself for installing an unstable iOS 11 beta on my personal iPhone, I’ll hit the 10-year mark from when I purchased my first iPhone. I was a longtime Nokia smartphone user at the time, but it became obvious to me fairly quickly that the Symbian platform as it existed in 2007 would soon be a relic of the past. Little did I know that Symbian itself would crumble completely, eventually taking Nokia’s entire cell phone business with it. But I digress. Whether or not you’re an Apple user, the iPhone’s tenth anniversary is a big deal. Every single smartphone on the planet right now exists as it does today because of the iPhone. Can you even imagine what Android phones would be like if Google had launched the awful BlackBerry clone it had been building instead of going back and retooling the platform in response to the iPhone? I couldn’t be more excited to see what Apple is cooking up for the iPhone’s tenth anniversary, and rumors suggest it’s going to be something special. But there’s one rumor in particular that really has me worried about the iPhone 8, and I’m growing more concerned with each passing day. Don't Miss: No iPhone user can even imagine dealing with what Android users have to tolerate While nothing will truly be confirmed until Apple unveils the iPhone 8 on stage later this year, there’s enough information out there right now from reliable sources to paint what will almost certainly be an accurate picture of Apple’s next-generation flagship iPhone. According to reports, the iPhone 8 will be a complete reimagining of an Apple smartphone. It might not be called the “iPhone 8,” by the way, but it will undoubtedly look a great deal like the renders we’ve seen so far. Rumor has it the iPhone 8 will feature a large 5.8-inch OLED display with a new, taller aspect ratio. LG’s new G6 has an 18:9 ratio and Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ are 18.5:9. The iPhone 8 will likely match one of those two ratios, and it will also likely match the more important common thread that connects these new flagship smartphones: Much thinner bezels than we have ever seen on a widely available flagship phone. Since the physical home button will be removed from the iPhone 8 and the bezels will be shrunken, Apple will be able to squeeze a 5.8-inch screen into a phone that’s about the same size as the iPhone 7. That’s right, if the rumors pan out, the iPhone 8 will be about the size of Apple’s current 4.7-inch iPhone, but it will have a screen that’s larger than the one on the company’s current 5.5-inch iPhone. Ever since Apple released its first phablet in 2014, I’ve griped that it’s far too large to use comfortably with one hand. In 2017, I finally relented and opted for the iPhone 7 Plus over the iPhone 7. I still hate how oversized the device is for a phone with a 5.5-inch screen, but one-handed usability is a sacrifice I was willing to make for huge improvements in two areas: Screen size and battery life. According to multiple reports from trustworthy sources, Apple will release three new iPhone models later this year. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will be followups to last year’s iPhones with modest upgrades, and then the iPhone 8 will be the first of its kind. The 8 will be the phone everyone wants, of course, because it will be the phone that features Apple’s sleek new design. But the iPhone 7s Plus may have a huge advantage over the iPhone 8 that’s going to be difficult for some users to pass up. You guessed it… battery life. Don't Miss: Maybe Tim Cook should blame the iPhone 7’s three-year-old design for declining sales I forgot to plug in my iPhone 7 Plus last night before I went to sleep. That means when I woke up this morning, it had been more than 24 hours since my phone had last been charged. It still had 21% remaining in the battery. Incredible. If you’re an iPhone 7 user, or if you use just about any Android phone currently available, there is no way you can go through a full day of typical usage and still have more than 20% left in the tank the next morning. My iPhone 6s last year could barely make it through my 10-hour workday without needing to be charged. In a nutshell, I no longer think about my phone’s battery life. Ever. I don’t have to check my remaining charge every time I leave my home or office, for fear that I might not have enough juice left to make the trip. And I don’t have to slap on a big bulky battery case that barely fits in my pocket just to make it through the day. If Apple’s new iPhone 8 really is about the same size of the iPhone 7, and it almost certainly will be, it likely means a huge step backwards in terms of battery life. I’m really not sure I can go back to living like that. One sketchy leak suggested that Apple will actually include two separate batteries in the iPhone 8. One will be a larger battery similar to the one in the iPhone 7, and a second smaller battery will supposedly occupy some available space inside the other side of the phone near the bottom. A second battery would undoubtedly help matters, but the source was a post on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, so this rumor is still unconfirmed. Like most iPhone users out there, I can’t see myself opting for an iPhone 7s Plus over a completely redesigned iPhone 8, even if Apple does give the 7s and 7s Plus design a small update with new glass backs to enable wireless charging. I want an all-screen iPhone. I want an OLED display with an embedded Touch ID scanner. I want color-matched stainless steel edges. I want a phone with a nice big display that can actually fit comfortably in my hand. But if all that comes at the expense of all-day battery life, many iPhone users like me are going to have a difficult decision to make.

The survey released Thursday by Strategy Analytics showed Apple grabbed a 15.9 percent share of the wearables market in the first quarter. While Apple does not release sales figures for its Apple Watch, the estimate by Strategy Analytics showed a 59 percent jump in sales from a year earlier, with 3.5 million units sold in the first three months of the year. "The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence," said Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston. Fitbit, which has been a longtime leader of the wearables market with its fitness bands, slipped to third place on a 36 percent slide in sales in the first quarter, the research firm said. The survey found that China's Xiaomi, which makes a budget-priced fitness band, was the second-largest vendor with a 15.5 percent global market share, ahead of Fitbit's 13.2 percent. "Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market," said Strategy Analytics researcher Cliff Raskind. "Fitbit's shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year." Overall, the report said sales of wearables rose 21 percent from a year earlier to 22 million units, led by stronger demand for new smartwatch models.

The reign of Fitbit has come to an end, however, as Apple claimed the top spot for Q1 2017. This comes from a report by Strategy Analytics, who shared that Apple shipped more than 3.5 million Apple Watches in the first quarter. The report also showed that Fitbit’s market share dropped by 35%, moving from 4.5 million units to just 2.9 million. The dramatic drop places Fitbit in 3rd place globally, behind the likes of Apple and Xiaomi. The fall from grace for Fitbit isn’t all that surprising considering the fact that the company was forced to cut up to 10% of its workforce. That comes after seeing an extremely poor performance in Q4 2016. However, there was some hope for the future after Fitbit acquired the likes of Pebble and Vector, but it seems that isn’t the case. A recent leak showed off Fitbit’s rumored entrance into the smartwatch market, but if that was indeed the final product, the company may continue to be in trouble. The smartwatch looks like a redesigned Fitbit Blaze while featuring a rather odd-looking design. The watch has been delayed until later this year, but it would appear that Fitbit has a lot of work to do to get its customers back. It will be interesting to see how Fitbit plans to rebound, but it definitely seems like the company has its work cut out.

(BRK.B) Stock Why Centurylink Inc (CTL), L Brands Inc (LB) and Viacom, Inc. (VIAB) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) and Warren Buffett are not only two names that are practically synonymous, but two names synonymous with successful investing. Berkshire stock hasn’t just beat the market since starting the business in 1964 — it’s embarrassingly crushed the S&P 500’s performance. Source: Shutterstock The secret to Buffett’s isn’t exactly a secret. He’s a value investor, and employs that approach with a fierce discipline. At 86 years of age, though, Buffett has not only backed off on the amount of dealmaking he does for Berkshire Hathaway, he and Charlie Munger have (mostly) passed stock-picking torch to a new, younger dynamic duo of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. They are being groomed in the Warren Buffett way, of course, but when one takes a step back and looks at some of the decisions his appointed chiefs have made of late, it’s becoming clear today’s Berkshire Hathaway isn’t the great one investors came to know and love years ago. It’s not clear Berkshire stock is built to perform as well as it has in the past. Things Are Changing for Berkshire Hathaway To be fair, it’s all too easy to pick apart decisions and comments made by Berkshire’s people. The company and Warren Buffett are always in the public eye, and consistently required to serve up some sort of sound bite. It’s inevitable they’ll say or do something contradictory or inconsistent in their effort to fill the voids of silence. A couple of things said and done of late, however, have been alarmingly un-Buffett like. Chief among them is the decision to take on a sizable stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). As of the most recent reported look, Berkshire Hathaway owned 133 million shares of AAPL, or roughly $19 billion worth of the consumer technology behemoth, doubling its stake from just two quarters ago. It was a surprising buildup in a tech position simply because the Oracle of Omaha has eschewed tech in the past. That’s fine. Things change, and Buffett is exactly right when he says that Apple makes consumer products that are very sticky … meaning iPhones are difficult to put down, and crowds always clamor for the next iteration. Buffett even seems to have his finger on the pulse of consumer sentiment regarding the iPhone, recently commenting: “It’s very hard to figure out how much people delay their buying of iPhones because of the launch of a new one in six months… [But] a lot of people are waiting. If you knew a new car was coming out tomorrow … and you had to pay the same, roughly the same, I don’t know what they are going to sell the new [iPhone] at but close to the same for the last year model, you are probably going to wait.” The mindset sets the stage for two key concerns, however. One is, there will come a time when iPhone-mania hits a saturation wall, but Buffett (like so many other) isn’t acknowledging the secular-cycle nature of the popular product … something in the past he likely would have foreseen in other industries like air travel or railroads. The other concern is, the suggested retail price of $1000 (if not more) for the next version of the iPhone isn’t exactly “close to the same” price as the newest iPhone is. As such, the release of Apple’s next phone may well coincide with the tipping point for Apple itself, where it transitions from a must-have investment to a can-live-without-it kind of stock, as consumers finally decide there’s too much of a premium in owning the newest iPhone. And no, Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway may not see the end of iPhone-mania in time to do anything about it. One only has to look at how the investment fund mishandled International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) as evidence that Berkshire’s brightest are anything but infallible. In some ways one has to admire the willingness to stick with International Business Machines for as long as he has. Berkshire Hathaway began accumulating IBM shares six years ago, only to see it top out in April of 2013 and spend the next three years losing 40% of its value. Big Blue shares bounced back to roughly a breakeven between early 2016 and early 2017, and Berkshire used the move as an opportunity shed a third of its stake in International Business Machines. It’s still holding the other two-thirds of its stake, though, which has been back in freefall mode.

Amazon employees expect the app to show up on Apple's hardware in the third quarter. It’s unclear what got the two companies to reach an agreement, though some industry observers suggest that any pact would have been worked out, at a high level, by CEOs Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos. Amazon and Apple are direct rivals in the streaming set top business. Amazon has its Fire TV and Apple offers the Apple TV. In the fall of 2015, Amazon stopped selling the Apple TV saying, "Over the last three years, Prime Video has become an important part of Prime. It’s important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion." To watch Amazon shows on the Apple TV, users currently have to AirPlay from their iPhone to the Apple TV via Wi-Fi. Purchasing or renting programs on Amazon's Prime Video app requires visiting Amazon first. It's unclear if the agreement between the companies covers improvements to the iOS app as well.

Apple could also build out the supply chain needed to support more U.S. hardware production. The fund could prove politically useful, given the Trump Administration's push toward American manufacturing.

According to the report, total shipments of wearables globally reached 22 million units in the first quarter of this year, and Apple captured 16 percent of that marketshare, with 3.5 million wearable devices shipped in the prior quarter — an increase of 1.3 million from the first quarter of 2016. While it’s likely that most of these sales represented Apple Watches, it’s important to keep in mind that Apple also includes products such as AirPods and Beats headphones in its “wearables” category, and the research report refers to “wearables” in general, defining that as “products such as smartwatches, fitnessbands and smartglasses.” The report also attributes the results to a 21 percent annual increase in global wearables shipments, citing the cause as “stronger demand for new smartwatch models” in several regions, and notes that “the new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere.” [via MacRumors] Comments « Amazon Prime Video may finally be coming to Apple TV Daily Deal: Just Mobile Xtand Car Vent Mount for Smartphones » Related Stories Several major apps ditching Apple Watch support?

According to February 2017 comScore MMX data, Apple and Google Shopping placed fifth and sixth, respectively, among the UK’s top 10 retail companies as ranked by unique visitors to their desktop brand sites. Those two choices were nowhere to be found on the comparable list from March 2016. Those additions displaced UK apparel retailer Next and grocery chain operator J Sainsbury (Sainsbury’s) from the top 10 list. Other homegrown retailers feeling the squeeze were department store and grocery operator John Lewis Partnership (John Lewis, Waitrose), which dipped one spot to seventh; electronics and mobile phone retailer Dixons Carphone (Carphone Warehouse, Currys PC World), which fell one position to eighth; and department store and grocery chain Marks & Spencer (M&S), which fell two spots to 10th. Walmart, owner of grocery chain Asda, also lost ground, sliding from fifth to ninth. The only homegrown retailers to hold their places on comScore’s list were Home Retail Group, owner of general merchandise retailer Argos and home decor merchant Habitat; and grocer Tesco, at third and fourth, respectively. Among the list’s members, only M&S has revealed any plans that might push it back up among the UK’s top online retail destinations. Steve Rowe, the retailer’s CEO, told The Guardian last week that M&S would begin testing a full-fledged online grocery shopping service this fall. Currently, M&S only provides shoppers the ability to buy some party food and gift items online for in-store pickup. —Cliff Annicelli New Report in eMarketer PRO This Week Advancing Programmatic Advertising As programmatic advertising matures, buyers and sellers no longer see it merely as a means of automating processes, but rather as an advanced method of controlling ad campaigns—and better targeting the audiences that come with them.

Supplier Is Selling Parts of Itself to Survive After disclosing that Apple doesn't plan to use its graphics technology going forward, this semiconductor intellectual property vendor is planning to shed its non-graphics businesses. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 5, 2017 at 10:30AM About a month ago, semiconductor intellectual property vendor Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) gave investors just about the worst piece of news that it possibly could have: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), its biggest customer representing about half of its total revenue, plans to design Imagination out of its future A-series applications processors. Now, just a month after the company's bombshell announcement, Imagination has announced that it plans to sell two of its three intellectual properties: its MIPS processor cores and its Ensigma connectivity intellectual properties. Image source: Apple. "While the Group has continued to invest in its MIPS and Ensigma businesses, it has now decided to actively market these businesses for sale, concentrate its resources on PowerVR, and strengthen Imagination's balance sheet," a press release published on the company's website read. Let's take a closer look at why Imagination is doing this and what it could mean for the struggling graphics specialist. Raising cash for the inevitable burn Imagination is clearly planning to continue to invest in its PowerVR graphics business, even though it seems that its largest customer of these technologies is about to go away. "With continued investment, the Group considers PowerVR to be well placed in mobile, automotive, digital TV/set top boxes and the rapidly emerging AR/VR market and having the potential to exploit investments for artificial intelligence in the medium term," Imagination's press release said. Considering that Imagination is barely profitable even with Apple's business, it'd likely burn substantial cash once Apple leaves -- assuming a largely similar operating expense structure as what the company has in place today. Since Imagination seemingly wants to protect its investments in PowerVR graphics technology even with the loss of Apple, it will likely need to deal with significant cash burn until it can cultivate additional, substantial PowerVR revenue streams. For Imagination to be able to withstand that cash burn, having a large cash buffer will be critical, which is why I think Imagination is planning to jettison the MIPS and Ensigma businesses. Can PowerVR succeed without Apple? Imagination has seemingly been trying to build out its PowerVR business beyond Apple for a long time, and yet Apple still makes up the bulk of PowerVR-related revenue. In Imagination's press release, the company cites opportunities in several potential segments (mobile, automotive, AR/VR, set top boxes, and even artificial intelligence), but given how poorly the company has done in the non-Apple smartphone market, investors should be skeptical that Imagination can translate those opportunities into true revenue and profitability. To make matters worse, as I've written about before, given the serious doubts around Imagination's long-term viability, I suspect that it will be increasingly difficult for Imagination to retain its current customers/design wins, let alone capture share from its much more financially secure rival, ARM Holdings. Imagination might be able to succeed over the long term if it builds up a large enough cash reserve and plays its cards right, but I wouldn't be surprised if, after Imagination sheds the MIPS and Ensigma assets, Imagination ultimately tries to sell itself before it runs out of cash.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Thoughts on That Rumored Siri Voice Canister  May 5, 2017May 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Rumors have it that Apple may ship its Echo and Google Home competitor as early as WWDC. The timing would be classic Apple: let the early players work out the kinks in the market, then come in with something you think is more nicely designed and works better than the devices that founded the category. No doubt a Siri Voice Canister would look better than the $179 Amazon Echo. I love how the slightly cheaper Google Home looks, but I found its touch surface to be a little lacking. A Siri Voice Canister carved of a single block of aluminum with a multitouch control surface? Sign me up. The other side of this isn’t as positive. I don’t think Siri works as well as these other voice assistants in some contexts. I rarely have my Echo misunderstand my words or misinterpret them, and Google is basically king of the hill here. Additionally, Apple’s reluctance to open Siri to more third-party services means its not as extensible as something like Alexa with its Skills program. If this product is real, I think Apple has to expand SiriKit into a much richer platform. The Siri Voice Canister will have to be able to work without a paired iPhone present. I’ll be looking for that at WWDC, even if there is no hardware announced. In thinking about what physically goes into a product like this, its clear Apple has all the expertise needed. Networking, speakers and microphones are things the company understands. In fact, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple’s product could be sold at a premium based on sound quality: We expect Apple’s first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP). Therefore the product is likely to be positioned for: (i) the high-end market; (ii) better entertainment experience; and (iii) higher price than Amazon Echo. All of that feels right to me, but I still have some questions about what this product could be like if Apple really leveraged its ecosystem. The Echo and Google Home both fall back to a mobile app when they can’t deliver the results the user expects. Tap the Echo app on my iPhone, and you’ll see a trail of every request it has heard, but the Echo itself will direct a user there when it can’t reply with voice: This is a space where Apple’s integration could really shine. Not only could this type of information simply show up on the lock screen of an associated iPhone, I think it’s be great for the Apple Watch to be involved as well. The Echo and products like it want to live in the kitchen. It’s a natural place a voice assistant. I can’t tell you how many time I’ve spoken to our Echo while cooking or washing dishes. Having a Siri Voice Canister fall back to my Watch means information is just a glance away, even if I have my hands in the sink. Update: Several people have suggested Apple could just build this type of functionality into the next Apple TV. I think this is a flawed idea for a couple of reasons. First, most people don’t have an Apple TV in their kitchens, where these products are the most useful. Even if the Siri Remote would work from a different room of the house well enough for this, then your Siri Remote is constantly in the wrong place when you reach for it. Secondly, most people don’t leave their TVs on all the time. Would this Apple TV also have a speaker in it? Then you’re back to the first problem, unless the Siri Remote also gains a speaker, which would make it bigger and even worse than it is today. I just don’t see it. I think this is a separate device from the Apple TV.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 100 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing. Bernhard Mähr Waiting since two years for a good 7" table with recent Android version.

It looks like that update is going live today, but it’s bringing more than SYNC 3 functionality with it. ExxonMobil is also launching an Apple Watch version of SpeedPass+ today, meaning those of you with Apple’s smartwatch will be able to take advantage of these new features as well. With these new updates – ExxonMobil says there will be several of them in all – you’ll be able to use your SYNC 3 system or Apple Watch to find Exxon or Mobil stations near you, and then when you arrive, select your pump and authorize payment. Support for mobile payments is live at around 10,000 stations across the US, so you probably won’t have to look very long before you find one that allows you to pay through your car or watch. While some my find it a little silly to download an ExxonMobil app dedicated to mobile payments, there could actually be some major benefits to doing so. Gas pumps are frequently targets for credit card skimmers, which aim to steal your card information without you noticing that something’s amiss. By paying through a mobile payments system like the one ExxonMobil has baked into SpeedPass+, you avoid that particular peril by not swiping your card in the first place. This mobile payment functionality isn’t the only thing arriving to SpeedPass+ today. You can now also use the app to apply for an ExxonMobil Smart Card though its new Apply and Buy feature. Should you be approved for this credit card, it’ll automatically be applied to your available payment options, allowing you begin charging your gas purchases it to it right away. Other payment options compatible with SmartPass+ are credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay. You can also use the app to earn Plenti Points through ExxonMobil’s loyalty program, and it should be noted that Smart Card purchases earn Plenti Points as well, assuming both accounts are linked. Watch for these updates to go live either today or in the very near future.

According to Strategy Analytics, Apple ousted Fitbit from the top position with 3.5 million wearables shipped during the first quarter of this year. Thats a jump of 59% compared to the same period last year. Apple raced ahead of the market, which grew only 21% annually for a total of 22 million units shipped. Fitbit went from first (with 4.5 million in Q1 2016) to third (with just 2.9 million in Q1 2017), a massive slump. Xiaomi also declined - from 3.8 million to 3.5 million - but it still kept enough market share (15%) to go up to second place. The market also diversified, makers outside the Top 3 went up from 7.7 million units to 12.2 million. Growth mostly came from North America, Europe and Asia. The Apple Watch 2 in particular was a hot seller in the US, UK and several other countries, helped out by strong marketing. Global Wearables Vendor Shipments (Millions of Units)      Q1 '16 Q1 '17 Apple 2.2 3.5 Xiaomi 3.8 3.4 Fitbit 4.5 2.9 Others 7.7 12.2 Total 18.2 22.0 Global Wearables Vendor Marketshare % Q1 '16 Q1 '17 Apple 12.1% 15.9% Xiaomi 20.9% 15.5% Fitbit 24.7% 13.2% Others 42.3% 55.5% Total 100.0% 100.0% Total Growth YoY (%) 74% 21% Source: Strategy Analytics This is a good place to mention that Xiaomi mostly ships smart bands, Fitbit has a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches (though not Android Wear) while Apple only ships full-blown smartwatches. So numbers are not always directly comparable. Still, the main takeaway from this is that the once market leader, Fitbit, is now in trouble. Shipments, along with revenue and profits, have fallen and it will be a struggle to recover.

Zeman   @phonescooper Imagination Technologies said it plans to sell two of its business units and strengthen its balance sheet before its years-old partnership with Apple expires. Earlier this year Apple told Imagination Technologies that it will no longer need the company's GPUs for the iPhone in 15 to 24 months time. Apple is Imagination Technologies' largest customer and the loss of the iPhone maker's business will result in a transformative change for Imagination Technologies. The company has already begun a legal dance around Apple. "Imagination has been unable to make satisfactory progress with Apple to date regarding alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement [and] has therefore commenced the dispute resolution procedure under the licence agreement with a view to reaching an agreement through a more structured process," said the company. Imagination contends that Apple will not be able to design and manufacture its own GPU without violating Imagination's patented technology. At the same time, Imagination is preparing to sell its MIPS and Ensigma businesses. Imagination will hold onto its PowerVR businesses unit. Imagination Technologies did not spell out a timeframe for making these changes. more info at Imagination Technologies » Related Review: RhinoShield Playproof and Crashguard RhinoShield has some inexpensive Apple iPhone cases for sale that claim to offer big protection with a minimal footprint.

Apple CEO To World: 😀 Hudson Hongo May 6, 2017, 12:00am ⋅ Filed to:  emoji gizmodo nights internet jail tim cook Share At approximately 11:38AM Cupertino time on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook posted a cryptic message on Twitter reading only "😀". It was quickly deleted. Screenshot: Twitter What could the man in charge of the world's most valuable brand be trying to say? Was it a mistake? A test? Did the tweet herald a new, Apple-developed two-way neural interface that feeds users pleasant imagery until their mouths are contorted into painful rictus grins, a caricature of genuine human joy? Maybe it was just a 😀 day. Wednesday evening, Gizmodo received a revelatory email titled "I know what the Tim Cook smile means." According to the tipster, who worked for Apple for several years, Cook's tweet was likely intended as "a private response to someone and he accidentally made it public and then caught his mistake". "I know a co-worker, about two years back, who wrote Tim to tell him about a really great interaction my co-worker had with a customer," writes our tipster. "He was surprised and delighted to actually get an email back several days later. He shared it with several of us. The response was a smile." We reached out to Apple for comment but had not heard back at time of writing.

Adobe software has always been expensive, but at least it was one upfront cost. As it turns out, we were right. Another annual price increase for Creative Cloud is happening a month from now, and it represents the latest jump in a nearly 250 per cent price rise for some Creative Cloud plans since it started.

With Apple’s growth relatively stagnant in the US, and slowing down in China, the company clearly has its eyes on India’s oft-disregarded market. One of the things Cook mentioned is that Apple sales grew in double digits in India last quarter, even setting a new record in March. As the company’s US and China markets saturate, it sold only 50.76 million iPhones globally, as compared to the 51.19 million units it sol in the first quarter. This makes India the prime new frontier for the tech giant to grow further. He was also impressed by the speed with which 4G services rolled out across the country, saying it offers his company an opportunity to broaden its reach. “The 4G network investment really began rolling in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year,” he said. “But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive.” In a meeting with investors post the quarterly results announcement, Cook said Apple is focusing its efforts in the country on retail, manufacturing, and research & development. Of course, he’s far from the first to see the potential our shores hold for the tech industry, but his company is making strides to expand on that opportunity, setting up a manufacturing plant in Bengaluru and a R&D lab in Hyderabad. “We agree that we are underpenetrated there,” Cook added, talking about how he feels the company has failed to connect with it’s buyers here. “Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geographies that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it.” To that effect, Cook says Apple is planning to open up more of its own walk-in stores in India Apple’s sales numbers may have climbed in India, but the company is far from securing the top spot.

All that appears set to change as it’s reported that the Amazon Video app will be coming to Apple TV by the fall … NordVPN Recode says that while it’s not yet a done deal, the two companies are close to agreeing terms. The tech giants, who are increasingly competing for customers’ time, eyeballs and money, are close to an agreement to bring an Amazon video app to Apple’s Apple TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the two companies. Amazon employees expect the app to show up on Apple’s hardware in the third quarter of the year. Amazon had something of a falling out with Apple over the cut it takes from in-app purchases, which would have meant Apple taking a slice of rentals and purchases from the (many) movies and TV shows not included in the Prime deal. While an Amazon video app exists for Apple iOS devices, it’s a crippled version of the app, which doesn’t allow users to buy or rent individual programs without visiting Amazon first. As retaliation against Apple, Amazon stopped selling Apple TV boxes on its website back in 2015. A search for Apple TV finds mostly accessories and competitor products, though a few third-party sales do slip through. Jeff Bezos stated that the reason for this was because Apple wasn’t offering ‘acceptable business terms.’ We want our player, our Prime Video player, to be on the device, and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms. And so, you can always get the player on the device; the question is can you do so with acceptable business terms. And if you can’t, then we don’t want to sell it to our customers, because they’re going to be buying it thinking they can watch Prime Video and then they’re going to be disappointed. And they’re going to return it. It’s believed that a deal could only have been reached at a high level, possibly through talks between Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos personally.

The iPhone maker AAPL, +1.66%  is offering three-year, five-year, seven-year and 10-year tranches, with fixed- and floating-rate notes in the three- and five-year maturities, according to research firm CreditSights. Proceeds are earmarked for the catchall “general corporate purposes,” but that includes shareholder returns, along with working capital, debt repayment and acquisitions. Apple said this week it is increasing and extending its shareholder-returns program and said it would tap the bond market at home and overseas to fund the program. Apple first issued bonds to finance huge buybacks and dividend payments, rather than repatriate the roughly $250 billion in cash it holds outside of the U.S., which would be subject to a 35% corporate tax rate. Since Apple began its investor return program in 2012, it’s debt load has increased from zero to $84.5 billion, as of the end of the last quarter. While much was made of Apple’s cash reserves topping $250 billion in Apple’s quarterly report Tuesday, Apple actually added more debt than cash in the quarter, with long-term debt rising nearly $11 billion and cash reserves increasing nearly $10.8 billion, the second time in three quarters debt has increased faster than cash. President Donald Trump has pledged to implement a one-time repatriation tax to encourage U.S. companies to bring home their cash as part of a wider tax reform, but the timing of that move remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Apple has just $17 billion in cash in the U.S. and had $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding in its recent quarter, without a backstop credit facility. CreditSights reiterated its underperform rating on Apple’s bonds, noting that the company missed expectations for iPhone sales in its latest quarter. The company’s leverage is rising and it could decide to boost the shareholder returns program even more if the repatriation holiday materializes, said the firm. See: Apple stock falls after iPhone maker reports revenue, forecast miss: Live blog recap Don’t miss: Calm the iPhone 8 buzz, Apple analyst warns “In particular, we think it could be a catalyst to refocus creditors’ attention from Apple’s cash hoard to its business profile, and we think this will lead to a steepening of its credit curve,” CreditSights analyst Jordan Chalfin wrote in a note. CreditSights’s rating of Apple’s bonds is based on the 30-year bonds, which are trading at the second-tightest level among the “super investment grade” tech companies in the firm’s coverage. That includes Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.47%  , GOOG, -0.49%  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.36% Oracle Corp. ORCL, +0.24% Cisco Inc. CSCO, +0.61% and IBM Corp. IBM, -2.51% The notes are just eight basis points wider than Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT, +0.28% said Chalfin. “We continue to think Apple’s 30-year bonds are too rich,” said the analyst. There is no 30-year tranche in Thursday’s offering. Apple has $3.5 billion of debt that is maturing in the next week, said CreditSights. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo are joint bookrunners on the deal. Apple’s 3.35% notes due in February of 2027 were last trading at 102.12 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess. Its shorter-maturity paper, the 1.000% notes due in May of 2018, were trading at 99.71 cents on the dollar. Apple’s shares closed down 0.4% Thursday, but are up 26% in 2017, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.26%  has gained 5.7% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.41%  has gained 6.5%.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 100 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing.

Speaking to Mad Money host Jim Cramer on CNBC, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company would be creating a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing jobs across America. “We’re announcing it today. So you’re the first person I’m telling,” said Cook to Jim Cramer on Wednesday. “Well, not the first person because we’ve talked to a company that we’re going to invest in already.” Apple will reportedly announce their first investment in May.   Apple has created two million jobs in the US, but many of their computer components are manufactured overseas. During his campaign, President Donald Trump famously vowed to bring Apple’s production back to the US. “We’re going to get Apple Computer to build their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,” he said. “We gotta bring back the jobs from China, we gotta bring back the jobs from Japan, and all these countries that are ripping us off. And we’re gonna do that. And we are gonna do that.” Breitbart reported in November that Apple has already researched the costs of moving iPhone production back to the US following President Trump’s comments. “By doing that [investing], we can be the ripple in the pond. Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them,” said Cook, “A lot of people ask me, ‘Do you think it’s a company’s job to create jobs?’ and my response is [that] a company should have values because a company is a collection of people. And people should have values, so by extension, a company should. And one of the things you do is give back.” Cook clarified how Apple plans to “give back” saying, “So how do you give back? We give back through our work in the environment, in running the company on renewable energy. We give back in job creation.” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

At the end of the first quarter, there were 136 million active iPhones in the U.S., new data released on Friday by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) shows (PDF). The user base is up from 132 million at the end of 2016 and a little over 80 million two years ago. CIRP tracks Apple's (aapl) total iPhone user base each quarter. The company's data is extrapolated across the U.S. based on a survey of American Apple customers it conducts each quarter. The latest survey was conducted over three weeks in April. While Apple's iPhone growth is good news for the tech giant, CIRP noted that the company's growth rate has slowed. In 2015, for instance, Apple routinely added about 10 million new U.S. users. Now, it's slowed to a few million each quarter. In a statement, CIRP partner and co-founder Mike Levin said that Apple's slower growth is likely due to many factors, including "the lengthening ownership cycle, a diminishing number of first-time buyers, and increased Android loyalty." He added that Apple's apparent interest in its Services business, where it's investing heavily in music, video, and original content, could be due in part to its own analysis that it has a finite amount of iPhone user growth in critical markets like the United States. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Still, Apple has done a fine job of getting customers running on its latest hardware and upgrading to new units every few years. In fact, the entire American iPhone user base consists of iPhones that were released within the last 30 months, according to CIRP. The two-year-old iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus account for a third of the U.S. user base. The most recent Apple handsets, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, account for 26% of the current American iPhone user base. Looking ahead, CIRP didn't say whether Apple's user base would plateau. However, in its fiscal second quarter earnings report this week, Apple revealed that iPhone unit sales slipped during the period. The tech giant said the 1% year-over-year decline was due to customers hearing about upcoming iPhones and deciding to wait to buy one of those handsets rather than a currently available device. Apple is rumored to be planning three new handsets this year, and they'll likely be released in the fall.

With this in mind, Golf Monthly looks at the some of the best island greens in golf. By Harvey Jones The 6 Best Island Greens in Golf 6 – Le Golf National, Guyancourt – Hole 18  A view from behind the 18th green and the connecting 15th green (right) | Getty Images The eyes of the golfing world will fall on Le Golf National, France in late September next year for the Ryder Cup. There the American and European teams will face one of the most challenging island greens in golf when the groups close off their rounds down the 18th hole. Named the ‘Albatross’, due to it’s short length as a par 5 making it eligible to also play as a par 4, the 18th hole at Le Golf National is a fitting end to any round of golf with a green that is protected by a grenade bunker a well as the surrounding water hazard. It’s main feature is a strip of turf connecting the 18th green to the 15th, another difficult island green. If the wind picks up when the players make their approach to this final hole, we could see anything from an eagle to a double bogey being made. A devilish green. 5 – PGA West Stadium Course, Palm Springs – Hole 17 Phil Mickelson taking his tee shot on the 17th hole at the 2016 CareerBuilder Challenge | Getty Images Designed by the famous golf architect, Pete Dye, the 17th hole at the PGA West Stadium course in Palm Springs, California is a replica of Dye’s famous 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass. Although Dye was originally sceptical about replicating the historic par 3, he well and truly created a green as treacherous (if not more) that the original. Though the green is significantly larger than Dye’s original, it’s also 30 yards longer and becomes doubly intimidating on a breezy day in the desert. The rocky perimeter of the green makes the hole even more daunting and really makes up for the lack of bunkers and other hazards, whilst the view from the tee box suggests that there is no water behind the green, which can trick first time payers into hitting the ball long. It’s no wonder this Sawgrass replica is nicknamed “Alcatraz”. Any tee shot that’s just a fraction out and there’s no escaping the inevitable splash. 4 – Coeur d’Alene Resort, Idaho – Hole 14 The daunting but picturesque view of the 14th hole | Getty Images Another par 3 from America, and this one is stunning. Boasting the title as ‘The World’s Only Floating Island Green’ this 218-yard hole is surrounded by a mixture of red geraniums, a pair of bunkers and some conifers, not to mention one of the country’s most beautiful lakes. A real hidden gem with a mix of beauty and danger. Related: Best Hidden Gem Golf Courses In The UK And Ireland The 15,000-square-foot putting surface beckons golfers for a challenge, floating silently 150 yards off the lakeshore. Unlike other island greens, there are no man-made strips of land that provide a bridge over the water. Instead, it’s only reachable by a six-passenger boat called the “Putter.” It’s a hole so difficult to make par on that if you reach dry land and two-putt you earn a certificate on the ride back to shore. 3 – Apple Tree Resort, Yakima – Hole 17 The amazing apple-shaped 17th green at the Apple Tree Resort This Washington based course has one of the most uplifting and picturesque par 3s in the world. Sticking to the apple theme of the resort, the 17th hole has an island green in the perfect shape of an apple. Guarded by a back-left bunker that resembles a leaf, there’s also a stem in the form of a 50-foot walking bridge connecting the green to dry land. With the surrounding water and fast greens, the hole’s beauty disguises the peril that awaits your tee shot. But perils aside, you can’t help but smile when you see this hole.

The only difference is this hole sits on a completely natural island on the Pacific Ocean. Designed by Jack Nicklaus, the 3rd hole is Best known as the “Tail of the Whale” which, during low tide, golfers can trudge through the sandy path to get to the green, but at high tide, it’s only accessible via amphibious golf cart. A truly stunning hole it requires no bunkers or other additional hazards. The swirling winds from the Pacific and towering rocks on the island give this green all the protection it needs. 1 – TPC Sawgrass, Florida – Hole 17 The 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass | Getty Images If you ask any golf fan from around the world to name a hole that has an island green, they would all say: ‘The 17th at Sawgrass.’ Every year we are fortunate enough to watch the top golfers in the world play this amazing Florida based course in The Players Championship and this hole is where all the drama happens. Related: Is The 17th At Sawgrass The Most Intimidating Par 3 In Golf? The swirling winds, accompanied by the incredibly small target zone makes this small 137-yard par 3 one of the toughest holes in the world. So much so that a number of players on Tour, including Tiger Woods, feel it shouldn’t be one of the finishing holes because there’s “too much left for chance”, like a gust of wind suddenly blowing your ball off line. That aside, the hugely challenging aspect of this hole is what makes The Players Championship so great and the large number of tournament-deciding tee shots that have been made on this hole makes it, not just the best island green in the world, but one of the best holes in golf.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Watch Takes Global Wearables Lead over Fitbit in Q1 2017 | Main | Apple Chooses Bosch for Sensors that Support Augmented Reality, In-Air Gestures, Indoor Navigation & Smart Glasses » May 05, 2017 China's Huawei, Oppo and Vivo continue to dominate the Chinese Smartphone Market by beating Apple's iPhone SE   On April 28 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Smartphone data for Q1 2017 shows that the big Story is the Stunning growth from Oppo, Huawei and Vivo." The report covered TrendForce's smartphone shipment statistics globally. One of IDC's latest reports covers new smartphone statistics in China for Q1 2017. Apple's iPhone remains in fourth spot barely beating out Xiaomi, confirming the report by Canalys that we covered in late April.   I noted in a report titled "Samsung Tops Smartphone Shipments Chart in Q1 due to Flooding the Market with Massive Low-End Model Shipments," that Apple only sells premium smartphone and that Samsung flooding the market with phones in the $185-$240 range, a category Apple doesn't participate in.   We furtther noted that TrendForce noted that "Samsung's sales results for its high-end smartphones fell short of expectations in the first quarter as consumers' confidence in the brand had yet to fully recover from the recall of Galaxy Note 7."   In a recent report by Counterpoint Research, Research Director, Neil Shah noted that "Apple's share of this super-premium segment remains at 80%, with five out of the top ten model SKUs belonging to Apple." Their graphic below spells that out clearly.   This is why Apple has taken 92% of the smartphone industry's profits in seven straight quarters. They don't participate in smartphones under $400.   In IDC's latest report they claim that 104.1 million smartphones were shipped to China in 2017Q1. This was a mere 1% year-on-year (YoY) growth, in part the result of high inventory from the previous quarter. 2017Q1 was also relatively quiet aside from a few product launches like Huawei's new P10, P10 Plus, and Honor V9. This, along with strong momentum for the Honor brand, helped Huawei reclaim the top position from OPPO.   "Apple has been seeing double-digit YoY declines for the fifth quarter in a row, but we believe that Chinese consumers are holding out for the launch of Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone at the end of the year, and this will help Apple to see a rebound in the China smartphone market." .The top five smartphone companies now dominate 70% of the market.   IDC noted that Oppo's R9 sold well this quarter, a phone that sells for roughly US$489 as did the Huawei Honor 8 selling for US$400. This is where Apple's only weakness is. While they don't, won't and shouldn't sell smartphones in the under $400 range as all Chinese vendors do to artificially beef up their "shipment stats," the fact is that Apple's iPhone SE is in a battle zone where they're not competitive based on what the Chinese consumer feels is value. These consumers want a 5 or 5.5" display and Apple only offers a 4" model.   When trying to figure out why Apple didn't hit their iPhone sales number for the quarter and why they were down in China, Apple's CEO seemed to be in denial this week about their Chinese competitors. The stats and commentary from IDC clearly shows that smartphones in the sweet spot ($400-$500) range, Apple's iPhone SE failed to register any significant sales.   Apple is always in a battle with shiipment of cheaper products and when there is deeper analysis, the volume game only helps losers that rely on price alone. Apple fans love to cheer when Apple is in first place like they are currently in tablets and smartwatches, but the minute that they're knocked out of the top spot, they change the argument to other factors. That's understandable and we report on those differences ourselves when volume alone is the deciding factor.   However, while Apple is the profit king and are the clear winners at the top end of the Chinese market with premium smartphones, they do in fact compete in the sweet spot of the market in China at the $400 to $500 price range and here the iPhone SE is a clear loser.   Apple's CEO did let it slip during his interview with Jim Cramer (and not during Apple's financial conference) this week, that certain iPhone models weren't selling as well and that they would take a closer look at that. That's what he should have said during Apple's conference call because as we pointed out in our report this week titled "Apple's CEO seems to be in Denial about their Chinese Smartphone Competitors Outsmarting them," Cook kept changing the reasons for why the iPhone missed it's mark by pointing to iPhone 8 rumors, tourism down in Hong Kong and currency factors.   Apple is a profit machine because they make products consumers want. They're the best at it in the world hands down. But the Chinese consumer in the $400-$500 range see things differently because they don't make as much money as U.S., Canadian and European consumers. And in that important slot, Apple's iPhone SE is a failure that Apple has to adress at some point in time.

Some manufacturers, including Apple, are trying to get rid of it. Apple wasn’t the first to do this, but the decisions they make tend to impact the entire industry. It seemed like other OEMs would follow suit. Thankfully, Samsung and LG haven’t given up on the headphone jack. However, other Android OEMs have ditched it. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is a new phone that doesn’t have the headphone jack. Xiaomi shared their reasoning behind the decision: Smartphones are highly-integrated products and internal space is precious. By removing the headphone jack, we can save room for other components such as a bigger battery. Audio through USB Type-C is becoming more common, and will continue to provide excellent sound quality. This is the same thing we usually hear. OEMs claim they can fit more good stuff into the phone if they remove the headphone jack. While that may be true, it’s still an unnecessary sacrifice. Is anyone not buying the Samsung Galaxy S8 or LG G6 because they are too thick? No. Would anyone complain if they were a millimeter thicker for extra battery life? Heck no. Consumers want the headphone jack. Sure, anyone can learn to live without it. But you shouldn’t have to do that.

Up to date Make sure your iOS is kept up-to-date to ensure your device is utilizing Apple’s latest battery life preserving tweaks. Battery usage Get to know your battery. Open Settings>Battery and wait for your Battery Usage data to load. You’ll be able to see which apps use the most power and switch them off. Reduce Brightness Open Settings>Display & Brightness and disable Auto-Brightness. You should also reduce the brightness of your device using the slider here (or in Control Center). Auto-lock You will save some power by setting your device to lock in the shortest available time, which is 30-seconds. You achieve this in Settings>Display & Brightness>Auto-Lock. Use AirPlane Mode to control connectivity If you don’t need to use Bluetooth, Cellular, or Wi-Fi, then you should swipe up from the bottom of the display to raise Control Center and then tap the Airplane Mode button to on.  If you need to use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi you can always enable them using their settings in Control Center, as even limiting cellular connection will save a little more power. If you are in a location with poor cellular coverage you’ll save significant power by disabling the cellular radio in your device – this is because it constantly seeks a strong connection, using battery power as it does. You can enable and disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi manually inside Control Center if you need to keep cellular coverage. Wi-Fi uses less power than cellular, Apple claims. Switch off AirDrop You can disable AirDrop manually in Control Center. Just swipe up to get to Control Center, tap the AirDrop item, and set it to ‘Receiving Off’. This saves a good amount of energy as it works by scanning for nearby devices when it is active. That’s also why Apple disables it in Low Power Mode (see below). Switch it down You’ll also want to switch down the volume on your device and turn off Vibrate on Ring and Vibrate on Silent to further trim power need. You can also switch off Background App Refresh in Settings>General, though this is done automatically for you in Low Power Mode, which may be better if you’re likely to forget to switch this one again. Reduce Motion and other stories Apple’s parallax and other visual effects can be disabled to save a little energy. Once again, Apple’s Low Power Mode will do this, but here’s how to do it yourself: Settings>General>Accessibility, and switch on Reduce Motion. You can also try switching off Spotlight settings in General>Spotlight Search where you can define which sites and apps it uses to search. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Notifications control Do you have apps set to share Notifications that you don’t read or don’t use? You probably do. Open Settings>Notifications to find an extensive list of all the apps capable of sharing notifications through your device. Tap on the ones you aren’t interested in and selecting None to prevent receiving items from that app, or switch off Allow Notifications from that app to disable it completely. Don’t push that Mail When you want to maximize battery life you will want to disable Push email, as this requires plenty of power. To do so in Settings>Mail>Contacts &Calendars choose Fetch New Data and turn Push to Off. You can now choose to check for emails at certain intervals, or switch it to Manually for best control (and best power saving). Once again, this is what Low Power Mode does for you. Silence Siri Open Settings>Siri and switch it off. You’ll miss it, but doing so may help conserve a little more power. Location Services In Settings>Privacy>Location Services toggle these to off. You will no longer be able to use all your apps and services, but you will also stop your device trying to figure out where it is. Alternatively disable location services for those apps you won’t need to use. Browser control Every Safari website has its own scripts, ads and ‘other stuff’. These don’t take up too much power, but the combined demand mounts up. If you want to extend battery life it makes sense to close any browser window you don’t need to use. You don’t need to quit Safari (the apps themselves make little difference when conserving power), but it is worth quitting some websites. Ditch Facebook I continue to believe you will save significant power by deleting the Facebook and Messenger apps from your device. You can always check the site and your messages using Safari.   Automatic Downloads You’ll want to open Settings>iTunes & App Store and switch Automatic Downloads off. Other things to avoid It may sound a little obvious, but avoiding media playback, games and camera usage will all help you squeeze a little more use out of your device. The very best tip: Low Power Mode The most useful power saving measure you’ll find is only available on iOS devices and is called Low Power Mode. It works like this: When your battery level falls to 20 percent your smartphone will warn you about it and let you enter the power-saving mode with one tap. When in this mode, display brightness will be reduced, Mail and other apps will not download content in the background, and features like iCloud Sync and AirDrop will be disabled. Device performance and system animations are also optimized. You can still make calls, access the ‘net and uses messages and email in this mode, but you’ll find your battery life lasts a whole lot longer. You can also enable this mode before your power runs down. Why Apple hasn’t built a similarly effective tool for Mac users to use to tweak battery life out of their systems eludes me. Mac battery life tips At time of writing, Apple’s mobile Macs include the MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Here are some of the ways in which you can get more usable time from your battery. Read this article for effective advice on understanding and maintaining battery condition. The basic tricks Always keep your Mac software up-to-date using Software Update. Apple routinely applies enhancements to your system performance, often enabling better battery life when it does. You should also get to know System Preferences>Energy Saver. This offers several settings that can help reduce power demand: The ‘turn display off after’ slider helps you save power by reducing the amount of time your display remains active when not in use. To maximize usable time and reduce power demands you should also tick 'Put hard disks to sleep when possible', and 'Slightly dim the display while on battery power'. Cut demand You can also reduce power draw by disabling any system features you don’t need to use. You can dim your screen; turn off Bluetooth; turn off Wi-Fi and Mute sound. You will also save a little more power by disconnecting any peripheral devices. If you are using a Mac with an optical drive, make sure to eject a disk you may have inside. Applications When you are using the apps you like to use most often and you are connected to power (ie. Not when you are trying to reduce power draw), launch Activity Monitor and take a look at the CPU and Energy readings. You will probably find Safari, Mail, and any imaging or video editing apps have consumed the most power. Another thing you can do is tap on the Battery Power indicator in Menu. When you do you will be shown a list of apps that are using significant quantities of power. You will certainly want to quit any power-hungry apps (if possible) when you want to maximize battery life. You should also quit any app you don’t need to use at the time, and also avoid power-hungry Websites such as most social networks and video sharing sites. Following these steps significantly reduces power draw. Browser tips Every website you have open in Safari probably consumes some system resources. This is why you should close any web pages or browser windows you don’t need when trying to tweak battery performance. Another useful tip: In Safari Preferences>Advanced enable the Stop plug-ins to save power setting. Activity Monitor Launch Activity Monitor and select CPU>All Processes. If you find any app, website, or process that is taking c.70 percent of power you’ll want to disable it. To do so, select the item in the list and then tap the X button top left. This quits the app/process. (You’d be surprised how some poorly-built websites also suck power from your Mac, get to know which ones they are and avoid them when you need more battery time). Invert colors You may get a little more battery life if you can work with in this mode. The first step is to open System Preferences>Desktop & Screen Saver>Desktop>Solid Colors and choose the white tile. Next you select System Preferences>Accessibility and tick Invert colors. You’ll end up with a low power demand but very black display. More Accessibility There are some other settings you may want to change in the Accessibility pane. I find the all-dark Mac hard to work with, so I sometimes tick the ‘Use grayscale’ item to switch to an all gray Mac. You should also reduce power demand by ticking the ‘Reduce Motion’ and ‘Reduce Transparency’ items here. Turn it off There are some application settings you can disable to save a little more power: If you use a Mac with an illuminated keyboard you may want to turn down the brightness or switch this feature off. Open System Preferences>Keyboard and uncheck ‘Adjust keyboard brightness in low light’. Limit the apps that can check for Notifications in System Preferences>Notifications. (Or switch on Do Not Disturb to disable them completely). Stop Mail from automatically checking for new messages in Mail Preferences>General, where you should switch Check for New Messages to ‘Manually’. Some Mac users also disable their Spotlight preferences by dragging their Mac disk across to the Privacy pane in Spotlight System Preferences. Feature request Surely Apple can create a single power saving pane that lets Mac users change all these settings from one place? It could call it Low Power Mode… What have I missed? Have I missed a power-saving tip you use yourself? Or do you have other ideas to reduce power demand on Apple devices? Let me know through the social media feeds below.

Tested: The truth behind the MacBook Pro's 'terrible' battery life With the new iPad, Apple keeps simplifying its product lines Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac As a company, Apple’s philosophy is often about pushing the envelope. And that’s great. It’s how we got the original Mac’s GUI, the iPhone, and other products and features too numerous to name. Apple likes to play up this revolutionary part of its history, and how it’s constantly trying to create world-beating products and not just move the needle slowly forward. It’s not to imagine the late Steve Jobs summoning forth the adage often attributed to Henry Ford: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” Of course, the philosophy of innovation can go awry. Apple was so concerned about transforming the 2013 edition of the Mac Pro into an elegant, radical piece of machinery that it lost sight of what made that product appeal to its users. In a rare moment, the company even admitted it had taken the wrong approach. But what about Apple’s portable Macs? With this week’s announcement of Microsoft’s Surface Laptop—of which there is very little that’s radical—it seems as though Apple’s notebooks may have missed a beat by being too focused on pushing the envelope. Maybe what we’re looking for is a faster horse. MacBook Roman Loyola It’s not hard to trace the pedigree of the current MacBook, back to the original MacBook Air in 2008. Apple emphasized how light and thin it was—it could even fit in a manila envelope. But it lacked common features such as an optical drive (remember those?) and FireWire, and its form factor meant that it had to hide its three ports (USB, micro-DVI, and a headphone jack) behind a flip-down door. It was slower than the consumer-oriented white plastic MacBooks, tended to run hot, and cost a pricey $1800. But over time, the MacBook Air developed into one of Apple’s most popular laptops. Subsequent designs removed the flip-down door, added more ports, and juiced up the processor as Apple managed to better balance battery life and performance. Like that first MacBook Air, the 12-inch MacBook does boast attractive features. It’s even thinner and lighter, and sports a Retina display and a USB-C port. But also like that first Air, it’s pricey, underpowered, and lacking in ports. Meanwhile, the MacBook Air has reached the end of its life, and will never get a Retina display, USB-C, or Thunderbolt 3. But even so it remains a versatile, powerful machine. I’m writing this column on my 11-inch Air from 2014, and it’s still more capable at many tasks than the iMac on my desk (which, admittedly, is three years older). We’ve yet to see the new MacBook’s second act, but I’m not about to invest in a notebook that’s less capable than what I’ve currently got. MacBook Pro Apple At the other end of the spectrum, the MacBook Pro is a respectable machine. But with the Touch Bar model, I worry that Apple’s once again heading down the same road it did with the Mac Pro, redesigning something that the target market of that machine doesn’t particularly want. The MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar didn’t set the world on fire, but it appeals to those who want to get work done without having to adjust their long-learned behavior. In other words: it’s a faster horse. And maybe that’s what’s needed. I understand what drives Apple: The Mac has entered its fourth decade, and while that’s a testament to its success, massive revolutionary changes are going to come fewer and farther between. Plus, speed bumps feel boring. They don’t get a lot of news, and everybody likes the shininess of the new and different. Of course, this has often been Apple’s MO: release a new product that pushes the envelope but requires tradeoffs. Iterate on that product over time to fill in the missing gaps, and refine it until it’s best in class. Rinse, repeat. There’s no reason to think this time will be different, but it’s frustrating that both of Apple’s laptop lines are in the immature stages of this cycle at essentially the same time. I’m looking forward to a new version of the MacBook, in particular. A machine that marries the sleek profile of the current model to the power of my MacBook Air? That’s a faster horse that I’d be happy to saddle up and take for a ride. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

During the company’s earnings call yesterday and again during an interview today, Tim Cook talked up Apple’s influence, and now Apple has launched a new website that breaks down its United States economic outreach… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover On the website, Apple describes its contributions to the United States economy. For instance, the company touts that it has created some 2 million jobs, 450,000 of which are through its United States-based suppliers. Additionally, the company has created 1.5 million jobs in app development, and various other amounts in construction, manufacturing, retail, and more. 80,000 employees are official Apple employees. Apple notes that there are 29 cities with 250 or more employees, 44 states with an Apple Store, and that there has been a 28x increase in Apple employment outside of California since 2000. Additionally, the company says that there has been a 1,500 percent growth in U.S. employees altogether since 1998. Furthermore, Apple explains that it spent over $50 billion in the United States last year, working with more than 9,000 suppliers and manufacturers. The numbers tell the story. Apple is one of the biggest job creators in the United States, responsible for two million jobs in all 50 states. Last year, we spent over $50 billion with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers and manufacturers. Since we launched the App Store in 2008, U.S. developers have earned over $16 billion in App Store sales worldwide. And we’re just getting started. The website also offers a state-by-state breakdown of its jobs and economic contributions, showing that it has created jobs in every state. Under a “Key U.S. Investment” heading, Apple also outlines some of its bigger investments, such as its headquarters in Cupertino, California, campuses in Texas and Arizona, and data centers in North Carolina, Oregon, and Reno. Apple today announced that it is creating a new $1 billion advanced manufacturing fund to further promote U.S. job creation. The company hopes that this fund will have a ripple effect and promote job growth in the United States as a whole.

Image Credit: Jeffrey Grubb/GamesBeat Source: Apple With Apple’s cash pile reaching into the stratosphere, people who buy and sell companies for a living think they know just how Apple should use that money. Any guesses? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Okay, the answer is…use it to buy some companies! Thus far, Apple’s acquisition strategy has been pretty subdued, except for spending $3 billion on Beats a couple of years back. Otherwise, investment bankers have been pretty bummed out that the Kings of Cupertino have not gone on an acquisition bender. Still, Apple just reported that it now has $250 billion sitting in a bank, most of it overseas, of course. But if talk of a repatriation holiday comes true, and Apple brings some of those bucks home…A banker can dream, can’t they? Imaging how such an event would play out, Citigroup analysts drew up a list of odds-on favorites for an Apple purchase. Excerpts from the note that were published online by The Fly say the following list was generated by Citigroup analysts in a note entitled: “Addressing the Problem of Too Much Cash.” (Because is there anything worse than having too much cash?) At the top of the list: Netflix, with a 40 percent probability of being acquired by Apple. Disney was next, at 25 percent. The other five were at 10 percent or lower: Electronics Arts Tesla Activision Blizzard Take-Two Interactive Hulu Personally, I would put the odds at all of these at somewhere around zero. Were Apple to attempt to swallow companies of these size and scale, it would likely lose control over its more precious asset: its culture. Integration in any of these cases would likely be a nightmare and a huge distraction. Further, it would be a tacit admission that Apple’s core businesses have run their course. Still, it’s fun to speculate over the drama-fueled potential of Elon Musk learning to submit to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Or Netflix CEO Reed Hastings learning to accept being told what to do and when to do it. Nah, doubtful.

May 5, 2017 12:41 SGT By Mario Ferrari Reuters After failing to come to mutual terms, Apple's British graphics chip manufacturer has announced that it is pursuing a "dispute resolution procedure" with the Imagination Technologies. The announcement surfaced after Apple expressed its intentions to produce its own graphics chip. Apple cutting ties The Cupertino firm said that the situation tensed up after the two firms failed to come to terms over licensing issues. According to the British firm, Apple had notified them last month that it is cutting ties with them and "would no longer use Imagination's processing designs in 15 months to two years' time" because it is making its own graphics chips. Upon knowing about Apple's decision, the chip manufacturer had resorted to sit down with the company and settle in amicable "alternative commercial arrangements" for the existing license and royalty agreement as it believes that it is impossible for Apple to come up with its own chip without violating patents of Imagination in some form. "Imagination has reserved all its rights in respect of Apple's unauthorised use of Imagination's confidential information and Imagination's intellectual property rights," it said in its press statement. Legal action looms Imagination Technologies has been producing Apple's graphics chips for iPod, iPhone, and iPads since the beginning and has become its biggest client by far. Reuters also reported that the chip maker has been getting a fair amount of money from each Apple device. Should Apple refuses to give into Imagination's demands and the latter pursues its own path after company deal expires in two years' time, legal action could ensue, Reuters reported. The British company is still optimistic that both the companies will be able to solve this issue and come up with an amicable settlement "through a more structured process".  Businesses for sale Imagination said that 50 percent of its annual revenue comes from Apple. With Apple planning to cut ties with Imagination in the future, the latter sees a major decrease in its income, forcing the management to put its two other businesses on sale. The company has decided to let go of its embedded processor technology MIPS and mobile connectivity unit Ensigma and expand its full-swing efforts on graphics chip PowerVR. The businesses on sale are expected to gain £21m from May to October 2016.

Last month Apple said it would scrap royalty and licence agreements with Imagination that make up half of the company’s £120 million revenues. Imagination posted a £61.5 million loss last year, the biggest in its history, and also embarked on a cost-cutting drive that cost 200 jobs. Apple plans to replace Imagination’s intellectual property, which is used in the graphics processor units for Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods and TVs, with its own technology within two years.

But that approach could come with its own risks. Ryan Brooks reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript In China's cutthroat smartphone market- -Apple's making a play to hitch sales onto services- -in everything from digital payment to online games. The move could be crucial money after maker the company posted a dip in first quarter iPhone sales - with revenue in China slipping as local rivals eat into the market. That strategy makes sense given China drove 50% of growth on the App Store last year. But as Reuters' Cate Cadell explains, the new focus comes with some local problems. SOUNDBITE (English) CATE CADELL, REUTERS, SAYING: "It comes with a lot of separate risks which aren't involved in hardware. So there's a lot of things that the Chinese government has been cracking down on in the last year, including livestreaming, including media, including games, and all of these things fit into Apple's new services ecosystem. We can expect that they're going to- come into conflict with regulators on the content side a lot more than compared to just selling straight hardware." As Beijing clamps down online on one side- Experts expect local brands to move aggressively into services, too... To compete, Apple really needs to nail its next iPhone model this fall. SOUNDBITE (English) CATE CADELL, REUTERS, SAYING: "Getting that next phone into the hands of consumers is really really important, not just for selling hardware and making money but for getting a bigger install base for getting more of these services and really bring people into their ecosystems so they can compete with people like WeChat, these large China players that are coming up and building their own ecosystems." In April last year, regulators forced Apple to pull its iBooks and movies from China just weeks after they went live. And the company's gaming apps have had setbacks with new rules that say foreign developers need local partners. Those are hurdles that local brands with cheaper phones won't always need to jump. Making it that much harder to convince Chinese buyers to stay inside that Apple's universe.

That marks the tenth consecutive quarter where year-over-year shipments have declined. Worse, in the most recent five quarters, the declines have sunk into the double digits. The data were reported on Thursday by IDC, which splits the tablet market into two categories: slate devices such as the iPad from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and detachable keyboard devices like the Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) Surface. The bad news for Apple is that shipments of slate tablets peaked in 2014 and are now in “steep decline.” Demand for detachable keyboard devices continues to rise, which is good news for Microsoft. IDC executive Ryan Reith said: As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this. The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we’ve seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression. Convertible devices such as the Lenovo Yoga 910 also figure into shipment totals. IDC research director Linn Huang noted: To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC’s 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable. IDC believes that shipments of detachables will far outpace shipments of convertibles, even with the improving favorability of the convertibles in the marketplace. Here are the top five tablet vendors ranked by first-quarter 2017 shipments and their year-over-year shipment growth in the quarter: Apple: 8.9 million units shipped; 13% decline in shipments Samsung: 6 million units; 1.1% decline Huawei: 2.7 million units; 31.7% increase Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN): 2.2 million units; 1.8% decline Lenovo: 2.1 million units; 3.8% decline Apple is expected to launch a refreshed iPad line soon and Microsoft, which is included in the “Other” category in the IDC survey, should be coming out with a new version of the Surface later this year.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 62 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 100 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth noting that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top dog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. Master Yates I disagree as my Galaxy Tab S2 is much nicer for surfing the net than my One Plus 3 when I'm at home. As soon as One Plus makes a tablet, I'll be all over it. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) wjrandon Burn the Nexus 9 with fire. freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. catalysto Yeah, but none of that addresses the software limitations of a mobile browser. I understand that it's important to find a good device, but I think that can already be found in several existing ultrabook and convertible devices. But of course, if you are fine with the mobile browsing experience, that's totally fine, too. iPads are definitely great for that! Marty The hardware... generally... isn't the problem with PCs, it's the software and browsers that presents the biggest convenience blockage. Microsoft's Edge browser is about the best you can get for user convenience, but it oales in comparison to Safari on the iPad. I was a big Firefox fan for PC browsing, and on powerful enough equipment it's really good. But on a Surface 3, it sucks. So it all depends on the configuration of a PC to get the best out of it. I agree, the capability of mobile browsers can't match a PC experience. But for general web browsing usage, the iPad can't be beat. catalysto I have to disagree. Chrome is great, and it has given me the best browsing experience by far -- especially because of its speed and cross-device syncing. And again, I loathe any sort of mobile browser, so pretty much any desktop browser would be preferable to me. But this is obviously very subjective, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I mean, it's great that you are so satisfied with the iPad, but making general statements like "can't be beat" is inherently incorrect because of different people's preferences. By the way, I only mentioned hardware because you brought it up when describing all the different machines you've tried. Marty It's not incorrect. People that haven't used an iPad for web surfing are basing their assertions on the Android experience. Yes, mobile browsing on any Android sucks bad...at least used to till Samsung Internet Beta came along. But I have used Chrome on all systems and the bookmarks system on mobile Chrome makes it entirely miserable for people who are used to a desktop browsing experience. Safari alleviates much of the misery by providing a near-desktop experience, but without a mouse. catalysto It is indeed incorrect because it's based on a subjective evaluation. There's no "right answer". We have several iOS devices in our home, so I've used iPads and iPhones extensively. Regardless, I hate any mobile browsing experience -- on iPad or otherwise. Mobile means any mobile browser on any OS. Though I will say that I much prefer Chrome on Android to Safari on iOS, so, again, subjective. And I find the Chrome bookmarks work great, so I don't know what you're talking about there either. The bookmark and tab syncing is another of my favorite features, actually. Marty You keep expounding on Chrome's syncing capabilities. I'm talking about actual usage. If I have to press a menu button and then press another button to find my bookmarks, IT IS NOT A DESKTOP BROWSER EXPERIENCE. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks on a desktop browser. You absolutely have immediate access to bookmarks in mobile Safari. You do not have immediate access to bookmarks on mobile Chrome. And you CANNOT use desktop chrome on Android. Jeeeze! How the hell are people so blind and so deft??? catalysto I'm not expounding on anything; I'm just mentioning a feature I really like about Chrome and one of the reasons I prefer it over other browsers. In any case, I see this conversation is going nowhere. So as I suggested earlier, we'll just have to agree to disagree. =) Marty Yeah, whatever. Thankfully there's now a much better alternative on Android. No need to put up with Google's ignorance or laziness. Marty Here's what I hear people like you say...people who seem to f*cking love the bookmarks in mobile Chrome: "I have to press a billion buttons to get to bookmarks in mobile Chrome, but they're there. What's wrong?" Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling mxwp it's none of those reasons. it is because people with ipads don't buy new ipads every year, unlike with their iphones. everyone that wants one pretty much already has one. Marty To a certain extent, that's probably true. I know for myself that if my 16GB iPad Air 2 hadn't kept running out of space whenever I tried to install a few free apps BGR's daily listing, I would have kept using it and never would have bought a new one with more storage. But what you're saying assumes everyone already owns an iPad. Not likely. I run into people all the time online and in person who don't own one. So I believe there's a huge marketing potential if Apple can figure out how to sell the iPad properly. JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Master Yates Agreed. The Nexus 7 2013 was way ahead of its time and that why its lasted so long. I'm not an LCD fan but the screen on the Nexus 7 2013 remains awesome. Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Zap Rowsdower Someone who has somebody else paying for it, like a school or company or relative as a gift. I bought a no-name Android tablet a few months ago, with keyboard and case for US$39.00. I popped a 512MB sd card in it and it's in my workshop for playing music on bluetooth speakers, watching how-to videos, casting to a nearby TV, whatever ... and other than a crap screen resolution, it's fast and works great. $39.00! Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k...

Ethan Nelson-Moore In a root terminal run: sleep 5; echo ff > /proc/ektf_dbg Then set your tablet on a flat surface and don't touch it for 5 seconds. It will recalibrate the screen. mxwp that was stated in the article... people with tablets are not buying new ones Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) shonangreg Yeah, I've been waiting for a couple of years to buy a replacement for my Nexus 7. Other than the NVidia Shield K1, nothing was decent. So, I finally got an iPad Pro 9.7 last year (discount coupon with a pocket WiFi device). I still want a replacement for the Nexus 7, but I'm reluctant to buy the Shield K1 now as it is at the end of its life (and still not heavily discounted, at least here in Japan). Nicholas Conrad Yeah, I didn't buy a K1 because I was convinced an X1 tablet was just around the corner, regret that now. Sorry to hear about your ipad: I had one once, it was terrible. Zap Rowsdower Why was owning your iPad a terrible experience? That would be helpful to know. shonangreg My iPad has become my favorite device. I use the iPad for all communications (all duplicated on my phone and most on my N7). It is only when I'm at my desk or walking that my PCs or my phone get their turn. Si vis pacem, para bellum To me it's not even that, it's the lack of choice between the very good ones (the "way overpriced" ones). I have a 2.5+ years old Tab S 10.5 LTE which I love and use a lot when at home and even use as a laptop replacement when I live part of the year abroad (I used to carry my Windows laptop with me, not anymore). I don't see any real alternatives to my Tab S (I may be interested in a Pixel C, now that with Nougat it has finally got MultiWindows, but it's not sold here in Italy) and I have not upgraded to a Tab S2 nor am I probably going to upgrade to the Tab S3 because the marginal improvements are simply not worth it. Actually, they almost feel like a downgrade since they have removed the IR blaster (which I DO use), they put smaller batteries, they went for the 4:3 aspect ratio (I much prefer 16:10) and the S3 has a glass back (I MUCH prefer the "rubbery" one of my Tab S! At least they didn't choose a F'ing metal back, which is the thing that I hate the most on handheld devices). Compelling new features (like an *integrated* S-Pen, I am a Note user from the original one and I miss it on my tablet!) or substantial improvements in specs/battery life are the only reasons who would motivate me to upgrade since I don't have any problems with my Tab S: while not exactly blazing fast it runs quite well (it's on stock, rooted Marshmallow) and still gives me 5+ hours of SOT. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Then theirs Windows 2in1s. Windows 10 is definitely the way to go for 10inch screens. Ah I see what Microsoft did there lol. UniBroW Except the new ipad at $329, it's lightening fast and loads web content like a champ. Couple that with ad blockers from the App Store and you have a great tablet that can't do most PC things but amazingly good once you get over the home screen PVL_93_RU Here's the problem though... it's an Apple device. If you were an avid user of something like the Nexus 7 - you'd have to make a big switch to a whole new platform. Meaning you need to get used to new software, to deal with certain missing features, as well as having to repurchase the entire library of your apps and games, which is a big investment on top of buying the iPad in the first place. Then there's cases, accessories, .. JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Master Yates Nexus 9's? I'm surprised people aren't paying you to take them away. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Iamsecond Exactly! It irritates me every time I see a 'tablets sales decline' article that no-one seems to mention this. Tablets are simple devices for simple use cases such as web browsing and media consumption and so most older tablets do the job just fine. shonangreg A lot of Nexus 7 owners have been waiting ... and wanting ... Other than the Shield K1, there has been nothing. I do watch Huawei with interest; seems too locked down, though. We were told long ago that the bottleneck in OS upgrades for our phones were the carriers. This isn't a problems for tablets, generally, yet their track record is maybe even worse than phones. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. AQ Yup, though I got it for only $70 it retails for $150 from AT&T, which still isn't bad for all the features it has. I love that its GSM unlocked, no WiFi only limits when I really want to use something that requires internet when away from home. Also it's great for GPS (loud, big & bright). StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Vay L My n7 2013 touch barely work and i had this problem for over a year now. Im waiting for Lenovo tab 4 10 plus to be released this month. it looks promising on paper Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... TedPhillips as someone who's recently been rewatching TnG, there are stacks of padd's (of various sizing), and the 'vertical file divider' style for collections of padd's on the show. Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small. tinabolina2017 They aren't giving people what they want.the chips in then are too slow and the LTE is too expensive royrov Well, if Google just could sell their Pixel hardware here on Norway, I would have bought one a long time ago.. Richard Markert The verdict is in: nobody really wants tablets. Lord Argyris I'll just echo a lot of what has already been said here and in the article: the tablet product category as a whole has been cannibalized by other devices. Even traditional laptops have started to make inroads. Recently I narrowed down my choice for a new computer to a Surface Pro 4 or a 13-inch MBP and went with the latter. It's small and light enough that I don't miss the additional portability of the Surface or a new tablet. Part of my intention with the new purchase was to largely replace multiple devices, including my Nexus 7 (2013). The latter mostly sits in a drawer now, being taken out only when I want to go further than a few rooms over and have a computing device with me. Nearly three and a half years ago, when the Nexus 7 (2013) was new, this would have been inconceivable. Even high end laptops were prohibitively heavier, larger, and had worse battery life, not to mention they still in some cases ran hot and had noisy fans. They also typically had low resolution (>200 PPI) and poorly calibrated screens (sometimes even with a sub-sRGB gamut and a TN panel), which made media consumption a significantly worse experience than you could get on much cheaper tablet (and smartphone) hardware. Especially in the PC space, the hardware has since gotten much better (the lingering MacBook Air range being a notable exception). Over the years, the list of exclusive advantages one could get from buying a tablet has grown shorter, and new product categories (2-in-1s, large smartphones) have emerged to draw away market share. I'm actually glad tablets happened, as they seem to have been a great catalyst to make the other computing categories improve. Mike I purchased and used a Nexus 10 quite a bit when I had a Galaxy Nexus. After getting a Note 2 I just didn't see the need anymore. I tried to convert it to be a laptop replacement but all of the keyboard/mouse peripherals were pretty bad. About a year or two ago I purchased an Asus Chromebook Flip and for half the price of the Nexus 10 it does so much more (Albeit, it was released a couple years later but still, a tablet can't do what a dedicated laptop can). As someone who was one of the biggest fans of tablets when they first started becoming mainstream (Owned a Tab S2, Nexus 7, Nexus 10) I wouldn't mind if they just died off at this point. PVL_93_RU No surprise there, really The classic tablets as we know them are slowly becoming less popular because the tech advancements in them have slowed down, people aren't needed to replace their current tablets with newer models as often as phones, and the introduction of projects like RemixOS or the Android App compatibility in ChromeOS, as well as the rising spread of convertibles, is making the classic tablet pretty much an obsolete product Unless the tablet market makes a revolution of some sort (be it in functionality or hardware etc) - the decline will only continue. Hell, even Apple is struggling, despite bringing the Pro and the Mini to the table justmy2pennies2012 My Ipad Air is 3 1/2 years old. My only complaint is I purchased the LTE verison and it only has 16GB. It still does what I need it to do, comsume media, web surf, etc. I use my Laptop for my computing needs. I would love to replace it with an Android tablet. My son still has a Nexus 2012/2013 tablet but it is slow has heck. He prefers his Android phone over his old as heck android tablet. I tend to replace my phone evry 22-24 months, but tend to go 3-4 years on a tablet. The newer Ipad isn't to bad feature and price wise IMHO. I had the first Moto tablet (yes the heavy one) but returned it within 30 days back in 2010. I think once manufacturers can produce a quality tablet in a mid price range (not too expensive not too cheap where they can't support it), sales will increase. With the lower price of the newer Ipads,this makes it harder for android tablets to compete on features and price. 1966CAH The only people really surprised by this are the ones who hopped aboard the "Tablets are the Next Big Thing!!!" hypetrain. There's a market for tablets just like there's a market for smartwatches. Neither of them have or likely will fulfill the pipe dreams of their early cheerleaders. They have largely achieved their market saturation point is all, and the demand just isn't what was hyped. I had both versions of the Nexus 7 and now have the Shield K1. When I get home at night, I put down the phone and use the tablet almost exclusively. I don't have any need to upgrade until such time as mine bites the dust or it's too obsolete, but when the time comes I will be looking to replace it. Colin Rowlands If you are mostly using a tablet for consuming media and browsing, there simply isn't any real need to upgrade a tablet until your current one dies, so it is no wonder that sales are decreasing. Bernhard Mähr Waiting since two years for a good 7" table with recent Android version.
