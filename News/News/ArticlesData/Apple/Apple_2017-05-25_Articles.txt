The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Making their mark: 375 Granite Hills seniors graduate Thursday Thursday May 25, 2017 at 12:01 AM May 25, 2017 at 10:31 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — For the third night in a row, the sound of joy filled Newton T. Bass Stadium as the graduating class of Granite Hills High School received their diplomas. The cold wind couldn’t hold back the wave of Cougar pride that swept through the stadium as family and friends cheered on 375 graduating seniors during Granite Hills High School’s commencement ceremony in Apple Valley on Thursday. “This class of unique students have left its mark on this school," Principal Chuck McCall said. “You have personified the best of Granite Hills High School.” As students waited anxiously to receive their diplomas, McCall boasted on the class of 2017’s accomplishments in the arenas of academics, athletics and art. McCall said the graduating class was “more than GPA’s,” adding that it’s not what the seniors “had accomplished” over the last four year, but rather how they went about accomplishing their goals. Co-valedictorians Katherine Hele, Nigel Doering, Shreyas Patel and Arjun Sharma delivered inspirational speeches that included quotes from TV shows or people who had climbed the ladder of success. Hele thanked her parents, family, coaches, teachers and friends for their love and support over her last four year, and said the lessons she learned at GHS could be compared to creating a ceramic piece of art as she was shaped, carved, refined and shaped over time by “Throughout our lifetime, we will create many intrinsic pieces of art and your life experience will contribute to your mosaic,” Hele said. “So my fellow classmates, let us use the talents, skills and time we have to make the world a more beautiful place.” Hele closed out her address by using a quote from a classic TV series to explain their futures, “It is a dimension as vast as space and timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man’s fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone.” During his address, Patel thanked GHHS teachers for dedicating themselves to producing “successful students.” He also thanked his family and parents who played a vital role in his success. “I can’t forget my sister,” Patel said. “She was the person who kept me motivated to work hard as I had to achieve the same valedictorian status she had back in 2011.” Patel concluded his speech by telling his fellow classmates to “always keep dreaming,” even if they are unsure of the future. He encouraged the class by using a quote from TV host Stephen Colbert who said, “Thankfully, dreams can change. If we’d all stuck with our first dreams, the world would be overrun with cowboys and princesses.” After thanking his father for their special relationship, and mother for her kind heartedness and inspiration, Sharma thanked his extended family of uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents for their support. Sharma also thanked his friends before he inspired his class with a quote from Bruce Lee who said, “Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. If you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can flow or it can crash. Be like water, my friend.” Doering told his classmates they should follow the examples of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, two of the richest men in the world who defined success by the happiness and love exemplified by those around them. “I believe these two men are right. And that in order to feel accomplished and successful in our lifetime, we must work to take care of and love those around us,” Doering said. “It is a great hope of mine that all of us go forth into the world and instead of focusing on making money for ourselves, we focus on making those closest to us happy…” During the ceremony, students with the school’s Vocal Music Department harmonized beautifully as they sang Sarah McLachlan’s “I Will Remember You,” the “Irish Blessing,”“I’ll Be There” by The Jackson 5 and GHHS’ “Alma Mater.” Governing Council President Dominique Fenton told her class, “Everyone of us is destined for great things” and each one of them is the “author” of their own destiny.

Which Apple Watch Size Should I Buy? By Josh Smith Posted on 03/10/2015 “Which Apple Watch size should I buy?” is the most common question we’ve heard in the last 24 hours from potential buyers who already know which Apple Watch model they want, but are having trouble choosing the right Apple Watch size. We’ll help you with a short and to the point guide to picking the right size Apple Watch for your wrist. The right Apple Watch size isn’t about being a man or a woman, it comes down to the size of your wrist and a few other factors. The small Appel Watch size is 38mm and the larger is 42mm. Read: Apple Watch vs Moto 360: Features & Price In terms of the actual size of the Apple Watch on your wrist this is 38 x 33.3 mm and 42 x 35.9mm. Both of the Apple Watch sizes are 10.5mm thick. How to pick the right Apple Watch size. Keep in mind that while we can help you pick an Apple Watch size, you can also go into an Apple Watch store on April 10th to try on the various Apple Watch sizes and models and pre-order before the Apple Watch release date on April 24th. You don’t need to wait though. Apple Watch Size Guide You can use an Apple Watch size guide at home to see what the two Apple Watch sizes look like on your wrist. You’ll need an iPhone or an iPad and the free Apple App Store app. Use the iPhone app to see the Apple Watch sizes on your wrist. Open the Apple App Store App and tap on Apple Watch and then Tap on one of the Apple Watch models. Next Tap on View Pricing in the upper right. In the middle of the next screen is a link to Compare case sizes. Tap on that to see the actual size of the Apple Watch on your iPhone. While you cannot see through the screen to your wrist, you can hold this up on your wrist to get a better idea of the Apple Watch size that best fits your wrist. This won’t replace actually trying an Apple Watch on at an Apple Store, but it is very handy. Print Apple Watch sizes true to life and try them on. The next best thing you can do is print the Apple Watch size guide from Kirkville, that delivers actual size Apple Watch photos from the App Store that you can cut out and put on your own wrist. Download the PDF and print it at 100%, don’t let your computer fit to page or any other scaling, and then cut out the watch face and set it on your wrist. What’s the Right Apple Watch Size? Is there a perfect watch size for men and a perfect watch size for women? We couldn’t find a straight answer about the best watch size for men or the best watch size for women that could help people choose the right Apple Watch size. Read: Apple Watch Price Details A Blog to Watch tells readers to buy the right watch size for your wrist, explaining in more detail what a good rule is for a man’s watch, “First, ensure that the lugs of a watch (those things that hold the strap) don’t extend over your wrist when wearing the watch. This can vary a lot because the same watch case size can have a lot of different lug sizes. The opposite is also true. If the lugs are no where near the ends of your wrist then the watch will appear dainty and feminine or child-like, and you don’t want that as well” In a poll on their site most men preferred a watch between 40 and 44 mm in size, which points to the larger Apple Watch size as a good bet. On Ask Men, the Watch Snob says that 39mm is the right size, which points to the smaller 38mm Apple Watch so there really is no perfect answer. According to JomaShop, the most popular woman’s watch sizes are from 26 mm to 36mm. This suggests a look at the smaller 38mm Apple Watch size, but there is also not a clear-cut best watch size. Apple Watch Band Size Guide Use this guide to pick the right Apple Watch band size. In addition to picking the right Apple Watch size you need to pick the right Apple Watch band size. Apple includes two bands in the Apple Watch Sport box so users can try the medium and large bands on. Read: The Do’s and Don’ts of Apple Watch Etiquette Once you graduate to the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, or if you want to buy a new Apple Watch band for your Apple Watch Sport, you will need to look at the various sizes Appel offers. To figure this out, you need to measure your wrist circumference and see how it compares to the Apple Watch band sizing guide. It’s best to measure in mm, as Apple uses this on the listing. 30 Exciting Things You Can Do With the Apple Watch Answer Calls on the Apple Watch   1 / 30 You can answer a call on your Apple Watch using it as a small Bluetooth speaker phone. After using a similar feature from a Samsung watch we know you'll definitely want to use this only for short calls and to be conscious of where you are taking calls. If you wouldn't talk on speakerphone, you shouldn't talk on your Apple Watch. You cannot answer a FaceTime or FaceTime Audio call on the Apple Watch. You can choose to answer and transfer a call to the iPhone.    1 / 30 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Apple 5 Things to Know About the iOS 10.3.2 Update The iOS 10.3.2 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch is now the most up-to-date version o… 05/24/2017 15 min read 10 Things to Do Before Installing iOS 10.3.2 The iOS 10.3.2 update is out of beta and today we want to walk you through some steps to t… 05/24/2017 5 min read 9 Things to Know About the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 Update The iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update is a small but important release for the former flagship a… 05/23/2017 6 min read Load More In Apple 2 Comments 2 Comments Aayaan 04/30/2017 at 10:27 pm IT is such that the APPLE WATCH help in every movement.

Apple iPhone 8 has seen quite a few leaks in these past weeks, including the pictures of the supposed moulds giving a glimpse into the possible design for the upcoming phones. Now a new video render has leaked of the iPhone 8 dummy, which gives a close look at the upcoming smartphone. The video indicates the home button will be removed, and the dual rear camera on this is vertically stacked. Twitter user and tipster Benjamin Geskin has posted a video render of the iPhone 8 on YouTube channel as well as on his Twitter account. The videos show this iPhone 8 won’t have a home button and also gives a close look at how the device could look like from the sides. The rear camera set up is also seen, and this one is vertically stacked, which is incidentally what we also saw on the leaked moulds. Once again this, don’t forget this is a ‘dummy’ iPhone 8 and the final device could look nothing like this render. However, there have been several reports saying the iPhone 8 won’t have a home button on the front. The reason for this: Apple iPhone 8 will have a near bezel-less display, which means the company will have to get rid of the home button on the front. Questions are also being raised about where the iPhone 8’s fingerprint sensor will be placed if the home button disappears. Some reports have said iPhone 8 will have the Touch ID scanner embedded under the display, but it remains to be seen how this will be implemented. Apple iPhone 8 will also sport an all glass chassis, rather than the aluminium one we’ve seen on the series so far. Apple is also expected to introduce wireless charging, and an OLED display with its anniversary edition iPhone. Some reports have pegged the iPhone 8 pricing at $870 going up all the way to $1000 for the 256GB version. Others have said, it could start at $1000 itself given an increased cost in components. Apple will launch the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus together, claim reports. The new iPhone 8 is expected to boost sales for the company, which has seen a drop in iPhone sales thanks to the market maturing and a global slowdown in smartphone sales.

The Galaxy S8 sports what Samsung calls as Infinity Display and has display ratio of 18.5:9. The new aspect ratio is slightly slimmer than the standard 16:9 and favors easy handling and usage. This is perhaps why Apple might adopt the same display aspect ratio for the iPhone 8. According to Digitimes, major display panel makers for mobile applications are boosting production of 18:9 aspect ratio displays in later this year. The boost is said to meet increased demands for display with the said size. The market is expecting a massive increase in orders from phone makers like Apple and Samsung for 18:9 displays. The report also claims that Apple will use the same aspect ratio display for the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 is expected to sport a 5.8-inch OLED display panel. Although there is an obvious increase in display area, the smartphone will assume a size similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone. Beneath the display will be the Touch ID sensor for biometric scanning. Alleged iPhone mockup (by Benjamin Geskin) Apart from the new display technology, the iPhone 8 is also rumored to include various new features. Chief of which is the augmented reality feature. This particular feature will make use of the 3D front camera of the phone. The iPhone 8 will also have infrared sensors to detect depth to compliment the 3D cameras. Perhaps another feature that most Android fans will be happy to hear is the wireless charging functionality. For quite some time now, Android fans have been enjoying wireless charging on some premium Android phones. Having the same feature on the iPhone 8 will definitely pique the interest of many Android fans. Despite many rumors of production delays, experts are still confident that Apple will be able to deliver the iPhone 8 later this year. Perhaps Apple is under pressure right now due to the fact that missing the 2017 release for the phone may lead to lost opportunity. Samsung is also expected to release the Galaxy Note 8 later this year. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The growing belief right now is that Apple will be releasing a new MacBook Pro at the Worldwide Developer Conference on June 5, an act that may work against the Cupertino company. While most have been placing heavy criticism on the laptops released in late 2016, the cycle of introducing the MacBook line has been singled out.  The MacBook Pro 2016 came out last year, a much-needed refresh for the device that sorely needed an update. The only problem then was that it came with an old chipset (Intel Skylake) limited to 16GB. As one would guess, power-hungry users were upset, since they wanted the best possible configuration they could get.  Most wanted to see the Intel Kaby Lake SoCs on board, but supply issues were rampant at that time. In short, timing was a bit off. Rival Microsoft opted to delay its Surface Pro series, releasing them in early 2017.  Apple could have followed the same tactic, only that the clamor for a new MacBook Pro was growing loud. Would have it made sense to delay the device until early 2017 as well? Probably.  Regardless, looming on the horizon is Apple releasing an updated version of its MacBook Pro line outside its normal scheduled route. Months apart, most are already anticipating Intel Kaby Lake chip-backed devices. Under normal circumstances, it would have been good news, but not for the ones who took Apple up on its offer with the MacBook Pro 2016.  It is a gamble that could put a dent on Apple’s credibility. Even with the backlash on the underpowered MacBook Pro 2016, many still took the bait. In fact, Trendforce reports a 15-percent year-on-year rise for the last quarter of 2016. With the cycle more than likely to be broken with a potential release of updated MacBooks next week, Apple will have to give a plausible explanation for doing so. While most know the reason behind it, one couldn't help but wonder what follows next later this year. This is assuming there will be another batch coming out.  The effects could be detrimental, with consumers being thrown off with an untimely release. Most want a powerful MacBook Pro, and the early 2017 version seems to be such. Looking ahead, will a new batch stay on schedule? Or will they save new variants for consumers before the year comes to a close?

Alsoft DiskWarrior 5 (for Mac) editor rating: excellent Comments May 25, 2017 REVIEW Comments SPECS COMPARE View Gallery View All 5 Photos in Gallery MSRP $119.00 Pros Repairs and rebuilds Mac directories to improve system reliability and performance. Useful hardware and maintenance tools. Effective for traditional hard disk and solid-state drives. Easy to use. Affordable. Cons The OS X Recovery partition complicates booting into the utility. Bottom Line While other data recovery utilities can scan disks to recover lost or deleted files, DiskWarrior is unrivaled in its ability to repair and rebuild the Mac directory. By William Fenton Alsoft DiskWarrior 5 is the data recovery software that Apple forgot to include. In fact, that isn't entirely true: Apple once bundled the third-party utility with AppleCare. Today, the utility is no less useful for a swivel-neck iMac or a MacBook with a solid-state drive (SSD). In fact, Alsoft DiskWarrior 5 is one of the best utilities you can buy for your Mac. //Compare Similar Products Compare Prosoft Data Rescue 4 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Stellar Phoenix Mac Data Recovery 7 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Seagate Premium File Recovery Suite 2.5 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% CleverFiles Disk Drill Pro 3 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Background I've been using the $119 DiskWarrior to perform routine maintenance and to resurrect defunct Macs since it shipped on a CD. While Alsoft has updated the utility and adopted flash storage over the past 18 years, DiskWarrior continues to perform maintenance and recovery tasks that no other utility can do. That includes utilities from Apple, whose Disk Utility may be suitable for basic maintenance and partition, but remains ill-prepared to repair badly damaged directories that result in kernel panics and boot failures. While Prosoft Data Rescue 4 can scan disks to recover lost or deleted files, DiskWarrior is unrivaled in its ability to repair and rebuild the Mac directory. It's worth the price of admission. Reviewing a previous version of the utility, we described DiskWarrior as almost singularly focused on rebuilding damaged directories. In the current version, the method has changed, but not the aim. DiskWarrior is designed to scan, maintain, and repair the directory, which you can think of as a table of contents. Defective RAM, power glitches, and poorly-written software can throw that table of contents into disorder. View All 5 Photos in Gallery As a senior Alsoft technician explained it, Apple's file system (HSF+) is a complicated animal. DiskWarrior rebuilds that file system using existing data. Unlike other utilities that attempt to repair problems in the existing directory, DiskWarrior creates a new directory. Given that a directory contains millions of data points, the process is simpler in theory than practice. Repairing a directory can make files and partitions reappear, improve performance, and even recoup disk space. If a disk is mechanically failing, DiskWarrior lets you repair your Mac's directory and back up its data before you replace the drive. Usage Now that Apple has largely jettisoned disk drives, Alsoft ships the utility on a flash drive. (You can also create your own using a 2GB flash drive.) If your system is running OS 10.6 or earlier (preinstalled on Macs prior to 2011), you can boot directly off the drive by holding down the Option key. Since Apple released its Recovery partition (with OS X 10.7), the process has become more complicated. You must boot into the Recovery partition (you hold down the R key), launch the Terminal (from the Utilities menu), and enter a command into the prompt (/Volumes/DW/go). It's important that to enter that command exactly: add a space or lose a slash and DiskWarrior won't launch. It took me longer than I care to admit to realize I had forgotten to include the forward slash before Volumes. I encountered two additional, but easily resolvable, issues. The version of DiskWarrior included on my flash drive wasn't compatible with my operating system (macOS Sierra). This hiccup gave me the opportunity to create my own bootable drive using the latest version of DiskWarrior Recovery Maker (v1.1), a three-minute process. When I booted into DiskWarrior, my drive registered as locked. I discovered that this was because I had enabled FileVault, which encrypts data. Thankfully, DiskWarrior lets you disable the feature by clicking an unlock button and entering a FileVault password. Testing Results I tested DiskWarrior's three main functions. S.M.A.R.T diagnostics, in the Hardware tab, reassured me that nothing was wrong with my three-year-old SSD. I used the Files tab to correct my permissions and scan my files and folders for issues. The test required about four minutes, after which DiskWarrior indicated that it had verified and repaired my permissions, checked the property list of 3,316 files, and checked the resource data of 2,847 files. Fortunately, no major problems were found. My directory, on the other hand, needed work. The Directory tab includes a color-coded optimization index: green indicates that a directory is not fragmented; yellow suggests it's inefficient; and red indicates serious issues. My SSD was designated inefficient. I clicked the Rebuild button and watched the utility glide through ten steps. After six minutes, DiskWarrior notified me that it had "successfully built a new optimized directory." I clicked Replace and hoped for the best. A moment later, I had a new directory and clean, green bill of health. Replacing a directory isn't some academic issue. Since I ran DiskWarrior, applications launch quicker and—this surprised me—I gained about 20GB of hard drive space, not an insignificant sum on a 120GB disk. A senior Alsoft technician explained that as a directory becomes less efficient, it wastes more space. By replacing an inefficient directory with a more efficient one, DiskWarrior eliminates wasted space and makes it easier for the operating system to locate files and folders. A Great Utility DiskWarrior won't help you to recover the document or spreadsheet you accidentally deleted. For that, you should consider a data recovery utility, such as Prosoft Data Rescue 4 or Data Drill. However, when it comes to repairing a Mac volume, a utility like Data Drill cannot compare to DiskWarrior, which, after more than two decades in the business, continues to offer the most effective tool for repairing and rebuilding Mac directories.

CleverFiles Disk Drill Pro 3 (for Mac) editor rating: excellent Comments May 25, 2017 REVIEW Comments SPECS COMPARE View Gallery View All 5 Photos in Gallery MSRP $89.00 Pros Excellent file recovery with best-in-class file signature support. Superb filtering. Unique features, including data protection and iOS recovery. Affordable. Cons Ineffective for recovering files on solid-state drives. Some features less useful than others. Bottom Line If you have Mac with a traditional hard drive, Disk Drill Pro offers one of the most advanced data recovery utilities available. By William Fenton If you've ever accidently saved over a document or deleted a presentation, you know the pain that comes with losing a file. CleverFiles Disk Drill Pro 3 ($89) turns back that clock. The data recovery utility scans a desktop's hard drive—and any external drives connected to it—in order to retrieve and reconstruct lost files. Thanks to exceptionally thorough scanning and vast signature support, it returns a trove of results that you can winnow with advanced filters. Like its peers, Disk Drill won't be of much service if your computer uses a solid-state drive, and the Windows version is less feature-rich than its sibling on the Mac (which I tested). But if you have an Apple computer with a traditional hard drive, Disk Drill Pro offers one of the most advanced data recovery utilities available. //Compare Similar Products Compare Prosoft Data Rescue 4 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Stellar Phoenix Mac Data Recovery 7 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Seagate Premium File Recovery Suite 2.5 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Alsoft DiskWarrior 5 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Options and Pricing DiskDrill Basic compares favorably with other try-before-you-buy options: In addition to allowing you to verify recoverable data, Basic also allows you to back up failing disks and to recover protected data. At $89, the Pro version, which I tested, is more affordable than competitors, which retail between $99 and $119. CleverFiles also offers 20 percent discounts for education, non-profit, and government workers, and lifetime upgrades for a sensible $29. Installable on three desktops, the utility's license is less generous than DiskWarrior (unlimited) and Data Rescue (five desktops), but more straightforward than Stellar Phoenix Mac Data Recovery 7 (one transferable) or the Seagate Premium File Recovery Suite 2.5 (one desktop, 24 recoveries or one year). View All 5 Photos in Gallery Finally, CleverFiles offers enterprise licensing (for $399), which can be installed on an unlimited number of desktops. While Disk Drill is a relatively small outfit that lacks dedicated recovery (as with Seagate or Prosoft), the enterprise version of the software allows users to export forensic data (DFXML) for further analysis. Those with older Macs should also note that the latest version of Disk Drill requires OS X 10.8.5 or later, which would have come preinstalled with any Apple computer purchased after the fall of 2013. People running older desktops can use an earlier version of Disk Drill or consider Seagate or DiskWarrior, which offer more generous legacy support. Windows users should also note that the Mac version is more feature-rich. The Testing Grounds I tested Disk Drill alongside four other recovery utilities using two Macs: an early-2015 MacBook Pro and a late-2014 Mac Mini. Both systems run the same version of macOS Sierra. The MacBook Pro features a 120GB solid-state drive (SSD), whereas the Mac Mini uses a 500GB hard disk drive (HDD). To ensure uniform testing, I deleted the same files on both machines two weeks prior to testing. In the interest of testing real world usage, I selected six common file types (DOC, XLS, PDF, JPG, MP3, and MP4). While I will also discuss some of the utility's unique features, this review focuses on file recovery. Disk Drill offers numerous types of recovery scans. I selected the most exhaustive mode, Deep Scan, to maximize my chances of file recovery. Deep Scan supports a huge number of file signatures—357 at last count—and uses something called signature analysis to find files based upon their structure. This enables the utility to reconstruct and retrieve files that might not otherwise be accessible. To its credit, CleverFiles acknowledges that people with SSD-powered PCs are unlikely to recover deleted files. The issue is a command called TRIM, which zeroes out the parts of the drive where deleted files were stored. By clearing sectors that are no longer in use, TRIM extends the lifespan of a SSD, but it also greatly reduces the efficacy of data recovery utilities. There is, however, a possibility that utilities can retrieve recently deleted files. According to the FAQ: "If your OS did not initiate this request (due to an error, or power failure, or delayed CPU response), the sectors containing deleted data will stay readable to Disk Drill, and data may still be recovered." I opted to test both an SSD and HDD because of the challenges solid-state drives present for data recovery software. Data Recovery Running a Deep Scan on my SSD was fast—less than 40 minutes in total. The utility identified 34 files and 30 reconstructed files, about as good as any utility managed with my SSD. Of those files, Disk Drill mainly identified preference and extension files (plist and pss), though it did recover seven PNG images. I was unable to recover any of the files I intentionally deleted. Running a Deep Scan on my HDD was much slower but much more fruitful. The scan required almost two days, though I would add that the drive is heavily fragmented, and that I ran the utility alongside three others. The results were exhaustive. Disk Drill retrieved a very respectable 67,000 files and 172,000 reconstructed files. I cannot imagine browsing all those results without Disk Drill's advanced filtering. In addition to filtering by file type, CleverFiles lets you sort by size (ranging from kilobytes to gigabytes) and deletion date (from days to years). Matched with integrated search, these filters eliminate guesswork. For example, searching for "DOC" and filtering for documents below 128 kilobytes and deleted in the past year, I winnowed tens of thousands of results to 23. After I located the document I intentionally deleted, I clicked a Recover button, which prompted me to save the file to a different destination folder. I selected my desktop, and voilà, I retrieved my original document. I'm happy to report that I was able to retrieve all the files I had intentionally deleted. I lost some file names, but I found that by sorting by file type and deletion date, and using the integrated preview (Mac OS X Quick Look), I was able to identify originals without too much difficulty. While my testing focused on recovering popular files from a single partition, I would remiss if I didn't add that Disk Drill can scan and recover other partitions, such as a Windows Boot Camp partition or Apple's Recovery partition. Additional Features Disk Drill includes a host of other features. One distinguishing feature is iOS Data Recovery, which can help you retrieve data that's recently been deleted (typically no longer than 14 days). Because iOS Recovery relies upon iTunes backups, you must sync devices with your desktops if you expect to recover anything. For those who rely upon iCloud backup, the utility will gain an iCloud Recovery feature soon, according to a CleverFiles technician. Plus, Disk Drill can access most Android devices. Disk Drill includes a feature called Disk Health, a S.M.A.R.T. monitoring menu item that visualizes the health and usage of a drive. I only used the tool to confirm the health of my SSD (which thankfully registered a healthy 92 percent wear level), though CleverFiles deserves praise for including a feature that's rarely bundled with other data recovery utilities. For example, Prosoft sells a separate, (admittedly richer) optimization tool, Drive Genius. Clean Up and Duplicate Finder help identify and remove bloated applications and files. Unlike the uninstaller AppZapper, which analyzes an application to remove all its tentacles, Clean Up simply removes the application file. While it's a nice add-on, I'm not convinced the feature does anything I can't do manually. Duplicate Finder lets you select and scan a folder for space-wasting duplicates. For example, when I processed my Pictures folder, I located a couple dozen duplicates, several of which I opted to delete. Bolder users can also apply rules to automatically retain a newer or older version of a file. If you have a flash drive (2GB or larger), you can also create a bootable Recovery Drive, similar to Prosoft Data Rescue 4's BootWell feature. While it's a valuable add-on, if my Mac wouldn't boot properly I would opt for Alsoft's premier recovery utility, the Editors' Choice award-winning DiskWarrior 5. Disk Drill also bundles features to protect a drive against future data loss. First, you can create a byte-for-byte copy of a drive using Data Backup. Backing up my SSD to an external USB 3.0 drive required several hours, which isn't surprising given that the utility created a 120GB DMG file. By enabling Data Protection, you can safeguard against future data loss. The feature doesn't work retrospectively; that is, you need to install the utility prior to losing data. Disk Drill offers two modes of data protection: Guaranteed Recovery, which safeguards particular folders (e.g. Documents), and Recovery Vault, which protects the disk. Unfortunately for people using PCs with solid-state drives, Recovery Vault is only available if TRIM is disabled, ill-advised given that the command extends to the life of SSDs. Peace of Mind Disk Drill Pro is an excellent choice for data recovery on HDD-based Macs. In addition to vast file signature support, CleverFiles offers one of the best sets of filters to pare down results, which is hugely important when browsing tens of thousands of files. It also comes packed with useful features related to data protection. While Disk Drill can repair Mac volumes, the utility is no replacement for veteran DiskWarrior when it comes to rebuilding directories. If you need an in-house recovery lab, you may gravitate toward offerings from Seagate and Prosoft. However, traditional consumers would be hard-pressed to find a more effective, feature-rich data recovery utility.

Apple previously said it would provide a live stream of the Worldwide Developers Conference through its Apple Developer website and through the WWDC app, but the new event page makes it clear the keynote event will be available for all to watch even without a developer account. WWDC 2017 is looking like it will be one of the most exciting conferences we've had in years. Along with introducing new versions of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, there are rumors suggesting Apple will introduce new hardware. New MacBooks and MacBook Pro models are expected, and there's a chance Apple will also introduce a refreshed MacBook Air. Rumors suggest the notebooks will feature more powerful processors and perhaps some other internal upgrades, but no design changes will be included. Along with new MacBooks, Apple may also introduce two much-rumored products, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the Siri speaker. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is said to feature a bigger display in a body that's similar in size to the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro, made possible through much smaller bezels. Apple's Siri speaker is the company's answer to the popular Amazon Echo, and it is expected to feature Siri integration, superior sound quality, and perhaps a touch display. For the June 5 keynote event, MacRumors will provide a live blog both here on MacRumors.com and on our MacRumorsLive Twitter account, along with detailed coverage of everything Apple announces during the week.

Instead Apple pays companies such as Foxconn a reimbursement for the licensing agreement that Foxconn has with Qualcomm, which is why Qualcomm is going after Apple’s suppliers since they’re the ones who are licensing from Qualcomm directly. According to Qualcomm’s general counsel Don Rosenberg, “We are confident that our contracts will be found valid and enforceable but in the interim it is only fair and equitable that our licensees pay for the property they are using.” Prior to this, Apple had accused Qualcomm of abusing its FRAND patents and has since filed a lawsuit of their own. This isn’t the first time that Qualcomm has landed themselves in legal trouble as the FTC is also going after the company, not to forget the various legal troubles they’ve encountered with government bodies in other parts of the world.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 26 May 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM Apple releases programming course for college students by benny evangelista The Swift programming curriculum is an extension of Cook's US jobs investment strategy. — Bloomberg Apple released a free college-level computer coding course designed to teach students how to create apps, a move that's part of the company's push to highlight its role in the US economy.  The one-year curriculum is called App Development With Swift. (Swift is a programming language used for Apple apps and devices.) Apple is offering the curriculum free on its iBooks Store, but has lined up six community college systems around the nation, including the San Mateo County Community College District, to use the course.  CEO Tim Cook announced a US$1bil (RM4.27bil) fund this month designed to create more US manufacturing jobs. The announcement came amid criticism by President Trump of Silicon Valley's reliance on overseas factories.  The Swift programming curriculum is an extension of Cook's US jobs investment strategy. Of the 2 million nationwide jobs supported by Apple, 1.5 million were linked to apps, the company said. The research firm App Annie said the worldwide app economy generated more than US$89bil (RM380.65bil) last year.  In an interview, Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environmental, policy and social initiatives, said the curriculum will help high school and college students develop skills needed for careers in that growing app economy.  "This isn't about politics," Jackson said. Rather, it is a way for Apple to demonstrate its commitment to the US economy.  But the course will train students in only one app language. While some have adapted Swift, whose source code is freely available and modifiable, to write apps for Google's rival Android operating system, the language is strongly associated with apps for Apple devices. In the first quarter, Android users downloaded more than twice as many apps as Apple users, according to App Annie.  The course will become part of the computer training courses available at San Bruno's Skyline College, one of three in the San Mateo County district. But it will be the first involving mobile app programming, said Andrea Vizenor, career and workforce training director. Skyline will offer a pilot program this summer, hoping to expand the curriculum to its sister campuses.  Vizenor said she didn't see a Swift-specific course as "just feeding" the Apple system. Instead, she hopes that the association with a popular brand will entice students "who wouldn't normally see themselves as computer science students." — San Francisco Chronicle/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Battle hardened eastern European tech entrepreneurs draw global interest Apple releases programming course for college students May to tell G-7 Google and Facebook must do more to fight terror Lenovo profit falls less than projected as PC market stabilises Facebook aims for broad views in ‘trending topics’ tweak Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read DBKL faces restrictions in curbing illegal foreign businesses Foreigners among militants fighting Philippine army in Mindanao - solicitor-general A glimpse into Sapura chairman’s success advertisement Latest News Hackers sought to discredit Russian opposition leader: researchers Lyft courts Uber’s high-end clientele with black car service May to tell G-7 Google and Facebook must do more to fight terror Waymo hunt for smoking gun turns to Uber acquisition report Facebook’s Zuckerberg urges Harvard grads to contemplate risk Most Viewed in Tech Facebook’s Zuckerberg urges Harvard grads to contemplate risk Some Uber and Lyft riders are giving up their own cars: poll Waymo hunt for smoking gun turns to Uber acquisition report Vietnam-linked hackers likely targeting Philippine intel on South China Sea dispute: FireEye Driverless cars will soon be learning from experience Amazon opens grocery pickup kiosks to rival Wal-Mart Google kills recruiters’ recovery with jobs for the bots May to tell G-7 Google and Facebook must do more to fight terror Lyft courts Uber’s high-end clientele with black car service Sony launches new Xperia X models Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

At a media preview yesterday, Apple Retail senior marketing director Denny Tuza said he believes the it “will be among the most popular in the world”. Here’s what you should know about Apple Orchard Road before its debut tomorrow. Designed to keep customers coming back Apple has nearly 500 stores worldwide in 20 countries. Last year, the tech company rebooted its retail space design worldwide to improve customer experience. The interior of the Apple Orchard Road Store in Singapore May 15, 2017. — TODAY picThe reboot was led by Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and senior vice president of retail Angela Ahrendts. Ive is most famed for designing the iPod, which paved the way for the iPhone and iPad. Ahrendts meanwhile left Burberry in 2014 to join Apple and was ranked 25th in Forbes list of the most powerful women in the world in 2015. Apple Orchard Road’s interior design is in many ways similar to those around the world. The first floor is “The Avenue” where its core products — the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Macs — are on display, and also has “Windows” where peripheries are displayed according to categories like music, photography or gaming. On the second floor, Apple attempts to evoke a “modern day town square” where customers can come to speak, learn or get tech support from the experts. The centrepiece is “The Forum”, with seats for customers to listen in to talks or workshops that can be screened on a large high definition display. The interior of the Apple Orchard Road Store in Singapore May 15, 2017. — TODAY picFlanking “The Forum” are two “Genius Groves”. Apple Orchard Road is the first in the world to have two, instead of one Grove. They replace the “Genius Bar” found in older Apple stores. A canopy of trees in each grove, with cushioned seats for customers to speak to its tech experts are the main feature. When Apple first rebooted its stores, the idea was to get customers to see the products, learn how they all work together, and eventually buy into more products and services to improve their experience. To emphasise customer experience even further, Tuza says its 36.6m long and 14m tall glass facade was “painstakingly” made to be extremely clear so as to blur the lines between the store and its exterior. “We want to remove any obstacles between us and the local community,” he said. Environmentally friendly Apple Orchard Road runs entirely on renewable energy, using rooftop solar installations provided by Singapore-based solar energy provider Sunseap Group. Apple’s current corporate office at One North is also entirely powered by solar energy, making the company the first in Singapore to run exclusively on renewable energy. The interior of the Apple Orchard Road Store in Singapore May 15, 2017. — TODAY picLearning for everyone Local photographers, film makers, musicians, illustrators, developers and entrepreneurs will be conducting a series of educational sessions at the store once it opens. This will come under the Today at Apple programme which launched worldwide on May 17. The sessions will be held at “The Forum”. The company is also organising photo and sketch walks out of its store. For instance, there will be sessions in street photography or shooting in low light carried out by in-house creative pros, or the Red Dot Heroes — local experts engaged by Apple. On May 28, photographer Chia Aik Beng will be holding a session about street photography in Singapore from 11am to 12.30pm. There will also be a session for kids on movie making on May 31 from 10am to 11am. Other sessions like coding or arts and design will also be held. Store information Apple Orchard Road will open daily from 10am to 10pm. It is located at Knightsbridge Mall, 270 Orchard Road, sandwiched between The Paragon and The Heeren. — TODAY                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week What you should know about Apple Orchard Road ahead of its May 27 opening Global chat platform Kik to launch digital currency Thailand to require biometric checks for pre-paid SIM cards in troubled south Chinese fans trash blackout as Google AI wins again Samsung investigating Galaxy S8 ‘iris hack’ Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows Free carpooling app for Singapore mosque-goers in time for Ramadan ‘Father of the Internet’ Vint Cerf says we should reach for the stars Watch out in a world of connected objects, cyber specialists warn Watch the moment Mark Zuckerberg found out he got into Harvard (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album When a hunter becomes the hunted ‘War for the Planet of the Apes’ gets new TV spot Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Apple store along Singapore’s Orchard Road to open May 27 Top iPhone apps: ‘Injustice 2,’ ‘B612,’ ‘Lottoland’ Apple Store along Singapore’s Orchard Road to open soon Apple’s App Store shatters records on New Year’s day Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Want a little more than the developer conference has to offer? Here are the events to check out. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference will be the focal point of the June 5-9 week in San Jose — but it's certainly not the only game in town. If you're attending WWDC or just hanging out in town with your fellow developers, designers, and tech pals, there are a bunch of other meetups, events, concerts, and secondary conferences worth your time. Here are just some of the ones we're looking forward to. Events & Parties Looking to hang out with fellow developers, tech journalists, and Apple aficionados during WWDC? Here are some of the awesome events and parties happening. Relay.fm WWDC17 Meetup (Monday, 7-9:30PM) Podcast network Relay.fm is hosting its yearly WWDC meetup on Monday, June 5 from 7PM-9:30PM at the San Jose Museum of Quilts and Textiles. Tickets have currently Sold Out, but you can also catch the Relay founders and podcasters at James Dempsey's Breakpoints show later in the week. Relay.fm WWDC17 Meetup The Beard Bash! (Monday, 8PM-12AM) Presented by iMore and the Loop, Jim Dalrymple's annual celebration of developers, Heineken, and rock and roll is entering its seventh year. Come hang out with Rene, myself, Jim, Dave Mark, and a host of rock 'n rollers as we bring the Beard Bash to the City National Civic Center in San Jose. Admission is free, but limited; get your ticket from The Loop now! 2017 Beard Bash The Talk Show with John Gruber Live (Tuesday Evening) Gruber brings the Talk Show to the California Theater in San Jose to interview an as-of-yet unnamed special guest. Who might show up in 2017? The past two years have seen Apple SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller and SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi take the stage; this year might bring another Apple executive to the forefront — or the long-awaited return of John Moltz. Anything's possible. Tickets will be available through Daring Fireball soon; keep an eye on the site for more details. The Talk Show Live James Dempsey and the Breakpoints LIVE (Wednesday, 7-11PM; show begins at 8:30PM) James Dempsey's coding-themed rock band is back for another year of strumming and singing about Swift, broken iPhones, and eponymous breakpoints. (If you're lucky, you may catch a glimpse of yours truly shredding on the ukulele.) In addition, Relay.fm is hosting a second meetup in the City National Civic with its hosts and co-founders. As always, the show is a benefit for App Camp for Girls courtesy women@wwdc; general admission tickets run you $35, with discounts for students and a VIP "unlimited-drink" ticket. James Dempsey and the Breakpoints LIVE Other conferences As the developer community has grown, tickets to WWDC have gone from hard to get to lottery-level impossible — and in response, the secondary conference was born. Usually held in the same area as WWDC, these conferences are designed for developers, designers, and enthusiasts who'd like to attend WWDC's social events, but can't (or choose not to) attend the flagship conference itself. AltConf (June 5-8) One of the first "alternative conferences," AltConf has provided a free space for WWDC-goers to learn and interact with fellow tech enthusiasts — whether or not they're actually attending WWDC. This year, AltConf is being hosted at the San Jose Marriot; the conference will stream the Keynote and State of the Union for over 900 attendees before splitting into two theaters' worth of free talks along with a Community space, where attendees can host a group event or public lab. AltConf Layers (June 5-7) If you're a designer or artistically-inclined, Layers is the WWDC conference for you: Having attended it the last two years, I can't say enough good things about Jessie Char and Elaine Pow's event and their speakers. Layers begins with an opening night party on Monday, followed by two days of conference talks at the Montgomery Theater, broken up by local snack vendors. This year, Layers has presentations from designer Brad Ellis, product design lead Amélie Lamont, former design leads for Hillary for America Chelsea Atwell and Ida Woldemichael, and Instagram product design manager Ted Boda.  You can grab conference passes on the Layers site; if you belong to an underrepresented industry group, you can also use the code REPRESENT to receive $100 off a Layers pass. Layers Design Conference CocoaConf Next Door (June 5 - 8) If you want developer-focused talks but missed out on a WWDC ticket, CocoaConf Next Door offers the next best thing, with sessions from prominent iOS and Mac developers at the Hilton Hotel. CocoaConf has been a developer conference staple for iMore will also be hosting a live reaction roundtable right after the WWDC keynote at Next Door on Monday with Rene, myself, and a few other special guests. Thursday is the last day to register for Next Door, so if you're interested in attending, make sure to grab your ticket now!

If you're planning on using a wrist-based monitor to track your heart rate while walking, running, or cycling, a group of scientists at Stanford (in partnership with the Swedish School of Sport and Health Services in Stockholm) claim the Apple Watch is the monitor to get, with the smallest margin of error (2%) out of seven tested devices. The experiment also looked at each device's caloric estimations (or "EE", for energy expenditure). Though the Apple Watch doesn't do poorly in this arena, that doesn't mean much: the lowest margin of error across the pack was 27.4% average, with a whopping 92.6% average error for the Fitbit Surge. In short: Still a long way to go when calculating calories burned effectively on a wrist-worn device. We evaluated the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn, and Samsung Gear S2. Participants wore devices while being simultaneously assessed with continuous telemetry and indirect calorimetry while sitting, walking, running, and cycling. Sixty volunteers (29 male, 31 female, age 38 ± 11 years) of diverse age, height, weight, skin tone, and fitness level were selected. How was this experiment conducted? In studies like this, scientists are primarily looking at margins of error when determining what device works "best": In other words, you want a device that regularly reports within a certain margin of error as compared to the control heart rate, or "gold standard." For this experiment, Stanford used the following for its gold standard: Gas analysis data from indirect calorimetry (VO2 and VCO2) served as the gold standard measurement for calculations of EE (kcal/min). ECG data was used as the gold standard for HR (beats-per-minute; bpm). Because so little testing has been done on wrist-worn devices, there is no "official" standard for such experiments: Prior studies of wrist-worn devices have focused on earlier stage devices, or have focused exclusively on HR or estimation of EE. Some have made comparisons among devices without reference to the U.S. a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gold standard. None proposed an error model or framework for device validation. As such, the scientists have also proposed a public repository of validated heart monitor data. To do this first experiment, the scientists identified 45 potential manufacturers, then limited it to eight based on the following criteria: wrist-worn watch or band; continuous measurement of HR; stated battery life >24 h; commercially available direct to consumer at the time of the study; one device per manufacturer. Eight devices met the criteria; Apple Watch; Basis Peak; ePulse2; Fitbit Surge; Microsoft Band; MIO Alpha 2; PulseOn; and Samsung Gear S2. Multiple ePulse2 devices had technical problems during pre-testing and were therefore excluded. After excluding the ePulse2, the experiment was left with seven devices. It is interesting to note that neither Garmin nor Polar's sport-specific wrist trackers were included in this study — we don't know if they were originally considered and then discarded, but it's worth noting given both manufacturers' prior expertise in sport-specific heart tracking. Devices were tested in two phases. The first phase included the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge and Microsoft Band. The second phase included the MIO Alpha 2, PulseOn and Samsung Gear S2. Healthy adult volunteers (age ≥18) were recruited for the study through advertisements within Stanford University and local amateur sports clubs. From these interested volunteers, study participants were selected to maximize demographic diversity as measured by age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), wrist circumference, and fitness level. In total, 60 participants (29 men and 31 women) performed 80 tests (40 with each batch of devices, 20 men and 20 women). So what do the heart rate (HR) results mean? Essentially, after all these tests, the scientists determined that the Apple Watch has the lowest margin of error when it comes to calculating heart rate while walking, running, or biking. For the walking task, three of the devices achieved a median error rate below 5%: the Apple Watch, 2.5% (1.1%–3.9%); the PulseOn, 4.9% (1.4%–8.6%); and the Microsoft Band, 5.6% (4.9%–6.3%). The remaining four devices had median error between 6.5% and 8.8%. Across devices and modes of activities, the Apple Watch achieved the lowest error in HR, 2.0% (1.2%–2.8%), while the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest HR error, 6.8% (4.6%–9.0%) (Figure 3A and Figure 4A). Most of the devices tested came within a median 5% margin of error throughout the tests, with only the Samsung Gear S2 falling outside the range on all activities (5.1% on cycling; a range of 6.5-8.8% on walking; and 6.8% total average). So the Apple Watch is the best at heart rate for wrist-worn devices, right? According to this study, yes, but its competition is nipping at its heels — a less than 5% margin of error is still quite good when it comes to overall monitoring, so there's no need to throw out your Fitbit Surge if you're otherwise happy with it. It's also worth noting that this experiment only tested wrist-worn devices in common exercise situations like biking, running, and walking — yoga, weight-lifting, and other wrist-bending activities were excluded, all of which have been known to negatively effect the accuracy of wrist-worn heart monitoring. What about the caloric (EE) results? "Calories burned" has always been a bit of a mysterious stat on wrist-worn devices, in part because the calculations behind energy expenditure (or EE) are obscured on a per-device basis. From the study: It is not immediately clear why EE estimations perform so poorly. While calculations are proprietary, traditional equations to estimate EE incorporate height, weight, and exercise modality. It is likely that some algorithms now include HR. Since height and weight are relatively fixed and HR is now accurately estimated, variability likely derives either from not incorporating heart rate in the predictive equation or from inter-individual variability in activity specific EE. There is evidence for this—for example, 10,000 steps have been observed to represent between 400 kilocalories and 800 kilocalories depending on a person's height and weight. As noted above, because there are a lot of variables involved in the calculation of EE — some that require user input, like height, weight, and activity type — it's much harder for any device to give you an accurate estimate. And the study proved it accordingly: EE error rates significantly exceed the 10% threshold for all devices on both the cycling and walking tasks… The Apple Watch had the most favorable overall error profile while the PulseOn had the least favorable overall error profile. Error in estimation of EE was considerably higher than for HR for all devices (Figure 2B and Figure 3B). Median error rates across tasks varied from 27.4% (24.0%–30.8%) for the Fitbit Surge to 92.6% (87.5%–97.7%) for the PulseOn. For EE, the lowest relative error (RE) rates across devices were achieved for the walking (31.8% (28.6%–35.0%)), and running (31.0% (28.0%–34.0%)) tasks, and the highest on the sitting tasks (52.4% (48.9%–57.0%)). … No device achieved an error in EE below 20 percent. The Apple Watch achieved the lowest overall error in both HR and EE, while the Samsung Gear S2 reported the highest. In other words: The Apple Watch may have had the fewest variations in energy expenditure when compared to the other devices in the study, but it still isn't anywhere near the level of accuracy provided by the study's gold standard. What does this mean for wrist monitors going forward? For health tech junkies, Stanford's study is actually an incredibly important step forward in getting more reliable data from our devices. Stanford's proposal for a "wearable sensor evaluation framework" alone is a pretty exciting development — if scientists standardize a baseline testing framework and data repository, it allows experiments to be done all over the world with large testing groups, getting us comprehensive data. Essentially, the more scientific experiments done on wrist-worn devices, the better: More data leads to competition from manufacturers to better their sensors, which gives us (the end-users) even better devices down the line. And Apple Watch users? For now, you can rest smugly knowing that you'll get a pretty accurate heart rate for most walking, running, and biking activities. (And hope that Apple works on a better system for measuring energy expenditure in the future.)

The second paragraph in the article incorrectly quotes the study saying the Surge has an error rate of 92.6%; that actually belongs to the PulseOn. Reading through the rest of the study, the EE error rate with the Surge was actually 27.4%, which might be the best of the bunch and NOT the Apple Watch. So Apple was only ahead with HR accuracy. Also, the Charge 2 has an improved HR tracking, which is the technology behind the guided breathing sessions and advanced sleep tracking.

Our photos can be as personal and private as our messages, financial information, and identities. iCloud Photo Library wants to make sure all our pictures and videos are backed up online and available on all our devices. To do that, it moves the bits that make up those pictures and videos from our iPhones, iPads, and Macs up to servers on the internet and then back down to our other iPhones, iPads, and Macs. That means both the transport and the storage needs to be secure so that our content is only ever available to us and us alone. How does Apple keep my photos secure? Apple uses end-to-end encryption to keep your photos safe as they move between your devices and iCloud. As Apple notes on its support site, your photos are transmitted under a "minimum of 128-bit AES encryption". This means that your photos are given the same treatment as your iPhone backups, iCloud Drive, and your other iCloud-stored content. How does end-to-end encryption keep my photos safe? On a very basic level, it means that when one of your images is being transmitted (uploaded or downloaded), that photo is protected while it's in transit. This means that if someone were to get ahold of the data for a photo that you were uploading from your iPhone to iCloud while it was being uploaded, they shouldn't be able to see the actual image. What else does Apple do to keep my photos secure? Apple employs AES and SHA, industry standards for securely encrypting and hashing data. The company goes further in its iOS security paper, which offers greater detail on how the company keeps your photos (and all of your data in iCloud) safe: Each file is broken into chunks and encrypted by iCloud using AES-128 and a key derived from each chunk's contents that utilizes SHA-256. The keys, and the file's metadata, are stored by Apple in the user's iCloud account. The encrypted chunks of the file are stored, without any user-identifying information, using third-party storage services, such as Amazon S3 and Windows Azure. At a basic level, these standards are very good ways to protect photos and other data while they're being uploaded, downloaded, or stored. What about privacy? Apple takes privacy very seriously and, as noted above, stores your data chunks without user-identifying information. The company also gives you options for controlling your own privacy. First, on your iPhone or iPad themselves, it's easy to grant or revoke permission for third-party apps to access your photos. However, if you've decided that there are images that you don't want to keep around, it's easy to delete them from your iCloud Photo Library. What's really great is that if you want to delete something, you only have to do so on once device. So if you delete an image on your iPhone, it will appear in Recently Deleted not only on that device, but any iPad or Mac connected to that iCloud account. From there, your photo will remain in Recently Deleted for the next 30 days if you change your mind, or you can choose to completely delete it right away. Questions? If you have any questions about the security of your iCloud Photo Library, be sure to let us know in the comments.

Which it can be, just unusual to think of iCloud as an endpoint for anything other than backups. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx This article suggests that iCloud Photo Library is protected by end-to-end encryption. However I can find nothing anywhere in Apple's documentation to confirm this. The only services that Apple states feature this level of security are iMessage and FaceTime. I don't believe that "encrypting during both transit and storage" is the same thing as "end-to-end encryption". The former cannot be decrypted even by Apple, while the latter can be. 0 1 year ago Reply faiza45 Do you have a pay~pal account ? in the event if you have you can add an extra 300 weekly in your revenue only working on the internet a few hours every week. go to this link<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<www.4jobshoney.COM 0 0 sec ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

(Liberate iPhone Auto-disassembly Machine), the custom robot that Apple created to perfectly disassemble iPhones. The video talks about not only how L.I.A.M. takes iPhones apart, but what Apple does with the parts once they have them. From Apple on YouTube: L.I.A.M. is part of Apple's plan to stop relying on new materials mined from the Earth, with a goal of moving to a completely sustainable supply chain. Apple previously released a set of videos in this style last month for Earth Day. The videos are illustrated by hand by James Blagden. The other videos covered Apple's use of solar farms, the design of Apple Park to use less energy while cooling itself, and more.

By Serenity Caldwell Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 3 Comments Serenity is the Managing Editor at iMore. She's been talking, writing about, and tinkering with Apple products since she was old enough to double-click. In her spare time, she sketches, sings, and in her secret superhero life, plays roller derby. Follow her on Twitter @settern. If you're an artist looking to turn your iPad Pro and Pencil into a Cintiq-like drawing tablet for your Mac, which app is for you? When it comes to digital drawing on the iPad, everyone who does it has fairly specific requirements and preferences for their work. Pretty much everyone wants low latency, smart pressure control, and a comfortable stylus. Beyond that, however, you wade into the world of specific shortcuts, drawing tethered, app choices, gestures, keyboard support, line prediction, and lots more. It's not surprising; art is a personal experience. It's only sensible that people have personal preferences for creating it digitally. The iPad has become a fantastic tool for those digital artists in part because of its flexibility — different apps give you different drawing tools, ideas, and experiences, and you need only find one that fits your needs to be happy. When it comes to hooking your iPad up to your Mac to create a Wacom Cintiq-like experience, however, your artistic options are far more limited. There are really only four solid options for people interested in using their iPad in this manner: Duet Display and Astropad, along with their two advanced subscription services, Duet Pro and Astropad Studio. Which one is right for your needs? Let's break each app (and its services) down. Wait, what is a second-screen or "Wacom Cintiq-like" drawing tablet anyway? Duet Pro mirroring the iMac's display, connected via USB. You can draw directly on your iPad with many, many great programs; while the iPad Pro and Pencil now offer professional artists more opportunity to create print-quality work, most still finish their projects on the Mac. To keep your iPad useful while working on your Mac, you can use a second-screen app to effectively "take over" your iPad's screen and either make it a second monitor or mirror your Mac's display outright. These apps connect to your computer using a (usually paid) app on your iPad and a free "helper" app on your Mac. From there, you can use touch commands on your iPad to directly control your Mac and even use your Apple Pencil for pressure-sensitive drawing inside certain apps. It's often referred to as a Cintiq-like experience in homage to the Wacom Cintiq, one of the first and best pressure-sensitive external displays for the Mac. Duet Display Duet Display, connected to my iMac via USB, resting on ElevationLab's Draft Table. Though not the first second-screen app for iPad, Duet Display was one of the first to truly offer a usable second-screen experience. After connecting iPad to Mac via USB, it delivered users a Retina-quality second display at 60 frames per second, with minimal to no lag. For those who wanted to view extra information — Twitter or work apps from their Mac on a second screen, for example — Duet was an excellent choice, and remains so today. Unfortunately, where Duet initially lagged was with the art community — users who wanted that second screen for drawing on a digital Photoshop canvas (or mirroring the Mac's display to draw upon it): The otherwise speedy 60FPS screen had issues displaying Photoshop documents and vast-delayed strokes, making the drawing experience uninspired as a whole. In the years since, Duet has improved its original app with options like a digital Touch Bar (for Macs without access to Apple's own hardware version), even faster rendering, and iPhone support — but no drawing capabilities, despite competition from newcomer Astropad. In late May, Duet at last offered a solution: an in-app Duet Pro subscription, which enables pressure sensitivity and line prediction for artists, among other tools. (We'll talk about Duet Pro in just a little bit.) Duet Display's standard version still offers no drawing tools or pressure sensitivity, however. Duet Display - See on the App Store Astropad Standard Astropad, connected to a MacBook Air. Astropad was the first app that offered iPad users a truly great drawing tablet for their Mac: It was built specifically for working in certain Mac programs, like Photoshop, and offered ultra-low latency for drawing through smart hardware optimizations. Unlike Duet Display, Astropad focuses solely on mirroring your Mac's screen — you can't use it as a true second monitor. But in mirroring the screen, it offers a host of different drawing features for artists. For one, Astropad displays a dismissible Function bar that holds oft-used drawing shortcuts like Undo, along with Line Preview, which eliminates further latency issues by "previewing" your drawing line (if your Mac hasn't yet caught up with your iPad's brush stroke). Better yet, it takes advantage of pressure-sensitivity hooks in Mac apps to offer pressure-sensitive drawing for any number of third-party styluses — not only the Apple Pencil. But perhaps the coolest thing about Astropad is that it can go wireless: You can draw tethered via USB for the best experience; if you don't mind suffering a minor drop in latency, however, you can sit elsewhere in your immediate Wi-Fi surroundings and continue to draw. (For instance, you can perch on your couch and continue to work on a project on your iMac or Mac Pro.) Astropad has remained one of the best apps around for basic iPad drawing on your Mac, especially if you don't yet own an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, since it works with many iPads and styluses. It is a little pricier than the standard Duet Display app, however — $29.99 to Duet's $19.99 one-time fee. Astropad Standard - See on the App Store Duet Pro A screenshot of Duet Pro, mirrored to my iMac. Launched in May of 2017, Duet Pro is Duet Display's venture into the iPad-as-pressure-sensitive-drawing-tablet world. Launching five months after the debut of Astropad Studio, Duet Pro offers many of the same perks as Astropad's high-end software — with a few extra wrinkles. Like Astropad Studio, Duet Pro is a subscription service: For $20/year, users get access to Duet Display's new drawing features, including Apple Pencil-optimized pressure sensitivity, tilt and hover support, palm rejection, and touch-based shortcuts. When setting up Duet Pro, users can customize pressure sensitivity with a personalized curve, adjusting based on how they draw and use the Apple Pencil, along with Line Lead (similar to Astropad's feature, though lacking in any sort of color customization). Duet's big advantage over Astropad is its true second-screen nature for iPad Pro users: You can have a drawing tablet that also acts as a second monitor, eliminating the need to take up your Mac's main screen with a giant Photoshop canvas. (It's still USB-tethered, however — there's currently no Wi-Fi option.) In lieu of customizable digital shortcuts, Duet Pro offers a digital version of Apple's Touch Bar — if the app supports it, you'll be able to view (and change, if applicable) Touch Bar shortcuts along the bottom of the screen. Currently, Duet only offers support for about 20 drawing apps, though big players like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and Pixelmator are all included. One thing to note about Duet Pro: It's built as an in-app purchase inside Duet Display; to access Duet Pro, you'll first have to purchase Duet Display, effectively making your first year's costs $39.99, with subsequent years at $19.99. Duet Pro - See on the App Store Astropad Studio Drawing wirelessly with Astropad Studio. The most expensive drawing tablet option for professional artists, Astropad Studio is also arguably the most full-featured. It takes all the goodies present in Astropad Standard and makes them faster and more customizable. As with Astropad, the Studio option offers you pressure-sensitive drawing with palm rejection and lightning-quick drawing; it also continues to offer a Wi-Fi option, with improved latency over Astropad Standard. Where Studio zooms away is on customization for pro users. Unlike Standard, it's limited to iPad Pro and Pencil users, which allows the app to provide an even speedier drawing experience. Both drawing pressure and smoothing can be adjusted, and users have full control over shortcuts buttons on a per-app basis, allowing them to tweak the tools they want for each individual program. Studio's Line Preview can also be altered to shorten or lengthen the amount of virtual line, change its color, or turn it off entirely. Studio also offers what may be the coolest touch implementation for iPad and Mac in the form of Magic Gestures: These touch- and Pencil-based gestures let you use your fingers and stylus together to activate a Right-Click, Eraser, Hover, or Modification Keys, depending on your choice. Astropad Studio - See on the App Store Which is best for casual artists? For those who want to tool around with an iPad on their Mac every so often, it's a tight spec competition between Astropad Standard and Duet Pro. Both offer great options for pressure sensitivity, though Duet provides more customization on the pressure curve and offers a digital Touch Bar. In contrast, Astropad Standard offers more limited options, but it can connect to any app on your Mac with full pressure support, and on non-iPad Pro models with third-party styluses. It's also cheaper in the long run ($29.99 one-time vs $19.99/year), and offers wireless drawing. Astropad has the seniority edge in the iPad-as-drawing-tablet game, and for that reason alone, it gets my vote for best casual artist tool. In my tests with Duet Pro, I frequently ran into minor bugs — a black screen when switching between second screen and mirrored mode, a non-functional Touch Bar — along with occasionally-spotty latency on the iPad Pro's Line Lead. Astropad, in contrast, has had several years to settle into a rock solid program, and that stability shows in everyday use. Astropad Standard has had more years of development behind it, and can withstand recropping or moving displays with no lag or problems; I ran into a few bugs with Duet Pro. That said, the advantage to a subscription model is that Duet's development team is likely hard at work making Duet Pro even better for its users; I wouldn't be surprised to see the app evolve and grow as more "prosumer" and professional artists weigh in on their hopes and desires for the software. Duet Pro might also be worth considering if you'd prefer to use your drawing tablet as a second display, rather than a mirrored option — neither Astropad Standard nor Studio currently offer this option. Which is best for professional artists? Duet Pro, despite its name, can't currently compete with the juggernaut that is Astropad Studio. There's a reason Astropad's developers charge such an elevated yearly fee for its software in comparison to Duet Pro: its features are reliable, endlessly customizable, and they simply feel like the right way to do professional drawing on the Mac. As nice as a digital Touch Bar is, years of Wacom work have conditioned me for big shortcuts on the left or right of my drawing surface; Astropad's customizable shortcuts are easy to see when I need them, and vanish into the background when I don't. It's also very easy to quickly adjust line pressure and various settings while connected to my Mac; Duet currently requires you to bring up its settings menu with a four-finger tap or disconnect to adjust accordingly. Some of Astropad's Line Preview and Magic Gestures customization options. The same goes for Astropad's Magic Gestures and touch shortcuts: I can easily refresh my memory on a given shortcut or trick via the shortcuts bar, whereas I have to return to Duet's "Connecting" screen to get a refresher course. But in all honesty, the difference I keep coming back to is the wireless advantage: Astropad Studio has perfected a latency-light drawing experience without being tethered to your Mac, and once you get used to working wirelessly, it's very hard to convince yourself to go back to a wired connection — especially when Astropad Studio's implementation is so good. Open Duet Pro or Duet Display without a USB connection to your Mac, and you'll see this sad screen. Of course, the nicest thing both of these apps using the subscription model is that anyone can take them for a spin: Both Duet Pro and Astropad Studio offer a free trial before your subscription kicks in, and whatever my personal feelings on each app, I highly recommend pro artists download both and take them for a spin. After all, when it comes to iPad art, you never know what your own personal preferences will end up being.

The competition is good for consumers. They cost what a drawing tablet would over a few years, yet would work on every iPad you own. Way too much for me, but right for the targeted audience. That said, what are your impressions on macOS on a touch screen? Is this something you would like to see natively for non-artistic use? With the low latency wireless mode described above, you basically have a touchscreen Mac. (Think carefully before you answer, if you do that is.

Lauren Kern, Executive Editor for New York Magazine, has apparently been selected for the role. From Politico: Morning Media has learned that Apple has given the job — a new position at the Cupertino-based company — to Lauren Kern, one of New York magazine's most high-ranking editors and a former deputy editor at The New York Times Magazine. Neither Apple or Kern have commented on this news, and as of yet, we don't know what it will mean for Apple News to have an editor-in-chief. For the most part, Apple News currently provides a central location from which you can read news from a wide selection of sources from around the world. But if Apple is hiring an editor-in-chief for Apple News, it suggests that they plan to take the service even further.

These days Apple has started to open itself up a bit more, and if you are curious to see what Apple will announce this year, you’re in luck. The company has recently confirmed that this year’s WWDC will be live streamable to users who aren’t in attendance. Previously it was suggested that the live stream would only be open to those with a developer account, but it has since been clarified to indicate that anyone with a compatible device or browser will be able to tune in just like before. For those looking to tune into the live stream, you would need to own an iOS or Mac device running Safari, but for those on PC, not to worry as if you have Windows 10 and use the Edge browser, you should be able to tune in no problem. While WWDC has largely been about software, many are expecting Apple to unveil some new hardware this year as well. According to the rumors, we can expect things like new iPad Pros (and one in a new 10.5-inch size) as well as refreshes made to the MacBook lineup.

The company described the exclusive video documentary series, at the time, as one centered on giving more detail and background on music’s “next generation” – as Apple explained it would aim to profile the newest and most-notable entrants to the scene, and the service, as a whole. And following Apple featuring Ricardo as its first, the Californian company is today announcing the second-ever artist to get the UpNext treatment … Of course, it’s perhaps of little surprise to regular listeners of Beats 1 that Sigrid is taking the crown … Serving as the service’s featured artist for the month of May, Sigrid Solbakk Raabe is a Ålesund-born and pop-laced singer-songwriter from Norway who has been making a name for herself ever since signing on with Island Records – last year. That decision ultimately fostered the perfect setting for the release of her 2017 breaker: Don’t Kill My Vibe. (You can grab a listen to an exclusive remix of the track w/ Gryffin on THEHOTLIST #34). There’s even an acoustic version. But despite the single’s huge international success, and resulting global airplay, you might be surprised to learn that it was not her first. That’s because, before signing on with Island at the back end of last year, Raabe had actually released three other singles on a solo basis: Sun, Two FishKnown You Forever – under lesser known labels and record houses exclusive to Norway and Sweden. Sadly, those offerings are no longer available for download (at least on iTunes, anyway). Going on to release her solo follow-up: Plot Twist under Island –the second from EP: Don’t Kill My Vibe– earlier last month, upon announcing that the artist would be serving as this month’s #UpNext feature on Thursday, the Apple Music Editors had just one thing to say to those yet to meet the riser: “You need to hear this.” / Image: We Are Sweet Watch the Film on Apple Music.

Out is a headline-oriented list of press releases and in is a Flipboard-like “Newsroom” with cover photos and clickable tiles. The company also redesigned its executive profile sites, including new headshots for some of its execs. Apple Newsroom 2017 Apple Newsroom Since shortly after Steve Jobs came back to Apple in the late 1990s, Apple’s press portal was found at apple.com/pr. That URL now redirects to apple.com/newsroom. Hovering over any given tile puts a drop shadow behind it and reveals direct links for sharing the release. Those tiles are a mix of solid colors and cover photos, as shown above. I’m pretty meh about this change. As a journalist, a list of headlines serves me far better than giant tiles with images that distract from the text. That said, it turns out it’s not always about me. The new layout is clearly more modern than the old site, and it better matches the look and feel of the rest of Apple’s online presence. It also makes Apple’s Newsroom into something that might appeal to a broader audience than only journalists. That, I suspect, is why Apple did this. Newsroom gives Apple a direct conduit of information to its customers. Journalists will find the press release they need one way or another, and catering to us was never a priority for Apple anyway. Apple Leadership There used to be a Leadership link at the top of Apple’s old PR site for executive profiles. That link is gone. It has been replaced by an About section in the navigation footer at the bottom of the site. That section now has links for Newsroom Apple Leadership Job Opportunities Investors Events Contact Apple The Leadership page itself has been redesigned, too. The landing page looks very similar to the old Leadership page with an alphabetical list of the company’s top executives. The layout has been tweaked, however, and many of the executives have new headshots. For instance, Apple CEO Tim Cook has a great new headshot. I believe Eddy Cue, Luca Maestri, Dan Riccio, and Johny Srouji all have new headshots, too. Clicking through to a profile reveals a new layout for the individual profiles, too. Here’s a look at Tim Cook’s new profile page.

He won’t be leaving Apple though; this position is more of a ceremonial think. Paul Thompson, rector (UK version of dean) of the Royal College of Art, had this to say: It is a great honour to be joined by the world’s leading designer of his generation, who has produced consistently innovative and commercially successful technology and design. As chancellor, Jony embodies the RCA’s ideals of technology and design excellence, inspiring students and staff, and enabling us to educate the next generation of world-leading artists and designers. Sir Jony Ive, Royal Chancellor. Sir Jony is taking over the position from Sir James Dyson OM, who is busy founding his own engineering university. Jony is a sort of “spiritual successor” to Sir James, as the latter is one of Jony’s sources of inspiration for his own designs. Jony is looking forward to the opportunity, and noted: I am thrilled to formalise my relationship with the RCA, given the profound influence the college has had on so many of the artists and designers that I admire. Our design team includes many RCA alumni, who embody the fundamental values of the college. I look forward to advising both the college and students, hoping that my experience proves useful in their work. The duties of Royal Chancellor will include presiding over RCA’s advisory committee, attending faculty meetings and conferring degrees at graduation ceremonies. Jony will also serve as advisor as the college looks to expand with a new building in Battersea, which will open in 2020.

The company’s new SDK will have an extension that allows publishers to create content in the Instant Articles, AMP, and Apple News format. Support for Google’s AMP will be rolled out first, with support for Apple News coming in a few weeks. Facebook’s SDK will work by building AMP and Apple News pages with the same markup used to build Instant Articles. In addition, it will include the unique customization options offered by each publishing format. “With an easy way to get from one markup format to another, publishers can then plug-and-play the markup in their content management systems or third party publishing tools.” This is an interesting and unexpected move from Facebook, which was previously pushing its own Instant Articles format as the only fast-loading article format allowed on the network. Instead of forcing publishers to adopt Instant Articles, Facebook is now giving them more freedom. Having to create multiple versions of the same piece of content to share in different places is a challenge that Facebook is hoping to address with this update. This can also be seen as a way to attract publishers back to Instant Articles. As publishers have begun to abandon Facebook’s Instant Articles format due to lack of monetization options, this could be the company’s way to get publishers to come back. Whether or not that will work remains to be seen, but introducing a solution for creating three types of articles at once sounds promising.

That’s fine for people with newer MacBooks or Apple’s Magic Trackpad 2. However, I certainly don’t want to forget to show some loving to the most current Magic Mouse, since it has its own gestures. Here is an unabridged look at what gestures you can use with the Magic Mouse, as highlighted by Apple and (I hope) improved upon by yours truly. This guide to Magic Mouse Mac gestures assumes you are running macOS Sierra with the most current model of the accessory. Your Magic Mouse 2 might be more powerful than you think (Image Credit: AlexKingCreative) Getting Started with Magic Mouse Mac Gestures The first thing you need to do is ensure the gestures are enabled. You do so from System Preferences -> Mouse. You’ll see two tabs, one for point and click gestures, and another for additional capabilities. Let’s look at the point and click gestures first. To get started with gestures on your Magic Mouse, visit System Preferences and click on Mouse First, my old nemesis — Scroll direction: Natural. This is usually enabled by default, so I quickly turn it off. Leave it on if you prefer it. There’s also an option for Secondary click, which allows you to click or tap on the right side of Magic Mouse 2 in order to perform the Windows equivalent of a right-click. A truly useful Magic Mouse Mac gesture, smart zoom allows you to quickly and easily focus in on a web page or PDF. Just double-tap with one finger to utilize this gesture. If you double-tap with one finger, you’ll quickly zoom in and out on a PDF or web page Even More Gestures That’s not all the Magic Mouse can do, though. If you click on More Gestures, you’ll see other possibilities to improve your productivity and efficiency when using your Mac. First, you’ll see the ability to swipe between pages in your web browser. With this Magic Mouse Mac gesture, you can just scroll right or left with one finger in order to go to the previous or next web page in your history. Swipe left with one finger to go to the previous web page Swipe right with on finger to go to the next web page Up next: moving through your full-screen apps with Magic Mouse Mac gestures Pages: 1 2 Next Page Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Print Tumblr Tags: gestures, Mac gestures, macOS Sierra, Magic Mouse 2 You might also like… A Stellar Concept Video for iOS 11 and the Rebirth of the Mac Comprehensive Guide to Mac Trackpad Gestures and Force Touch - Page 2 of 5 Apple Plans to Change Scrolling in Safari Dude Makes $70 Hackintosh, and It Worked (Video) How to Use New 1Password Travel Mode to Protect Your Data One Comment Add a comment geoduck May 25, 2017 Thank you, this was very helpful. I had been wondering why occasionally Safari would slide the page to the left or right and show me another page. I honestly never connected it with a gesture. So I’ve gone in and made several changes to the settings, some I’ve turned on and some off. Safari works much more smoothly for me now.

Politico reported that Apple brought on Lauren Kern, an experienced editor from New York Magazine. She’ll start her new gig on June 2nd, just before Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference. Lauren Kern from her Twitter profile Meet Lauren Kern Lauren Kern was named one of 10 Players in Media You Must Hire in May of 2016 by The New York Observer. In that piece, the magazine said this about her work as Executive Editor of New York Magazine. Ms. Kern has since grown the magazine’s footprint in print and digital, and put a spotlight on women’s issues by shepherding the magazine’s mammoth Bill Cosby cover. She also worked at O and New York Times Magazine. These are all heavy-hitter traditional print magazines, and she’ll be bringing that experience to Apple News. Her Former Boss Said Glowing Things New York Magazine Editor-in-Chief Adam Moss, her soon-to-be-former boss, had some rather glowing things to say about Ms. Kern, too. In a note to the magazine’s staff published by CNN, Mr. Moss said: I am not happy to report that we are losing our beloved Lauren Kern to the Apple corporation. I mean, I’m happy for Lauren certainly. It’s an exciting opportunity to be the editor in chief of Apple News, to bring a journalistic vigor and intelligence to an operation that has always seemed to me so full of promise. Apple has the audience — all they needed was a superior editorial intelligence to guide it. They recognized that that person was Lauren, and of course we know they are right. She provided excellent council to me on all sorts of editorial matters, and she was just beginning a new adventure seeding ambitious feature projects across our verticals. There isn’t much she can’t do. Apple is lucky to have her. Those are some amazing comments to make about someone who is leaving your organization. What Will This Mean for Apple News? Ms. Kern isn’t replacing anyone as editor-in-chief is a newly created position for Apple News. It’s hard to know exactly what Apple has in mind for its service, but this move means the company is absolutely serious. You don’t hire a heavyweight unless you’re serious, and that heavyweight isn’t going to come work for you unless she knows you’re serious. Like Adam Moss, I believe Apple News has tons of promise. The formatting is there, as is the presentation. The eyeballs and positioning within iOS are there, too. But, Apple News is more promise than fulfilled promise, and editorial direction could have a big impact on the service.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Reports Second Quarter Results CUPERTINO, California — May 2, 2017 — Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Apple also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the Company’s program to return capital to shareholders and is extending the program timeframe by four quarters.  Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Nokia and Apple sign agreement, settle all litigation Cupertino, California and Espoo, Finland — Nokia and Apple announced today that they have settled all litigation related to their intellectual property dispute and agreed a multi-year patent license. “This is a meaningful agreement between Nokia and Apple,” said Maria Varsellona, Chief Legal Officer at Nokia, responsible for Nokia’s patent licensing business. “It moves our relationship with Apple from being adversaries in court to business partners working for the benefit of our customers.” Under a business collaboration agreement, Nokia will be providing certain network infrastructure product and services to Apple. Apple will resume carrying Nokia digital health products (formerly under the Withings brand) in Apple retail and online stores, and Apple and Nokia are exploring future collaboration in digital health initiatives. Regular summits between top Nokia and Apple executives will ensure that the relationship works effectively and to the benefit of both parties and their customers. “We are pleased with this resolution of our dispute and we look forward to expanding our business relationship with Nokia,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This agreement will strengthen our collaboration,” said Basil Alwan, President of Nokia’s IP/Optical Networks business. “We look forward to supporting Apple.” While details of the agreement remain confidential, Nokia will receive an up-front cash payment from Apple, with additional revenues during the term of the agreement. The value of the agreement will be reflected partially as patent licensing net sales in Nokia Technologies and partially as net sales in other Nokia business groups. Nokia will follow its existing practices for disclosing patent licensing revenue in its quarterly announcements and expects that revenues for the agreement will start to be recognized in the second quarter of 2017, including an element of non-recurring catch-up revenue. Due to the up-front cash payment from Apple, Nokia intends to provide a comprehensive update of its capital structure optimization program in conjunction with its third quarter 2017 results. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

They even put the parts into coffins. Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET You might find this confusing. Earth Day was last month. You missed it? How could you? Yet on Thursday, Apple released an ad that reeks of Earth Day spirit. Perhaps the company wants to be seen as the Church of Latter Earth Day Saints. Here we have more tales of Liam, the robot that takes apart old iPhones so that their parts can live another day. Apple asks a positively existential question here, one you've likely asked yourself: "Does my iPhone believe in reincarnation?" It seems that it does. Or, at least, that parts of it do. The ad explains how Liam creates perfectly separated iPhone parts. So Apple tries to put them back into the company's supply chain. Oh, that's why my iPhone is so slow? Still, the goal is for Apple not to have to extract any more raw materials. Recently, the company declared that its aim is to make all its phones from recycled materials.

Indeed, I couldn't quite believe what Siri had replied. So I asked her the same question again. This time, she said, "I don't believe that I have beliefs." Now that sounds nearer the truth.

Oh well. Growing up in Spokane, it was the closest major college football team so I've followed them since I was born and was obsessed with Drew Bledsoe when I was a kid. So instead of sharing why I became a WSU fan, I'll share the ABCs of why I remained a fan, because we all know there have been ample opportunities to jump off the wagon. (also, this will be football-heavy, but some basketball is thrown in) Apple Cup. Duh. I know the game has been one-sided in recent years, but when I was a student, the Cougs went 3-1 in Apple Cups, and I wish I cherished those wins more than I did. Oddly, the most satisfying Apple Cup win for me was the 2012 OT victory. That season had all sorts of drama, and ending it the way it did was a huge relief. The 1997 game was possibly the most meaningful win in school history, but I remember expecting to win that game. What a weird feeling. Bledsoe, Drew. He was the ultimate athlete to five-year-old me. Colfax. It's not until I get to Colfax while driving from Spokane do I start to feel some excitement for the day ahead. I don't know, it's just always been that way. You're not there until you reach Colfax. Also, I have in-laws that live there so it's a great place to crash after those 7:30 p.m. games. Derting, Will. I loved the story of his recruitment, about how he didn't even have a home phone. I love small town stories like that. His three interceptions in his first game was cool too, I guess. Earth, Wind and Fire. It's so refreshing to have a good running game (and Earth, Wind and Fire doesn't even include Bobbie, technically). Forrest, Caleb. If you saw Caleb Forrest walking around campus, you'd probably wonder if there was a Cabela's in Pullman that you didn't know about. He always looked like he came straight from a hunting trip, yet he was an important player on some great basketball teams. He wasn't always well coordinated, but he did what he needed to do and was a fun guy to watch. Gleason, Steve. It's been real hard to watch Steve Gleason go through what he's gone through. I remember before he lost the ability to speak, he recorded a message that was played on the big screen at a game in 2012 or 2013. I don't think many people knew how far he'd deteriorated, and the stadium went silent when it played. It was a depressed silent, too. Tough to watch. Steve's been a great Coug and a great ambassador for those with ALS. I'm glad he is, and I'm glad he's one of us. Halloween. It doesn't happen often, but when a Cougar home game falls on Halloween or a day or so before, the costumes fans bring out are fun to see. I'm a sucker for creative costumes, like the one guy wearing yellow jeans, Doc Martins, a purple polo and a name tag that read, "Hi, I'm a douche." Isaac Brown. He was such a unique defensive end and I wish we had someone like him now. I was in high school when he played and was fascinated by his play and that entire defense. Jed Collins. One of my all-time favorite Cougs. I believe he played three different positions at WSU: linebacker, tight end and fullback. He was also big on special teams. I loved how he was such a versatile player and always seemed to enjoy playing football. Oh, and he played in the NFL, too. Kicking game. Actually, this isn't one of the reasons I've remained a Coug fan. Don't know how this got on the list. Loren Langley. See above. Mike Leach. I was one of those fans that bought season tickets when Leach was hired and pretty much because he was hired. I was real jaded before his arrival, I'm sad to say. But he got me re-engaged pretty quickly. Nooooooo Gaaaaaain. Oregon pounding. I've never hated the Ducks, but for some reason this year's 51-33 thrashing was incredibly satisfying, and it wasn't as close as the score says, as we all know. There's something about crushing a team that has been atop the conference for a decade or so. That was the game that made me think the 2016 season was going to be a-OK after a lackluster start. Peter Roberts. Remember when all of our quarterbacks got injured and we had to have open tryouts to find someone to run the scout team? The student who won those tryouts was named Peter Roberts. File that one away for your next bar trivia outing. Quieting High Point Solutions Stadium. That stadium was rocking when Rutgers returned that punt for a TD late in the game. Soon after, it was awfully quiet, except for that one Rutgers fan who said she was so mad she could strangle me and my friends as we walked out. Road games. If you ever have a chance to see the Cougs on the road, do it (see above). When I'm at a home game, there are Cougs all around me. When I'm at a road game and see other Cougs, it's as if we're protecting each other, like we know we're in the minority and we need to seek each other out and stick together. And that's not just at the stadium - I'm talking about walking to the stadium, in the airport, at the hotel, at the local bar the night before, etc. Secret coaching search. I don't know why, but I love the story about Bill Moos secretly flying to Key West to meet Mike Leach in the middle of the 2011 season. What's even cooler is that, according to the book The System, Moos told only a select few people what he was doing and even used his own credit card so he didn't leave an immediate paper trail. Covert operations have always interested me. Plus, this trip got us Mike Leach. Taylor Rochestie's three-pointer against ASU. Senior day was always an adventure during the Bennett Years. The 2009 game wasn't even the most insane one (the one two years prior against USC when Tony Bennett and Tim Floyd nearly went WWE on each other was the most insane), but it was a lot of fun. This season was kind of a downer compared to the previous two seasons, so this was a nice way to end the year: But we did go to the NIT! Getting Under Todd Graham's skin. The whole sign stealing thing was rather amusing, at least to me. That we won this year and last year made it even more amusing. RV lots. Tailgating before every game is always a joy. Walking around the RV lots is one big community celebration. Random people hand you drinks and invite you to tour their motorhome. It's a unique atmosphere and may the State Board of Education never outlaw alcohol in a college campus parking lot (Idaho's did just that). Waving the flag on GameDay. I know the whole WSU-College GameDay topic has all sorts of opinions, but seeing the WSU flag each morning, to me, has become pretty cool. I used to think it was kind of weird and desperate, but I've grown to like it. Whether GameDay comes to Pullman or not isn't the point for me, but as someone who works in marketing, seeing your logo each morning on one of the most popular shows is a good thing. EXciting finishes. That 2015 season sure was something. I don't know that a team I root for has every had so many comeback wins like that. The 1995 Mariners, maybe. Yarno, George. I still think Paul Wulff's biggest mistake was not retaining Yarno to coach the offensive line. He was an entertaining guy when I covered the team for The Daily Evergreen. RIP, coach. Zzu Cru. My junior year, we played UW on senior day in basketball. This was the game that went to two OTs, with WSU coming out on top. You know how when a player fouls out, the student section chants, "Right! Left! Right! Left!" as they're walking off the court? Well, that chant happened a few times during the game, but when Jon Brockman hurt his knee and had to be helped off the court, a part of the Zzu Cru chanted, "Righ! Right! Right! Right!" because he couldn't put weight on his left leg. Cold. OK so that's the best I could muster. Cheated a little with "U" but that's just how it goes. I'm sure I missed something obvious.

MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Applications Houston Community College Launches Coding School for Apple Apps The course builds on Apple's educational programs for K-12 classrooms, as well as a network of iOS app development centers that the company launched in Italy last year. by Lydia DePillis, Houston Chronicle / May 25, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- Apps are one of the main ways that Apple attracts people to the iPhone, and in the interest of training more people to make them, the tech behemoth is launching a new curriculum for community colleges — starting in Houston. Houston Community College will be among the first educational institutions to teach the Apple-designed course in developing applications for the iOS operating system, the company announced in Houston on Wednesday. It's part of a new iOS Coding and Design School that will offer both short-term boot camps and programs for degree credits starting in June. "We have been excited about the links they have to the community, to businesses, to government, to everyone there," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, about HCC. "Because that means that lots of students will wind up in good jobs." RELATEDMobile App, Responsive Site or a Little of Both?App Allows for Donating to Goodwill Without Leaving the House The course builds on Apple's educational programs for K-12 classrooms, as well as a network of iOS app development centers that the company launched in Italy last year. HCC Chancellor Cesar Maldonado says he noticed the iOS development center in Milan about nine months ago, and thought that Houston should have something similar. Upon reaching out to Apple, he learned that the company was already planning a curriculum for community colleges. "There was some magic in the timing," Maldonado says. Although the new Coding and Design School will focus on Apple's Swift programming language, he says that won't preclude students from learning to create programs for Android phones as well. "The skills are transferable across devices and platforms." Google doesn't have anything similar, but hinted that a program is under development. "While we don't have an analogous program we're offering to college students at the moment," wrote Google spokeswoman Charlotte Smith in an email, "be sure to keep an eye out for updates as we get closer to the next school year :)" Approximately 1.7 million mobile app developers in the United States, according to a study by the Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left think tank in Washington. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts about 800,000 software developers for apps — which can be either web or mobile based — who make a median salary of $100,000 per year. Although consumer-oriented smartphone apps are the most well-known variety, Houston might have a greater demand for developers who can create them for industrial uses, says Greater Houston Partnership CEO Bob Harvey. There are a number of ways to land a job as a mobile developer: You can either teach yourself, using various free online tools, or take a course through non-accredited schools like General Assembly or Hack Reactor. Those can be expensive, though, and often require taking time off from regular jobs. Those intensive programs aren't available in Houston, which only has a couple coding schools. Kevin Colten is the chief technology officer for Austin Coding Academy, which has a Houston office at Station Houston, a co-working space downtown. He says that demand for courses has been low so far, but that it makes sense for HCC to teach Apple's program. "If you look at the numbers, iOS developers get paid more because it's more of a luxury phone," Colten says. In addition, he says many university app development courses have a hard time keeping up with changes in technology, which an Apple-directed course might be able to avoid. Apple won't provide financial support for the courses, but the curriculum will be free to use for community colleges, beginning this year at institutions in Alabama, Pennsylvania, California and Ohio. It will also be available for free online to anyone who wants to teach themselves. It's a welcome bit of momentum for Houston's nascent tech scene, which got a push last week with the launch of an "Innovation Strategy Office" within the Greater Houston Partnership aimed at boosting the city's startup ecosystem. One of the recommendations in a report from the consulting firm Accenture was for Houston to attract an office of a big Silicon Valley tech firm, such as Apple. Apple employs about 8,400 in Texas. Six thousand of those jobs are in Austin, including the Maps team as well as other research and development functions. When asked if the company would start an office in Houston, Apple's Cook — who spent a few months in Houston in the 1990s while working for Compaq — said the city should instead focus on having people build on top of Apple's platform. "Any city that's looking to expand, whether it's startups or just their tech workforce, my recommendation would be to focus on app development," Cook said. ©2017 the Houston Chronicle Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Twelve months later and two weeks out from its annual conference, Apple has finally snagged its first big customer. What's more, Belkin says that its compatibility with Apple's HomeKit standard won't just extend to a single product, but to every Wemo device it has produced – every smart plug, switch, light and camera. There's only one downside: you will have to buy a specific HomeKit bridge to make it work. "Wemo is offering this bridge to address the overwhelming request from customers to make currently installed Wemo products work with HomeKit and other HomeKit compatible products," said Belkin's CTO Brian Van Harlingen cheerfully, adding: "We're proud to work with Apple to bring together two of the most influential Smart Home platforms." This is quite a shift from exactly a year ago when Belkin decided it wasn't going to bother with Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem. "We hear you, Wemo fans. Trust us, we do. We know you really want HomeKit compatibility for your Wemo devices and we are sorry that we've kept you hanging for so long," it opined in a blog post in March 2016. "But the short answer is that Wemo will not work with HomeKit in the immediate future. Before you get mad and stop reading, please hear us out..." But why? And the reason behind the decision was the same as pretty much every other manufacturer of smart home products: Apple's insistence that its own special chip be added to all products to make them work. "Right now the only way to make Wemo work with HomeKit is to build a completely separate line of products and we don't think that makes sense for the overall Wemo ecosystem," the company explained. "HomeKit integration requires a specific hardware component and cannot be accomplished with a software or firmware update to existing devices. Though we have tried to find a workaround solution, thus far nothing has fallen within Apple's HomeKit guidelines." The decision by Apple back in 2015 to require people to use special hardware to work with its system has been a disaster for the company. It had to scrap its plans to launch HomeKit with a new "Home" app for the iPhone at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) that year, despite having teed it up the year before. It took another year for the app to appear, and even then it was a half-hearted effort, with senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi doing his best to sound excited. What we found most notable was the fact that half of the customers listed on the slide Federighi shared with WWDC attendees two years earlier were no longer featured. Arrogant The reality is that Apple's arrogance has caused it – not for the first time – to overplay its hand. It changed course on its smart home plans when they decided it needed to build security into the product and, being Apple, that it had to be in control of that. Apple's logic was that smart homes would rely on smart phones, and as the maker of the iPhone it was in a position to effectively dictate the market. All it would need to do is create an easy-to-use app and everyone would jump on board. Except they didn't. And the smart home market has slowly grown with only a few companies bothering to include HomeKit in their plans. "HomeKit collides with the rest of the industry," the CEO of WigWag, Ed Hemphill, told us when we asked around about the dearth of HomeKit products back in October. "Their approach is just onerous and unnecessary." But Apple is not out of the running just yet. The slow acceptance of smart home products by consumers, combined with continuing security concerns over smart home and internet-of-things devices, means that the market has not moved as swiftly as many expected. However, with industry and governments now getting serious about new IoT security standards, and with devices like Amazon's Alexa and Google's Home adding voice control and activation into homes, that window of opportunity is closing. This year's WWDC will be on June 8 and if Apple doesn't announce something that moves it forward drastically when it comes to the smart home, by the time June 2018 comes around it may well have lost its chance to grab a decent chunk of the market. Behold the bridge: Wemo changes its tune, but there's no escaping the clunkiness of the solution Rule change? Last year, Wemo said that "no current Wemo device will ever be able to work with HomeKit unless Apple changes its rules." We asked Belkin if that meant Apple has relaxed its rules to make the new bridge viable; Belkin told us no. "The rules haven't changed – we decided to go with a bridge approach so that would go onboard all current Wemo users. We had lots of customers asking for support," a spokesperson told us. It's possible that Belkin felt that demand was sufficiently large from Apple users for there to be a market for the bridge (it will be out this fall for an undisclosed sum), but just as likely is that it has received early notice of Apple's plans and decided that something was better than nothing. But the reality is that a bridge is a terrible compromise. It will need to be plugged into your router and presumably also into an electrical socket. Control commands will then have to pass through it to your various Wemo products. It is inelegant to say the least and a step back for an industry that realized a long time ago that adding a new bridge every time you install a new smart home device from a different manufacturer was never going to scale. The future is undoubtedly in using standards and protocols that allow products to work and communicate together without having to pass through proprietary interfaces. So while Belkin's decision to support HomeKit is a sign that Apple is not yet a smart-home lost cause, it does highlight the fundamental stumbling block that continues to exist with Apple's product. Unless Apple plans to bring out its own line of smart home products, it's hard to see how it is going to persuade everyone else to play ball. ® Tips and corrections 3 Comments MORE Apple Belkin Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Apple finally teaches Android music app to validate certificates Cupertino's so keen on Android it took eight months to repair interception bug 3 Comments Apple blocks comms-snooping malware Leaked developer certificate revoked, protection updated 12 Comments Nokia, Apple lawyers make peace over nasty IP wrangle Unspecified lump sum heading for Finland 24 Comments Apple asks FCC to let it run mm-wave tests - for backhaul?!

Armed with an old iPhone and nearly any speaker, you can create a voice-activated Siri speaker on the cheap. Smart Home by Rick Broida May 25, 2017 3:50 PM PDT @cheapskateblog You don't need to spend money on an Amazon Echo or whatever Apple's smart speaker turns out to be. Just use an old iPhone and put Siri to work. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Rumor has it Apple will jump on the smart-speaker bandwagon at next month's WWDC, giving the Amazon Echo ($179.99 at Amazon.com) and Google Home ($114.00 at Jet.com) some stiff competition. What would such a device look like? What would it be called? (I'm going to put a marker on iHome, even though there's already a whole brand with that name.) And the big question: What will it cost? This is Apple we're talking about, so my guess puts it at $199, if not $229. And it probably won't ship until the second half of the year, at least according to industry analysts. Don't want to wait? Or pay that much? If you've got a spare iPhone (or iPad or iPod Touch) lying around, you can easily create your own "Siri speaker" setup. (Sound familiar? It's also possible to turn an old Android phone into a poor-man's Google Home.) Why this works and what you need Anyone familiar with Siri knows she already does the whole speak-and-say thing -- just within the confines of your iPhone. Because you can invoke this feature hands-free (by saying, "Hey, Siri"), all you need is a speaker to round out the equation. Enlarge Image Pair an old iPhone with a speaker-stand like this one for a nicely consolidated Siri-speaker surrogate. Lugulake Before we talk about the latter, though, let's finish with the brains of the operation. Any modern iDevice can be tasked for this project, so long as it has a reasonably current version of iOS. Although iPhone models older than the 6S must be plugged in for "Hey, Siri" to work when the screen is off, you're going to leave this iPhone plugged in full-time anyway -- so that's a nonissue. As for the speaker, anything you can connect your phone to is fair game. My recommendation is a simple Bluetooth speaker, though it has to meet one requirement: It needs to stay powered on when plugged in. Some speakers have an auto-off feature, which you don't want here. You can also take the wired route, plugging one end of a 3.5mm audio cable into your phone and the other into a speaker or even an old stereo. It's one more wire you'll have to look at, but of course a little decor disguising can help with all the wires. Speaking of which, as I noted above, you'll need to leave your phone plugged in full-time. Same goes for the speaker. Obviously all this won't provide the same aesthetic as whatever unified product Apple delivers, but functionally it should get reasonably close. And if you want to keep everything as consolidated as possible, consider getting a speaker that's also a stand. For example, the LuguLake Bluetooth speaker and phone stand shown here might prove a good option, if only because it gives your phone a forward-facing place to sit. It's currently priced at $30, £27 in the UK or AU$39 in Australia. Although you'll have to provide the wall USB plug for the speaker to stay powered, it has a physical on-off switch, so I'm pretty certain it won't automatically shut off after a period of inactivity. (Not positive, though; check with the manufacturer if you want to be sure.) What to say to your Siri speaker From there you just need to make sure the "Hey, Siri" option is enabled, which you can do by tapping Settings > Siri and making sure the top three options are toggled on. That way, the iPhone will be listening for -- and responding to -- your commands even when the screen is off. (What about your current iPhone? Won't it be listening as well? Sure enough, your spoken commands might trigger both phones at the same time. For now, there's no real workaround for this, other than to disable the option on your primary phone -- or just keep it out of earshot of your Siri speaker.) So what can you do with your new smart speaker? Pretty much anything and everything you can do with your iPhone. For example, you can ask Siri to tell you a joke, check your flight status, give you a weather forecast, play a podcast (if you have Apple's Podcasts app installed) and much more. Here's the complete list of Siri commands to date. You can also control your HomeKit-ready smart home devices, too. As for music, you can't currently use Siri to activate third-party apps such as Spotify, so if you want to issue verbal commands for songs, playlists and the like, you'll have to rely on your Apple Music library. That's a fairly major limitation (the DIY Google Home is similar in that respect), so it'll be interesting to see if Apple's standalone smart speaker -- assuming it exists -- overcomes it. In the meantime, what do you think of creating a home-grown Siri speaker?

(H. Moser) Share Written by Mike Murphy May 25, 2017 Late last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a company earnings call that the Apple Watch was generating more revenue than every watch brand other than Rolex. Quartz has argued previously that Swiss watchmakers will not be able to compete against the Apple Watch, as Apple is working with a much larger pool of potential customers. Now it seems that the industry is following an age-old adage: If you can’t beat them, join them. This definitely won’t tell you how many steps you’ve walked. (H. Moser) H. Moser, a high-end Swiss watchmaker, released the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz this month, a line of mechanical watches that look almost identical to the Apple Watch’s unique rounded-rectangle face. In a press release, the company compares the design to “a smartwatch which is powered off or on standby.” The release goes on to lightly taunt Apple’s fondness for minimalist designs, and the awkwardness of using the Apple Watch’s tiny screen to actually try to do anything: Behind its contemporary design lies a 100% mechanical watch. The black dial—stripped not just of any signature, but also of its indices—is strictly minimalist. On this model, there is no interface: the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz is designed to display the time, something it does beautifully. Seemingly simple, it is anything but. At the heart of the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz, the HMC 324 form movement beats with the rhythm of the balance wheel’s rotations. In response to the cold electronics of connected watches, H. Moser & Cie. presents the soul of mechanical watchmaking. With a minimum power reserve of 4 days, fully rechargeable by hand, it couldn’t be further from the world of the smartwatch. Apple wasn’t immediately available for comment on its thoughts regarding the similarity between its wearables—which cost anywhere between $200 and $1,500—and a watch that Bloomberg reports costs roughly $27,000.

Wearables suck at tracking calories burned, study shows Posted 8 hours ago by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story SoFi co-founder Dan Macklin is leaving the company New data out of Stanford is lending credence to common wisdom that fitness trackers suck at counting calories. Heart-rate monitoring, on the other hand, fared surprisingly well in the school’s Medical Center studies. The group of 60 volunteers was hand-selected to offer a broad range of subjects, factoring in things like gender, body mass index and skin color (optical heart-rate monitoring has a history of being a bit unintentionally racist). The 31 women and 29 men tested various combinations of the Apple Watch (first generation), Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn and Samsung Gear S2 while walking on treadmills and riding stationary bikes. Those results were compared to data from medical-grade equipment for measuring heart rate and carbon dioxide in the breath, a commonly accepted measure for gauging energy expenditure. Turns out all of the devices other than the Samsung did a pretty solid job on the heart-rate front. The rest had error rates of under five percent, which qualifies them as decent candidates for medical uses. They’re not going to replace chest straps in the lab any time soon, but the kind of day to day data they collect could be useful for doctors looking for a more complete picture of their patients’ health. At the very least, they could provide some interesting supplemental information. “Five percent is approaching something useful in a clinical setting, which suggests that doctors may be looking toward this data when evaluating their patients,” graduate student Anna Shcherbina told TechCrunch. “If a doctor has average data on the patient as they’re going about their day, this could provide a more complete picture.” Caloric information is a different story altogether. And it’s not surprising, really. Heart rate is a pretty direct reading. Calories burned differ hugely from person to person based on a variety of different factors. And the wrist isn’t the logical spot to start a search for caloric information. The system needs to do a fair amount of guesswork based on movements detected by the wearables’ built-in accelerometers. The range of readings is pretty astounding. The best reading was off by an average of 27 percent and the worst by an appalling 93. To be of any real use for a medical setting, you’re going to want a number under 10 percent. So there’s a lot of work to be done here. Shcherbina says the Apple Watch and Fitbit Surge were the most accurate of the bunch; it was Finnish company PulseOn really missed the mark. The team unsurprisingly got some pushback from PulseOn when it didn’t enter more precise information like a volunteer’s VO2 max level. In order to get a more accurate picture of the average user, the researchers didn’t enter information that most of us don’t have access to. I know I haven’t been on a treadmill with a VO2 measuring mask on my face any time recently. Perhaps I’m overdue. Since the study began in 2015, there are newer versions of a number of the devices here. The team admits that, in the case of the Apple Watch, there may be some discrepancies between “active” and “total” calories burned, an issue that may be reconciled as it continues testing on the new version. The team purchased all devices independently for the integrity of the study — but lead researcher professor Euan Ashley says they’re open to communicating with the companies involved to make sure there’s not some sort of proprietary secret sauce somehow being overlooked. Both PulseOn and Apple have reached out with feedback, after the paper’s publication, and the team is open to future collaboration. “No concrete plans as of now,” Shcherbina explains, “but we are definitely open to this idea if the companies are interested in working with us. Obviously maintaining our independence/impartiality is key, but closer communication might yield valuable insights about most effective ways to improve fitness algorithms for wearables.” Apple and Samsung declined to offer a statement, while Fitbit is clearly on the offensive here, sending along a big one. The wearable maker touches upon its “extensive, ongoing research and development,” but adds that the caloric estimates that trackers give are just that — estimates: Fitbit trackers show an estimated total number of calories burned based on users’ BMR (basal metabolic rate) and activity energy expenditure (AEE). Fitbit uses a scientifically validated estimate of BMR based on height, weight, age, and gender information that users provide when setting up their Fitbit account. The company also argues that there’s something to be said for the base-level motivation that simply wearing a tracker brings. It’s a fair point. If the sort of gamification that these devices bring does get more people off their butts, that’s probably a net positive and a big part of what’s driving the category’s success. I know plenty of people (myself included) who find the simple act of wearing one of these devices on their wrist cause to get off their respective butts. Shcherbina agrees with the point, but adds that there’s a big downside for those who rely on such readings to make “very precise decisions about exercise and food based on that, then it might be off by quite a bit and they may not get the results they want and become frustrated.” As more health providers look to trackers for data, the category is likely to come under increased scrutiny from regulators like the FDA. As it currently stands, however, that body doesn’t oversee any sort of claims made for these “non-medical” products. “Our position is that ‘sunlight is better than regulation,’ ” says Ashley. “We would encourage the companies to make available their validation studies in the public domain so the public can see for themselves which devices are most accurate.” At the very least, the study prompts some interesting questions about how companies collect and process the data that informs its health claims. The data collected may not be a perfect reflection of manufacturers’ intentions, but the study is a place to start the conversation.

As usual, Apple will use its own HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) technology introduced in 2010 to broadcast the event so that users of any relatively recent iOS or macOS device can view it in the Safari web browser. PC users can view the event using Microsoft Edge on Windows 10; older versions of Windows don’t appear to be supported. For Apple TV users, the event will be broadcast in the Apple Events tvOS app; interestingly it also appears that Apple will still be broadcasting the event to second- and third-generation Apple TV devices, suggesting the “Apple Events” channel will simply appear on these now-discontinued models in time for the event.

The iOS 10 Maps app redesign added a small indicator showing the current weather, but now in iOS 10.3 if you have a 3D Touch capable device you can view a weather forecast simply by pressing down firmly on the weather icon. A light press will let you “peek” at the current weather forecast, and if you press a bit harder it will take you over to the iOS Weather app. What’s particularly useful about this is that the weather information will pertain to whatever area you’re viewing on the map, so while it’s only slightly faster for your home city than opening the Weather app or widget, it’s a particularly useful shortcut when you’re looking at a map view of another city.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Definitive Guide to Apple Stock Dividends The mobile device innovator has recently embraced dividends. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) May 25, 2017 at 5:23PM Technology stocks have historically been slow to embrace dividends, and until recently, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) dividend history was no exception to that rule. After discontinuing a token payout in the mid-1990s, Apple went more than 15 years without making any dividend payouts at all. Yet now, the tech giant has not only started paying dividends but has increased them regularly, giving it a respectable yield even after a big run higher for its stock. Moreover, its modest payout ratio gives it plenty of room to boost scheduled quarterly dividends further in the future. Let's look more closely at Apple's dividend history to get a better sense of how the tech company has come to be a giant in the dividend world as well. Apple's history of dividend payments Apple has a long history of paying dividends, but it also has a long gap in the middle of its dividend history. From 1987 to 1995, it paid quarterly dividends that ranged from $0.06 to $0.12 per share, but that was before three subsequent stock splits that have given longtime investors 28 Apple shares for every one share they owned during that time span. Then in 1995, Apple suspended its dividends, choosing instead to focus on growth initiatives. Image source: Apple. But in 2012, Apple decided to bring back its dividend. The company started with a split-adjusted payout of about $0.38 per share quarterly as part of a broader package to return $45 billion in capital to shareholders over a three-year period. The payout represented a yield of slightly less than 2% at the time, but it began a process by which Apple could look at further dividend growth over time. AAPL Dividend data by YCharts. Note: The line between 1996 and 2012 represents a discontinuity in Apple's dividend history during which Apple paid no dividend at all, rather than the gently sloping increase represented in the chart. Those increases indeed did come with regularity. In 2013, the company made a roughly 15% increase to bring the dividend to about $0.426 per share, and 2014 brought Apple's latest 7-for-1 stock split and a boost to $0.47 per share. Roughly 10% annual increases have followed ever since, culminating in its most recent increase to $0.63 per share on the dividend Apple declared on May 2, with a record date of May 15 and paid out to shareholders on May 18. What's next for Apple dividends? Yet some investors are unsatisfied with what Apple has done with its dividend. With a huge nine-figure cash hoard, it has plenty of capital to return to shareholders, and in that light, a current yield of just 1.6% seems lackluster at best. There's no doubt that Apple could afford to make greater dividend payments. Currently, the tech giant pays out only about 28% of its projected earnings for this year, and less than 25% of its forward earnings projections for the next year. It's true that a lot of those earnings are generated outside the U.S. and would therefore be subject to repatriation taxes if used to pay dividends. But even within the bounds of current tax law, Apple would have more latitude to make higher dividend payouts if it so chose. The key question is what happens with tax policy. The Trump administration has proposed tax reform measures that would make it far easier for U.S. companies like Apple to bring overseas cash back into the U.S. for investment, but the details aren't yet clear. Whether Apple would be able to use repatriated money to pay a higher dividend or would instead have to demonstrate a commitment to more active investment within the U.S. remains to be seen. Still, investors have to be aware that because of its size, even the relatively low dividend yield that Apple pays is enough to make the company the largest payer of dividends in the world in terms of raw dollar payout. In addition, it has emphasized stock repurchases over dividend increases, with more than two-thirds of its most recent $50 billion increase in capital return going toward buybacks. That has two negative impacts on dividends in that it both leaves less money for dividend payments and tends to boost the stock price, which makes the dividend yield weaker. Nevertheless, investors aren't complaining about the strong total returns that Apple stock has produced lately. For dividend investors, Apple has gone from a nonentity to a leader in just five years. If its business continues to thrive, then Apple could see even more success in growing its dividend over time and satisfying its shareholders with strong total returns.

Readdle, makers of the popular Spark and PDF Expert, aren't waiting for Apple to add a native drag & drop framework to iOS, though. Today, in addition to the release of Documents 6, the company is updating most of their iPad apps with a custom drag & drop feature that simplifies the transfer of documents between two apps in Split View. I've been testing this functionality for the past week, and, even if it's not system-wide iOS drag & drop, it's been enough to pull me back into Spark and PDF Expert – at least for now. Since the launch of iOS 9, I've seen a few third-party libraries attempt to bring drag & drop to iPad apps, but all of them failed to gain widespread adoption. As I outlined in last week's story, a native drag & drop feature would have to be an official framework created by Apple and opened up to third-party developers with an API. With their iPad apps, Readdle is taking a limited, but perhaps more effective approach: drag & drop works for certain file types and specific drop targets in the UI, and it's only supported in Split View and with Spark, Documents, PDF Expert, and Scanner Pro. Don't expect to, say, drop an image from Safari into Spark, or a PDF from Slack into PDF Expert. Readdle has built their own proprietary flavor of drag & drop that only works with their apps in Split View. Dropping files from Documents into Spark. Untitled Replay Despite its custom nature, drag & drop works as advertised and it's a fantastic complement to Readdle's iPad apps that reinforces how needed an official Apple version is. Readdle's drag & drop feels natural: if you need to add multiple attachments to an email in Spark, you can grab them in Documents and drop them into the body of the message. Want to save a PDF from Spark into PDF Expert? Just hold it, drag it into the app in Split View, and the file is saved. No need to open and close the iOS document picker multiple times, no need to upload anything: with drag & drop, you can save several steps typically involved with managing documents in a way that makes sense on the iPad's large screen. Readdle has been able to pull this off by adopting constraints in terms of the kind of content that can be grabbed and where in the interface it can be dropped. All of their apps offer drop areas clearly visualized in the UI: in Spark, the '+' button in the bottom right corner transforms into a larger blue circle when you're holding a document, indicating that you can drop the file there to create a new message with an attachment. If you're already writing a message and you start dragging a file, you'll get a drop target at the bottom of the message composer instead, which allows you to attach multiple files to the same email (something that is either cumbersome or impossible in other email clients for iPad). I recently had to send a handful of PDFs to my accountant and, for the first time in years, I didn't have to collect them in a single .zip archive beforehand; I just put PDF Expert and Spark in Split View and dropped multiple files in the email, which took less than 10 seconds. It was glorious in its obviousness. Readdle's drag & drop is even more impressive when you want to save attachments from Spark into PDF Expert or Documents. Not only can you grab an email attachment and drop it in the main UI of the other app – you can release it on top of an existing folder to save it in that location, or you can drop it on another file to create a folder. Dropping files from Spark into PDF Expert. Untitled Replay There's even support for spring-loading: while holding a file, you can hover over a location in PDF Expert's sidebar (such as iCloud or Synced Folders) and wait a second until the destination loads and lets you continue navigation before dropping the file. To navigate back to the root level, you can either spring-load another item in the sidebar or hold the file on top of the 'Back' button in the upper left corner. Spring-loading locations in Documents 6. Untitled Replay As you can imagine, I'm a fan of what Readdle has built; it matches the kind of drag & drop system I envisioned for iOS 11, and it fully supports multitouch in that grabbing an item from one app preserves the ability to control the interface in the other. There are other behaviors I would have liked to see and which are not supported right now (dragging a message from Spark to print an email to PDF; dropping a text selection in another app), but, overall, Readdle has replicated (albeit at a smaller scale) the experience we should have in all iPad apps in the future. Readdle has been quite clever from a technical standpoint, too. Under the hood, two apps in Split View create a local web server that makes them aware of each other. This two-way communication allows them to share documents by simulating drag & drop in the UI and relying on various URL scheme and clipboard-based workarounds. Readdle did an admirable job in making their drag & drop feel like part of iOS, but, if you look closer, the fact that a file can't float on top of the Split View divider (it just transitions from app to app at the edges of the UI) may break the illusion. For most people using Spark and PDF Expert in Split View, though, the apps' drag & drop feature will look like a native iOS enhancement. Documents 6's new contextual menu. In addition to bringing drag & drop to their iPad apps, Readdle is also releasing version 6.0 of their popular Documents file manager later today (a free update for existing users). I've been using Documents as a de-facto lightweight Finder on iOS for years now, and it's good to see that Readdle is continuing to develop the app as a central hub that can integrate with iCloud Drive and other services. Documents 6 iterates upon the app's solid foundation without altering its core structure or functionality. The new version supports drag & drop with Readdle apps, which, like in PDF Expert, lets you drop files into other apps in Split View as well as receive files from apps and save them in specific locations. Readdle has also adopted a contextual menu for individual files that can be opened by pressing a three-dot 'More' button. The combination of long-press for drag & drop and the contextual menu works well, and it simplifies access to options that were perhaps too hidden in the old version of the app.1 Documents 6 brings a redesigned media player for audio files, too. The 'Now Playing' screen now lives in a sidebar on the iPad, with a list of audio files queued up on the right; the player can be minimized if you want to continue listening while doing something else in the app. I've been using Documents to preview AppStories episodes before release, so I appreciate the more flexible audio player (which also resizes properly in Split View now). Documents' new audio player in full-screen and minimized modes. There are other minor changes in Documents 6 but, as you might expect, drag & drop is the marquee addition. Being able to keep a Finder-like app in Split View when processing email or scanning PDFs and having a way to easily move documents back and forth across apps is the kind of workflow every iPad user deserves. The convenience of drag & drop in Readdle's apps is predicated on the assumption that most of your work happens inside the Readdle ecosystem. And given the popularity of Readdle's iPad apps, there's a good chance that you're already using Spark and PDF Expert to communicate with others, edit PDFs, and exchange documents. But even if you're not a Readdle user, I believe this new drag & drop feature can lure you back into their suite of apps and convince you to stay until Apple offers a native, system-wide alternative on iOS. Out of curiosity (and to properly assess the utility of drag & drop), I switched to Spark, Documents, and PDF Expert full-time for the past week. To my surprise, I noticed that I spend a lot of time dealing with attachments, converting documents to PDF, and saving those PDFs to Dropbox. Drag & drop between these apps has saved me several minutes I would have otherwise wasted dealing with extensions and document providers. As I argued last week, it just makes more sense on the iPad to grab something and drop it elsewhere on screen. The folks at Readdle understand that inter-app communication on iPad can go beyond the share sheet, and they've shipped a polished, intuitive drag & drop functionality that now makes other iPad apps feel one-dimensional and static. Readdle's take on drag & drop is the strongest case in favor of an official, Apple-made alternative yet. I just hope that this custom implementation will feel obsolete in two weeks. I wouldn't mind if Apple went with colored glyphs for each function of the share sheet, like Readdle did with Documents 6. Each feature has a different color in this menu, which makes them easier to find at a glance. ↩︎ Tags: email, iPad, readdle Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

Photographed by Christopher Patey FX Chief John Landgraf Talks Peak TV, 'Louie' Future and Netflix: It's "Shoveling Money" by Lacey Rose May 25, 2017, 6:25am PDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter "Where are YouTube and Apple going to go?" asks THR's TV Executive of the Year as he and colleagues reject the "heat-seeking missile" strategy that "leaves shows as an afterthought." On Feb. 5, the FX logo splashed across 111 million television screens. "In a year with over 450 scripted series, one network has the three most critically acclaimed of all," a voice could be heard saying, as viewers of the 51st Super Bowl were treated to snippets of The Americans ("the most celebrated drama"), Atlanta ("the most acclaimed comedy") and The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story ("the most acclaimed program"). It was a bold statement about creative prowess, and one that FX Networks CEO John Landgraf had made at least once before. In fact, three and a half weeks earlier, Landgraf, 55, stood on the Television Critics Association stage — where he once famously coined the term "peak TV" and semiannually earns the unofficial title "the mayor of television" — and rattled off those and other impressive data points, including FX's 406 inclusions on 152 year-end best lists, the top showing of any television network. Had the Super Bowl spot run longer, Landgraf could have worked in the basic cable record that his network shattered at September's Emmy Awards. Thanks in large part to American Crime Story and Fargo, FX took home 18 statuettes, the most in the network's 23-year history and a sum second only to HBO's. Viewership followed: FX and younger-skewing sibling FXX rounded out the year with two of cable's top five scripted dramas (O.J., American Horror Story: Roanoke) and three of its top five comedies (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Archer and Atlanta). FX's success becomes all the more impressive when one considers that Landgraf, a married father of three whom GQ recently dubbed "the quiet genius inside your TV," is working with a $1 billion budget — about one-third of what HBO reportedly spends and just one-fifth of Netflix's 2016 content budget (the streamer is expected to lay out $6 billion in 2017). "If you look at the difference between what Netflix is doing right now and what we're doing, we're spearfishing and they're drift-net fishing," he says, pointedly. "They're scooping every organism off the bottom of the ocean. And they're keeping them all now, but reason would say, at some point you keep the bluefin tuna and throw the others back." For FX's roster of producers, working with Landgraf is a significant draw. That's certainly been the case for Noah Hawley, who dabbled unsuccessfully in network TV before making his way to FX. "John understands theme and character and cinema — not because he read about them in a book or took a seminar but because he is a searcher who cares deeply about finding answers to life's important questions," says the Fargo and Legion showrunner. "He believes these truths can be discovered through the stories we tell. This, not profit or ratings, is what drives him." Landgraf — a 13-year FX veteran with 250 employees under his direction (not including ad sales and affiliate sales) and THR's TV Executive of the Year — was joined by original programming presidents Nick Grad and Eric Schrier in their offices on the Fox lot for a candid conversation about the frothy market, the future of Louie and the upside of not having pockets as deep as Netflix. You coined the term "peak TV" to describe the boom in scripted originals. How close are we to that peak? JOHN LANDGRAF What's unknown is: Where's YouTube going to go? Where's Apple going to go? Silicon Valley has infinite access to capital and can lose money indefinitely. If enough of them decide they want to take over this business and they're willing to lose money to do it, they can just make as many shows as they want. So you can't compete on the amount of money you're willing to pay talent up front. How do you persuade people to come to FX? LANDGRAF First of all, we can pay people as much or more in success. So, where we compete is if you have a successful show on FX, you can actually make more money than having a successful show on Netflix, for example. ERIC SCHRIER We look at everything, and I don't think it's actually the production costs that stand in our way because if there is the right property, we can figure it out. It's the commitment: Jumping into two seasons on the air just doesn't make sense. It's not a good way to make television. There will be good shows that come out of that, but we just don't believe in that model. How often do you miss out on projects as a result? LANDGRAF It absolutely happens, but we've just never been a bank that's going out and trying to buy hits and buy Emmys. We've been a place that was really about the person and about the idea. So, while I'd love it if we could just have $100 million we could throw down at will, I think that would cause us to lose our focus on some level, too. You do? LANDGRAF I do — because ultimately that's being a heat-seeking missile. That's chasing after what's hot. We know that we will lose things that we deeply admire — like Master of None — that way. But on the other hand, this gives us an opportunity to really carefully think about who we want to work with, what's not on television and what's worth taking a risk on. It's more organic because it's responding day in and day out to people and conversations and ideas rather than frantically chasing after a frothy marketplace trying to get information, get in on the meeting, twist people's arms, make a deal, write a check. I'd say that that leaves the shows as an afterthought. With his casting in the Han Solo movie, Donald Glover (Atlanta) is the latest FX talent to parlay a success on your network into other, bigger opportunities elsewhere. Frustrating or inevitable? NICK GRAD In a perfect world, you'd want Atlanta to come back a year later [in 2017 rather than 2018], after its first season, but we have the ability and the portfolio to be able to say, "If we want to let Donald do Star Wars, we can." LANDGRAF I'd also argue it's kind of hollow to say, "We support your creativity, but it better be done by this date." Is it fair to say you opened the door to these kinds of delays years ago with Louis C.K., who is currently on an indefinite hiatus? LANDGRAF Yeah. Louis called me at home on a Saturday and said, "I'm really having trouble saying this out loud, but I think I need to not make Louie for a while." This was after the last season [in 2015]. It was surprising to me because we had unilaterally rewritten his backend definition and given him very, very lavish financial incentives. But he said, "Look, I'm feeling trapped being this version of myself that I play on this TV show, and I'm feeling trapped by the expectations that I now go out and do this again." Then he said, "I don't know that I will never make an episode of Louie again. I just know I can't do it right now. I have to go do something else." So, what are you going to do when you have that conversation? Well, you could go the Dave Chappelle way and back up a money truck and say, "Louis, I'm going to pay you $50 million to make two episodes of TV" or whatever it is. [Netflix is paying for Chappelle's specials.] What I said was, "Gosh, Louis, this is really hard to hear. I'm going to really, really miss making this show. Obviously, we're going to miss having this show. But you've got to do what's right for you." And so after that conversation, Louie went on to a really extended hiatus. By the way, I think one of the reasons he called me is because we were about to close an overall deal that was tied to the show, and Louis is an honorable guy. He said, "I don't want to close this deal and then tell you. So, if you want to pull out of the deal, I understand." We were really bummed. We talked about it, but we kept the deal. Welcome, Baskets and Better Things and One Mississippi and now The Cops [all from C.K.'s production company] and more to come. Will we ever see more Louie? LANDGRAF I don't know. Look, Louis is a major filmmaker as well as a major TV producer. There could be Broadway plays, too, and he's still making money hand over fist as a comedian. What I would say is, I don't think it'll happen unless Louis has gone through a transformation in his life related to his kids getting older and changing his perspective and growing up. He has a different point of view about how he views life or who and what he is as a protagonist. I could see him coming back and making more episodes, but Louis wouldn't be the same Louis by that time. Ryan Murphy recently said the only downside to the limited series model is financial, but you keep greenlighting more. Any concerns? LANDGRAF Ryan really invented this form with American Horror Story, and we saw the possibilities very quickly. We went through a period of time where we thought the drama business got overheated. They just started to feel derivative. It's been 15 years since The Shield, 18 since The Sopranos, and there are still great shows, but there are an awful lot of shows that are manufactured to look like great shows that follow the template of great shows like The Sopranos or The Wire or The Shield or Breaking Bad but that aren't great shows, either because they're a little familiar or they just feel derivative. So we leaned the other way. As we were getting this mandate to launch a channel [FXX] and increase the number of shows, if we had insisted that those shows be dramas because the prevailing wisdom was that dramas were the ones that are the prestige things and they make the money, we would have put mediocre stuff on the air. Noah Hawley's had success with the format, too. How long can Fargo go? LANDGRAF There may never be another Fargo. Unless Noah has an idea for Fargo that he thinks he can make as good as the prior three. I think once people get to the end of this [season] they will find that it is thematically different. It's really about the moment we live in now. There are several genres, including late night and stand-up, that you're not currently playing in. Will that change? LANDGRAF You could say the reason that Netflix and HBO are in all those other areas is because there's excellent work to be done in all those areas. You could also say it's because Emmy nominations are awarded and top 10 lists are made in all those areas, and if you want to have the maximum chance to be the No. 1 brand in America, you're going to take your capital and you're going to spend it everywhere there's an Emmy. To be blunt, I don't know that that's true, but I suspect that it is. So, would we like to be in the documentary business? Yeah. We watch a lot of documentaries. I think it's a form that's at a superb place, but right now, Netflix is just shoveling money at it like shoveling coal into a boiler. Same could be said for stand-up, where Louis recently did a special. LANDGRAF Yes. If you follow conventional wisdom, what you end up tending to do is competing against the most successful, largest players on the field of battle where they're going to destroy you because you're playing to their strengths — whether that's the breadth and ratings of broadcast networks or the financial muscle of a company that can burn through $2 billion in free cash flow a year. So, why fight with them where we can't win? We've always tried to play the game that we thought we could win. So we're never going to program in children's, I don't think, and that's an area where both HBO and Netflix program. There are a lot of genres out there — variety shows, comedy specials, late-night programming, doc series. … But if we were getting in it to open up a new front in our battle for critical acclaim and Emmys, we'd probably fail. We'd have to be in it because we thought there was something we could bring to it in terms of process and taste that was missing from the market and because we were going to get in it and stay in it for a long time. You were in the late-night space briefly with talent like W. Kamau Bell, though that was just before race became so much a part of the Hollywood conversation. He has since found success elsewhere. Would you take the same bet if it were offered today? LANDGRAF I think if we had put him on the air in concert with the Trump campaign and election, it probably would have worked. GRAD And if I learned anything from that, it's that I'm definitely more of a fan of the weekly show than the daily show. There are people who can do it daily, but it's very hard. You've said you have big ambitions in shortform animation. LANDGRAF We're quietly working on it. We just like the idea of a laboratory where we could take even bigger risks on different, weirder things that people might not be doing right now. What does that look like? SCHRIER There's an expression of the FX brand that's in the shortform business that people can watch on a phone or in smaller bites. It's a process of experimentation because you never know what's going to hit. There's animation, there's live action, there's five-minute segments, 10-minute segments, 15-minute segments. We're not trying to jam it into some structure. We're trying to go to people we think are talented and have unique ideas that fit in that space and cultivate that. GRAD And then we'll curate a program block. LANDGRAF We miss the time, on some level, when there wasn't an expectation that every show we put on the air was going to be good and succeed. I don't mean to say we want to make bad shows, but the standard for what people expect right now out of a comedy or a drama or a limited series is really hard. We miss the time when you could just swing freely. FX series have had a tendency to run over the hour mark to the frustration of certain critics. How do you assess episode length, and what do the conversations with your creatives entail?  LANDGRAF Initially, we didn't want to put anything that wasn't the best possible product on the air. The notion that we would hurt a cut so that it would hit a format made no sense to us. So, there was a point a while ago where we decided, "You know what? We have a format, but we're going to let [our creatives] put the best version of the show on the air. And if it's 40 minutes, it's 40. If it's 68, it's 68." We used to have big fights over it because the ad revenue was really important and we didn't want to lose commercial space. At a certain point, we just built enough slack to be able to tolerate it. Then, to be honest with you, we probably got a little lax. I think there are episodes of television that have aired that would've been better if they were shorter, as opposed to the problem that we had before, which is shows might have been better if they were longer. And so we've tried to correct back and say, "Well, look, you can make a show of any length. But just because you can make a show of any length, doesn't mean you should." You've had a lot of success in this job, but you, too, have missed on occasion. What do you consider your blind spot? LANDGRAF There have been three times since I've been here that we've launched three shows in a row that failed. So, I guess my answer is we have the same weakness everyone else does, which is that it is impossible. It's hitting a fastball with a fraction of a second; it's something that just can't be done perfectly every time. No matter how much we listen to each other, talk to each other, solicit opinions, try to correct for bias, you have to make decisions without enough information. I wouldn’t wish public disappointment or failure on anyone in this business, it’s hard, and if you’re doing any of these picker-programming jobs, you’re going to look like an idiot because hindsight is twenty-twenty and it’s always going to be, “Why didn’t you pick that up?’ or “Why did you pick that up?” ••• "IT'S NICE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A BIDDING WAR"  FX Productions wasn’t built to be a seller, but the studio now places projects everywhere from Amazon to Freeform. When John Landgraf launched FX Productions in 2005, he had no intention of hawking its projects to networks other than FX. The strategy simply was to own content. Twelve years later, the studio has a growing portfolio of producers — Louis C.K., Donald Glover and Noah Hawley each have deals — and projects at rival networks, including Amazon (One Mississippi), TBS (The Cops) and, soon, Freeform (a project loosely described as "Friday Night Lights in a rodeo"). While the primary goal remains to make series for FX, landing content at outside networks — be it a passion project like Rob McElhenney's Bare Knuckle Fight Club that has no place on FX's schedule (it sold to Channel 4 in the U.K.) or a series that feels better tonally elsewhere — is a byproduct of both the FXP roster and the expanding marketplace. "Fox 21 Television studios will make a deal with talent to sell that talent to HBO or Showtime or AMC," says Landgraf. "We make a deal with talent because we believe they have a show for FX Networks in them, and we hope to put that show on the air. But are you going to have a perfect one-to-one ratio between everything that anybody you have a deal with creates and shows that you put on FX? That's impossible." So rather than shut down ideas that don't feel right for FX, the team has begun selling elsewhere. Occasionally, that results in some confusion, with buyers wondering, "Why aren't you doing this at FX?" It's also given the FX execs an education in how to hear a pitch, having moved to the seller side for the first time. Among the perks, says FXP original programming president Eric Schrier with a laugh: "It's nice to be on the other side of a bidding war."

Apple News is getting its first ever editor in chief. Lauren Kern will leave her role as executive editor of New York Magazine on June 2nd for the Cupertino-based company, New York Magazine Editor-in-Chief Adam Moss announced on Wednesday in a staff memo obtained by CNN. "I am not happy to report that we are losing our beloved Lauren Kern to the Apple corporation," Moss wrote. "I mean, I'm happy for Lauren certainly. It's an exciting opportunity to be the editor in chief of Apple News, to bring a journalistic vigor and intelligence to an operation that has always seemed to me so full of promise." The news was first reported on Thursday morning by Politico. An Apple spokesperson confirmed the news to CNN, but declined to offer further details on what Kern's role will entail and whether the job will based in the company's California headquarters. Apple News is a mobile news aggregation app which launched in the summer of 2015. The app draws in stories from various news partners and personalizes the front page to fit the user's interests. Apple News' partners include CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and others. "Apple has the audience -- all they needed was a superior editorial intelligence to guide it," Moss wrote in his memo. "They recognized that that person was Lauren, and of course we know they are right." Moss praised Kern for the work she has done at New York Magazine, which he said "has been so critical" to its success. "She provided excellent council to me on all sorts of editorial matters, and she was just beginning a new adventure seeding ambitious feature projects across our verticals," he wrote. "There isn't much she can't do. Apple is lucky to have her."

The five-day event, which is being held in San Jose, California, isn’t just an opportunity for macOS and iOS developers Master iOS 10 Programming With 5 Swift Classes Master iOS 10 Programming With 5 Swift Classes Are you thinking of getting get into app development? Maybe, you are still undecided between Android or iOS? Take these Udemy classes to understand the potential of iOS 10 programming. Read More to get together and have a good time. It’s also when Apple has historically announced or updated products that eventually become a huge part of our digital lives, including iPhone, Apple Music, and more. Let’s take a look at the WWDC events of years gone by and consider why this is such an important event for Apple. WWDC by the Numbers 71 seconds — The amount of time it took for tickets to sell out for the event in 2013. Since in 2014, tickets to the event are assigned randomly through a lottery system. $1,599 — Since 2010, Apple has charged nearly $1,600 for each ticket to the event. Apple also gives out free student scholarship tickets. 1983 — The first WWDC was held in Monterey, California, although it wasn’t until 1988 when the event began being held annually. 2002 — The last time San Jose hosted WWDC. From 2003 through 2016, the event was held in San Francisco, California. 2011 — Steve Jobs hosted his final Apple event at WWDC. The Apple co-founder died the following October at the age of 56. 5,000 — Since 2008, Apple has capped the number of attendees to 5,200. This includes 200 scholarship winners. The Biggest WWDC Moments 1. 1997: The King Returns Steve Jobs made his triumphant return to the company he co-founded in 1997 after 12 years in the technology wilderness iRead: 7 Books About Steve Jobs All Apple Fans Should Own iRead: 7 Books About Steve Jobs All Apple Fans Should Own We have selected the best books written about Steve Jobs and Apple. These seven tomes provide all the information on Jobs you'll need to know, and a lot more besides. Read More . After being fired by Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT and helped fund the company that became Pixar. Jobs’ return to Apple was brought on by Cupertino’s February 1997 purchase of NeXT for $427 million. Thanks to the acquisition, Apple would have the tools necessary to introduce a new operating system for Mac a few years later. Pixar was purchased by The Walt Disney Company in 2006 for $7.4 billion. It has produced some of the biggest films of the past 25 years, including the Toy Story franchise and Finding Nemo. 2. 2000–2001: Saying Hello to Mac OS X Apple celebrated the dawn of 21st century by introducing Mac OS X (now called macOS How To Install macOS & Save The Installer How To Install macOS & Save The Installer It's really easy to save the macOS installer to avoid multiple downloads, and worth doing even if you only have the one Mac. Read More ) in March 2001. At WWDC 2000 and WWDC 2001, Apple demonstrated the new operating system to developers and the public during numerous how-to sessions. In 2001, the company announced Mac OS X Server, which was big news for business users. Mac OS X 10.0 served as a radical departure from the classic Mac OS and introduced a new Darwin Unix-like core and a completely new system of memory management. 3. 2005: Cupertino Looks to Intel At WWDC 2005, Apple announced it would transition the Mac platform to Intel x86 processors from PowerPC processors, which had been developed by Apple, IBM, and Motorola. The move was described as a “seismic shocker” at the time. Why did Apple make the switch? As Macworld explained: “The reason, industry analysts say, is that (Steve) Jobs has a clear goal in mind: innovative designs. And such designs require the lowest-voltage chips, which IBM and Freescale were not going to make with the PowerPC chip core…” The switch would allow Apple to eventually introduce new and speedier Mac products, including the MacBook Air. 4. 2006: Windows Comes to Mac OS X Apple introduced the Mac Pro as a replacement for the Power Mac G5, which was the company’s final PowerPC-based Mac. At WWDC 2006, Apple also launched Time Machine and Boot Camp for Mac OS X. With Time Machine, you can backup your Mac with easy. The latter allowed you to access Windows from a Mac computer for the first time. This change was significant in that it allowed folks who would have ordinarily needed to buy a Windows-based computer to purchase a Mac instead. 5. 2007: The Birth of the iPhone In January 2007, Apple unveiled iPhone, a product that would transition the company from a computer maker to something much more. At WWDC 2007, which focused mostly on the impending arrival of OS X Leopard, Jobs finally announced the release date for iPhone: June 29. The date was revealed during one of Jobs’ signature “one more thing” moments that ended that year’s keynote address. 6. 2008: App Store Arrives Though Mac remains an important part of WWDC, beginning in 2008, the main focus of the event began shifting towards iPhone and what would become iOS. This was also the year that Apple announced the App Store, which launched in July 2008. A few years later, the Mac App Store arrived, forever changing how you purchase applications for your computer. As of January 2017, the App Store features over 2.2 million apps for iPhone and iPad. 7. 2010: The Final Summer iPhone At WWDC 2010, Apple revealed the iPhone 4, the last Apple handset to launch at the annual event. Since 2011, new iPhones have been announced in the fall, which has dramatically changed when consumers purchased new smartphones each year. Instead of using the WWDC keynote to announce new iPhones, WWDC instead now serves as a launching pad for next-generation versions of iOS. This is one of the primary reasons the WWDC keynote has become popular with non-developers since it’s a preview of things to come iOS devices. 8. 2013: iCloud Keychain In 2013, Apple introduced iCloud Keychain Should You Use iCloud Keychain to Sync Passwords on Mac & iOS? Should You Use iCloud Keychain to Sync Passwords on Mac & iOS? If you primarily use Apple products, why not use the company's own password manager completely free of charge? Read More , which serves as a secure database for user information that’s accessible from multiple devices. This data includes website login passwords, Wi-Fi network passwords, credit/debit card management, and other account information. AES (256-bit) encryption protects the data. Meanwhile, Apple Pay, which launched in 2014, launched because of iCloud Keychain. It allows you to make mobile and online purchases without handing over your debit or credit card information to strangers making it a more secure solution. 9. 2014: Swift Apple used the WWDC 2014 keynote address to announce Swift, a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language Apple's Swift Is Going Open Source: So What? Apple's Swift Is Going Open Source: So What? Even if you aren't a programmer yourself, Apple's decision to open source Swift will impact you. Want to know why and how? Read More for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux development. Swift has been positioned as an alternative to the Objective-C language that employs modern programming language theory concepts and strives to present a simpler syntax. In doing so, it’s one of the easiest languages to read and maintain. Because Swift is now open-source, developers can develop iOS and macOS apps on non-Apple systems and have the assurance of 100 percent compatibility. This means more apps for you to try in the future. 10. 2015: Apple Music, Beats 1 Launch Apple launched the first iPod in 2001, which brought with it the iTunes Store. For over a decade, iTunes was the place to go to buy digital music, which overtook CDs in the early 2000s. The popularity of buying music has ebbed considerably in recent years, however, thanks to the rise of music streaming services such as Spotify. Cupertino’s entry in this field, Apple Music, launched at WWDC 2015. Like similar subscription plans, Apple Music membership allows you to rent and listen to unlimited music across multiple platforms 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know Since its launch in 2015, Apple Music has come a long way, baby.

Though Apple Music continues to trail Spotify in terms of the number of subscribers, it would be foolish to count Apple out. This was the company that changed how we consumed music, after all. Perhaps we’ll hear more about the company’s future plans for Apple Music at an upcoming WWDC. Yes, WWDC Is Important Apple developers will be the ones gathering in San Jose for the annual WWDC. Ultimately, however, this event is all about the people at home. Many of the products announced at WWDC are the ones you’ll be talking about and using in the months and years ahead.

While WWDC is less than two weeks away, we've haven't heard many details on what we can expect. There's talk about an overhauled design and an updated user interface along with rumors of new functionality for the iPad, but beyond that, we don't know what's coming, and we don't know what that new user interface will look like. In the absence of rumors, we've taken a look at some of the most-desired features MacRumors readers are hoping for in iOS 11, culled from our forums. Unsurprisingly, many readers are looking forward to a new design and an overhauled interface. Here are some of the things readers want in a design refresh: - Animated icons - Allowing developers to add small animations to app icons is something that iOS users have been wanting for several years. With access to subtle animations, apps like Fantastical could feature an icon with the current date, or third-party weather apps could display the current temperature. - iPhone complications - The Apple Watch interface features multiple complications or small icons that let Apple Watch users glean information at a glance. On the iPhone, complications could be added to the lock screen or the Home screen to serve the same function, letting users see information like weather or activity level without needing to open an app. - Customizable Control Center - iOS 10 made a mess of the Control Center, splitting it into three screens. MacRumors readers are hoping for a more unified design with the ability to choose what icons and functions are displayed. Expanded 3D Touch for more granular control over Control Center options would also improve the Control Center. - Call interface - When an incoming phone or FaceTime call is received on an iPhone, it takes over the entire display with a call interface, something people would like to see changed in iOS 11. A call interface that pops up over what a user is doing instead of domineering the entire iPhone is a feature several readers mentioned wanting. - Volume interface - On a similar note, there's a lot of hate towards the current volume display that pops up when the volume is adjusted on the iPhone because it's a giant icon in the middle of the screen. Something subtler and less intrusive is at the top of several wish lists. - Widgets - Android-style Home screen live tiles or widgets are another feature that some iOS users have long desired. Apple added widgets to the Notification Center on the iPhone, but some readers want a more integrated, customizable solution directly on the Home screen. - Keyboard - Users who prefer a swipe-based keyboard (where typing is done by swiping across the screen) would like to see that added as an option. A top number row across the default keyboard is also highly desired. - Dark mode - Dark mode was a feature rumored for iOS 10 that never materialized, and MacRumors readers are hoping to see it in iOS 11. A system-wide dark mode that comes on at sunset is something a lot of people want, and with an overhauled interface rumored for iOS 11, it could happen. A dark mode concept from iHelpBR - iPhone 7 Plus multitasking features - Some users would like to see the iPad's multitasking features expanded to the iPhone 7 Plus, including Split View, which allows two apps to be used at once, and picture-in-picture, which allows a video to be watched in the corner of the display while other apps are in use. With a larger 5.8-inch display rumored for the OLED iPhone, it doesn't seem out of the question. Split-View multitasking on iPad Along with the above listed design changes, there are also wish lists for individual apps, Siri, and other internal features, ranging from notifications to Continuity. Photos App Many MacRumors readers want to see some significant improvements to the Photos app, which got a major overhaul in iOS 10. Facial recognition was added, allowing iOS devices to automatically recognize the people in photos and group them accordingly, but the feature is on-device only and does not sync for privacy reasons. Some users want the People option to sync across devices for convenience purposes, while others want to be able to choose specific albums to sync to iCloud Photo Library. Other desired features include options to fully hide photos from albums and options for manually adding things like keywords and location. Camera App Several camera settings for adjusting video and other options are tucked away in the Settings app, and several readers would like to see those options added to the Camera app instead, where accessing them would be much easier. An option for manual controls in the Camera app is also a requested feature, as it would allow users to have more control over photos without needing to download a third-party app. Maps iOS users would like to see an option for offline Maps and multi-destination routes in iOS 11, two features that are available in Google Maps. Siri Along with an overhauled interface, a better version of Siri seems to be one of the features people are most hoping for in iOS 11. The good news is that Apple's rumored to be working on some major Siri improvements, and it's likely we'll see something Siri-related in iOS 11. - Text-based Siri - A Siri assistant would allow people who don't want to talk to their phones to interact with Siri via text, sort of like a chatbot. Google just introduced chatbot abilities for Google Assistant, and introduced a Google Assistant iOS app, which could inspire Apple to release a similar feature. - Unified Search - A merged Siri and Spotlight Search feature goes hand-in-hand with a text-based Siri assistant. The search function could be updated to support Siri-style commands that could be typed into the current search interface. - Offline Siri - Some users would like to be able to use Siri when the iPhone is offline for tasks that are able to be accomplished without an Internet connection. - Extended SiriKit - Opening up SiriKit to more kinds of apps would expand Siri's capabilities. Other Features File management - Several MacRumors readers mentioned a desire for a better file management system that would make it easier to transfer content between apps. MacStories' Federico Vittici made a mockup featuring a drag and drop interface and a file storage shelf on the iPad that would be an ideal way for Apple to implement simpler file sharing options. Federico Vittici's iOS 11 file sharing concept - Notification grouping - A lot of people hate the way notifications are handled on iOS. Options for grouping notifications by app would go a long way towards cleaning up the Notification Center. - Default apps - While it probably won't happen, MacRumors readers would like to see an option to set non-Apple default apps, like choosing Chrome for the default browser or Google Maps for the default mapping app. - Improved Continuity - For those of us with multiple devices, Apple's Continuity features that let tasks be transferred from one device to another are super useful. Improvements to make existing Continuity features more reliable would be nice, as would support for ongoing media -- the ability to transfer a call in progress, or a movie that's playing. Another thoughtful Continuity suggestion involves the Mac and native support for using the iPad as a secondary Mac display, functionality that's currently enabled through third-party apps like Duet Display. Apple could also potentially add support for connecting an iPad to a Mac to enable drawing features, allowing it to serve as a substitute for a Wacom tablet. That's another third-party feature that's already available through apps like Astropad. - Multi-user support - Support for multiple users on the iPad has been a long-desired feature, but Apple has thus far declined to implement it outside of a classroom setting. - Touch ID for locking apps - Third-party developers can use Touch ID as a second layer of security for locking iOS apps, but some users would like to see this feature expanded to encompass all apps. The option to lock apps like Photos with Touch ID would prevent them from being accessed without a fingerprint or a password even if someone bypassed an iPhone passcode. What features are you hoping to see in iOS 11? Join in on the discussion about the update on the MacRumors forums. Apple will unveil iOS 11 on June 5, the day of its WWDC keynote event. The update will be provided to developers immediately, while Public Beta testers can expect access later this summer. iOS 11 will be officially released this fall alongside new iPhones.

Tech Industry by Patrick Holland May 25, 2017 12:20 PM PDT Lauren Kern is leaving New York Magazine for Apple News. LinkedIn On June 2, 2017, Lauren Kern will be joining Apple as the editor-in-chief of Apple News, the company announced today. Apple released Apple News as a mobile app and news aggregator in September 2015 as part of iOS 9. Since that time, the service has become a wildly popular feature for iOS users. The addition of Kern is an exciting move, especially in light of the criticism of Facebook received for its "trending topics" section. Kern is currently the executive editor of New York Magazine, a role she's held since 2014. Apple confirmed the hire but declined to share any other details.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « IDC's Five Year Forecast See's Notebooks and Detachables as Growth Areas, Desktops and Tablets in Steady Decline | Main May 25, 2017 TSMC Executive Says they're testing 7nm Chips for 12 Top Customers & will Ramp up Production in H2 2018   Last September Patently Apple posted a report titled "TSMC is Confident in their Superior 7nm Chips Being Ready for the 2018 iPhone." TSMC's CEO Mark Liu stated at their second quarter performance presentation in 2016 that he believed that their "7-nano chips are superior than Samsung Electronics' chips in PPA index that indicates Power, Performance, and Area. We are going to start on tape-out on 7-nano chips in first quarter of next year and start mass-producing in early 2018."   Today we got an update to TSMC's schedule and they're very close to their original prediction. The Nikkei is reporting that TSMC is currently "testing cutting-edge 7-nanometer chips for 12 customers, and the company will start to make the product in large quantities in the first half of 2018."   With Apple being TSMC's number one customer, it's likely that Apple will be able to secure 7nm processors in sufficient quantity for their 2018 iPhone.   TSMC'S Co-Chief Executive C. C. Wei stated at a company symposium today that TSMC is well-prepared to face intensifying competition from Samsung Electronics. "We will always be the most trusted technology and capacity provider for customers for many years to come," said Wei.   Wei further noted that his company spent more than $2.2 billion in 2016, or more than 7.4% of TSMC's annual revenue last year, and more than 5,400 engineers were committed to research and development.   The two companies have long been jostling for market share, and TSMC appears to have the upper hand for now. Apple will adopt TSMC's 10-nanometer chips for iPhone's upcoming 10th anniversary range.   Separately, TSMC Asia-Pacific Senior Director Tsai Chih-chun stated that Chinese smartphone brands could slow down significantly this year and may be difficult to reach the 10% growth in shipments this year as new iPhones will squeeze demand for other handsets.   Tsai further added that "iPhone changes such as cancellation of the home button and the increase of screen ratio in the flagship handset coming out in the second half of 2017 are features Chinese companies may be eager to replicate.   Nobunaga Chai, an analyst at the research unit of Taipei-based electronics publication Digitimes noted that because "Samsung designs many chips for its own use, and makes its own end products, it could somehow compete with the clients that it wants to pursue such as Apple. It is doubtful whether Samsung could convince its potential competitors to hand over their design blueprints."

They recognized that that person was Lauren, and of course we know they are right.” The Apple News app pulls news stories from partners including BuzzFeed, CNN, The New York Times and more while featuring a front page personalized to each user’s interests.

Apple’s WWDC 2017 opening keynote, which Apple will live stream, will be the first major event the company has held since last fall after foregoing a spring event this year. Sony A6500 Apple first announced WWDC 2017, which is being held in San Jose rather than San Francisco this year, earlier than usual back in February. The early announcement has helped attendees adjust plans while a variety of community events have followed WWDC from San Francisco to San Jose this year. While the venue may be changing, Apple officially confirmed that its major keynote will still be held at 10 am PT on the first Monday of the keynote. 9to5Mac will be covering all the announcements out of the keynote and WWDC 2017 so stay tuned for all the news and analysis. Apple has also added its usual calendar reminder to www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2017/ which adds Apple Special Event to your calendar with a 15 minute alert. The event entry includes this teaser: “Join us for the WWDC keynote presentation and watch every moment live.” WWDC has strictly been a software event in recent years, but this year Apple is expected to introduce new hardware on stage as well. Alongside iOS 11, macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and tvOS 11, Apple is expected to possibly unveil new MacBooks and MacBook Pros, the first-ever 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and the first Siri Speaker which is expected to be an Amazon Echo competitor.

Trudeau Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reddit LinkedIn Email Please enable Javascript to watch this video HOUSTON — Knowing how to code can be the difference between a great idea for an app— and a million-dollar app idea! That’s why Apple and Houston Community College are teaming up to help Houston students get a crash course in Apple's iOS coding language, “Swift.” “[It is] a one year course developed by the software engineers at Apple in conjunction with great schools including, and first and foremost, today, HCC,” Vice President Lisa Jackson at Apple said. A decade ago, the app store didn't even exist. Now, Apple estimates they've created a 1.5 million jobs through the app economy. Those are jobs Houston wants! That's why HCC is in the very first group of community colleges teaching Apple's new curriculum. Learning a coding language may seem intimidating, but Swift was designed to be intuitive. “It comes to you very naturally, and yet it's powerful enough to be able to run the most, you know apps you know everyday, like Airbnb runs in Swift code,” Jackson said. The classes for college credit hours will be available in a two-semester course. Students can register now for the West Loop, Central and Alief campuses. The program is one more step in making Houston the innovative technology capital of Texas.

Live Watch With new iPhone in the works, Apple shares headed toward $200 By DAVE GILREATH May 25, 2017, 2:25 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayJohn Taggart/Bloomberg via Getty Images WATCH Apple suffers an unexpected decline in iPhone sales 0 Shares Email In the 1994 movie “Forrest Gump,” the hapless hero learns that his friend Lt. Dan unwittingly invested their Bubba Gump fortune in shares of Apple, making them both very wealthy men. Though Apple stock has long been more reliable than an undistinguished box of chocolates, it was up and down as recently as a year ago. The price per share hit a peak of $134 in the summer of 2015, and was down to $90 in the summer of 2016. Apple was trading in the $150s this week, having been on a tear all year. Shares of the world’s largest company, now collectively worth more than $800 billion, are up about 32 percent this year. There is no company anywhere near the size of Apple that has done that well. By contrast, Amazon and Google are up 28 percent and 21 percent this year, respectively. Historically, Apple’s price/earnings ratio has averaged about 20 times earnings (it’s currently at 18 times). Using 20 times earnings as a price target, the stock could hit $200 per share in a year. Analysts’ projections are sanguine. The average rating of the 46 analysts covering Apple is a buy and for 35 of them, a strong buy. About half of Apple analysts have increased their earnings for this year and next. The strong growth is mainly because of the success of the iPhone 7, the most popular smartphone on the planet. Apple sold 21.5 million iPhone 7 units in the first quarter of this year, capturing a global market share of 6 percent. That percentage may not sound like a lot, but it actually is, considering the plethora of phones available, especially in China, the world’s largest market, where less expensive models dominate. With the 7 model taking the more affluent parts of the world by storm, all eyes are on the next iPhone iteration (presumably the iPhone 8), expected to be released in the fall. Sure, Apple gets points for general sexiness (people still talk about the possible viability of Apple TV and the company is getting in on the self-driving car mania), but the relevant news driving the company’s fortunes is all about the phones. Some analysts are so optimistic about the iPhone 8’s success that they talk about the company’s value potentially ascending in the next 12 or 18 months to the $1 trillion mark. Why are they so confident that the new model will succeed? The reasons include: • Customer loyalty. About 92 percent of buyers of the new phone are expected to be repeat customers, based on projections from historical buying patterns. • Success thus far in the Indian market, where smartphones are an aspirational product for most (priced at roughly half of the average resident’s annual salary) and a new status symbol for the affluent. Apple is well positioned on the subcontinent amid competition for high-end consumers, and is taking market share from Samsung there. Samsung took 23 percent of this market last month, but Apple eclipsed this with 66 percent. The company has plans to open Apple stores there. • Increased domestic consumer confidence and wage confidence, which means Americans might be more disposed to upgrade their 4s and 5s to the new model than they would have been a year or two ago. • Apple's cash reserve ($250 billion) means the company can spend whatever it needs to remain competitive and still have plenty to buy back shares to massage earnings. (Counterbalancing this is the reality that about $230 billion of this cash hoard is languishing overseas, awaiting a congressionally signaled repatriation holiday for taxes before it comes home. Even kind tax treatment by Congress would lower earnings a bit.) What could go wrong after the next phone’s roll-out? Well, given the reliability of repeat business, going “wrong” for Apple is a highly relative term. But if the sales aren’t gangbusters, it would be because loyal customers may not have the upgrade fervor they once did — in part because the power difference from one model to the next isn’t as great as it once was. Or, Apple’s buoyant boat could go down with others in a subsiding tide if there’s a market pullback, which hasn’t occurred since early 2016. But the company is performing so well that it could sustain a 20-point event and still be in a technical uptrend. And regardless, for companies with good forward prospects, market pullbacks usually just signal buying opportunities. A really ripping roll-out of the new phone would depend to some extent on enticing enough Samsung users to change brands. Samsung phones’ pesky problem of batteries catching fire has naturally hurt the company and helped Apple competitively. And even if Samsung has sufficiently rehabilitated its brand, anticipated sexy new features of the iPhone 8 (including anticipated display technology known as OLED) may be hard for some Samsung users to resist. However, the price may be resistible. Some analysts are predicting a price point of around $1,000 for the new model, which could test the allegiance of all but the best-heeled iPhone cult followers—the kind who fawn in web postings about the allure of new features. Of course, to the extent that the cult Apple loyalists—and more level-headed aficionados—must have the new iPhone, the breathless price point may just mean more cash for Apple, as its phones deliver a far higher profit margin than its competitors’. Overall, barring a disastrous new-model roll-out, the ascendancy of Apple stock will likely continue. Of course, that doesn’t mean the company will necessarily remain a good investment, particularly if the share price rises too high relative to earnings and growth prospect begin to dim. But Apple’s investment profile seems bright now, and optimistic projections for the next 12 or 18 months seem justified—unless publicity about them (including this article) drives the price so high that the stock becomes radioactive to institutional investors wary about GARP (growth at a reasonable price). If that happens, there could be lots of selling, shorting and resulting volatility—and Apple could return to the organic mortal state it was in a year ago. No company has a guaranteed future. This is, after all, the stock market. Disclosure: Neither Dave Sheaff Gilreath nor members of his family own shares of Apple or Samsung.

Let’s take a look at Apple Watch security and how to protect the sensitive data stored within.

Here's how to begin. Read More , contact information, and app data too. If your Apple Watch disappears, it could easily become a big problem. Using Passcode Lock The easiest way to protect any Apple Watch is with a passcode lock. If you use the watch for Apple Pay, Apple requires a passcode. When setting up a new watch, you have the option of selecting a lock code. If you don’t do that during setup, just head to the companion Watch iPhone app and select My Watch > Passcode. You can either enter a simple four-digit code or a more complicated version with anywhere from 5–10 digits. It can, and probably should be, different from other passcodes on your iPhone or iPad. Fortunately, unlike passcode lock on an iOS device, you won’t have to enter the code every time when using the device The code only has to be entered after restarting an Apple Watch or when you take it off and put it back on. So if you wear the watch all day, you’ll only need to enter a passcode once in the morning after putting it on.Sensors within the device determine whether it’s currently being worn or has been taken off. Another nice feature that you can enable in the same menu is Unlock with iPhone. When the setting is active, unlocking the iPhone will automatically unlock the Apple Watch as well, provided you’re actually wearing the device. This Watch Will Self-Destruct… If someone finds an Apple Watch and tries to guess the correct passcode, there are fail-safes as well. After the incorrect passcode is entered six times, an automatic one-minute delay will be required before trying again. Once an incorrect code is entered 10 times, two different actions can occur depending on the chosen setting. If Erase Data is enabled in the Passcode menu, 10 incorrect passcode entries will automatically and completely erase the watch. Not exactly Mission: Impossible, but definitely a big deterrent to any would-be bad guy. On the other hand, if you’re forgetful and don’t have a backup of the Apple Watch, this can be a real inconvenience, You should think about using a password manager to store your codes How Password Managers Keep Your Passwords Safe How Password Managers Keep Your Passwords Safe Passwords that are hard to crack are also hard to remember. Want to be safe? You need a password manager. Here's how they work and how they keep you safe. Read More  after turning this setting on. Without that setting enabled, there is a bit of hope if the rightful owners happen to forget the passcode. They can completely erase the Apple Watch and re-pair with an iPhone. Erase the watch by heading to General > Reset >Erase Apple Watch Content and Settings in the Watch app. Activation Lock The most effective security feature any Apple Watch user needs to enable is Activation Lock. It’s a simple yet effective way to make any lost or stolen watch completely useless. Just to note, your Apple Watch will need watchOS 2 or later installed to take advantage of the security feature. With the feature active, anyone who finds or steals an Apple Watch will have to provide the associated Apple ID and password before it can be erased and used with a new iPhone. It also kicks in when someone attempts to unpair your watch from an iPhone or disabling the location feature. So unless a thief is psychic and can magically pull your Apple ID and password out of thin air, all they’ll have is a worthless piece of junk that they can wear on their wrist. The good news is that if you’ve already setup Find My iPhone, Activation Lock is active and running for the watch. You can double check by opening up the Watch app on the iPhone. Select the My Watch tab and the choose your watch’s name on the screen. After hitting the “i” icon look for Find My Apple Watch. If you see that, the feature is active. Thankfully, Activation Lock doesn’t need any kind of internet connection and protects the watch and its data anywhere. Most Apple devices feature the same protection now, provided the Find My iPhone (or iPad, or iPod, or Mac) feature is active. Tracking It Down If your Apple Watch does happen to vanish, there are additional layers of protection in the free Find My iPhone app above and beyond Activation Lock. Most importantly, you can view a map that will show the last known approximate location of the device, using the last known trusted Wi-Fi connection. You can do that by using the Find My iPhone app How To Use Find My iPhone To Get Your Stolen iPhone Back How To Use Find My iPhone To Get Your Stolen iPhone Back Long story short: my wife had her iPhone stolen when she misplaced it at work the other day. I was able to log into her iCloud account and eventually get the device back. Read More or even going to the Find iPhone tab on iCloud.com. Launch the app and enter the correct Apple ID and password. Click on the watch’s name to hopefully view it on the map. If you don’t see a map, that means the watch can’t access an iPhone or Wi-Fi network. If you can locate an Apple Watch on a map, and the watch is nearby, hit the Play Sound button. As the name suggests, it will automatically play a loud noise. That should make the device easier to find if it is stuck under a couch cushion or some other out of the way location. Lost Mode is another option you can select using the Find My iPhone app or website. Along with providing a phone number, you can write a short customized message that will appear on the watch’s screen. Use this to leave a phone number or email address that any good samaritans can use to contact you. You may also consider a reward if the watch is engraved or particularly sentimental. The final step, when you’re sure you aren’t getting your watch back, is to Erase Watch. That will remotely erase all information stored on the watch. Activation Lock persists however, so anyone who finds or attempts to use the watch is out of luck. Even though all of those features can hopefully help track down your Apple Watch, there is a substantial limitation. The device has no way to connect to any cell networks and its Wi-Fi feature is only available on networks that have previously been accessed. Final Thoughts As the Apple Watch has become more popular and added more features, Apple has been proactive to add additional layers of security to protect the device and its information. While nothing is perfect, Activation Lock, Passcode Lock, and Find My iPhone provide a combination of nice security features for any watch wearer.

Lauren Kern will leave her role as executive editor of New York Magazine on June 2nd for the Cupertino-based company, New York Magazine Editor-in-Chief Adam Moss announced on Wednesday in a staff memo obtained by CNN. "I am not happy to report that we are losing our beloved Lauren Kern to the Apple corporation," Moss wrote. "I mean, I'm happy for Lauren certainly. It's an exciting opportunity to be the editor in chief of Apple News, to bring a journalistic vigor and intelligence to an operation that has always seemed to me so full of promise." The news was first reported on Thursday morning by Politico. An Apple spokesperson confirmed the news to CNN, but declined to offer further details on what Kern's role will entail and whether the job will based in the company's California headquarters. Apple News is a mobile news aggregation app which launched in the summer of 2015. The app draws in stories from various news partners and personalizes the front page to fit the user's interests. Apple News' partners include CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and others. "Apple has the audience -- all they needed was a superior editorial intelligence to guide it," Moss wrote in his memo. "They recognized that that person was Lauren, and of course we know they are right." Moss praised Kern for the work she has done at New York Magazine, which he said "has been so critical" to its success. "She provided excellent council to me on all sorts of editorial matters, and she was just beginning a new adventure seeding ambitious feature projects across our verticals," he wrote. "There isn't much she can't do. Apple is lucky to have her." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: ifanr Why the iPhone 8’s $1,000 price tag won’t impact sales one bit Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 25th, 2017 at 1:54 PM Share Tweet Over the past few weeks, we’ve been inundated with somewhat conflicting information regarding how much the iPhone 8 is going to cost. While some analysts anticipate that Apple’s next-gen iPhone will cost somewhere in the $870 to $1070 range, other analysts maintain that the entry-level 128GB iPhone 8 will retail for $1,000, with a more storage-friendly 256GB model set to retail for $1,099. As a point of reference, the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus currently sells for $869. No matter how Apple opts to price the iPhone 8, it’s a safe bet that the device will easily be the most expensive iPhone Apple has ever released. In turn, there has been some chatter that Apple may be doing itself a disservice if it prices the iPhone 8 too high. The reality, though, is that consumers will clamor for the iPhone 8 no matter how expensive it is, even if the entry-level model does ultimately fall in the $1,000 range. Don't Miss: T-Mobile is about to make its most exciting new service free for all subscribers At a base level, Apple’s entire history is predicated on selling premium products at a premium price. While there are exceptions here and there, it’s no secret that most Apple products are pricier than rival devices. To that end, Apple and iPhone users are already well-acquainted with the idea that enjoying Apple’s most advanced technologies and next-gen features isn’t an investment that comes cheap. Additionally, the surprising success of the iPhone 7 Plus underscores that iPhone buyers have no problem spending a little bit more to enjoy exclusive features. With the iPhone 7 Plus offering users an advanced dual-lens camera, not to mention incredible battery life, users flocked to the iPhone 7 Plus in droves. In fact, the popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus even surprised Apple executives and forced the company to tweak its production to account for this dynamic. Even in China, where iPhone sales were down overall, iPhone 7 Plus sales did surprisingly well. During Apple’s most recent earnings conference call, Tim Cook relayed that demand for the iPhone 7 Plus was strong while demand for other models came in weaker than expected. All in all, a $1,000 price tag on a brand new iPhone might reasonably cause some users to take a step back, but the slew of new features the iPhone 8 will bring to the table will undoubtedly compel many longtime iPhone owners to upgrade. Remember, the iPhone form factor hasn’t changed much at all since Apple rolled out its iPhone 6 lineup in 2014. Consequently, many iPhone owners have been hoping for a fresh new form factor for years. What’s more, the cumulative number of iPhone users  is larger today than it’s ever been, which is to say that the pool of users in the market for an upgrade will be at an all-time high once the iPhone 8 is released.

The event took place at the Houston Public Library’s Julia Ideson Building in Downtown Houston on May 24, 2017. Main speakers included HCC Chancellor Cesar Maldonado, Apple’s Vice President of Environment and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson, Houston’s Mayor Sylvester Turner and Bob Harvey, President and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership. Madeline Burillo-Hopkins, President, HCC Southwest College has been instrumental in the development of this curriculum for app development and coding. Eva Laredo, Chair, Houston Community College Board of Trustees, started the event by welcoming the attendees. She thanked Apple for providing this historic opportunity for Houston’s students. In his opening remarks, HCC Chancellor Cesar Maldonado said that this fulfills one of the 4 pillars of the HCC strategic plan, innovation. Industries today are dependent on coding. This supports the growth of the entrepreneurial culture in the city of Houston. HCC plans to integrate this course into their full degree programs in the Fall of 2017. “Apple’s products and operations define innovation. This collaboration creates another pathway for student success, the ultimate experience at Houston community college.” Coding helps students with critical thinking and problem solving skill sets, he added. This course will help provide certified developers to companies who depend on coding and software abilities to run their business. Caleb Hicks, Apple, explains the coding steps in developing an app to Madeline Burillo-Hopkins, President, HCC Southwest College. (Photo by Jacob David) Lisa Jackson, Apple’s Vice President of Environment and Social Initiatives, said she was thrilled to be able to empower the next generation of app developers and coders coming from the Houston Community College system. “Diversity is a huge part of what makes Apple great, In 2008 there was no such thing as an app, it just didn’t exist ten years ago.” Apple hires a lot of bright students who are creative, ingenuous and intelligent. Swift Playgrounds, a new curriculum started by Apple engages students in coding basics as early as Kindergarten. Apple has created 2 million jobs in the United States. 1.5 million are app related jobs. This historic tie up with HCC is an economic investment into the long term development of the Houston jobs economy, she said. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner welcomed Apple’s Lisa Jackson to Houston. He thanked all of the staff affiliated with Apple and Houston Community College System for bringing investment and innovation to the city of Houston. This enhances learning opportunities in the most diverse city in the United States America. The world calls Houston a knowledge capital, because of the incredible mix of ideas and innovation. Houston ranks in the top 15 cities among I.T jobs. The mayor affirmed that there is an incredible need for coders and software developers. This new curriculum would give students the ability to learn and get high paying jobs in relevant fields of technology and the digital world. Houston will be one of the most aggressive cities in the deployment of innovative technologies, he added. “We look forward to creating the city of tomorrow by starting today” he said. Bob Harvey, President and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership, thanked Apple for creating opportunities and initiatives for Houstonians in the workforce development effort. “Success does not require a four year degree, but it requires skills, credentials, in areas where the market needs capabilities, such as in the fields of digital systems and technology.” Innovation is increasingly on digital platforms and this will open opportunities to develop not only consumer related apps but also industrial apps. This collaboration between Apple and Houston Community College Systems is set to create fast pathways to digital jobs that pay well in the city of Houston.

That way, publishers can build first in Instant Articles and then push near-identical versions of their content to other platforms. This might help cut down on news organizations’ distribution costs, but it’s also a big deal for the tech industry’s platform wars. Because this announcement doubles as a tacit admission from Facebook that its Instant Articles format is not as popular as other forms of platform publishing, as well as a move to undermine the success of Google AMP and Apple News by incentivizing publishers to create one version of a thing and push it out everywhere. If Facebook can ensure that everyone publishes equally to all platforms, it won’t have to worry about Google or Apple gaining an edge. Tech companies are competing to control the future of web publishing “The SDK already enables developers to easily integrate publishing Instant Articles into their content management systems. By supporting a gateway to generate content across platforms, we’re also making it easy for publishers to apply some of the custom styling templates in AMP and Apple News that they have created in the Instant Articles Style Editor,” explains Facebook’s Piyush Mangalick, a partner engineering director, in a blog post. “For example the custom formats, like fonts, colors and captions, that publishers have designed in the Style Editor, will be closely mirrored in the other formats.” In other words: if you build once on Instant Articles, you won’t have to worry about stylizing the article for AMP or Apple News. Facebook’s SDK will take care of all the heavy lifting. “This new flexibility with Instant Articles is part of our commitment to open standards of collaboration with the community,” writes Mangalick. “Our goal is to give publishers control over extending and modifying the Instant Articles building blocks to be the best storytellers on every platform.” Of course, that’s not the only goal Facebook has. Like so many aspects of the media business over the last three decades, the future of web publishing is currently being decided not by journalism organizations, but by the platform-owning tech companies that collect and distribute the world’s information. More recently, this has manifested itself in a standards battle currently being waged by Facebook, Google, and Apple, all of which own a proprietary format that transforms articles into clean, readable formats on mobile. Related Facebook's Instant Articles promised to transform journalism — but now big publishers are fleeing Facebook’s Instant Articles, launched back in 2015, has struggled to grow, while Google’s AMP format has engulfed huge swaths of the mobile web. Apple News, meanwhile, takes advantage of its high-priority placement on iOS devices as a native app to push the iPhone maker’s own walled-garden approach to news delivery. For Facebook, this is mostly an issue of the ever-constant identity crisis pulling it between its dominant social network and platform roots and the ways in which it continues to resemble a modern media empire. Some publishers have fled Instant Articles mostly because of Facebook’s own inability to help those organizations grow audiences and make money, both goals that happen to be at ends with Facebook’s constant News Feed tweaking and prioritization of video over text. This is also a debate about the very nature of the open web While the ramifications for news organizations are monumental, this is also a ontological debate about the very nature and future of the web. Google, which makes a vast majority of its revenue through web advertising, wants people to continue using its search engine. So it’s continued making the Chrome and search experience more reader-friendly with AMP. Facebook would very much like people to consider its app a modern-day gateway to the rest of the internet, a destination for consuming anything and everything you would otherwise have to seek out on the mobile web. And Apple doesn’t care about the future of the web so much as it’s interested in making the iOS the best way to do anything on a smartphone, news reading included. All of this means controlling the flow of content, a huge chunk of which is article links to news websites. So the question now is whether Facebook’s changes will make publishers come back to its platform, even as it strikes deals with media companies to produce original video that it will likely prioritize over the Instant Article links of third-party news publishers. As it stands, Facebook’s only option now is to hope publishers are so wary of any one tech platform that they publish to all of them simultaneously. While that’s not necessarily great for building a healthy relationship with the journalism business, it does keep Instant Articles from completely ceding ground to competitors.

According to the social networking giant, an updated Instant Articles SDK, now available on GitHub, allows publishers to build content publishable as Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages. Support for Apple News articles is coming soon, says Facebook. Politico reported today that Apple has created a new Editor-in-Chief position on Apple News. The Cupertino giant hired Lauren Kern, former Executive Editor at New York Magazine, for the newly created position. Facebook’s updated SDK removes a time and resource-consuming step in publishing on multiple platforms by having the markup publishers use to create Instant Articles automatically generate the code needed to build these other formats. For instance, any custom formats—things like fonts, colors and captions—that publishers have designed in the Style Editor will now be “closely mirrored” in the other formats. The company wrote: Media executives told us about the challenge they face using multiple platforms to share their stories–more distribution formats create more content management costs. Developers who attended our Journalism Project Hackathons in New York and London also asked for a way Instant Articles could support other major publishing formats. Instant Articles debuted as an iPhone exclusive in May 2015. Rival Google launched Accelerated Mobile Pages in October the same year. Both features aim to make news articles from participating publishers load in a fraction of a second on mobile devices than their non-optimized versions. Both Google and Facebook want to speed up webpage loading times, especially for users in emerging markets and those on unreliable or slow Internet connections. The faster the page loads, the more likely the user is to actually read the article. And the more news articles users consume on any given day, the more ads they’ll see. Instant Articles have been criticized for being confined to Facebook’s wall garden and their ad system. As for Accelerated Mobile Pages, Google is giving them preferential treatment in search results, but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. While these pages do load significantly faster versus the regular mobile pages, all Accelerated Mobile Pages implement Google’s own scrolling behavior that feels weird on iOS while making it harder than necessary to visit the original article. Accelerated pages have their own unique URLs. To visit the original article, you must first tap the hyperlink icon at the top of the page to reveal the original URL, then tap the URL to visit the original page on the publisher’s website. The worst thing about Google’s accelerated pages is the fat that they don’t let you use Safari’s clutter-free Reader Mode or the Find in Page feature, available from the Share menu.

Today, more than a month after Earth Day took place, it shared another Earth Day video on YouTube, titled “Does my iPhone believe in incarnation?” and featuring its recycling robot Liam. The clip was created to celebrate Apple’s attendance at Sustainable Brands 2017, a Detroit conference where Sarah Chandler, Apple’s Director of Operations and Environmental Initiatives, discussed Apple’s plan to reduce the environmental impact of its supply chain. “Lisa Jackson, Apple’s lead on Environment work, and our recycling robot Liam will make you believe,” reads the video’s description. “Lisa and her team explain it all, while Liam disassembles your iPhone 6 so those parts can find new life.” Bt taking apart used products, Apple is able to recycle rare earth materials and other valuable metals and send them back to its supply chain for further processing to be eventually reused in the production of components for new products. According to the video, L.I.A.M. stands for “Liberate. iPhone. Auto-Disassembly. Machine” Question: why does the video briefly show Tim Cook holding a bunny?

The Reformed Broker Home About Invest with Josh Josh in the News! Public Speaking Books Mix Tape Contact American Gods Posted May 16, 2017 by Joshua M Brown You have questions… You’re wondering how it could be possible that the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average could be climbing to record highs day after day, given, well, everything. How is it that stocks can break through to new heights while the country at large seemingly sinks to new depths? And about those new depths… What happened to the instruments of American Exceptionalism? Are they dead? Did we kill them? If we did, the murder weapon was disbelief. And in the place of the pillars that once upheld everything we held dear, we’re putting our trust and faith in something else…something that seems invincible right now: Technology. Systems. Data. Innovation. As our belief in the old thing dies, our belief in the new thing grows ever stronger. *** 1100’s – a Viking ship makes landfall in the New World, carrying Scandinavians and, with them, the one-eyed god, Woden. They’ve brought him to North America, hundreds of years before there even is such a place on any map. 1600’s – a slave ship traverses the Atlantic with a cargo hold full of Africans. And hitching a ride with them, their mischievous spider-god, Anansi. 1800’s – Eastern Europeans begin settling in Chicago. Poles and Russians, Czechs and Bulgarians. They bring their ancient Slavic “black god”, Czernobog, with them. 1900’s – a young girl arrives at Ellis Island with a stowaway in tow – “Mad Sweeney” Suibhne, a sort of cursed leprechaun who roamed the Irish countryside for hundreds of years. It’s a New World but the people carried their totems and tokens along as they came. But something happens over the ensuing decades and centuries. These deities from the Old World begin to lose their hold over the émigrés they came here with. Their influence fades as new gods – American Gods – hold sway over ensuing generations: Radio, television, the automobile, the airplane, electricity itself, the telephone, the assembly line, the Internet. These are the new deities. The Old Gods lose their place as modernity answers more and more of the questions and prayers of the people, and fills more of their lives. “The TV’s the altar. I’m what people are sacrificing to.’ ‘What do they sacrifice?’ asked Shadow. ‘Their time, mostly,’ said Lucy. ‘Sometimes each other.” This is the plot of Neil Gaiman’s 2001 novel, American Gods. His story is playing out in the real world today. *** The country feels like it’s being torn apart. A half hour of cable news delivers enough psychic trauma for a whole year. The newspapers are talking of nothing but treason, espionage, investigations, protests. Video clips of town hall meetings flood the Internet, little shoebox dioramas of unbridled rage. Creatures who haven’t braved the light of day in decades are crawling out from under their rocks – unapologetic male chauvinists, racists and bigots, defenders of the Confederacy, white supremacists, apologists for dictators, fascists – the type of monsters who used to dwell only in the darkest places, at the fringes of society, are now inking book deals and collecting likes on their Facebook pages. Out in the open. There’s an advisor in the White House who once publicly professed his desire to wreck our society. “I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment.” The person who said this, less than five years ago, now is the establishment. Let that sink in, if it hasn’t already. All of the things we once held sacred are being chipped away at and destroyed. Sometimes purposefully and sometimes just out of spite or for fun. The Republican Senator from Nebraska, Ben Sasse, told Face the Nation this weekend that “The U.S. is in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust…And we need to talk honestly about our institutions that need to be restored and need to have the ability for people in five and eight and ten years to trust these institutions.” These institutions he is referring to – that were once thought of as non-partisan and trusted equally by men and women, Democrats and Republicans, young and old – are becoming more politicized and mistrusted by the day. The FBI, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Electoral College, the mainstream news media, Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Reserve, the intelligence community, the Judicial branch, the office of the President, the White House Press Corps, the Department of Defense, the US Constitution. These Older Gods, once venerated, are now fading in influence, in confidence and in the public trust. We no longer take a single word any of these organizations say at face value; we’re questioning their motives and communiqués before they’re even finished speaking. Fingers pointing from every direction. *** Our faith in the conventions of American government and these institutions isn’t just fading away. As in the Gaiman story, it is being transferred. We still have faith, that part of human nature doesn’t go away. “People believe, thought Shadow. It’s what people do. They believe, and then they do not take responsibility for their beliefs; they conjure things, and do not trust the conjuration. People populate the darkness; with ghosts, with gods, with electrons, with tales. People imagine, and people believe; and it is that rock solid belief, that makes things happen.” Our new beliefs are making one thing happen, relentlessly – we’ve selected a new Pantheon. We have more faith in their ability, their capacity to learn and improve, their adaptability, than we have in the President or in Congress or in the courts. Here are a handful of the very large stocks making new 52-week (and, in many cases, all-time) highs right now:   These are not brand new companies, and in many cases they are not selling a brand new product. Rather, they are institutions that have earned the trust and devotion of millions of customers, shareholders, employees and managers. We believe in their products and services, we have faith in their durability, their competitive advantages, their vision of what the future looks like and how they’ll fit into it. En masse, we have decided that, come what may in Washington, these are the entities that will find a way to thrive. They will not merely survive the future, they will be responsible for shaping it. There’s an element of blind faith at work here, and of self-fulfilling prophecy. Because the larger these stocks become, the larger their weight in the index funds that investors have taken to deifying. Vanguard is a Mecca for money, and as it draws in more adherents, by extension the market caps of these companies draw in more invested dollars. *** There’s a man out in the desert who is preaching. He is telling fabulous tales and winning new converts to his cult every day. He has his detractors, sure, but with every successive miracle he pulls off, his apotheosis grows in the imagination of the flock. Their faith becomes unshakeable with every new all-time high in his church’s share price. When outsiders dare to ask questions of a more terrestrial nature, about boring things like cash flows and valuation, he dazzles his believers with spectacles – a battery powered car that can drive and park itself, a factory staffed entirely by automatons, a solar powered roof of magical shingles, a rocket that he launches into the heavens and then lands on a platform as though it were merely a helicopter. And, when he’s done performing these feats, well, who the fuck wants to talk about accounting? *** In October 2011, Saint Steve died, but he left behind the plans for what would someday be his final masterwork – a circular corporate headquarters, 12.8 million square feet in total, designed to hold 12,000 of Apple’s very luckiest corporate employees. It is nearing completion and is the closest thing to Mount Olympus or Asgard ever constructed on planet earth. It may not be floating in the clouds, but it certainly appears to be levitating above the scrub hills of Cupertino from virtually any angle it can be viewed from. All that’s missing is the rainbow bridge to connect this new temple of innovation and shrine to technological dominance to the real world. The stories about the quarrying of “just the right stone” and the assembly of custom-created glass and metal material are so absurd that they defy even mythological comparison. Apple is the first publicly traded company in history to be worth in excess of $800 billion. Some context about how large this number is: 1) By itself, Apple’s market capitalization exceeds the combined market values of the 102 smallest companies on the S&P 500, according to FactSet. 2) Apple’s market cap is more than 220 times larger than Ryder System, Inc., a transportation logistics company that is currently the smallest member in the S&P 500 with a market cap of $3.6 billion. 3) Apple’s market cap is more the 2015 gross domestic products of 183 out of the 199 countries tracked by the World Bank. It’s approximately the same size as the combined GDPs of Iran and Austria. Don’t tell me we stopped believing. Apple has sold over a billion iPhones and the iOS user base is now rivaling all of the world’s major religions, combined. Poor comparison, you say? We check our iPhones 2600 times a day. If that’s not ritualistic devotion, I don’t know what is. *** The comical thing about the whole “Trump Rally” conceit is that while people have the effect right, they have the cause precisely backwards. Stocks are rallying because of how little faith we have in the government. The Mega Blue Chip Corporation is the new Sovereign. This applies in Europe and Japan just as neatly as it applies here at home – go ahead and look at their indices, this belief transference I describe is going global. Shareholders around the world are waking up to the idea that, despite the many and prominent failings of their respective governments, the universal “profit motive” has not let them down. Our new gods – our American Gods – are the only thing left worthy of our love and attention in the current moment. And the Saints who guide us – Dimon, Zuckerberg, Cook, Fink, Page, Bezos, Musk, Bogle – have shown themselves to be far more worthy of investor adulation than Congress or the White House. For the 20% of Americans who own 80% of America’s wealth, these companies are the objects of worship. The old objects of worship, and those who attend to them, have lost their power or their sanity. *** Sam Clay, the eponymous comic book creator protagonist in Michael Chabon’s 2000 novel, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, tells a story: “Guy lands on a planet. Exploring the galaxy. Mapping the far fringes… He finds a vast golden city. Like nothing he’s ever seen. And he’s seen it all. The beehive cities of Deneba. The lily-pad cities of Lyra. The people here are ten feet tall, beautiful golden humanoids. Let’s say they have big wings. They welcome Spaceman Jones. They show him around. But something is on their minds. They’re worried. They’re afraid. There’s one building, one immense palace he isn’t allowed to see. One night our guy wakes up in his nice big bed, the entire city is shaking. He hears this terrible bellowing, raging like some immense monstrous beast. Screams. Strange electric flashes. It’s all coming from the palace… The next day everybody acts like nothing happened. They tell him he must have been dreaming. Naturally our guy has to find out. He’s an explorer. It’s his job. So he sneaks into this one huge, deserted palace and looks around. In the highest tower, a mile above the planet, he comes upon a giant. Twenty feet tall, huge wings, golden like the others but with ragged hair, big long beard. In chains. Giant atomic chains… We’re in heaven, this planet… It’s God… God is a madman. He lost his mind, like, a billion years ago. Just before He, you know. Created the universe.” *** Let the Old Gods bellow and rage in the distance. There are likes to like and pages to page-view. Swipes to swipe. Items to be ordered and thought-leaders to be thought-followed. We’ve got our own temples, up in The Cloud, to be decorated with selfies and festooned with a million paeans to ourselves, our personal brands and our experiences. Our chauffeured chariots to be summoned, literally, on-demand. The app as finger-snap. People are favoriting us as we sleep. At least, they’d better be. Google is doing the work that priests and rabbis used to do. It has answers. Curious children are learning to consult with Alexa and Siri in kindergarten. And our New Gods have found a way to extract tribute from each and every one of these activities. We’re carrying their altars in our pockets.       Full Disclosure: Nothing on this site should ever be considered to be advice, research or an invitation to buy or sell any securities, please see my Terms & Conditions page for a full disclaimer.

Hanna HowardMay 25, 2017 1:24PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestCourtesy of Apple Instagram, Snapchat, Seamless, Facebook...those are just a few of the apps that have completely transformed our lives. And the act of developing those apps also changed the founders' lives — sometimes to the tune of millions of dollars. But when we think about the most successful app developers, a lot of them seem to fit a similar mold: white, male, and educated at prestigious universities. According to Apple, of the 2 million jobs they support across the 50 states, app development counts for 1.5 million (AKA a huge portion). That's why they want to make the ability to develop apps something that's not confined to startup offices and Harvard dorms. On Wednesday, Apple announced a new initiative in their endeavor to give everyone access to the ability to code and develop apps. Now in the iBooks store, you can get an entire one-year curriculum for learning to develop an app at any age, written by the experts at Apple for their coding language Swift (which you may know from the Swift Playgrounds app). And it won't only be available for you to self-teach the skills — which are available for free for people from kindergarten age through college — Apple has also partnered with six community college systems across the country that will be teaching the App Development With Swift curriculum in classes. The new program is an extension of the Everyone Can Code project that Apple is spearheading in order to bring the skills and code literacy necessary for the fast-growing app development job market to everyone, regardless of age, race, socioeconomic status, or gender. If you're looking to learn a new skill while staying close to home, Apple's new curriculum will be taught at Houston College System, Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Mesa Community College, and San Mateo Community College District — as well as high schools across the country starting this fall. “We’ve seen firsthand the impact that coding has on individuals and the US economy as a whole. The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we’re thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, in a statement. “Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love.” So if you've always dreamed of creating the next Snapchat (or an even more wildly successful app), now's your chance to learn how. Maybe we'll even see you at a future WWDC.

(Reuters/Rebecca Naden) Share Written by Anne Quito Obsession Design May 25, 2017 He’s the design genius behind the iMac, iPhone, iPod, iPad, and Apple’s new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, California, and he’s also been knighted by his native Britain. In the ultimate revenge move, Apple’s chief design officer Jony Ive today was appointed chancellor of London’s Royal College of Art (RCA), the school he once rejected attending. The five-year appointment makes Ive the ceremonial head of what’s widely considered as the top design school in the world. His duties include presiding over meetings of RCA’s advisory committee, attending faculty meetings and conferring degrees at graduation ceremonies. Ive will not leave his position at Apple. “I am thrilled to formalise my relationship with the RCA, given the profound influence the College has had on so many of the artists and designers that I admire,” the 50-year old industrial designer said in a press statement. “Our design team [at Apple] includes many RCA alumni, who embody the fundamental values of the College.” Ive was once critical of RCA’s learning atmosphere. He briefly considered pursuing a degree in car design at London’s 121-year old public university but found the vibe off-putting. “The classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew,” explained the notoriously introverted designer to TIME magazine in 2014. He attended Newcastle Polytechnic (now called Northumbria University) and graduated with honors. He also has honorary doctorates from his alma matter, the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, the Rhode Island School of Design and the RCA. Ivy was knighted into the Order of the British Empire for “services to design and enterprise” in 2012. Ive’s appointment comes as RCA has been re-orienting its design curricula towards STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics). RCA intends to introduce science-focused postgraduate courses and encourage research in computer technology, the impact of the digital economy, advanced manufacturing and intelligent mobility. Ive, whose minimalist aesthetic shaped Apple’s new headquarters, is expected to advise the college as it moves into a new campus in Battersea, in southeast London by 2020. RCA’s chancellorship was previously held by bagless vacuum cleaner magnate James Dyson, who is currently busy preparing for the opening of his own engineering university in September.

Facebook says it has heard from publishers that supporting multiple formats like Google AMP, Apple News, and Instant Articles can require a lot of upfront work. Facebook’s solution is adding a new export option for publishers to use when creating Instant Articles that works with Google AMP and Apple News. The updated SDK transforms the markup publishers use to create Instant Articles to generate the code needed to build these other formats, removing what we’ve heard can be a resource-heavy step in publishing on multiple platforms. With an easy way to get from one markup format to another, publishers can then plug-and-play the markup in their content management systems or third party publishing tools. Publishers will still need to put in the work to support Instant Articles, but Facebook is hoping that working with Google AMP and Apple News will push publishers to play ball. Google AMP support is live now, and Facebook says Apple News “will be ready in the coming weeks as we learn how these tools can best support our partners.” Publishers can read more about the Instant Articles SDK Extension here.

The hiring has since been confirmed by an Apple spokesperson. It's unclear what exactly the role will entail, but it suggests Apple has bigger ambitions of some kind for its News app on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Apple News is not a firsthand source of news, so Kern's role could be at least partially related to curation of other news sources. In February, Apple executive Eddy Cue said the company wants to "vet and make sure that the news providers" in Apple News are "legitimate," in an effort to cut down on "clickbait." Apple News gathers stories from several leading news sources and displays them all in one place. The app launched on iOS 9 in the United States, and it has since expanded to Australia and the United Kingdom. The app was redesigned for iOS 10 with a bolder, simpler interface that puts content front and center.

What could go wrong? :rolleyes: I'm not saying my way is the best way but I bounce around between all news sites from CNN, Independent, Fox News, and such. I also cut out all editorials and try to stick to just factual news articles. Lastly I try not to form an opinion on something until at least 3 days after a story breaks. This also allows the truth to surface over knee jerk emotional articles. Makes processing news in a digital age much safer.

With a lack of part leaks, we're relying on dummy units, design drawings, and design renders to give us an idea of what to expect from the device, and there's been no shortage of those leaks, many of which are somewhat confusing due to the fact that Apple tested several iPhone 8 prototypes. This week, the first hands-on video featuring an alleged iPhone 8 dummy model surfaced. We already saw the dummy model in question in photographs back in April, but the video provides a better look at the device, and perhaps a better picture of what the iPhone 8 might look like if accurate. This particular dummy device, said to be a CNC model, aligns with design drawings and rumors pointing towards an edge-to-edge display with a glass body encased in a shiny stainless steel frame. There is no Home button and no visible Touch ID sensor, suggesting it is built into the display, which would be in line with many rumors. It features a dual-lens rear camera in a vertical orientation and it lacks an Apple logo, so it's not entirely clear if this is representative of the final design Apple settled on, but it does match up with a lot of the rumors we've heard. Alleged iPhone 8 design drawings and schematics that resemble this dummy suggest the iPhone will be thicker than the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The dummy device in the video above represents one set of design drawings we've seen, but there's also a second set of design images that have circulated featuring an iPhone with an aluminum body and a rear Touch ID button underneath the Apple logo. The device with a rear Touch ID button is said to be one of the prototypes Apple tested as a fallback should an under-display Touch ID solution not pan out. Rumors and leaks seem to be coalescing around the first iPhone 8 design without a rear Touch ID sensor, suggesting the images with the back Touch ID button are based on an outdated design that was perhaps scrapped. That it appears unlikely this design will be used in the iPhone 8 hasn't stopped one China-based company from creating an iPhone 8 clone based on the schematics and design drawings that have been circulating. Leaker Benjamin Geskin this morning shared images of what he says is an iPhone 8 clone that was designed based on an early iPhone 8 prototype model. It features a front display with slim bezels, a vertical camera, an aluminum body in multiple colors, and a rear Touch ID sensor. As a clone, this is not representative of what the real iPhone 8 will look like, but it provides an interesting glimpse at prototype design and what an iPhone with a rear Touch ID sensor might resemble. With multiple prototypes in testing, the actual design of the iPhone 8 will remain unconfirmed and up in the air until we start to see legitimate part leaks. In past years, part leaks have started earlier than May, and their absence may suggest that Apple still has not settled on a finalized design. For a complete overview of the iPhone 8 rumors and a better picture of what we expect to see included in the overhauled device, make sure to check out our iPhone 8 roundup. It goes into much greater detail on the different design prototypes and it includes information on all of the internal features we expect, like advanced biometrics (facial or iris recognition), an A11 processor, wireless charging, a new front-facing camera system, and more.

Touch ID on the back, home button gone... I know many on here have lost faith in Apple, but I haven't. There are almost no sensible decisions that lead to such a design choice, but exactly these design choices are (some say were) at Apple's core. Hence I would love to just put this off as false for now. One can hope... Rating: 16 Votes rpe33 1 day ago at 01:04 pm Some of you commenters are so ridiculous.

Obviously I could be wrong, but I don't think I am. How would that even work as a home button? Pushing against the back with your index just wouldn't work. The thumb works because you're pushing the phone against your palm. Rating: 8 Votes Relentless Power 2 days ago at 12:27 pm It's really simple Apple, just make an iPhone4S with and TouchID.

Facebook rolls out software tool to make AMP, Apple News pages more like Instant Articles Facebook’s tool will automatically convert Instant Articles to Google’s AMP and Apple’s Apple News formats. Tim Peterson on May 25, 2017 at 1:42 pm More Ever since Facebook officially opened up Instant Articles to all websites last year, publishers, brands and other site owners have had to wrestle with how to make sure their sites’ regular pages could be converted to Facebook’s proprietary format, which becomes even more of a headache if those sites also support Google’s and Apple’s proprietary article formats. But now Facebook is making it easier for a site owner to manage all three formats — and making it more likely that, if sites use the tool, AMP pages and Apple News links will look more like Instant Articles. On Thursday, Facebook rolled out a software tool for developers that will automatically convert an Instant Articles page to Google’s AMP format, and eventually, to Apple’s Apple News format. If site developers adopt the tool, then Facebook’s, Google’s and Apple’s proprietary page formats may start looking more homogeneous, since developers will need to create the Instant Articles page first to be translated into an AMP and/or Apple News page. As a result, Facebook’s format could become more influential on its rivals’ versions. A Facebook Instant Article (left) converted to Google’s AMP format (right). Source: Facebook. For example, Facebook could introduce a content option that AMP and Apple News don’t yet support or vice versa, which could limit adoption by publishers that are automatically converting Instant Articles to the other two formats. Or Facebook could add rules dictating how many ads can appear on an Instant Articles page or where they may appear that conflicts with the rules for AMP and Apple News pages. But for now, Facebook’s tool appears to play nicely with Google’s and Apple’s formats. Publishers can include code in an Instant Articles page that will override automatic conversions that Facebook would make to page elements like ads or analytics tags, according to the tool’s official documentation. And publishers will be able to export the style details of the pages they create using its Instant Articles Style Editor to AMP and Apple News. “For example the custom formats, like fonts, colors and captions, that publishers have designed in the Style Editor, will be closely mirrored in the other formats,” according to a Facebook blog post announcing the tool.

Seeks to discuss ‘urgent issues’ New Delhi, May 25:   With various reports coming in about Apple’s manufacturing and its sales plans in India over the last few days, the Head of Government Affairs of the company has requested to meet Minister of Electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday to discuss ‘urgent issues’ about its India plans. In a request letter to the Minister, the company has written that Ali Khanafer, Head of Government Affairs of the Europe, Middle East, India & Africa (EMEIA) region and in-charge of Apple’s India expansion plans, wants to discuss the issues. According to sources closed to the development, Prasad’s office has received such request letter from the Cupertino-based company’s India operations team dated May 23. “…in-charge of Apple’s India expansion plans, seeks an appointment to meet you for discussing certain urgent issues about our India plans,” the letter accessed by BusinessLine, said. When asked, an IT Ministry official told BusinessLine that “the Minister has not taken any decision yet on the meeting. He may take a call in a day or two.” Meanwhile, various sources from the industry said that the iPhone-maker has been going through lot of exchanges of communications with various departments of the government to get a clearer picture on its manufacturing plans in India. There have been differences between the company and the government on tax issues, wherein the iPhone- maker wants some relaxations on import of certain components to manufacture devices. Last month also, Global Vice-President of iPhone Operations Priya Balasubramaniam and Dheeraj Chugh, Director iPhone Operations had met the Minister to discuss certain issues on manufacturing and sales. The company had kicked off making its devices in India last week with iPhone SE, at its Taiwanese contract manufacturing partner Wistron’s plant, in Bengaluru. Since its inception plans to manufacture devices in India, Apple has been to convince the Central government for special concessions for manufacturing in India, which according to many government officials and industry watchers say would not be possible for the well being of the industry. The company’s application for exemption from compulsory 30 per cent domestic sourcing norms was also rejected by the Finance Ministry last year. Such ‘special treatment’ to a particular company may hamper other manufacturers’ future plans and those who have been manufacturing in India for long.‘Make in India’ plan Meanwhile, many sources from the government also said that Apple’s ‘Make in India’ plan is still on, and the government has asked them to consider Indian norms and regulations for all purposes – whether it is for manufacturing, sales or importing of products. On asked for any update on the exchange between the government and Apple on tax issues, Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary at the Ministry of Electronics and IT, told BusinessLine that “We have shared our roadmap for indigenisation. Now, they (Apple) have to study and come back.” (This article was published on May 25, 2017) Post Comment Related NEWS India now the apple of TimCook’s eye Centre has said no to most of Apple’s demands for sops: Sitharaman TOPICS computing and information technology | telecommunication service | economy, business and finance | computing and information technology | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

But its Services business has become its fastest-growing segment — and hidden within that unit is a content business that’s growing tremendously. This story first appeared in the May 23, 2017 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. A little more than 80% of Apple’s total revenues over the past year have come from hardware sales, with iPhones accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total and iPads and Macs another 20%. But Apple’s Services segment generated around 13% of the total. The segment includes iTunes, iBooks and the App Store as well as revenues from Apple Music, Apple Pay and money Google sends to Apple for featuring its search engine in its Safari browser. It’s become the fastest-growing part of Apple’s business, averaging 20% growth year on year even as Apple’s iPhone business has shrunk a little. source: Company Reporting, jackdaw research Analysis and estimates *excluding Parks & Resorts The Services business has become so important to Apple that the company has set a formal target of doubling revenues from the segment between 2016 and 2020. But the segment is also something of a black box, containing many different parts of Apple’s business across a range of areas, none of which Apple breaks out explicitly. Yet it’s possible to arrive at some pretty decent estimates of the size of the constituent parts and, specifically, to break out the content business. That business generated about $15 billion in net revenue for Apple in 2016 — around 7% of its total revenues. If we look at Apple’s gross take from its content business, the number is even more impressive. On that basis, revenue was nearly $8 billion in the March 2017 quarter, and the scale of the content business is approaching that of some of the largest congloms. source: Company Reporting, jackdaw research Analysis and estimates That quarterly revenue number was roughly double CBS’ quarterly income; it was about the size of total 21st Century Fox revenues toward the end of last year; and it eclipsed NBCUniversal business (minus theme parks). The only major content businesses bigger were Time Warner’s and Disney’s. And Apple is rapidly closing in on Time Warner. This scale and rapid rate of growth make Apple’s content business unique among its peers, and that puts it in a powerful position to invest, even in original content. We’re seeing the start of that effort with a series of acquisitions for videos to play in Apple Music, including a series from “The Late Late Show” host James Corden. But Apple could easily increase that spending if it becomes serious about a stand-alone subscription video offering. So far, the company isn’t trying to compete directly with Netflix, which it sees as a partner and a customer. But there’s no financial reason why Apple couldn’t begin to challenge not just Netflix but Amazon, HBO, Hulu and any number of other players that invest in original content.

I’ve been doing these almost every week since 1991, starting at the Wall Street Journal, and during that time, I’ve been fortunate enough to get to know the makers of the tech revolution, and to ruminate — and sometimes to fulminate — about their creations. Now, as I prepare to retire at the end of that very long and world-changing stretch, it seems appropriate to ponder the sweep of consumer technology in that period, and what we can expect next. Let me start by revising the oft-quoted first line of my first Personal Technology column in the Journal on October 17, 1991: “Personal computers are just too hard to use, and it isn’t your fault.” It was true then, and for many, many years thereafter. Not only were the interfaces confusing, but most tech products demanded frequent tweaking and fixing of a type that required more technical skill than most people had, or cared to acquire. The whole field was new, and engineers weren’t designing products for normal people who had other talents and interests. Walt Mossberg’s “Personal Technology” debut in 1991 Dow Jones But, over time, the products have gotten more reliable and easier to use, and the users more sophisticated. You can now hand an iPad to a 6-year-old and, with just a bit of help, she will very likely learn how to operate it quickly. That’s amazing, given that the iPad is far more powerful than any complex PC I was testing in the 1990s. Plus, today’s hardware and software rarely fails catastrophically like PCs did so often in the old days. So, now, I’d say: “Personal technology is usually pretty easy to use, and, if it’s not, it’s not your fault.” The devices we’ve come to rely on, like PCs and phones, aren’t new anymore. They’re refined, built with regular users in mind, and they get better each year. Anything really new is still too close to the engineers to be simple or reliable. Many people aren’t going to be able to hook up a dedicated virtual reality system, or want to wear the headset. And most of us can’t yet trust Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant for an accurate, useful answer much of the time. But it’s early days for those technologies. So: Where are we now, and what’s coming? The lull As I write this, the personal tech world is bursting with possibility, but few new blockbuster, game-changing products are hitting the mainstream. So a strange kind of lull has set in. The multi-touch smartphone, launched 10 years ago with Apple’s first iPhone, has conquered the world, and it’s not done getting better. It has, in fact, become the new personal computer. But it’s a maturing product that I doubt has huge improvements ahead of it. Tablets rose like a rocket but have struggled to find an essential place in many people’s lives. Desktops and laptops have become table stakes, part of the furniture. The big software revolutions, like cloud computing, search engines and social networks, are also still growing and improving, but have become largely established. Consumer drones and robotics are in their infancy, a niche, with too few practical uses as yet. The biggest hardware and software arrival since the iPad in 2010 has been Amazon’s Echo voice-controlled intelligent speaker, powered by its Alexa software assistant. It arrived in 2015, and was followed last year by the similar Google Home device. I expect others. Justin Sullivan / Getty But the Echo and Alexa are just getting started. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told me in an interview last year that artificial intelligence was not just in the first inning of a long baseball game, but at the stage where the very first batter comes up. And, while Amazon doesn’t release sales figures for the Echo family, third-party estimates say that, while they are growing fast, they were still well below 10 million units last year. For comparison, even in a relatively weak period, Apple sold 50 million much costlier iPhones in just 90 days last quarter, and the combined total sales of the far more prevalent Android phones no doubt were much greater. Google just announced that there are now two billion Android devices in active monthly use globally, and Apple announced a year and a half ago that there were over one billion iOS devices in active use. These are mostly smartphones, and they are no longer novel. Wait for it But just because you’re not seeing amazing new consumer tech products on Amazon, in the app stores, or at the Apple Store or Best Buy, that doesn’t mean the tech revolution is stuck or stopped. In fact, it’s just pausing to conquer some major new territory. And, if it succeeds, the results could be as big or bigger than the first consumer PCs were in the 1970s, or even the web in the 1990s and smartphones in the first decade of this century. All of the major tech players, companies from other industries and startups whose names we don’t know yet are working away on some or all of the new major building blocks of the future. They are: Artificial intelligence / machine learning, augmented reality, virtual reality, robotics and drones, smart homes, self-driving cars, and digital health / wearables. All of these things have dependencies in common. They include greater and more distributed computing power, new sensors, better networks, smarter voice and visual recognition, and software that’s simultaneously more intelligent and more secure. Shutterstock Examples of all these technologies already exist, but they are early, limited and mainly attractive to enthusiasts. Compared to what’s coming, they are like the Commodore PET (look it up, kids) or those huge car phones in old movies. Ambient Computing I expect that one end result of all this work will be that the technology, the computer inside all these things, will fade into the background. In some cases, it may entirely disappear, waiting to be activated by a voice command, a person entering the room, a change in blood chemistry, a shift in temperature, a motion. Maybe even just a thought. Your whole home, office and car will be packed with these waiting computers and sensors. But they won’t be in your way, or perhaps even distinguishable as tech devices. This is ambient computing, the transformation of the environment all around us with intelligence and capabilities that don’t seem to be there at all. It reminds me of a great Saturday Night Live skit from 2005, where cast member Fred Armisen, playing Steve Jobs, shows off an ever-smaller series of iPods, finally producing a model that’s literally invisible, yet holds “every photograph ever taken.” Just in recent weeks, Facebook’s famed researcher Regina Dugan has announced that her secretive team is working on using the brain to type, and to control augmented reality devices. They are also developing ways to “hear” through your skin. Their idea is that, even if augmented reality gets built into standard eyeglasses and can impose sophisticated virtual objects onto real life, it won’t be seamless if you have to push buttons, use touch controls or utter commands. Apple reportedly has a secret project to monitor the glucose levels of diabetics with new noninvasive sensors, ending the need for daily test needles. Google has changed its entire corporate mission to be “AI first” and, with Google Home and Google Assistant, to perform tasks via voice commands and eventually hold real, unstructured conversations. Several small firms are pursuing the prospect of recharging mobile devices with power sent through the air, so power cords won’t be around. I expect to see much of this new ambient computing world appear within 10 years, and all of it appear within 20. Why it matters Every one of these efforts has the potential to create a new world that’s unrecognizable. It’s a radically different way of thinking about tech. When the internet first arrived, it was a discrete activity you performed on a discrete hunk of metal and plastic called a PC, using a discrete software program called a browser. Even now, though the net is like the electrical grid, powering many things, you still use a discrete device — a smartphone, say — to access it. Sure, you can summon some internet smarts through an Echo, but there’s still a device there, and you still have to know the magic words to say. We are a long way from the invisible, omnipresent computer in the Starship Enterprise. Worse, those early computers were in your way. They were hulking objects that demanded space and skill. Even now, if you look around a restaurant, you’ll see smartphones on the tables, waiting to be used. Computers have gotten vastly easier to use, but they still demand attention and care, from charging batteries to knowing which apps to use and when to use them. Technology has been a great thing, but it’s been too unnatural, an add-on to life, for 40 years. What’s going on in the labs has the promise to change that. The dark side Some of you who’ve gotten this far are already recoiling at the idea of ambient computing. You’re focused on the prospects for invasion of privacy, for monetizing even more of your life, for government snooping and for even worse hacking than exists today. If the FBI can threaten a huge company like Apple over an iPhone passcode, what are your odds of protecting your future tech-dependent environment from government intrusion? If British hospitals have to shut down due to a ransomware attack, can online crooks lock you out of your house, office or car? Good questions. My best answer is that, if we are really going to turn over our homes, our cars, our health and more to private tech companies, on a scale never imagined, we need much, much stronger standards for security and privacy than now exist. Especially in the U.S., it’s time to stop dancing around the privacy and security issues and pass real, binding laws. But, as tectonic shifts like this occur in technology, oligopolies get shaken up. And, if ambient technology is to become as integrated into our lives as previous technological revolutions like wood joists, steel beams and engine blocks, we need to subject it to the digital equivalent of enforceable building codes and auto safety standards. Nothing less will do. And health? The current medical device standards will have to be even tougher, while still allowing for innovation. The tech industry, which has long styled itself as a disruptor, will need to work hand in hand with government to craft these policies. And that might be a bigger challenge than developing the technology in the first place. The oligopoly Most of the work on this, especially what we and others can learn about and report about, is coming from the giant companies that make up today’s tech oligopoly — Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. But, as tectonic shifts like this occur in technology, oligopolies get shaken up. For instance: today, Apple is the biggest of the group. By all reports, it’s working seriously on AR, self-driving cars and health initiatives. But its strict and admirable privacy policies make it harder for it to gather the vast amounts of data required for the best machine learning. Microsoft is still trying to find a way to meld its formidable software and cloud expertise with a significant hardware business. The ad-based business models of Facebook and Google, now so dominant, could prove fickle. And Amazon has only had one really giant hardware hit — the Kindle — in its existence. But, even if these oligarchs all do fine, and their ranks swell by one or two, the country and the world will have to ask if they have too much power — and, if so, how to curb it without killing progress. The bottom line We’ve all had a hell of a ride for the last few decades, no matter when you got on the roller coaster. It’s been exciting, enriching, transformative. But it’s also been about objects and processes. Soon, after a brief slowdown, the roller coaster will be accelerating faster than ever, only this time it’ll be about actual experiences, with much less emphasis on the way those experiences get made. As a gadget-lover, this makes me a little sad. But, as a tech believer, it’s tremendously exciting. I won’t be reviewing all the new stuff anymore, but you can bet I’ll be closely watching this next turn of the wheel. Thanks for reading. Mossberg out.

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.   Mark Zuckerberg’s “We’re making the camera the first augmented reality platform” was the most important step so far towards mass market AR. Where Pokémon Go gave consumers their first taste of mobile AR, and Google Tango ushered in the race towards high end mobile AR phones, Facebook’s AR Platform now democratizes mobile AR regardless of hardware. Apple launching an AR enabled iPhone this year or next year could combine with Facebook to kick-start the mobile AR market at scale, and also be the final step towards the next great platform war. Consumers will win as usual, but there will be blood (as detailed in Digi-Capital’s new Mobile Augmented Reality Report). The burning platform question Hardware and software platforms are so intertwined that it can be hard to tell the difference, and if you’re Apple this played in your favor for the last decade. But Apple, Samsung and other phone makers have done such a great job with existing hardware, that they might have stacked the deck against themselves for mobile AR. Facebook’s AR Platform has shown exactly how the major social and messaging platforms can play the game using nothing more than a standard smartphone camera. So while device manufacturers roll out new hardware to build an installed base for AR phones, established and startup social/messaging platforms could build a mobile AR ecosystem and user base in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost. They’ll also be able to leverage this advantage as dedicated AR phones come to market. What is mobile AR anyway? At one end Pokémon Go is what some industry insiders call “the best worst example of AR”, because its ambient mobile AR is pretty basic. Lovely graphics positioned approximately against the real world on your phone screen, using basic computer vision and positional tracking. Nonetheless mass consumers think it’s mobile AR, and they’ve loved playing with it. At the other end of the spectrum is Google Tango, with hardware based immersive mobile AR driven by integrated hardware and software. Without diving into the technical weeds, Tango phones enable accurate motion tracking, area learning and depth perception in a device that looks much like any other smartphone. The difference comes from a motion tracking camera, a depth sensing camera, an infrared projector, computer vision and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) software. So virtual objects superimposed on the real world appear as you would expect them to if they were really there. But Tango’s time is yet to come in terms of consumer awareness and app ecosystem (no disrespect to Google, Lenovo or Asus). Facebook and Snap’s software based immersive mobile AR is a serious contender, as it combines the ubiquity of ambient mobile AR with some of the computer vision and SLAM that previously required dedicated hardware. While Google Tango’s sensors enable heavier duty mobile AR apps, that’s not the problem Facebook and Snap are solving. By plugging immersive software based mobile AR into the largest consumer platforms on the planet, they’re democratizing mobile AR for everyone for free. And free is a good price point. This hasn’t escaped the notice of Tencent in China either. Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel and Pony Ma didn’t get to where they are by being dummies, and so it is with software based mobile AR. The cool kids There’s another factor in the democratization of mobile AR that Pokémon Go highlighted – demographics. 68% of Pokémon Go users are between 13 and 29 years old. Even though that came from a very specific set of circumstances, it is the largest sample set of mobile AR mass adoption to date. For comparison in terms of major consumer platforms: 88% of Americans from 18 to 29 use Facebook (2/3 of them use Messenger), 76% of US teens own an iPhone (81% want their next phone to be one),  75% of WeChat users are between 20 and 30, and 60% of Snapchat users are between 13 and 24. Spot the pattern? Mobile AR will be adopted by the young. Platforms that can scale mobile AR with 13 to 29 year olds will win. Apple of my eye Tim Cook loves AR, but Apple has been characteristically enigmatic about its plans. We wrote back in January that Apple could launch an AR enabled iPhone this year or next year, with Samsung and others following. But until Tim Cook says “one more thing” about mobile AR, we really don’t know. So let’s think this through. For the last two years we’ve said that Apple is the best-placed of all major tech companies to drive AR, with its end-to-end ecosystem of hardware, software, app store, developers and retail. Combined with iMessage and its renewed push with stickers, an iPhone AR looks like a pretty compelling proposition. But Apple has a problem. Apple. Apple’s closed ecosystem is a huge advantage, but it’s also a weakness. Apple could provide the best and most complete experience for mobile AR, but only for folks who’ve bought a new iPhone AR. Apple expects users to replace iPhones every 3 years, which is a major driver of 200 million plus annual sales. But iPhone 7/7 Plus only makes up around 2/3 of the total. Assuming the iPhone AR is a range-topper that stimulates growth (converting Android users, reducing replacement cycles), we’re looking at an installed base of at first tens and then hundreds of millions of iPhone ARs in a few short years. But Facebook Messenger has 1.2 billion MAU, WeChat has 768 million DAU, Instagram has 400M DAU, WhatsApp Status has 175 million DAU, Snapchat has 160 million DAU. This means it could take Apple well over 5 years to deliver the mobile AR reach Facebook and Tencent potentially have today. Marc Andreessen remains right – software is eating the world. Do androids dream of tangoing sheep? Samsung and Huawei are the largest Android phone makers globally (not forgetting Oppo and Vivo in China), and these two companies could drive the hardware based mobile AR market for the larger Android ecosystem. But Samsung’s S8 and Huawei’s P10 aren’t AR enabled phones, having neither Tango nor their own proprietary AR platforms. So as discussed in January, we’re looking at 2018 as the likely inflection point for Android hardware based mobile AR. There is also the Android ecosystem challenge of the separate Google Play dominating outside China, and a fragmented set of changing players ruling app stores in China. In other words, none of the Android hardware players has the dominant end-to-end mobile AR potential of Apple. Who dares wins Sun Tzu’s “victorious warriors win first, then go to war” is a way of thinking about Mark Zuckerberg kicking off the mobile AR platform war at F8. Facebook’s mobile AR Platform wins outside China. Its user base, platforms (Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp Status), developer ecosystem, mobile AR developer tools, mobile market experience and financial muscle guarantee its success. Plus Mark Zuckerberg’s got something to prove, justifying his $3 billion entry into VR/AR in the first place (even if that was for a VR company). It’s a really smart move, and it’s going to pay off. Big time. Tencent wins in China. The potential dominance of WeChat mobile AR when launched in China is as exciting as Facebook’s AR Platform outside it. The battle has already kicked off during Chinese New Year with Tencent’s versus Alibaba‘s mobile AR Hongbao (traditional red envelopes filled with cash). But the Alibaba opportunity looks very different, as it will be the AR eCommerce leader in China rather than the mobile AR platform leader. Baidu is also layering its wealth of data on the real world, but it too has a different opportunity to Tencent. Apple could become the dominant and most profitable hardware enabled mobile AR player, scaling from zero to hundreds of millions of iPhone AR users by 2021. This could become the innovation for which Tim Cook is remembered, and potentially lead towards Apple’s long term smartglasses dominance going into the next decade (assuming smartglasses solve their 5 big challenges). Apple has been looking for a catalyst to take it beyond Steve Jobs’ legacy, and this could give it a real chance of becoming a 100 year company. Samsung, Huawei and other phone makers could do very well when they start to sell AR phones, but don’t have Apple’s inherent ecosystem advantages. To do more than maintain the status quo, they might need to invest in or acquire totally new capabilities. Otherwise they could miss out on the profits others will make using their mobile AR phones. Google’s Tango is currently geared to enabling a large open mobile AR ecosystem to drive its core search advertising and Google Play revenues, similarly to its current Android approach. However as with Baidu, the mobile AR opportunity to layer its data on the real world could improve its position. Snap is already in the mobile AR business, even if it doesn’t call it that yet. But with a user base much smaller than Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp Status and a closed platform, Evan Spiegel might think about copying Mark Zuckerberg for a change. No dog in this fight Microsoft still hasn’t announced any play for mobile AR. They’ve got massive assets in mixed reality (HoloLens) and VR (Windows VR), so it depends on whether they see themselves as a consumer or enterprise company long term. Steve Ballmer’s biggest regret is missing out on mobile. Hopefully mobile AR won’t become Satya Nadella’s. Amazon has also stayed quiet on mobile AR, despite reports of experiments with AR stores. If they’re not already working on it, this might be an area where Jeff Bezos could learn from Jack Ma. Know your enemy, know yourself The battle lines for mobile AR have been drawn, and some of the winners were clear before the first shot was fired. While it’s not too late for incumbents and startups in mobile AR, again in the words of Sun Tzu, “I have heard that in war haste can be folly, but have never seen delay that was wise.” Time to saddle up.

Next up, the cornerbacks. We are now on day four of our 10-part series breaking down the best Ohio State players to play their position in the first five years under Buckeye head coach Urban Meyer. Cornerbacks have been one of the strongest position groups during the Meyer era, as four corners have been taken in the first round of the NFL draft since Meyer came to Columbus prior to the 2012 season. With that, James Grega, Tim Moody and I came up with our top five cornerbacks to play under the Ohio State head coach.  No. 5 – Doran Grant  A four-year letterman, Grant played in all of Ohio State’s 54 games from 2011-14, starting 30 of them. The Akron, Ohio, native had 20 career pass break-ups and nine career interceptions as a Buckeye, five of which he recorded during Ohio State’s 2014 national championship season. Grant also was a reliable tackler for Ohio State, as he accumulated 146 stops across four years for the Scarlet and Gray. Grant, a team captain as a senior in 2014, was a first-team all-Big Ten selection before being taken by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth round (121st overall) of the 2015 NFL draft.    No. 4 – Marshon Lattimore  Though Lattimore played in only 20 games at Ohio State, he did more than enough to crack this list. Lattimore participated in seven games as a redshirt freshman in 2015, but had a breakout season last year when he started all 13 contests. The Cleveland Glenville product was second on the squad in 2016 with four interceptions, two coming vs. Tulsa in which one was returned for a touchdown. He also tallied nine PBUs, tying Denzel Ward for the team lead, while making 41 tackles. His efforts last fall led to him being named first-team all-Big Ten by the league’s coaches. Lattimore was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the first round (11th overall) in this year’s NFL draft. T-No. 2 – Eli Apple, Gareon Conley  It was too close to call in our voting, so Apple and Conley are tied for the second spot.  Similar to Lattimore, Apple only played two seasons at Ohio State. After redshirting his first year at OSU in 2013, Apple played in all 15 contests, starting 14 of them, in 2014 before starting all 13 games a year later. While making 53 tackles and a team-high 10 PBUs as a redshirt freshman, he also notched three interceptions. The last theft occurred when he picked off Oregon quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota in the national championship game. He followed up the 2014 campaign with 33 tackles, eight PBUs and another interception in 2015. Apple went to the New York Giants in the first round (10th overall) in the 2016 NFL draft.  Conley played in 42 games for the Buckeyes and started 27 games at cornerback. A team captain as a junior in 2016, Conley equaled Lattimore with four interceptions as both trailed Malik Hooker’s team-leading six picks last fall. Conley collected 15 PBUs and a half dozen thefts for his career. The Massillon, Ohio, native ended his time in a Buckeye uniform with 91 total tackles before being taken by the Oakland Raiders in the first round (24th overall) in this year’s NFL draft.   No. 1 – Bradley Roby  Roby occupies the No. 1 spot on this list. A two-time first-team All-Big Ten selection, Roby started in all 37 games he played in over his three-year career with the Buckeyes. He totaled 179 tackles, 36 PBUs and eight interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. Pick-sixes weren’t the only way Roby scored, though. As a sophomore in 2012, he recovered a fumbled punt in the end zone vs. Miami and recovered a blocked punt in the end zone vs. Indiana. That same year, Roby led the nation in passes defended with 19 (17 PBUs, which tied Ahmed Plummer’s mark set in 1998 for the OSU single season record, and two interceptions). Roby capped off his Ohio State career in 2013 with 69 tackles, 13 PBUs and three picks. He was chosen by the Denver Broncos in the first round (31st overall) of the 2014 NFL draft.   Comments:  James Grega: While he played just two years under Meyer, Bradley Roby earned my top vote here for a couple of reasons. For starters, he is probably the best pure athlete to play the position under Meyer and we all saw what happened when he didn't play against Clemson in the Orange Bowl. He meant more to that defense than a lot of people realize. Eli Apple was amazing in run support in addition to man coverage so he got my No. 2 vote. After him, there is a solid drop off in my opinion. Lattimore could have been a lot higher had he played more than one season.  Ryan McGlade: This was probably one of the most, if not the most, difficult position groups to break down in my opinion. As mentioned above, there have been a number of talented cornerbacks to play under Urban Meyer at Ohio State. I think the deciding factor for me to place Bradley Roby at No. 1 in my personal rankings was because I think he consistently made an impact throughout all three seasons he was a Buckeye.   Tim Moody: For me, Gareon Conley gets the nod for consistently stellar play over two full seasons. Roby was a close second, but he was a bit inconsistent at times. Apple and Lattimore were both great, of course, and will have better NFL careers, but I have Conley and Roby as the better college players. After that, Doran Grant was really the only other player worth considering.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Northrop Upgrades Triton High-Tech Sea Drone 99 Days to Kickoff: #99 Jachai Polite Special Ops Advances Iron Man Suit-2018 Baylor, Indiana Interest for Texas Sleeper Urban Era: Ranking The Cornerbacks 4-star CB Tyson Campbell updates recruitment Full Story Buckeye Sports Top Stories OSU Football Has Best Spring GPA In 8 YearsThe Ohio State football team reached its highest combined GPA for a spring semester in nearly a decade. by Ryan McGlade Buckeye SportsYesterday at 1:23 PM Times Announced For IU, Oklahoma GamesESPN announced start times for Ohio State's first two games of the year Thursday afternoon. by James Grega Jr. Buckeye SportsYesterday at 10:43 AM Urban Era: Ranking The Tight EndsBuckeye Sports Bulletin is continuing its series of the top Buckeyes at each position to play at Ohio State in the first five years of the Urban Meyer era.

Sony A6500 Facebook says it has heard from publishers that supporting multiple formats like Google AMP, Apple News, and Instant Articles can require a lot of upfront work. Facebook’s solution is adding a new export option for publishers to use when creating Instant Articles that works with Apple News and Google AMP. The updated SDK transforms the markup publishers use to create Instant Articles to generate the code needed to build these other formats, removing what we’ve heard can be a resource-heavy step in publishing on multiple platforms. With an easy way to get from one markup format to another, publishers can then plug-and-play the markup in their content management systems or third party publishing tools. Publishers will still need to put in the work to support Instant Articles, but Facebook is hoping that working with Apple News and Google AMP will push publishers to play ball. Google AMP support is also live now, and Facebook says Apple News “will be ready in the coming weeks as we learn how these tools can best support our partners.” For its part, Apple has had its own challenges with The Guardian recently pulling out of both Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles last month. Apple shared last fall that its News app hit 70 million users. Apple News is pre-installed to iPhones and iPads but only available in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Publishers can read more about the Instant Articles SDK Extension here. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news!

Up Next is a new documentary artist series from Apple Music that focuses on up and coming musicians. The Up Next series started last month with R&B inspired hip-hop artist 6LACK (pronounced “black”). Apple Music’s Up Next page was dedicated to the artist including a personal documentary with the artist, and an interview with Zane Lowe. Sigrid is a Norweigan singer-songwriter who gained traction recently with her release of “Don’t Kill My Vibe.” From her Up Next profile this month: Armed with an electrifying voice and an effortless gift as a songwriter, Sigrid is a love-at-first-listen pop star. She was only 16 when her first song proved she was destined for stardom beyond small-town Norway, and she delivered an international hit with the raw, radiant energy of “Don’t Kill My Vibe.” Explore Sigrid’s music, watch an exclusive short film, and check out her intimate interview with Julie Adenuga. it's an honour to be @AppleMusic's #UpNext artist. here is a snippet of a documentary we did together back home in Norway 💜 pic.twitter.com/0mnZKcCtEE — sigrid (@thisissigrid) May 25, 2017 Get to know Sigrid on Apple Music’s Up Next at apple.co/upnext.

The Royal College of Art in London on Thursday appointed Ive as it chancellor, a position he will hold for five years starting in July. As chancellor, Ive will serve as the head of the college and join the school's Council governing body. It's an unpaid position. The Royal College of Art, founded in 1837, is one of the world's most highly regarded art and design institutions with programs including art, design, and architecture. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter In a statement, the college called Ive, who has been knighted in the U.K. for his achievements at Apple, "the world's leading designer." The college awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2009 for his work designing Apple's products. Ive, who has been at Apple (aapl) since 1992, has played a critical role in designing everything from the company's iPhone to minute details in its retail stores. He also worked with architects on Apple's new Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, Apple Park. While Ive's role is largely honorary and won't require him to step away from his job at Apple, he said in a statement that he will act as an adviser to students and employees at the college. The school added that Ive will have a say in a new building it plans to open in 2020. For his new role, Ive succeeds James Dyson, founder of his namesake company that is best known for its Dyson vacuum cleaner.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple has been in Talks with China's BOE Technology Group who has Patented Displays that recognize Fingerprint ID | Main | TSMC Executive Says they're testing 7nm Chips for 12 Top Customers & will Ramp up Production in H2 2018 » May 25, 2017 IDC's Five Year Forecast See's Notebooks and Detachables as Growth Areas, Desktops and Tablets in Steady Decline   In a new IDC report forecasting the future growth of PC devices, IDC goes out on a limb by forecasting 'detachables' as the single PC device that will grow over one percent over the next five years (2016 – 2021). More specifically they forecast 'detachables' will grow 16.4% in contrast with tablets that they forecast will decline by 6.9% in that same time period.   Last June Patently Apple posted a report titled "In Q1 2016, Apple Led the Detachables Market in the U.K. Hands Down with the iPad Pro." The latest worldwide tablet shipments data released for Q1 2017 shows that Apple remains in the lead even in a declining market. Yet IDC continues to pump-up Microsoft over Apple even though that position has never panned out for them to date. In truth,  Microsoft's Surface tablets, including the Surface Book, have never been able to crack the top five IDC tablet vendors list.   Yet with that said, Microsoft's fortunes may begin to experience growth in Q1 2018 due to a barrage of PC vendors jumping on the detachables sector with Windows 10 on ARM architecture in Q4 2017. Though one on one, Surface will not overtake Apple's iPad any time soon. As a Windows 10 vs iOS duo, Windows may pull ahead in 2018 if everything is perfectly on schedule for Q4.   Today's IDC report noted that "Within the tablet category, the high-level story hasn't changed all that much. The expectation remains that slate tablets will continue to decline at double-digit rates in 2017, with contraction slowing in the later years of the forecast while detachable tablets are expected to continue strong growth. However, coming off a weaker than expected 2016 for detachable tablets, IDC reduced its overall detachable tablet forecast with the largest reductions coming from the United States and Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan)."   Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers noted for the report that "Sales of detachable tablets haven't quite met our expectations and as a result we've reduced volume projections throughout the forecast period."   Reith added that "New detachable tablet products continue to hit the market but the reality of this relatively new product category is that Microsoft and Apple control close to 50% of the volume and both companies have very cyclical product releases and relatively high price points."   Wow, with Apple's iPad being number one and Microsoft not even on the latest tablet chart for Q1 2017, IDC tried to make it sound that Microsoft and Apple were on equal footing which is a bald-faced lie. All Surface products, excluding the new Surface Book laptop, are detachables technically and Microsoft never made the top tablet's chart. Chalk one up for fake news.   To further pump-up Microsoft, IDC's Reith noted that "One piece of industry movement that we continue to watch closely is OEMs that have traditionally focused on the smartphone space moving further into the Windows device market. This is happening with both detachable tablets and notebook PCs, and as recently as this week Huawei announced very attractive products in both categories."   And finally on the PC front, IDC notes that "As a collective group of device categories, the PCD market is expected to return to growth in 2019, albeit marginally small. Led by a modest recovery in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia/Pacific in the first quarter of 2017, the traditional PC market registered its first quarter of positive year-on-year growth since Q1 2012. Despite the improvement, growth was less than 1% and headwinds remain. IDC expects traditional PC shipments to return to a slow decline until positive growth resumes in 2019. Desktop volume will continue to decline as consumers move to other platforms, while notebook volume will grow modestly, boosted by the commercial market and a steady move toward ultraslim and convertible notebooks.   "The steady refinement of slim and convertible designs, as well as rising commercial spending are helping stabilize overall traditional PC shipments," said Loren Loverde, vice president with IDC's Worldwide Personal Computing Device Tracker and Tracker Forecasting. "Although traditional PC shipments will decline slightly by the end of the forecast, rising replacements and steadier growth in emerging regions will keep commercial growth in positive territory and sustain total annual shipments above 252 million throughout the forecast."   Yet with new leaps coming to desktops beginning this summer with Ryzen and more specifically the ThreadRipper, desktops could experience a mild comeback if VR headsets, like Facebook's Oculus, can deliver super high-end VR gaming experiences powered by the crazy power of these new desktops.   Some current system already offer 8GB of Nvidia GPUs (GeForce 1070) out of the box like this HP system. The gaming community may be ready to upgrade to these new systems coming out over the course of the next two years to boost desktop sales – though overall, they'll likely not return to their former glory days unless tech leaders like Apple decide to reinvent the desktop.   We all know that Apple is currently working on a whole new power modular desktop system. Apple is focused on delivering major Augmented Reality experiences in the future as 5G networks come to market and the desktop is likely to be the benefactor due to their brute power. So – you never know – the PC may still have a brighter future for pros and consumers than IDC is forecasting.   One More Thing   In our patent report posted this morning titled "Apple Continues to Advance a Hybrid Notebook with a Reconfigurable Surface Supporting a Virtual Keyboard & more" we noted that technically, Apple's patent-pending invention could in fact be a hybrid / detachable device. Apple has been working on a dual iPad device for some time as noted in Apple's patent figure below. The point being that Apple has a few tricks of their own for future detachables that could very well keep the Windows machine at bay for many years to come.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

However, with just a few insider tips and tricks, it's actually really easy to explore the Big Apple on a budget. There's plenty of cheap and free sightseeing, travel passes, walks whatever the weather and top museums to visit on a budget. Add to that affordable micro-hotels and it's perfectly possible to visit New York City and have a great time without breaking the bank. We take a look at some of the best things to see and do in the Big Apple if you're on a budget... To save those extra pennies check out our round-up of the best cheap hotels in New York - and don't miss our guide on everything from flights to cheap eats in the city. 1. Staten Island Ferry The Staten Island Ferry is a free option to see the whole City vista To get the best view of that famous city skyline you'll have to get further away from the hustle and bustle. The ferry is not only free, but a good way to get out on the water to see the amazing view of southern Manhattan, Lady Liberty herself and Ellis Island. The ferry takes you across the bay to the fifth borough and back again in 25 minutes. The Ikea Ferry is also free, but only at weekends (it's $5 on weekdays). It chugs out from Wall Street to the Red Hook, Brooklyn. Read More 10 things you never knew you could do in New York 2. Get up in the sky Most of your time in New York is spent looking up as a tourist, with skyscrapers on every corner. There's the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center and the One World Observatory - but they'll all cost you a fair bit. It's really worth visiting one for the spectacular views. Lower Manhattan, Manhattan is one of the most impressive skylines The cheaper way to see the city from up high is to take to a rooftop bar, get a drink or two, and enjoy the view. Many hotels have their own. 3. 9/11 memorial The 9/11 Memorial and museum are an emotional experience The whole world was watching when the planes hit the World Trade Center towers. The memorial by architect Michael Arad and landscape architect Peter Walker focuses on the thousands of lives lost in the tragedy. The two large waterfalls pour into the foundations where the Twin Towers once stood, the names of all the victims are cut into the metal rim around it. It's a powerful reminder of what happened and worth a visit. Memorial to the 9/11 victims (Photo: Mirror) The museum itself is an emotional experience, taking you through the events as they happened, the background and the aftermath. There's a strong sense of loss and the pain felt, but it also shows the strength of New Yorkers, coming together to help those involved and bring New York back from the atrocity. Visit One World Observatory (tickets start from £23) based in the One World Trade Center afterwards to truly see the contrast between what the area once was and the hub it is now. 4. Cross the Brooklyn Bridge There's a great view from Brooklyn Bridge The bridge is an iconic landmark, linking Manhattan to Brooklyn since it was built in 1883. The dark limestone and neo-gothic towers are a great backdrop for photos. If you face Brooklyn with the skyline behind you there's a perfect postcard image as the wooden slates are elevated above the road. It can get quite busy, with people leaning over to attach the 'banned' padlocks to the bridge, but in the cooler months and frostier weather the tourists drop away leaving you free to snap away. If you're heading towards Brooklyn make sure you carry on into the Dumbo district for a coffee or ice-cream if it's warm or a hot chocolate in one of the independent cafés if it's cold.

Visit museums for what you think they're worth The Met museum has an extensive collection Also known as The Met the huge museum sits on one side of Central Park. While they don't exactly shout it from the rooftops, the $25 fee is a recommended amount - you pay what you wish. You could easily spend days wandering around, but some top things to see include the Egyptian collection, the European art and the Greek statues. Egyptian artifacts in The Met The Met isn't the only museum that you can visit on the cheap. The Museum of Modern Art on 53rd Street is free on Fridays from 4pm. The Whitney Museum of American Art is also pay what you wish on Fridays in the evening. The Museum of New York tells the City's story - including the iconic I love New York sign If it's history you want, try the Museum of The City of New York, where you can follow the city's rise from a striving Dutch village to the big player it is today. It’s worth a look even if it’s just for the iconic I ❤️ NY logo concept sketch – the simple scribble on that became globally recognisable. 6. Take a stroll Whether you are by the Hudson River, walking through Central Park or visiting the High Line, there's plenty of places to explore outdoors - and for free. It took a decade to come to fruition, but it was worth it judging by New Yorkers reaction to the High Line. The once abandoned overgrown freight train line along the city's west side is now a 'park in the sky' - and one of New York's most popular attractions. Times Square at night There's also Times Square - visit at night for the famous and dazzling spectacle of all the screens lit up. The roads work on a grid system so it’s impossible to get lost. The Staten Island Ferry, which takes you across the bay and back for free, passes Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. 7. Central Park What's a visit to New York without a visit to Central Park? Sat in the middle of the rows of buildings, the 840 acres seems a little out of place. There's a boating lake, a reservoir, sports fields, a zoo and more. Whatever the weather Central Park is worth a visit Jump on a rented bike and cycle at leisure through the park or join one of the runs. It’s strange to see 80 acres of stunning greenery in the heart of the metropolis, but it’s a welcome free haven. 8. Take in a show off-broadway Broadway shows can be expensive, especially if there's more than one of you. A cheaper option is to head off-broadway and catch one of the shows in the smaller theatres. There are plenty other musicals that were broadway - and West End - hits often have tickets going: for example, you can get tickets to Avenue Q for just $75.50/£61. 9. Shop 'til you drop There's the Westfield World Trade Center if you're in Lower Manhattan. The mall replaces an earlier shopping centre, which was on the concourse area of the original World Trade Center until it was destroyed in 9/11. Westfield World Trade Center Mall The inside now looks like the inside of a whale, white, sleek and rib like it looms over lines of shops. If you're looking for food options head over to Brookfield Place. Between the Gucci and high-end boutiques there's a food court, with everything from Ramen to Umami burgers, Sprinkles cupcakes and root beer. Remember that tax isn't included in the price too, budget accordingly and check the sales tax before you buy. 10. Eat like a New Yorker Food isn't exactly cheap in the city, with most mains $15-$20, but if you choose well you can try a range of typically New York treats. Pick up a bagel Take your breakfast to go with the must-have coffee. Zucker's Bagels and Smoked Fish are the "real deal" and were named best bagels in NYC last year by Time Out and USA Today. Pizza wise there's plenty to choose from. The pepperoni at Joe's in Greenwich Village is a great option, since it opened in 1975 it's been drawing people from far and wide. For something more hip try Adoro Lei in Hudson Street and munch on the chocolate pizza. Try a bit of everything in the Mall food courts To get a taste of everything try venturing out for local fare or try the mall food courts for everything from Mexican to Asian, Ramen to burgers, there's something for every palate. Try City Kitchen in Row NYC. Foodies will also want to check out the Dumbo ­district (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), which is full of tiny cafés selling the best hot chocolate ever, alongside interesting food – the current flavour of the month is fried Brussels sprouts served with... anything. 11. Free tours of NYC There's plenty of free tours to join, showing you the best sites in the city. From the Big Apple Greeter (where you can request what to see), to Brooklyn Brewery (learn about suds-making for free every Saturday) and Central Park Conservancy (there's a long line for the expert guided tour around the park). Top tips if you're on a budget: Find some great cheap hotels in New York City here. Invest in a New York CityPass: it costs $114 (£107) and offers you free entrance - and often priority - to six iconic attractions and museums. Take the subway: yellow cabs may be one of New York's most recognisable staples, but the subway is much more budget-friendly. It runs 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year - thus making it easier to venture further out into Queens and Brooklyn at your leisure. Bag a Metro pass for £25 for unlimited use. Make the most of Happy Hour: New York is packed full of bars and places to grab a drink, but whether it's a cocktail or just a beer it can be just as pricey as London. Luckily playing it savvy can save you a dollar or two. Look out for Happy Hour before you head in - and if you're eating out, check to see if the restaurant offers a Happy Hour discount on the menu too.

Facebook’s Instant Articles platform to support Google AMP, Apple News Posted 14 hours ago by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Mogees picks up seed funding to put audio-based gesture recognition tech into new devices One of the problems publishers face today in making their content more readable on mobile devices is that there are multiple, competing formats available for this purpose. Facebook has Instant Articles, Google is spearheading the AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) project, and the Apple News Format optimizes content for iOS devices. Facebook is today taking a crack at a solution to this problem by rolling out support for both AMP and soon Apple News as a part of its open source Instant Articles software development kit. The updated SDK will now include an extension that lets publishers build content that’s publishable in all three formats, beginning with support for Google’s AMP in addition to Facebook’s own Instant Articles. In the weeks ahead it will also include support for publishing to Apple News, though the company didn’t provide an exact launch date for when that feature would be added. At a high level, the SDK will take the markup that’s used to build Facebook’s Instant Articles and use it to create the code that’s needed to build for AMP and Apple News. While the multiple systems aren’t identical, of course, Facebook says it will offer ways for publishers to apply the custom styling templates for the competing services – including the application of things like custom fonts, colors, and captions, which will be mirrored as closely as possible in the other formats. The goal with this change is to offer a design once, publish anywhere experience – and naturally it’s one where publishing to Facebook is the first priority, in terms of getting things right. The functionality will be made available through an extension to the Facebook Instant Articles SDK, which is found here on Github. (Documentation on its usage is on the Facebook for Developers site, here.) The idea for the extension came about as part of the Facebook Journalism Project, a program that aims to connect Facebook with media publishers to help inform the company’s roadmap for upcoming news features on its site. The project’s other ideas include things like letting publishers offer free trials to their paid subscriptions via Facebook, hackathons with publishers’ development teams, digest packages that Facebook users can subscribe to, PSAs to promote news literacy across Facebook, tutorials for journalists, and more. However, the extension’s launch also comes at a time when a number of high-profile publishers have begun to abandon Facebook’s format, due to its lack of monetization options. In April, for example, it was reported that Forbes, Hearst, The New York Times and others have backed out of Instant Articles. Other major media organizations including Bloomberg, The WSJ, ESPN, CBS News, NPR, Financial Times, and VICE News have also been holdouts, running little to no content in Facebook’s format. Others who have used the format have been winding down their support; and last month, The Guardian pulled out of both Facebook’s Instant Articles and Apple News. Publishers are generally unhappy with the deals the platforms are cutting on revenue sharing, and don’t like that the Instant Article format prevents them from having a more direct relationship with their readers. Sending visitors to stripped down, mobile-optimized pages may be a good experience for readers who don’t have to deal with pop-ups and other clutter, but it has historically meant that publishers can’t serve all the same advertisements as on the web, nor encourage donations, push paid subscriptions, promote their email newsletters or events, or make other connections with readers. Facebook has tried to stem some of these concerns by tweaking the rules for Instant Articles – allowing them to show more ads, for example, or by rolling out new features, like call-to-action units in the articles that can promote email sign-ups or request Page Likes. It lets publishers push free trials and app downloads, among other things. Now, by tying Facebook Instant Articles to AMP and Apple News, the company hopes that it can lure publishers back to its platform by making it possible to publish to all three major services at once. But without fully loosening its restrictions, Facebook may still have a hard time making the case for Instant Articles, if the format doesn’t match up with publishers’ larger goals. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report DJI's Cute $499 Spark Drone | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Instant Articles Facebook Media Popular Posts Featured Stories Mark Zuckerberg's Harvard Commencement Speech | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:27 Zuckerberg tells Harvard we need a new social contract of equal opportunity 11 hours ago | Josh Constine Target just gave Casper $75 million 11 hours ago | Sarah Buhr Mark Zuckerberg gets trolled on Harvard’s student newspaper ahead of commencement speech 11 hours ago | Lucas Matney Judge orders Uber to hand over to Waymo unredacted term sheet with Otto 12 hours ago | Megan Rose Dickey Latest From Social Zuckerberg tells Harvard we need a new social contract of equal opportunity 11 hours ago | Josh Constine Watch Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard commencement speech here 12 hours ago | Josh Constine Tips for mastering Magikarp Jump, the next Pokémon masterpiece 12 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Instagram direct messages now support web links and different photo orientations 12 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Comment moderation powered by Up Next Mogees picks up seed funding to put audio-based gesture recognition tech into new devices Posted 14 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Two Sigma Technical Recruiter at Two Sigma Investments (New York, NY, United States) Two Sigma Ventures Content + Brand Manager at Two Sigma Investments (New York, NY, United States) Cloud Optimization Engineer at Eyeview (Seattle, WA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Green Bits at Green Bits (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ GreatHorn at GreatHorn (Belmont, MA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip Activations Blog International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

By Joseph Lichterman @ylichterman May 25, 2017, 12:08 p.m. May 25, 2017, 12:08 p.m. Facebook said Thursday that it’s making it easier for publishers to export stories formatted for Instant Articles to Google’s AMP and Apple News as well. The announcement comes as Facebook continues to try to woo publishers to the Instant Articles format; many have cooled on it, citing business pressures and technical restraints. Facebook’s software development kit now lets publishers export stories to the AMP format, Facebook partner engineering director Piyush Mangalick wrote in Facebook’s announcement. Support for Apple News will “be available in the coming weeks.” “The updated SDK transforms the markup publishers use to create Instant Articles to generate the code needed to build these other formats, removing what we’ve heard can be a resource-heavy step in publishing on multiple platforms,” Mangalick wrote. “With an easy way to get from one markup format to another, publishers can then plug-and-play the markup in their content management systems or third party publishing tools.” RELATED ARTICLE Facebook’s Instant Articles are live: Either a shrewd mobile move by publishers — or feeding the Borg May 13, 2015Lots of hype surrounded Facebook’s 2015 release of Instant Articles. The format launched with nine partners, including The New York Times and The Guardian. But the format seems to have fallen out of favor as outlets struggled to monetize stories there and also as Facebook itself began to prioritize video. The Guardian and the Times are just two of the many publishers that have since pulled out of the Instant Articles program. The Times reportedly left Instant Articles last fall after it found that links to stories on the Times’ own site were better to monetize and made readers more likely to subscribe. The Guardian pulled out of both Instant Articles and Apple News. A Guardian spokesperson told Digiday: Our primary objective is to bring audiences to the trusted environment of the Guardian to support building deeper relationships with our readers, and growing membership and contributions to fund our world-class journalism. The Verge reported last month that publishers’ business models were “an afterthought” for Facebook as it developed the Instant Articles format: Though the format would have important financial consequences for the companies who used it, generating revenue for publishers was not a primary goal in its development. “The team is legitimately motivated by making great articles,” [Instant Articles designer Mike] Matas told me in 2015. One former employee familiar with the matter said media companies’ business models had initially been all but an afterthought. “The idea that these products could meaningfully impact the revenue of the news industry just didn’t really come up,” the former employee said. “I don’t know that anyone [at Facebook] took that piece all that seriously.” Facebook now says it is taking news organizations’ concerns seriously. This update to the SDK came as a result of “meaningful conversations with publishers as part of the Facebook Journalism Project to better serve the needs of news publishers and readers on Facebook,” Mangalick wrote. RELATED ARTICLE Facebook rolls out Flipboard-y story packages, subscription tests, and video metrics for big publishers January 11, 2017Facing scrutiny for its role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Facebook launched the Facebook Journalism Project in January to try to improve its relationship with news outlets. In April, Facebook added two new features to Instant Articles — allowing readers to sign up for emails from publishers and also like their Facebook pages — that were inspired by feedback from the project. News outlets still rely on Facebook. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Facebook is working with BuzzFeed, Vox, and other publishers to produce original video content that will include ad breaks. RELATED ARTICLE Google AMP is about to become a much bigger deal, showing up in everybody’s mobile search results August 2, 2016For their part, Google and Apple are also looking for ways to leverage their news platforms. Google has made AMP stories show up more prominently in search results. Apple, with its latest iteration of iOS, enabled push notifications in Apple News. And Apple News has hired New York magazine executive editor Lauren Kern for the newly created position of editor-in-chief, Politico reported Thursday.

Ive will take over the post from the inventor and entrepreneur James Dyson, who held the role for five years. Ive said he was “thrilled to formalise my relationship with the RCA, given the profound influence the college has had on so many of the artists and designers that I admire”. Ive joined Apple in 1992 and has led the company’s design team at its Silicon Valley headquarters in California since 1996. He has shaped some of its most influential products, including the MacBook, iPod and iPhone. His appointment coincides with the RCA’s expansion into the fields of technology, science and engineering and as it looks to take on more digital-based courses. Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Ive emphasised, in the wake of Brexit, the importance of continuing to welcome a “diverse pool of talent” to the UK to make sure its design and technology sector could compete with the likes of Apple and Google. Speaking about access and welcoming talent from different countries and backgrounds, Ive said it was “terribly important for creating a context for multiple companies to grow and in a healthy way explore and develop new products and new product types”. Ive said Apple had grown because of its willingness to hire “like-minded people” from all over the world. “I think at Apple we’ve been very clear on how important it is that we have a diverse pool of talent that we can hire from,” he added. Ive also said the UK could benefit from importing the culture of US companies such as Apple to become a world-leading technology hub. Apple has plans to build a UK headquarters in London. He said that in Silicon Valley “there is the sense that failure isn’t irreversible, so very often people will work on an idea, and there isn’t the same sense of stigma when one idea and perhaps one company doesn’t work out”. Paul Thompson, rector at the Royal College of Art, said: “Jony embodies the RCA’s ideals of technology and design excellence, inspiring students and staff, and enabling us to educate the next generation of world-leading artists and designers.” Ive, who was knighted in 2012 for services to design, will not receive a salary for the chancellor role, which will involve conferring degrees and heading up meetings of the university’s governing body. Ive will take up the role in July. He added: “The UK has a fabulous tradition of design education, but we can always be doing better, given the way design has to meet new challenges and is in a constant fluid state of change. There are always ways design education can become more relevant.” Topics Royal College of Art Jonathan Ive Art Apple Design news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Could Jony Ive's promotion at Apple actually inch him closer to the exit door?

However with so much to see and do in the Big Apple, trying to find a hotel that's in the centre of all of the action can feel like a daunting task - even more so if you're on a budget. The good news is there are actually plenty of brilliant cheap hotels tucked away amidst the city's streets, just a stone's throw away from major attractions from Times Square to Greenwich Village. Whether you're after that Instagram-worthy shot of Times Square, looking to check out the skyline from the top of the Empire State Building or want to make the most of the city's iconic nightlife, we've searched high and low to find you the best budget-friendly accommodation. Check out our favourite hotels for a cheap stay in the city that never sleeps... You can also find our top tips for seeing New York on a budget here - or for something a bit different, check out 10 things you never knew you could do in the city. 1. Hotel Mela On the doorstep of: Times Square You don’t get much more central than this hotel, just a tapdance away from the heart of Broadway - with theatres, classic restaurants and glorious neon advertisements and - if you’ve got children you need to shop for - Toys R Us. It’s a popular hotel - the rooms might be on the small side but they deliver plenty of style and the all-important amenities, including a restaurant, a bar, free wifi and a gym. How much? Doubles from £113 per night. Find out more on TripAdvisor here. Read More 11 of the best things to do in New York on a budget 2. The Jane On the doorstep of: The Highline Full of atmosphere - and history - this hotel once housed survivors from the Titanic. After a period as a flophouse, it was reinvented as a chic, distinctly bohemian hotel. If you don’t mind sharing a bathroom, there are miniscule bargain billets all year round but in January and February you can also get its posher, bigger rooms - ‘captain’s cabins’ for affordable rates. Bands perform in the Ballroom - but you can also inhale the atmosphere at Cafe Gitane, the hotel’s coffee shop before heading out to New York’s newest park, the Highline, built on a former elevated railway. How much? Doubles from £86 a night. Find out more on Hotels.com. 3. The Pod Hotel On the doorstep of: Grand Central Station This hotel has all sorts of rooms on offer, from singles to bunk beds - there are even some rooms that squeeze in four of you and is popular with groups of friends. With bar, games area and ping pong table, in keeping with the designery budget feel, the concierge produces a handy daily tip sheet on bargain meals, sample sales and exhibitions. How much? Singles from £73 a night, bunk beds from £86 a night. Find out more on TripAdvisor here.

Cosmopolitan Hotel On the doorstep of: SoHo The Cosmopolitan doesn’t draw attention to itself, but lives up to its name with accommodation that will suit everyone, from families, couples or solo travellers. With 125 rooms, all en suite - try to aim for one of the mini loft rooms. The management is friendly and efficient and the location is great – crammed with bars, vintage shops and general Downtown cool. How much? Doubles start from £79 a night. Find out more on Booking.com. Read More 10 things you never knew you could do in New York 5. Aloft Hotel, Brooklyn On the doorstep of: Brooklyn Heights Priced out of Manhattan, New York’s hipsters started colonising the borough of Brooklyn over a decade ago. This hotel is part of Starwood’s coolest brand. You won’t find room service or even a restaurant - but that’s no hardship when some of New York’s best restaurants can be found on this side of the Hudson River. It’s an easy stroll to Brooklyn Heights, with its beautiful brownstone buildings - used in the TV series Girls and Manhattan’s just a short subway ride away. How much? Doubles from £105 a night. Find great deals on TripAdvisor here. 6. The Evelyn On the doorstep of: Rockefeller Centre Its former incarnation, the Gershwin, was one of New York’s best boho hotels - with great art and iffy plumbing. Now spiffed up, it’s still a good value option in winter, with a nice mixture of period details and up-to-the-minute furnishings including posh Frette linen. In the newly trendy NoMad (North of Madison) district, one reason it’s such a bargain is that the lobby area is still undergoing renovations and there’s no restaurant yet - but the area is stuffed with great eateries. How much? Doubles start from £130 a night. Find out more on Hotels.com. Read More Cheap holidays 2017: The best travel deals on all inclusive trips, hotels, flights and more 7. The Marlton On the doorstep of: Greenwich Village Once a cheap hotel beloved by the beat generation, former guests Jack Kerouac wouldn’t recognise it now. The new owners describe it as a ‘baby grand’ hotel - all wood panelling and leather sofas in the communal area, with light airy rooms and suites above. In peak times you’ll be paying £300 plus for the privilege of staying here, but it becomes much more affordable in winter - and groovy West and Greenwich Villages are on your doorstep. How much? Doubles from £130, including continental breakfast. Find out more on TripAdvisor. Read More America's greatest cities New York Washington DC Nashville Seattle Oakland San Francisco Boston 8. nyma On the doorstep of: Macy’s Step outside this hotel - part of the good value Apple Core range - and you’ll see the Empire State building rise up above you. Close to Penn Station - this is quintessential New York - with steaming pavement vents, honking taxis and gridlock traffic. There are more stylish hotels in New York - but there’s a lot to like about this no-nonsense hotel apart from the central location, including free wifi and breakfast. How much? Doubles from £120 a night. Find out more on TripAdvisor. 9. Z Hotel On the doorstep of: Queensborough Bridge You won’t get a better view of Manhattan than by staying at this hotel just across the East River in Queens - all the rooms have iconic views of midtown Manhattan and fantastic floor-to-ceiling windows. There’s plenty to explore in the immediate area too - whether it’s PS1 - the offshoot of the Museum of Modern Art is nearby and the restaurants are increasingly hip. And should you want to head across the river, Manhattan’s only one subway stop away How much? Doubles from £83 a night. Find out more on Expedia. 10.

Describing it as a “move that’s sure to raise eyebrows” in media circles, Politico adds that Kern is one of New York magazine’s “most high-ranking editors” as well as having formerly been a deputy editor at The New York Times Magazine. While there’s no information available on what Kern’s responsibilities will be in the new role, which is an entirely new position within Apple, it obviously suggests that Apple is continuing to forge ahead with its News app and service, possibly taking it in some new directions. Apple has not yet confirmed the hiring, and Kern declined to comment.

Sony A6500 Apple News first launched back in 2015 on the iPhone and iPad as a new platform for discovering and reading content from a wide variety of news outlets including 9to5Mac. While Apple News doesn’t produce original content, editorial decisions are made from staff about which stories to promote and feature in various sections including News Editors’ Picks and News Top Stories. Apple News also featured a now retired curated category called Election 2016 ahead of the U.S. election last fall. Apple News even has a dedicated Twitter account for promoting topical stories found within the service with links that launch the News app on iOS and default to the web on other platforms. Lauren Kern, the first-ever editor-in-chief of Apple News, most recently worked at New York Magazine where she was promoted from executive editor to a new role at New York Media that covered more publications. Here’s how New York described her new role back in November: Lauren Kern is becoming executive editor, New York Media, creating an integrated feature and enterprise operation that will span across all publications, including Vulture, the Cut, Daily Intelligencer, Select All, Science of Us, Grub Street, and New York Magazine, working with the editors and building on her accomplishments in the print magazine and on the Cut to produce ambitious journalism throughout the company. Politico says it’s “unclear what exactly the role will entail” for Kern at Apple News, but you can see how her most recent role could apply to Apple’s news aggregator service.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Samsung Galaxy Book review: one step forward, one step back Samsung’s Surface competitor still doesn’t quite match up by Dan Seifert@dcseifert May 25, 2017, 10:38am EDT Photography by Amelia Holowaty Krales share tweet Linkedin Every company that makes PCs has been chasing Microsoft in the race to create a tablet that can work as a laptop. Samsung’s first real effort at this was last year’s TabPro S, which introduced a number of good ideas, but ultimately was underpowered and fell short of beating the Surface Pro at its own game. Now Samsung has launched its second attempt at making this do-all device, the Windows 10-powered Galaxy Book. The Book also adds a number of improvements over Microsoft’s Surface Pro, and addresses some of the issues that the TabPro S had, such as its uneven performance. But at the same time, the Book has problems of its own that prevent it from being the ultimate tablet-slash-laptop. There are two versions of the Book: a 10-inch Wi-Fi-only model that starts at $629.99 and a 12-inch version that comes in Wi-Fi and LTE flavors for $1,129.99 and $1,299.99, respectively. Both models come with a pen and keyboard in the box, which is something Microsoft and Apple charge extra for with their tablets. I’ve been testing the 12-inch LTE model, which has an Intel Core i5 processor (seventh-generation, Kaby Lake), 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. For this price, I’d have expected more RAM and storage, but I appreciate the built-in connectivity. (The Wi-Fi-only Book 12 can be equipped with more RAM and storage, but only one option is available for the LTE version.) The best part of the Book 12 is its display As with most Samsung devices, the best part of the Book is its display. The 12-inch model has a HDR-capable Super AMOLED touchscreen that’s sharp and vibrant with good contrast and lovely black levels. It’s a 3:2 aspect ratio with 2160 x 1440 pixels, which make it better suited for doing work in a landscape orientation than reading in portrait mode. I don’t really have any complaints with the display, other than the brightness adjustment goes from fully bright to unreadably dim in just a few steps. I ended up using it a notch or two higher than the default setting most of the time as a result. There’s also Samsung’s comically dated spinning 3D text screensaver that kicks in after just a few minutes and can’t be disabled. The included keyboard acts as an input method, stand, and case for the tablet. The full-size, plastic, chiclet keys are closer to a standard laptop keyboard than Apple’s fabric-covered Smart Keyboard or the Surface’s slimmer design. It attaches to the tablet via pogo pins, so there’s no pairing necessary, and the keyboard doesn’t ever need to be charged. It’s clear that Samsung designed the Book with the idea that it would always live in this case, as it’s too big and cumbersome to really use as a dedicated tablet most of the time. Fortunately, the keys are surprisingly nice to type on, with good travel, spacing, and feedback; they even come with a backlight. The trackpad is also responsive and easy to use — it supports Microsoft’s Precision drivers, so scrolling and multitouch gestures work quite well. As good as the case’s keyboard and trackpad are, it falls short as a stand. It attaches to the back of the tablet via magnets and offers three different angles of incline, which is better than Apple’s Smart Keyboard and its one position, but far worse than the Surface Pro’s infinitely adjustable built-in kickstand. Propping the tablet up in the case is awkward at first, but it’s stable once you get the hang of it. I should clarify: it’s stable if you’re using the Book on a table or desk. It’s a completely different story on my lap, where the keyboard case is floppy and extremely awkward. Worse, unlike last year’s TabPro S that had a short, flat base, the Book’s case has a very long footprint, which makes it easy to slide off my knees and impossible to fit on the ever-shrinking airplane tray table. Both the Surface Pro and iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard are much easier to use as laptops on my lap. The Book 12 is extremely uncomfortable to use on my lap That’s doubly frustrating for the LTE-equipped Book, because if it could be comfortably used on a lap, it would be a train commuter’s dream portable computer. A built-in internet connection (the Book uses Verizon for its connectivity) is far superior than relying on Wi-Fi hot spots or tethering to a phone or other connected device, but that’s all a moot point you have to sit at a desk to get the best experience with the device. The included pen has fewer issues than the case and works well for writing or doodling on the screen. It’s not as good for drawing or art purposes as the Apple Pencil or Microsoft’s new Surface Pen, but it comes in the box and never needs to be paired or charged, so it works for me. There’s no way to attach the pen to the tablet directly, so Samsung includes a pen loop that sticks to the bottom of the keyboard case to keep it all together. It’s not elegant, but it gets the job done. And there are a few software features specific to the pen, such as a note-taking app and screenshot tool. You can also use Windows 10’s built-in Ink functions with the pen if you prefer. It’s a shame that the Book is so damn awkward to use because performance-wise it’s much better than last year’s TabPro S. I’ve been using it as my main work computer for the past week and I’ve had zero performance issues. I initially thought the 4GB of RAM would be a bottleneck — it certainly was for the TabPro S — but I’ve been able to run multiple programs and lots of browser tabs without having them constantly reload or crash. I can switch between apps and virtual desktops with ease and apps and programs launch quickly. This is not the machine for heavy photo editing, gaming, or any video editing, but for day-to-day business tasks, such as using a web browser, Microsoft’s mail and calendar apps, and the Office suite, it’s quite capable. You’ll have to get used to the consistent hum of the Book’s fans, however, as they are almost constantly running. They don’t get as loud as the Surface Pro 4’s fans when those kick into gear, but they also seem to never turn off. The hum of the fans is a constant companion Samsung claims "up to 11 hours" of battery life with the 12-inch Book, but unsurprisingly, the company’s claim and my experience differ greatly. Most days, the Book needs to be charged after just five or six hours of use as a computer — you might get more stamina if you just use it to watch locally stored video, but I don’t think most people will use this device that way. It does have fast charging through either of its two USB Type-C ports, but it still takes a couple of hours to get a full charge. I appreciate that Samsung directly addressed some of the issues the TabPro S had last year (lack of backlit keyboard, no pen included, performance bottlenecks), but it’s as if each improvement means another sacrifice is made. What you end up with is a supremely portable tablet-slash-laptop that can’t be used on your lap and can only go half a day away from an outlet before it needs to be recharged. And that’s before you get to its price, which is hundreds of dollars more than last year’s model. For each advancement, a new compromise is made It also doesn’t help that Microsoft just announced a new version of the Surface Pro that will finally come with an LTE option, sniping right at one of the few differentiators Samsung has with the Book. The Galaxy Book is okay in a vacuum — it has a nice display, solid performance, and a comfortable keyboard — but in this surprisingly competitive field, it doesn’t match up. The PC market marches on, but this one merely stumbles.

In a court filing yesterday, Qualcomm asked for a preliminary injunction against four of Apple’s suppliers — Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron, and Compal — all of which it began suing for breach of contract earlier this month. Qualcomm said in April that Apple had instructed those companies not to pay royalties for devices they made using Qualcomm technology. It later said that would lead to a loss of $500 million in revenue this quarter alone because of the missing payments. “[Apple] has chosen commercial ransom over judicial process.” Qualcomm and Apple are locked in a worldwide legal dispute over patents and payments, with Qualcomm largely stuck playing defense. Apple has said that Qualcomm has been charging excessively high patent licensing fees for years, using its position as the dominant supplier of smartphone modems as leverage. In its new filing, Qualcomm says that Apple is trying to force a settlement by throwing its weight around. “Apple could litigate against Qualcomm indefinitely; it has virtually unlimited resources (more than $256 billion in cash reserves) and already has filed multiple cases against Qualcomm not just in this court, but around the world. And when those cases end, Apple can file more cases,” the company writes in a new filing. It goes on to say that Apple “has chosen commercial ransom over judicial process” and that it’s trying to get an unfair deal on Qualcomm’s technology “through coercion enabled by its enormous market power.” Apple declined to provide a new comment on the filing, once again pointing to older remarks. In one of those, Tim Cook says that Qualcomm is “trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value” when what it provides is “one small part of what an iPhone is.” In a separate statement from April, Apple says it’s suspending payments “until the correct amount can be determined by the court.” Backing up Apple’s claims is a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission, which began suing Qualcomm earlier this year for anti-competitive practices in regard to how it obtains patent licenses. In filings earlier this month, Samsung and Intel also put their weight behind the FTC.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Most-awaited devices in second half of 2017: Nokia 9, iPhone 8, Galaxy Note 8, OnePlus 5 Some of the most-awaited devices in the second half of 2017 are Nokia 9, iPhone 8, Galaxy Note 8 and OnePlus 5. Raymond Ronamai   May 25, 2017 20:44 IST The new iPhone 7 smartphone is displayed inside an Apple Inc. store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson The first half of 2017 is almost over and a few flagships like Samsung Galaxy S8, Xiaomi Mi 6 and HTC U11 have been unveiled, but it wasn't as exciting as expected. Will the second half of this year be more exciting? Can't say, but there are a few interesting handsets in line for release. Nokia 9 is one of the most-awaited smartphones of the year. HMD Global has revived the once popular brand from the brink of death. As usual, Apple's flagship is one device that gadget lovers look up to, and iPhone 8 is the cynosure of all eyes. Also read: Will loyalty guarantee good sale of iPhone 8? Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Note 8 is one device that people will watch with curiosity after the debacle of the Note 7 that had to be discontinued after a faulty battery caused fire. Nut there is no denying that Samsung is known more for its Note handsets. Another smartphone you can watch out for is the OnePlus 5. This Chinese smartphone manufacturer is known for making devices with impressive specifications, yet make available at a reasonable price. Here are expected specifications of some of the most-awaited devices expected before the end of this year: Nokia 9 It is expected to sport a 5.5-inch QHD OLED display with a 1,440x2,560 resolution, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and run Android 7.1.2 Nougat operating system. It is also expected to feature a 6GB RAM, a 64GB/128GB internal memory (with microSD card slot), a 22MP PDAF with Zeiss optics, a 12MP front-snapper, and a 3,800mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 support. There are also reports that the device will be priced at $700 / €750. iPhone 8 The iPhone 7 successor is expected to be released in the third quarter of this year. It is expected to feature a curved OLED panel, a 3D sensing system, and an A11 chipset. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 successor is expected to be codenamed Baikal, which is the name of a lake in Siberia. It is also reported that the device will have a 4K display and an AI assistant but not much is known other than that at the moment. OnePlus 5 The device is the successor of the OnePlus 3. Interestingly, the makers of the device have reportedly decided not to use number "4" as its name as "4" is considered as unlucky for the Chinese. The handset is expected to have a 5.5-inch full Quad HD display with 2,560x1,440 pixels, a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Octa-core processor clocking at 2.35GHz, an Adreno 540 GPU and an Android Nougat operating system. It also expected to feature an 6/8GB RAM, a 64GB internal memory, a 23MP rear camera, a 16MP front-snapper, and a 4,000mAh battery. It is reported that the OnePlus 5 will be priced at $499 in China and $688 in the rest of the world.

With its bright design, no distracting apps and Snake, summer’s hottest accessory is a stripped-back Nokia 3310 Ben Travis Thursday 25 May 2017 16:38 BST Click to follow ES Entertainment Blast from the past: Nokia has re-released the 3310 It'a a Saturday afternoon, I’m on the bus and I’m not scrolling through Twitter. I’m still looking at my phone but I’m playing Snake because I’m trying a revamped Nokia 3310. The dumb phone comeback started with Rihanna and her flip phone in 2015. Since then, appetite has risen for mobiles that eschew the bells and whistles of constantly connected devices for the stripped-down basics. Nokia has rejuvenated the much-loved 3310 from the year 2000 with a few updates and a low price of just £49.99. 10 years of Apple's iPhone 7 show all 10 years of Apple's iPhone 1/7 Unveiled Steve Jobs with the first iPhone AFP/Getty Images 2/7 iPhone The original iPhone Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 2 megapixel PA 3/7 iPhone 3G Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 2 megapixel AFP/Getty Images 4/7 iPhone 4 Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 5 megapixel Getty Images 5/7 iPhone 5 Screen size 4in, rear camera 8 megapixel Getty Images 6/7 iPhone 6 Screen size 4.7in, rear camera 8 megapixel Getty Images 7/7 iPhone 7 Screen size 4.7in, rear camera 12 megapixel PA It could be the perfect phone for those with smartphone fatigue or going to a festival and requiring strong and stable battery life. In this spirit I ditched my iPhone 7 Plus for a week and stepped back to the start of the millennium to try the simple life — but can you hack it in London without wi-fi? Here’s how it measures up. On message Messaging has totally changed in the smartphone era — qwerty keyboards are the norm now and autocorrect does half the work for you — so going back to the multiple button-presses of traditional texting proved tricky. Typing takes forever, and the predictive text is laborious. I spent five minutes trying to text my partner that I was in Uniqlo, but had left the shop before I’d finished writing it. Read more Apple finally reveals how to take a perfect photo on your iPhone Still, it all contributes to a slower pace of life — it’s so much more effort to text that you only do it when you really need to, and you’ll use your mobile more economically. It could even make your friends less flaky — if they know texting is this much effort they might stick to the original plan. Txt spk could make a comeback because it is just easier, especially if you go extra-retro with a pay-as-you-go SIM where every text counts.  Game on Nokia couldn’t revive the 3310 without including its most iconic game. Snake is indeed back, but there have been a few tweaks. There’s a new challenge-based play mode where you have to complete a series of timed objectives, but luckily the separate “survival” mode is far more like Snake 2. iPhone marks 10th anniversary The gameplay is faster and there are new elements — bombs to avoid, magnets to attract nearby apples, and scissors to trim your length in a crisis. As it is the only distraction on the handset I quickly became consumed by it — just like I did on the original 3310. The difficulty threshold is high though — a score of 70 apples proved my best. When I go back to my iPhone I’ll be downloading the Snake app. In charge Battery life is where the Nokia 3310 trumps every other phone. It has serious staying power.  Over the course of a week I only charged the thing once for about two hours — and the charge port is now a standard USB input, meaning it will fit all those random cables that you have strewn around your home. Despite sending plenty of texts, making several calls, and playing hours of Snake, the 3310 had remarkable stamina. Read more Apple finally reveals how to take a perfect photo on your iPhone Hidden feature in iOS 10.3 update will free up space on your iPhone Farpoint is fine – but PlayStation's Aim controller is a game-changer Make a connection The 3310 is internet-enabled but it won’t connect to wi-fi and the connectivity is only 2.5G — a crawl compared to 4G. Of course, if you’re switching to the Nokia 3310 you’re likely doing so to disconnect from the internet’s perpetual thrum — and there are no pinging social notifications here. The Opera web browser provides a basic lifeline to Gmail, Facebook or BBC News in a low-res format when the time really calls for it, but when I tried looking up Vue Piccadilly’s film times at the weekend all that loaded was a fully black screen. Camera action You’re not buying the Nokia 3310 for its camera. The lens shoots in 2MP and requires a steady hand to capture anything more than a yellowy blur. I snapped one photo of my colleague to use as wallpaper and didn’t bother after that. Still, it’s ideal for a break if you often find yourself living for the likes on Instagram. @BenSTravis More about: Nokia Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → Lauren Kern Named First Editor-in-Chief of Apple News » May 25, 2017May 25, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Politico: And it’s a move that’s sure to raise eyebrows not just in Silicon Valley, but in Manhattan media circles as well. Morning Media has learned that Apple has given the job — a new position at the Cupertino-based company — to Lauren Kern, one of New York magazine’s most high-ranking editors and a former deputy editor at The New York Times Magazine. It’s unclear at this point what this position will mean for Apple News, as the company and Kern declined to comment. I assume Apple is building more of editorial organization within Apple News, but how big it will be, and what it will do within the app is unknown, to me at least. Two things do come to mind though. First, Apple could be building a news team. I think this is pretty unlikely, but first-party reporting within Apple News could add value to the platform. This team could even generate video for Apple’s Always-Rumored-But-Never-Here TV offering. Getting into reporting can be expensive and risky. Moreover, it just doesn’t seem like a very Apple-like move to me. What I think is more likely is the second option; this new team could be working to influence coverage seen in Apple News to a greater extent than what is happening now. Facebook has been under pressure for influencing the top news trends seen by its users, as well as its shifting approach to fighting fake news. If Apple wades into these waters, it will have to deal with these issues at some point. It’s very tricky business to exercise editorial control over news from outside sources. I’m very curious to see what — if anything — changes in Apple News in the future.

It’s unclear what exactly Kern’s new role will entail, Politico said. The move is being described as “sure to raise eyebrows” in media circles. Kern is one of New York magazine’s “most high-ranking editors,” said Politico. Prior to joining New York Magazine, she was a deputy editor at The New York Times Magazine. The hiring suggests Apple intends to advance the Apple News service and the stock News app. Apple executive Eddy Cue said in February that Apple wants to cut down on clickbait on Apple News. The company, said Cue, wants to “vet and make sure that the news providers in Apple News are legitimate.” Following its 2015 debut which replaced Apple Newsstand, Apple News is currently available in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. iOS 10 brought out an Apple Music-like redesign for Apple News with bold headings, larger images and other visual tweaks. Kern declined to comment and Apple has yet to confirm the hiring.

And, after a successful run in the US, vaping company Firefly has decided to launch its latest product here in the UK . For a cool £310. One of the co-founders of the company, Mark Williams, spent time at Apple and the Firefly2 vaporiser has swiftly been dubbed "the iPhone of vaporisers". It's been designed as if it was a smartphone as well - just like any good gadget it comes in a range of different colours. Read More There's an iPhone case that also works as a coffee dispenser There's also a customisable temperature setting and a quick-charge USB 3.0 charging dock built straight into the device to make it easier for users to keep it topped up. There's also capacitive touch activation, a removable mouthpiece with a particulate filter and a borosilicate glass vapour path. Hilariously, it even has iPhone and Android apps to give people "complete control of their vaping experience." According to the press release, the Firefly 2 is "the only portable vaporiser in the world that delivers the entire sensory spectrum of vapour from your favourite plants or concentrates, in a single inhalation." Read More Vaping could increase your risk of heart disease - just like smoking cigarettes Mr Williams, who once worked with Apple's legendary founder Steve Jobs, said: "We wanted to create a product that allows people to control and enjoy their experience more directly than ever before - to bring the quality, design and ease-of-use you’d expect from a premium product that’s been created to enhance your life." The Firefly 2 is available at a range of vaping retailers. According to the UK Vaping Industry Association, around three million British smokers have already taken up vaping. Over half of those now describe themselves as ‘former smokers’; and the industry was recently estimated to be worth nearly £1bn in sales in the UK.

Based on the aforementioned blackout days, and assuming the pattern follows previous years, it’s easy to imagine an iPhone keynote on either Wednesday, September 20 or September 13. Conversely, pre-orders should go live on Friday, September 22, meaning iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus (maybe even iPhone 8?) could go on sale on Friday, September 29. Here’s an excerpt from Apple’s message: The upcoming months are going to very exciting for all of us and for our customers. As you know, there are new product announcements and launches in September. In anticipation of the upcoming events and the corresponding heightened call volume expected, we will be increasing our staff across all of our programs over the summer. In order to support our client during this very important time of year, we will be implementing Black Out Days in all AppleCare programs for Advisors and Leaders. The upcoming Black Out dates will be September 4 through November 4. Apple notes that these dates are subject to change “as our support volume expectations fluctuate.” During blackout days, employees are restricted from requesting vacation. “It is extremely important that everyone works their assigned scheduled days during this period—absences are unacceptable,” notes the firm. pic.twitter.com/6CywOaQJoI — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 25, 2017 As with all leaks by Geskin, take this report with a pinch of salt until we’re able to verify this piece of information with other sources. For instance, there are spelling mistakes in the memo. Tagged: Apple Event iPhone News Rumors MORE FROM iDB Everything we expect from Apple’s ‘Let us loop you in’ event on Monday Video: first hands-on with iPhone 8 dummy Apple granted patent for iPhone-compatible Apple Pencil Tony Trenkle Jr. No! An Apple event in September?? No way! Iskren Donev Those spelling mistakes bug me. I’d say that the text itself is not genuine (i.e. copy-pasted from the original). Instead, it could have been manually typed from a screenshot/photo/print and hence the typos. Or, someone could just be practicing their creativity (and their poor grammar). One other red flag for me is the sentence “As you know, there are new product announcements and launches in September.” I am not sure that the Management Team at Apple would send such an email so early on, to so many(?) people specifying the month in which there will be a release.

Today a new patent application from BOE was discovered that describes a display with integrated fingerprint authentication and oddly points directly at Apple's iPhone 5S as an example of the old way of using fingerprint ID. Is this one of the reasons why Apple is in talks with BOE?   BOE's patent background notes the following regarding the iPhone 5S:   "For the sake of safety, the fingerprint identification technology is generally used to realize user authentication in conventional personal portable electronic device. A display comprises a display region and a non-display region, and a conventional fingerprint identification region is disposed in the non-display region.   Correspondingly, a fingerprint sensor pattern is disposed below the fingerprint identification region. As an example, in a known electronic device (such as the smartphone iPhone 5S launched by Apple Inc.), an opening is formed on a cover plate which is configured for protecting the display panel. The opening is located within the non-display region of the cover plate and corresponds to the fingerprint identification region, and a sapphire glass covers the opening.   However, the design of an opening and the employment of sapphire glass result in a complex fabrication process, which increases the fabrication cost and decreases a size of the display region, thereby reducing the user experience.   Fingerprint ID in the Display   In describing BOE's patent FIG. 3 noted above they note that "during the fabricating process of the display employing the substrate the pixel array region of the substrate is in a display region of the display. Disposing the fingerprint sensor pattern in the pixel array region is equivalent to forming a fingerprint identification region in the display region.   The fingerprint identification region is still used for display and does not compromise the user's experience. When a finger slides in the fingerprint identification region, it is possible to realize fingerprint identification through the fingerprint sensor pattern.   It can be conceived that the number of the fingerprint sensor pattern may be more than one such as two, three or more, thus it is possible to identify a plurality of different fingers so as to improve personal information security.   Moreover, the fingerprint sensor pattern may be formed in any position in the pixel array region. In the case that the number of the fingerprint sensor pattern is plural, the patterns may be disposed in distinct positions, and the positions can be customized according to user's requirement.   The substrate in the embodiment can realize the identification of fingerprints sliding in the display region of the display, which reduces the fabricating cost, moreover, increases the usable area of the display since there is no need to design openings in the non-display region, thereby improving the display effect and user experience.   BOE Technology Group's patent application 20170147850 that was published today by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office was originally filed back in September 2015.   A Few of Apple's latest patents on Touch ID under the Display   March 28, 2017: Apple Wins Patent for Ultrasonic Biometric Sensing allowing Touch ID to be under an iDevice Display March 03, 2017: Apple's New Under-Display Touch ID Developed In-House will Reportedly Push iPhone Production to September Feb. 28, 2017: Apple Granted a Patent for Touch ID beneath the iPhone Display   May 17, 2016: Apple Granted a Key Patent Supporting Touch ID beneath a Touch Display   Whether Apple will introduce Touch ID beneath the display for the iPhone 8 or future model is unknown at this time.   About Posting Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro: What’s the difference? by Sean Keach 17 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments New Surface Pro vs MacBook Pro: When you’re looking for a work laptop, you’ll probably consider the Microsoft Surface Pro or Apple MacBook Pro, but which is best? The MacBook Pro has long been a staple of Apple’s computing roster, offering solid performance and an ever-attractive design for a generally high price. Microsoft’s attempt to dethrone Apple as the go-to provider of work machines for hip professionals is the Surface Pro series. These laptop/tablet hybrids have proved popular with those looking for a versatile machine with decent power and a Windows operating system. Choosing between the two is a difficult task, so read on to learn the key differences between the two devices. Note that the new Surface Pro was only announced on May 23, and although it’s available for pre-order, it won’t begin shipping in the UK until June 15, 2017. Related: Best laptops New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Design: What’s the difference? The MacBook Pro comes in two variants: 13-inch and 15-inch. This dictates the size of the screen (diameter), so you’ll want to work out whether paying a premium for those extra two inches is worth it. Related: New Surface Pro 2017 vs Surface Pro 4 On the newer MacBook Pro models, there’s an option to add a Touch Bar: an OLED strip that replaces the row of function keys on a standard MacBook Pro. The strip shows different function keys depending on the app you’re in. So if you’re using Photoshop, you’ll get relevant shortcut keys; listen to Spotify and you’ll be able to control music. All-in-all, the MacBook Pro is a fairly conventional laptop, boasting a slim and stylish metal chassis and a large, accurate trackpad. The keyboard has Apple’s new shallow-actuation design for keys, so typing should be very low-effort compared to older models. Importantly, despite the fact it has tonnes of power, the MacBook Pro is very slim and light. In fact, it weighs just 1.37kg and has a thickness of 14.9mm – that’s about two iPhone 7 handsets stacked on top of each other. But the Surface Pro is also a slick piece of kit, featuring a swanky hybrid design. This means that it can be used like a tablet, or attached to a keyboard for a laptop-style experience. Related: Best PC games The only screen size available for the Surface Pro is 12.3-inches, which some power users may find limiting. That said, the 12-inch to 13-inch mark is probably the safest size range for notebook devices, so it should suit the needs of most users. Like the MacBook Pro, the Surface Pro is very attractive and svelte, and will look gorgeous sitting on almost any surface. That’s partly thanks to the fact it has an incredibly slim 8.5mm body, and weighs a feathery 768 grams (up to 784 grams, depending on your configuration). Bringing the Surface Pro in at under the 1kg mark is a real win for Microsoft, as it will woo those who regularly have to cart their notebook around. There’s no clear winner in terms of design, rather two very different options that will require your personal judgement. The MacBook Pro is great for anyone who wants a sturdy, traditional laptop with a tried-and-tested design. If you’re looking for a more lightweight hybrid device, the Surface Pro is obviously the way to go. New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Specs: What’s the difference? Hardware Both the Surface Pro and MacBook Pro have high-resolution displays, but Microsoft’s hybrid is marginally superior with a display resolution of 2736 x 1824 pixels to Apple’s 2560 x 1600 pixels. Given the fact that MacBook Pro panels are slightly bigger, the Surface Pro comes in with a hefty 276ppi pixel density compared to the MacBook Pro’s 227ppi. As far as processing goes, the Surface Pro and MacBook Pro are on relatively equal footing. They both use Intel’s latest 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs. What you get in terms of performance depends on how much you’re willing to spend on pricier configurations. Storage is fairly equal between the two devices, as both come with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options. Surface Pro has a minor advantage however, in that there’s a 128GB configuration available too, for those who don’t need heaps of storage and want to keep costs down. The cloud is your friend, folks. Memory is consistent again, with both devices featuring 8GB and 16GB RAM configurations. But once more, Microsoft’s Surface Pro edges out with a 4GB option. Both products use 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory, though this is upgradeable. One of Surface Pro’s big wins over the MacBook Pro is its camera tech. The Surface Pro has two cameras (8-megapixel and 5-megapixel) on the back and front, both of which are capable of capturing 1080p (Full HD) video. By comparison, the MacBook Pro’s singular camera can only capture 720p (HD) footage, which means video calling won’t look as sharp. Apple’s controversial port strategy also causes some problems for the MacBook Pro: there’s no SD card slot. There are two (or four) Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports though, as well as a headphone jack. The Surface Pro, meanwhile, features a full-size USB 3.0 port, a headphone jack, Surface Connect support, a MicroSDXC card reader, and a Mini DisplayPort. And finally, thanks to a number of enhancements, Microsoft’s Surface Pro promises an incredible 13.5-hour battery life. That’s compared to Apple’s 10-hour charge cycle claim for the MacBook Pro. Ouch.

This is because both companies have crafted exceptional operating systems, and you’ll probably get along fine with either. If you’re already used to one, then the obvious advice is to just stick with the OS you’ve become familiar with. You’ll work much faster on a machine that you know the ins and outs of. Both Windows and MacOS support workflow continuity to their respective smartphones, so if you’ve got an iPhone then you might want to invest in a MacBook Pro. Similarly, if you’re one of the very few people using a Windows 10 phone, maybe a Windows machine is for you. Apple MacBooks have a reputation for being safer in terms of cybersecurity, if only because they have a very locked-down software setup i.e. the App Store. But you’ll find that Microsoft – although arguably more vulnerable – still has a wider selection of software available to it, particularly when it comes to niche apps. In any case, whichever OS you choose, you won’t be disappointed. New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Price: Which laptop is better value? The issue of value is difficult because both devices come in so many different configurations. The cheapest MacBook Pro will set you back £1,449 while the most expensive costs £2,699. By contract, the cheapest Surface Pro costs £799, with the top-end model also costing £2,699. For a good comparison, a 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar costs £1,449. That gets you 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and an Intel Core i5 processor. The closest two Surface Pro models to that price point are as follows: Option 1 (£1,249): Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM / 256GB storage Option 2 (£1,549): Intel Core i7 / 8GB RAM / 256GB storage So in both cases, it’s a fairly similar proposition. What it will probably come down to is your preference in terms of design and usability. However, it’s worth noting that the Surface Pro arguably has a better array of ports, and offers some advantages, including better battery life, a more pixel dense screen, and a better camera setup. Still, you’re likely to find similar value for money from both devices at a similar price point – after all, they’re designed to compete with each other. New Surface Pro 2017 vs MacBook Pro Summary: What’s the difference? Here’s a quick breakdown of the key differences between the new Surface Pro and MacBook Pro. Design: Both devices are very attractive, but the key difference is the MacBook Pro is a laptop, while the Surface Pro is a tablet/laptop hybrid. Specs: Both devices offer basically the same configuration options, although the Surface Pro seems to be a more complete offering. Price: The MacBook Pro starts at £1,449, while Microsoft undercuts Apple with a lower-configuration option at £799, but both devices eventually work their way up to a similarly configured £2,699 beast.

A virtual keyboard was of course a headline feature of the iPhone when it was launched in 2007, and Apple also introduced the feature to the latest MacBook Pro models in the form of the Touch Bar. Patently Apple illustrated the patent using a Lenovo Yoga Book, showing what is in effect a giant Touch Bar replacing a physical keyboard. If the idea fills you with horror, as it does me, we may not need to worry too much … NordVPN Those of us who use our MacBooks predominantly for writing or coding would have a terrible user experience were Apple to replace a moving keyboard with a screen-based one. It’s extremely unlikely that Apple would take this approach across all models, even if it were to use it for one or more. The company has also shown interest in mechanical dynamic keyboards, such as the Apple-like Sonder e-ink keyboard. This is a Magic Keyboard style device with each keycap being a tiny e-ink display that can dynamically adjust to different languages and other specialist functions. Crucially, you still get real keyboard movement. There are also more sophisticated dynamic key systems such as that used in Elgato’s Stream Deck, in which each moving key has a full-color LCD display. This is available today. Patently Apple notes that what Apple may have in mind for this particular patent is more of an iPad-style device. The secret to this invention is that it also oddly covers tablets […] Technically it could be some kind of hybrid device […] This past February, an Apple patent application covered an iPad Pro smart cover that supported a new virtual keyboard. So it’s evident that Apple is coming at this project from many angles. I’ve argued before that I’m pretty sure that Apple’s long-term plan is for MacBooks to have some form of dynamic keyboard. The ability to have a keyboard adapt to each app would be of huge benefit, as demonstrated by the market for keyboard overlays and dedicated keyboards for pro apps. Apple’s inclusion of the Touch Bar in the latest MacBook Pro models is evidence that Apple understands the appeal. But while it may have made moves to reduce the movement in MacBook keyboards, I don’t see it abandoning the physical form factor in its mainstream laptops – not for as long as typing remains a key input method.

clock menu more-arrow Mossberg Mossberg: The Disappearing Computer Tech was once always in your way. Soon, it will be almost invisible by Walt Mossberg@waltmossberg May 25, 2017, 10:00am EDT Illustrations by William Joel share tweet Linkedin Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode. This is my last weekly column for The Verge and Recode — the last weekly column I plan to write anywhere. I’ve been doing these almost every week since 1991, starting at The Wall Street Journal, and during that time, I’ve been fortunate enough to get to know the makers of the tech revolution, and to ruminate — and sometimes to fulminate — about their creations. Now, as I prepare to retire at the end of that very long and world-changing stretch, it seems appropriate to ponder the sweep of consumer technology in that period, and what we can expect next. Let me start by revising the oft-quoted first line of my first Personal Technology column in the Journal on October 17th, 1991: “Personal computers are just too hard to use, and it’s not your fault.” It was true then, and for many, many years thereafter. Not only were the interfaces confusing, but most tech products demanded frequent tweaking and fixing of a type that required more technical skill than most people had, or cared to acquire. The whole field was new, and engineers weren’t designing products for normal people who had other talents and interests. Personal technology is usually pretty easy to use, and, if it’s not, it’s not your fault But, over time, the products have gotten more reliable and easier to use, and the users more sophisticated. You can now hand an iPad to a six-year-old, and, with just a bit of help, she will very likely learn how to operate it quickly. That’s amazing, given that the iPad is far more powerful than any complex PC I was testing in the 1990s. Plus, today’s hardware and software rarely fails catastrophically like PCs did so often in the old days. So, now, I’d say: “Personal technology is usually pretty easy to use, and, if it’s not, it’s not your fault.” The devices we've come to rely on, like PCs and phones, aren't new anymore. They're refined, built with regular users in mind, and they get better each year. Anything really new is still too close to the engineers to be simple or reliable. Many people aren’t going to be able to hook up a dedicated virtual reality system, or want to wear the headset. And most of us can’t yet trust Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant for an accurate, useful answer much of the time. But it’s early days for those technologies. So: where are we now, and what’s coming? The lull As I write this, the personal tech world is bursting with possibility, but few new blockbuster, game-changing products are hitting the mainstream. So a strange kind of lull has set in. The multi-touch smartphone, launched 10 years ago with Apple’s first iPhone, has conquered the world, and it’s not done getting better. It has, in fact, become the new personal computer. But it’s a maturing product that I doubt has huge improvements ahead of it. Tablets rose like a rocket, but have struggled to find an essential place in many people's’ lives. Desktops and laptops have become table stakes, part of the furniture. The big software revolutions, like cloud computing, search engines, and social networks, are also still growing and improving, but have become largely established. a strange kind of lull has set in Consumer drones and robotics are in their infancy, a niche, with too few practical uses as yet. The biggest hardware and software arrival since the iPad in 2010 has been Amazon’s Echo voice-controlled intelligent speaker, powered by its Alexa software assistant. It arrived in 2015, and was followed last year by the similar Google Home device. I expect others. But the Echo and Alexa are just getting started. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told me in an interview last year that artificial intelligence was not just in the first inning of a long baseball game, but at the stage where the very first batter comes up. And, while Amazon doesn’t release sales figures for the Echo family, third-party estimates say that, while they are growing fast, they were still well below 10 million units last year. For comparison, even in a relatively weak period, Apple sold 50 million much costlier iPhones in just 90 days last quarter, and the combined total sales of the far more prevalent Android phones no doubt were much greater. Google just announced that there are now 2 billion Android devices in active monthly use globally, and Apple announced a year and a half ago that there were over 1 billion iOS devices in active use. These are mostly smartphones, and they are no longer novel. Wait for it But just because you’re not seeing amazing new consumer tech products on Amazon, in the app stores, or at the Apple Store or Best Buy, that doesn’t mean the tech revolution is stuck, or stopped. In fact, it’s just pausing to conquer some major new territory. And, if it succeeds, the results could be as big, or bigger, than the first consumer PCs were in the 1970s, or even the web in the 1990s and smartphones in the first decade of this century. All of the major tech players, companies from other industries, and startups with names we don’t know yet are working away on some or all of the new major building blocks of the future. They are: artificial intelligence / machine learning, augmented reality, virtual reality, robotics and drones, smart homes, self-driving cars, and digital health / wearables. All of these things have dependencies in common. They include greater and more distributed computing power, new sensors, better networks, smarter voice and visual recognition, and software that’s simultaneously more intelligent and more secure. Examples of all these technologies already exist, but they are early, limited, and mainly attractive to enthusiasts. Compared to what’s coming, they are like the Commodore PET (look it up, kids) or those huge car phones in old movies. Ambient computing I expect that one end result of all this work will be that the technology, the computer inside all these things, will fade into the background. In some cases, it may entirely disappear, waiting to be activated by a voice command, a person entering the room, a change in blood chemistry, a shift in temperature, a motion. Maybe even just a thought. Your whole home, office and car will be packed with these waiting computers and sensors. But they won’t be in your way, or perhaps even distinguishable as tech devices. This is ambient computing, the transformation of the environment all around us with intelligence and capabilities that don’t seem to be there at all. It reminds me of a great Saturday Night Live skit, from 2005, where cast member Fred Armisen, playing Steve Jobs, shows off an ever-smaller series of iPods, finally producing a model that’s literally invisible, yet holds “every photograph ever taken.” Just in recent weeks, Facebook’s famed researcher Regina Dugan has announced that her secretive team is working on using the brain to type, and to control augmented reality devices. They are also developing ways to “hear” through your skin. Their idea is that, even if augmented reality gets built into standard eyeglasses and can impose sophisticated virtual objects onto real life, it won’t be seamless if you have to push buttons, use touch controls or utter commands. the computer inside all these things will fade into the background — it may even disappear Apple reportedly has a secret project to monitor the glucose levels of diabetics with new non-invasive sensors, ending the need for daily test needles. Google has changed its entire corporate mission to be “AI first” and, with Google Home and Google Assistant, to perform tasks via voice commands and eventually hold real, unstructured conversations. Several small firms are pursuing the prospect of recharging mobile devices with power sent through the air, so power cords won’t be around. I expect to see much of this new ambient computing world appear within 10 years, and all of it appear within 20. Why it matters Every one of these efforts has the potential to create a new world that’s unrecognizable. It’s a radically different way of thinking about tech. When the internet first arrived, it was a discrete activity you performed on a discrete hunk of metal and plastic called a PC, using a discrete software program called a browser. Even now, though the net is like the electrical grid, powering many things, you still use a discrete device — a smartphone, say — to access it. Sure, you can summon some internet smarts through an Echo, but there’s still a device there, and you still have to know the magic words to say. We are a long way from the invisible, omnipresent computer in Starship Enterprise. Computers have gotten vastly easier to use, but they still demand attention and care Worse, those early computers were in your way. They were hulking objects that demanded space and skill. Even now, if you look around a restaurant, you’ll see smartphones on the tables, waiting to be used. Computers have gotten vastly easier to use, but they still demand attention and care, from charging batteries to knowing which apps to use and when to use them. Technology has been a great thing, but it’s been too unnatural, an add-on to life, for 40 years. What’s going on in the labs has the promise to change that. The dark side Some of you who’ve gotten this far are already recoiling at the idea of ambient computing. You're focused on the prospects for invasion of privacy, for monetizing even more of your life, for government snooping and for even worse hacking than exists today. If the FBI can threaten a huge company like Apple over an iPhone passcode, what are your odds of protecting your future tech-dependent environment from government intrusion? If British hospitals have to shut down due to a ransomware attack, can online crooks lock you out of your house, office, or car? Good questions. My best answer is that, if we are really going to turn over our homes, our cars, our health, and more to private tech companies, on a scale never imagined, we need much, much stronger standards for security and privacy than now exist. Especially in the US, it’s time to stop dancing around the privacy and security issues and pass real, binding laws. And, if ambient technology is to become as integrated into our lives as previous technological revolutions like wood joists, steel beams, and engine blocks, we need to subject it to the digital equivalent of enforceable building codes and auto safety standards. Nothing less will do. And health? The current medical device standards will have to be even tougher, while still allowing for innovation. The tech industry, which has long styled itself as disruptors, will need to work hand in hand with government to craft these policies. And that might be a bigger challenge than developing the technology in the first place. The oligopoly Most of the work on this, especially what we and others can learn about and report about, is coming from the giant companies that make up today’s tech oligopoly — Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. But, as tectonic shifts like this occur in technology, oligopolies get shaken up. For instance: today, Apple is the biggest of the group. By all reports, it’s working seriously on AR, self-driving cars, and health initiatives. But its strict and admirable privacy policies make it harder for it to gather the vast amounts of data required for the best machine learning. Do the oligarchs have too much power? Microsoft is still trying to find a way to meld its formidable software and cloud expertise with a significant hardware business. The ad-based business models of Facebook and Google, now so dominant, could prove fickle. And Amazon has only had one really giant hardware hit — the Kindle — in its existence. But, even if these oligarchs all do fine, and their ranks swell by one or two, the country and the world will have to ask if they have too much power — and, if so, how to curb it without killing progress. The bottom line We’ve all had a hell of a ride for the last few decades, no matter when you got on the roller coaster. It’s been exciting, enriching, and transformative. But it’s also been about objects and processes. Soon, after a brief slowdown, the roller coaster will be accelerating faster than ever, only this time it’ll be about actual experiences, with much less emphasis on the way those experiences get made. As a gadget-lover, this makes me a little sad. But, as a tech believer, it’s tremendously exciting. I won’t be reviewing all the new stuff anymore, but you can bet I’ll be closely watching this next turn of the wheel. Thanks for reading. Mossberg out.

"Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum," Apple said in the application to the FCC that was first reported by Business Insider. "These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks. Per the application, Apple plans to run the tests, using the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands, in two locations, in Milpitas, Calif., and at a location that previously served as the company’s headquarters on Mariana Avenue. Apple’s far from alone in exploring the use of millimeter wave spectrum. Charter Communications, for example, is also conducting tests, and millimeter wave is the basis of a platform from Starry that’s currently being tested in Boston. Verizon, meanwhile, will test 5G trial in a handful of locations this year, and Nokia and AT&T are teaming up to trial 5G fixed-wireless streaming of the DirecTV Now OTT TV service over a 39 GHz system RELATED: Low Costs, Dense Markets Critical to Starry’s Success: Analyst Want to read more stories like this?

Since news organisation have transformed to digital first, software does continue to eat the world meaning new technology platforms appears quickly trying to become the new mainstream medias. Those platforms where users will read content, or be notified that a new content is available, are called “off-platform” in opposition to the news organisations own websites, referred as “on-platform”. At the Guardian, thanks to our digital content management architecture, where the content structure is separated from its presentation, we have been able to quickly integrate our content in them and cross-publish it to new platforms launched by the technology giants such as Google AMP, Apple News, Facebook Instant Articles, or Amazon Echo. This ability to deliver fast has allowed us to run extensive trials on the those platforms to assess their potential how they fit with our editorial and commercial objectives. However publishing is only one part of the integration, and the article will show how we have provide new features in editorial and analytics tools to support new platforms and social media. Twitter and Facebook social sharing cards preview Twitter and Facebook are driving a significant number of potential readers to our website, but the virality of an article on those social networks is dependant of quality of the sharing card. Adding the ability to preview how an article cards are going to look like before its publication has enabled writers to improve the image and associated description. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of social sharing guardian preview tool Illustration: Mariot Chauvin Facebook instant articles preview Facebook Instant Articles are rendered a bit differently than articles on our website, so again being able to preview how the content will look like has allowed content writers to optimise the content for both platforms, therefore we added this ability in our preview tool. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of Facebook Instant Article preview Photograph: Mariot Chauvin iOS Spotlight search referrer Before Apple News was launched iOS Spotlight search was driving a significant numbers of our audience to our platform but they were not correctly identified and so was reported as unknown in our in house analytics platform named Ophan. Diving into HTTP headers and query parameters we did find a way to reliably identify it as a referrer, and that has changed the organisation view of off-platform impact. As far as we know Ophan is the only analytics tools that is correctly identifying this platform. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of Ophan - the guardian analytics platform showing referrers Illustration: Mariot Chauvin WhatsApp & WeChat referrers Usually people tend to overestimate the impact of sharing platforms such as WhatsApp in the number of page views, but the best way to way to prove it is to correctly identify the page views coming from them and that is exactly what we did. Interestingly some piece of content become shared extensively on a specific platform. The South China sea case had enabled us to find a way to identify correctly WeChat. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of Ophan - the guardian analytic tools showing what is being read on WeChat Photograph: Mariot Chauvin Apple news & Amazon Echo platforms Apple news presented a specific challenge as it was not possible to add our custom tracking into this platform. We therefore had to use a dramatically limited API provided by apple, enabling us to only add pageviews every 6 minutes, losing a lot of useful metrics such as the reading time or the location of the reader. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of Ophan - the guardian analytics platform showing top 20 with referrers Photograph: Mariot Chauvin Integration of Amazon Echo was more limited but it has enabled us to discover which section of our website this audience was the most interested in and the time at which listeners where using device. Podcasts analytics Podcasts are published through RSS which is a distributed platform, enabling any client or application understanding this format to retrieve and read podcasts. Therefore you can’t rely on Apple provided analytics to have a comprehensive view of your downloads and subscriptions. To have proper analytics you have to some control in your distribution platform, usually a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Because our excellent CDN is a developer non-hostile technical platform you can adapt, we have been able to stream raw downloads logs and analyse them in real time them to understand better our audio audience. We have therefore extended Ophan to display the downloads analytics for all our podcasts. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of Ophan - the guardian analytics platform showing podcast downloads Illustration: Mariot Chauvin For a podcast or for an episode, one can breakdown downloads per country and per used platform (web and mobile apps). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of Ophan - the guardian analytics platform showing podcast episode downloads breakdown Illustration: Mariot Chauvin As with Amazon Echo, we think The Guardian is the only news organisation that have integrated audio analytics into their main real-time analytics tool allowing one to better understand how reading and listening audiences are interconnected.

If the ruling is upheld, Apple's tax bill is expected to be close to €13bn. However, this figure is still being calculated. Commenting on the process Finance Minister Michael Noonan said, "To find the legal basis of the exact amount when the sum is as big as €13bn - that takes a little time." "We're agreeing the basis of the calculation with the Commission, but it's work in progress," he added. European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager criticised Ireland last week over the length of time it is taking to recover unpaid Apple tax. "The calculation of the exact amount is a very difficult process and we're working closely with the Commission and if the Commission are a little patient, we'll collect the money," Mr Noonan said yesterday. Both Apple and the Irish Government have launched appeals against the EU's ruling which judged that Ireland had offered a 'sweetheart' tax deal to the US tech firm.   14:13 25 May 2017 Joseph Conroy 17 hours ago 4 Related articles Wayne Rooney left out of England squad for World Cup qualifier Company launches '3D printed' rocket from New Zealand NFL allowing players to celebrate once more An Post posts €15.6m annual loss most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography Met Éireann issues three rainfall warnings for Saturday Cleveland Cavaliers reach the NBA Finals Marco Silva decides to leave Hull City site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Where do Photos and iCloud Photo Library have to catch up, and should we be looking for from Apple at WWDC? Email a friend To Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Jason Snell More like this Hey Apple, let me control my iCloud Photo Library WWDC wish list: What we’d like from the Siri Speaker Apple Photos and Google Photos: Two photo apps compared Video Is Google Assistant better than Siri? | The iPhone Show Last week at the Google I/O developer conference, Google announced a raft of forthcoming additions to its Google Photos service. Since Google Photos runs on iOS and in any web browser, it’s a serious photo-storage option for Mac, iPhone, and iPad users—and in many ways, it’s way ahead of Apple’s Photos apps and iCloud Photo Library service. Then again, WWDC—Apple’s own developer conference—is in just two weeks. It’s an opportunity for Apple to declare where it’s taking Photos and iCloud Photo Library next. In the meantime, though, it’s worth pointing out where Google Photos is beating Apple’s offerings, and where Apple’s ahead—and how WWDC could be poised to change both sides of the equation. Apple’s advantages Apple I’ve spent an awful lot of time with Photos and iCloud Photo Library. You could say that I wrote the book on it, because I have. Spending that much time up close with any product makes you appreciate its features and deeply understand its flaws. Photos and iCloud Photo Library seem to be knocked reflexively by Internet commentators and critics alike, which is unfortunate—it’s actually a pretty impressive collection of features that work quite well. Keep in mind that iCloud Photo Library and the overhauled Photos app for Mac are only a couple of years old, and that the machine-learning features that allow Photos to let you search for all your photos of cats or zebras was only introduced last fall. These are, in some ways, Apple’s baby steps with a new product. Apple’s Photo offering has a few big advantages over Google Photos. If you’re a Mac user who prefers native apps to web apps, for example, Apple has a huge advantage—Photos is a real Mac application, while Google Photos runs entirely inside your web browser. There’s also the matter of security. With Google Photos, your entire photo library is available on Google’s servers, to be processed and analyzed in whatever way Google sees fit. In contrast, images in iCloud Photo Library are encrypted and Apple can’t see them when they’re off your device. There are a lot of advantages to Google’s approach, which I’ll get to shortly, but if you’re someone who feels uneasy about giving Google access to your personal data, Google’s approach will be a huge turn-off. Finally, iCloud Photo Library has an advantage on iOS that’s tied in to Apple’s status as the owner of the operating system. The Photos app can sync to iCloud Photo Library automatically, but third-party apps like Google Photos don’t have unlimited power to remain running in the background. Google Photos does its best to work around these limitations, but in my experience I can always count on my iCloud Photo Library to be properly synced with the latest changes in my library; with Google Photos, it’s a bit of a crapshoot. Google’s advantages Google Though Google’s reliance on analyzing your photos in the cloud is a drawback if you’re concerned about privacy, it’s got a lot of advantages. First among them, your photos need only to be analyzed once—and using Google’s powerful server hardware. Apple’s approach with Photos requires that every image be scanned for potential keyword matches on your device—which takes time and uses processor power, as many people discovered when they upgraded to iOS 10 or macOS Sierra last fall. What’s worse, the machine-learned keywords don’t sync via iCloud, so every device you use has to re-scan your entire library—a huge waste of time. With any luck, the next versions of macOS and iOS will allow photo data to sync across devices, saving this step. But the larger issue remains: Google’s ability to scan (and re-scan) your photos in the cloud lets it work faster and improve scanning quality as it adjusts its algorithms. Google also seems to have a head start on Apple when it comes to using machine learning; at the very least, the company has been quite vocal about how much it’s investing in its learning systems, while Apple’s been quieter on that front. However, I’m reluctant to claim that Google is destroying Apple in this area. I just did some random spot checks on my photo library in both Google Photos and Apple’s Photos app: Both of them produce some impressive finds as well as some laughable misfires. Yes, if I search for dogs in Photos, I’ll get photos of cows and cats. But when I do the same search on Google Photos, guess what? Cats and pairie dogs. That’s the state of machine learning today—on both sides of the fence. However, Google’s announcements last week show that it’s planning on leveraging what it learns about your photos in some clever new ways. The new suggested sharing feature will notice if people in your contacts list are present in photos you take, and ask if you want to share those photos with them. That’s a smart feature that Apple could implement, too—and is consistent with the Memories feature added to Photos last fall, which intelligently groups subjects and locations into collections. Google Photos will soon be able to print photo books, which will not come as news to Photos and iPhoto users who have been able to do this for more than a decade. But the fact that Google will use metadata gleaned from scanning photos via machine learning in order to assemble the books is intriguing. Apple’s book- and calendar-creation tools have languished since the iPhoto days; maybe people would be more inclined to print books or photos if the same technology that powers Memories could be used to lay them out? Google’s announcements at I/O included one that’s been on my mind in the two years since Apple introduced iCloud Photo Library: Sharing your library with a trusted partner. Though Apple has offered the ability to link iTunes accounts used by a family together for a while now, that feature is basically unconnected to iCloud Photo Library. (The one exception is a family shared album, which lets you manually choose to share photos—scaled down to three megapixels in size—with other family members.) My wife and I have wanted to pool our photo libraries for ages now—the alternative is for me to occasionally plug her iPhone into my Mac and import her photos, and for her to ask me to AirDrop photos I’ve taken to her when she wants to post them to Facebook. Google Photos will allow that now—and Apple needs to follow suit. But, you’re saying to yourself, what if you want to share some but not all photos with a partner? Google’s announcement takes this extra step, letting you specify that certain sorts of photos—for example, photos of specific people—be shared, while others aren’t. While offering an all-or-nothing library sharing feature would be nice, it’s even better if sharing can have some granularity. Google’s headed there now. Will Apple follow? Google’s added even more intelligence to something that was already a strength of Google Photos—intelligently analyzing your photos and suggesting ways to make them better. At I/O, the company demonstrated an editing tool that detected a chain-link fence between a camera and the subject and removed it automatically. Google Photos already will assemble animated GIFs out of a series of still photos, ready for sharing. This sort of stuff is smart, because it offers new ways to enjoy and share our photos without requiring us to do extra work. That’s one of the next frontiers of photo technology—how do we take the tens of thousands of photos in our libraries and the dozens more we shoot on a daily basis and do something with them? It’s too much for a person to wade through manually. We need intelligent assistants to help us do the job. Google and Apple are both heading there. I hope Apple’s still working hard on this front and we’ll find out more in June at WWDC. Finally, one last note about where Apple’s behind: The cost of storage. Google offers unlimited free photo storage, though if you’ve got very large photos or videos, those items will be stored at a reduced resolution. If you pay extra to keep those large items at full resolution, Google’s cloud storage costs what Apple's does, but it's awfully hard to argue with free. Apple allowing families to share storage would be a positive step, as would offering a free tier that would allow a generous amount of iPhone backup and photo storage. Apple’s photo offerings aren’t out of the game. It’s got some tough competition, but it’s been making strides of its own. Let’s hope that with iOS 11 and the next version of macOS, Apple’s approach to storing and sharing photos keeps getting better.

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | May 25, 2017 -- 13:20 GMT (06:20 PDT) | Topic: Smartphones Apple will officially open its retail store in Singapore on May 27, marking its first outlet in Southeast Asia and touted to be the first in the city-state to operate fully on solar power. Located along Singapore's Orchard Road shopping strip, the new two-storey retail space featured a glass facade--spanning 36.57 metres long and comprising glass panels each 14 metres high--as well as a 7.62-metres long canopy to provide shelter from the city-state's tropical climate. The store also was flanked by two curved Castania stone staircases, which design was inspired by the Apple Park campus in Cupertino. According to Apple, the Orchard Road outfit currently had 237 employees, more than 25 percent of whom were existing employees that moved from call centres or other parts of the business. It comprised two Genius Groves, in which customers could sit through hands-on sessions or get help from Apple's technical consultants. The new store and the company's local operations also ran fully on solar power, the result of a "long-term contract" Apple signed with Singapore-based solar energy provider, Sunseap Group. This was part of the iPhone maker's goal to power all of its facilities worldwide entirely on renewable energy, including hydro and wind power. The Orchard Road site would join Apple's global network of almost 500 stores worldwide that were visited by more than 1 million a day, it said. Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail, said: "We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn, or connect with others in their community." The vendor in January confirmed plans to open a store in South Korea, but would not reveal an official opening date. Local reports said construction for the retail space had began in Seoul and was estimated to be completed by end-November.

By David Snelling David Snelling PUBLISHED: 10:05, Thu, May 25, 2017 | UPDATED: 10:25, Thu, May 25, 2017 UKAndroid v iPhone and why one is being targeted by hackers The Android v Apple war continues to rage on with fans of both brands hailing their devices are the best. Whilst Apple's iPhone is still hugely popular there's no doubting that, with devices such as the Samsung's new Galaxy S8, HTC's U11 and the upcoming OnePlus 5, Android is producing some serious competition for the US technology giant. However, there is still one area where it seems Apple has the upper hand. Recent reports, coming out of China, are suggesting that there has been a huge 39 per cent surge in malware with almost all of it aimed at Google's popular operating system. In fact 99.9 per cent of this malware is reported to target Android devices. The Internet Society of China and National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center say they have discovered two million new malicious mobile attacks 2016. And one engineer has revealed that an incredible 1.9 billion smartphones running on Android could be hit by these new cyber threats. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, prototype phones, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 30 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button So why is Android more vulnerable? One of the issues for Android is the way that updates are released. Unless users own one of the latest Google-branded devices, such as the Pixel, it's unlikely they will have access to the very latest software. This is due to both manufactures and mobile networks having to test crucial updates before they are released to customers. Android security team member Adrian Ludwig recently told TechCrunch that as of the end of 2016 some 78 per cent of all flagship smartphones in North America were up-to-date with security patches. That's not bad. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 - Is this what Samsung's next smartphone will look like? Wed, April 26, 2017 SAMSUNG'S Galaxy S8 has just been released but the firm's next smartphone could be the on to buy. Play slideshow DBS DESIGNING 1 of 8 Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Unfortunately, it seems that older Android devices may not get the same level of updates as their top-end siblings. "About half of devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received a platform security update in the previous year" Mr Ludwig admitted in a Google blog post. By comparison, just over five months afetr Apple released its new iOS 10 operating system some 79% of active iOS devices had adopted it. That means those iOS users are well protected against the latest security threats. Thanks to its tight control of both hardware and software, Apple is capable of pushing device owners to the latest software updates. The technology firm also persistently notifies iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch owners to update to the latest iOS version, including offering the option to have the software update install overnight while the device is plugged in. Google is working on new fixes that should make it easier and faster for its hardware partners to issue updates, like Apple does with its iOS devices. Writing on the Google blog, Mr Ludwig confirms: "We're working to increase device security updates by streamlining our security update program to make it easier for manufacturers to deploy security patches and releasing A/B updates to make it easier for users to apply those patches." However even if manufacturers manage to streamline the roll-out of their security patches – Android smartphone owners will still be at the mercy of mobile carriers. The most reliable way to ensure your Android device is up-to-date and protected against the latest security threats is to use a Nexus or Pixel phone, since these are overseen by Google itself.

For people with diabetes, this would be a huge improvement over the somewhat invasive or downright painful options they currently rely on. But experts warn that if the rumors are true, Apple will be facing a scientific and technological battlefield littered with decades of other companies’ failures. If Apple is chasing a needleless blood sugar monitor, it wouldn’t be that surprising. (Apple declined to comment.) After all, the market would be massive. About 30 million Americans have diabetes, a disease caused when there’s too much sugar, or glucose, in the blood. People with diabetes have to carefully titrate their food intake, or even inject the hormone insulin in order to keep their blood sugar from spiking or dropping to dangerous levels. So regularly measuring blood glucose is key. Illustration by Rosy Warren / The Verge Right now, it’s also unpleasant. People with diabetes have to prick their fingers to draw blood, or wear a monitor that inserts a tiny tube beneath their skin to continuously measure glucose in the fluid between cells (the same fluid that spills out when you pop a blister). So a needleless device — preferably one that continuously monitors glucose levels and spits them out in real time — would be a huge upgrade. A needleless device would be a huge upgrade “That is the holy grail,” says Eric Topol, the director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute who also sits on the board of glucose monitor manufacturer Dexcom. And that’s why so many before Apple have made the attempt. Google tried to develop a contact lens to detect glucose in tears, but ever since pharmaceutical giant Novartis licensed the technology in 2014, the project’s gone quiet. (A spokesperson for Alcon, a division of Novartis, told The Verge in an email: “We’re working together to initiate larger clinical trials in the near future, but do not have a definitive timeline to share today.”) “It’s an incredibly difficult problem,” says Mark Rice, an anesthesiologist and diabetes expert at Vanderbilt University. “Everybody thinks they have a way to do it, and everybody, so far, has failed.” Why? The hurdles are many — so let’s talk about a few of them. Glucose is actually a tough molecule to measure The first problem is that there’s only about a sugar packet’s worth of glucose floating through the blood, writes expert John L. Smith in his book The Pursuit of Noninvasive Glucose: Hunting the Deceitful Turkey. So, there’s not a lot of glucose to measure from the outset. The second problem is that glucose is actually a pretty boring molecule. It’s colorless, small, and it doesn’t have many distinguishing features. That’s why the current glucose tests use a chemical reaction to convert glucose into molecules that are easier to track, either because they have a color, or because they can generate electrical currents. “It’s an incredibly difficult problem.” These tests can be run at a clinical lab or, since the 1970s, in the comfort of your home using a glucometer. In both cases, you have to draw blood — for glucometers, this is done by pricking your finger and pressing a drop to a test strip. More recent continuous glucose monitors use a wire inserted beneath the skin that takes measurements every few minutes, and can deliver the results onto a smart device, like your phone or Apple Watch. Users still need to prick their fingers, though, to calibrate the device with the more accurate measurements from a glucometer. In fact, both tests are not always perfectly accurate: the test strips can go off if they’re not stored correctly; common drugs like Tylenol can interfere with the chemical reaction; and microorganisms and tissue can gunk up the sensor in a continuous monitor. And that’s dangerous. Inaccurate results could drive people to take insulin when they don’t need it or miss the signs of dangerously low blood sugar — which can lead to coma or even death. It’s hard to accurately test blood sugar without breaking the skin The problem with a device like Google’s contact lens is that the body likes to hold on to sugar. Sure, if blood sugar levels are too high, glucose will spill over into tears, spit, sweat, or urine. (In the 1600s, a physician who taste-tested diabetic pee reported that it was "wonderfully sweet as if it were imbued with honey or sugar.") But as blood sugar levels drop, the body holds on to this precious source of energy and stops leaking it into other fluids. This dooms the prospects of monitoring glucose from the bodily fluids you can access without puncturing the skin. Taste-testing pee: the original glucose test The original non-invasive glucose monitor. This urine wheel helped doctors diagnose diseases like diabetes by smelling, testing, and looking at pee. This one was first published by Ullrich Pinter in Epiphanie Medicorum, 1506. Image: The Royal Library, Copenhagen Some have tried to get to that blister-filling liquid under the skin without using a needle. In the early 2000s, the FDA approved a device called the GlucoWatch. It used a low electrical current to draw glucose right out of the body, where it was measured by sensors on the back of a tight-fitting watch. The problem was that the device was a pain to use: it caused a bad rash underneath the watch for 80 percent of the people who used it, according to an evaluation by ECRI Institute, a nonprofit research organization. It also took three hours to warm up before it could take a measurement; people with hairy arms needed to shave a clear patch for the sensor; and it didn’t work if the user got too sweaty. (This last one is a big design flaw, because sweatiness can be a symptom of dangerous drops in blood sugar.) The GlucoWatch is no longer on the market. So, is a needleless glucose sensor even possible? Technically yes, but again, it’s hard — right now, there aren’t any FDA-approved noninvasive glucose trackers. The two main methods attempted so far have been unsuccessful. One way to measure glucose through the skin is to monitor something that changes as result of blood sugar fluctuations — like how much light reflects off of your skin, for example. If you eat lots of sugar, your skin will get warmer or it might get shinier, Rice says. So you could theoretically have a device that monitors these physiological changes. “That’s how everybody gets fooled.” The problem is that plenty of other molecules can also cause these changes. And so measurements wouldn’t be very reliable day to day. “There are many technologies that correlate with glucose going up and down — and that’s how everybody gets fooled,” Rice says. Another more direct approach is to measure how much light the actual glucose molecules either scatter or absorb to figure out how much is in the blood. “There are thousands of patent applications to do this,” Rice says. He admits: “Some are mine.” So, for example, you could have a device that shines a near-infrared light through a thinner region of skin, like an earlobe, and measure the wavelengths that come out the other side. But the problem is that glucose is just one tiny, nondescript component of the complex chemical makeup of human tissue. So the main challenge with getting this method to work has been pulling glucose’s signal out of all the other molecular background noise. “That’s the whole secret,” says analytical chemist Mark Arnold at the University of Iowa, who has been working on this method in his lab. And he seems to have figured it out — at least, on rat skin. There’s only one problem with the setup: “It’s about the size of a small refrigerator,” he says. “Not a device that could work on somebody’s wrist.” FDA approval could take years Even if Apple settles on a strategy that somehow manages to noninvasively bypass the skin’s barrier, even if it develops a device that reliably and accurately measures blood glucose — there’s still the hurdle of FDA approval. “It’s very different to be a medical device manufacturer than a consumer product manufacturer,” says Brad Bonnette, a medical device evaluator at ECRI Institute. “They could certainly do it, but it would be a pretty big change.” “You can get it to market, and still not stick.” A noninvasive glucose monitor would probably fall into the category of a Class III medical device, Bonnette says. That’s reserved for products unlike anything else on the market that could seriously harm a patient if they failed. And it requires that a company get what’s called pre-market approval, a process that can take years. Then, once the device is on the market, there are still challenges to overcome. Bonnette guesses that a noninvasive monitor would initially only be available with a prescription. So that means that the company making the device will need to convince insurers to pay for it. “You’d have to prove to the insurers that it’s worth doing,” Bonnette says. So it might be worth it for Apple, or any other company entering this space, to consider the lesson of the GlucoWatch. “It’s not enough to get past all of these hurdles, to still be able to make money and have a successful device,” he says. “You can get it to market, and still not stick.” Next Up In Science This sneaky male fish steals eggs to clone itself NASA’s Juno spacecraft finds planet-sized cyclones and a dynamic magnetic field at Jupiter Early farmers and hunter-gatherers got it on with each other, study says Rocket Lab launched its experimental rocket to space for the first time — but didn’t reach orbit Time to say ‘I told you so’: cannabis can treat seizures Here are the microbes you can pick up at the hospital — and those you leave behind Now Trending Google’s blob emoji are great and no one will convince me otherwise May 25th, 2017 Mossberg: The Disappearing Computer Tech was once always in your way.

Transit directions allow users to navigate the Netherlands thanks to integration with the Intercity direct train line, various bus routes, trams, and ferries. Transit in the Netherlands includes up-to-date advisory information with the help of data accumulated from various local transportation companies including NS, Connexxion, and GVB (via iPhoned). With the data, Apple Maps can warn users about reduced service, or a complete service shutdown, and update their transit trip directions accordingly. Apple first added in a small amount of transit data to various Dutch cities last week, including the appearance of train, tram, and metro stations for a few areas, but had yet to turn on live schedule information for public transport. Most recently, areas including Singapore and Adelaide, Australia have received transit updates in Apple Maps. Transit directions first launched with iOS 9 back in 2015 with just a handful of cities supported, but now Apple has kept up a consistent pace with adding new areas all over the world. In total, more than 10 countries now include transit directions, as do most major United States cities like Boston, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. It appears the rollout in the Netherlands will be ongoing since the area has yet to appear on the supported transit list on Apple's website. Tags: Apple Maps, transit, The Netherlands 7 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) iTom17 18 hours ago at 06:06 am It comes totally unexpected to me. Not so long ago there was this article on the Dutch website iCulture.nl, about some 'preparations' rolling out in Apple Maps for Transit directions in The Netherlands. The assumption was it would see its full roll-out with iOS 11, but apparently Apple chose to release it earlier. I think it's a great move. One of the features I was really looking forward to. It works very well I think. Would be nice to be able to see at what platform trains stop, but overall it's very good. Now I can actually ditch the third-party 9292 app that is commonly used in my country for transit information. It's a good app, but the fact that Transit in Apple Maps seems to work so well AND that it is integrated with Siri as well is great. Works on my iPhone, Mac and even my Apple Watch. Will definitely be using it to its full extent. :) Good job Apple! Now you just need to bring Apple Pay, Apple News, QuickType suggestions, TV Shows etcetera to The Netherlands. It's progress though. :P Rating: 4 Votes RoelJuun 16 hours ago at 08:03 am Eeeeeindelijk.

Rating: 1 Votes truthertech 13 hours ago at 11:15 am Oh my god more than TEN WHOLE COUNTRIES!!!11 When Google maps transit was in iOS5 it converted every country and major city! OK, we will go through this one more time. Yes, if Apple wanted to do what Google did, they could simply import all of the transit data at once and Voila, you'd have it in every major city today. However, Google has been heavily criticized for the accuracy, etc., of its transit data, and Apple, after its debacle of a roll out, is committed to the best mapping experience possible. Thus, instead of simply importing all of the transit systems' data, ala Google, Apple has decided to customize each major transit region to make their transit more accurate and much more user friendly, which is hugely beneficial for transit users. The trade off is it obviously takes much longer to do this than simply importing the basic stock data. This article explains very well the different approaches, and why Apple Maps approach is superior. Having used both, I am glad Apple didn't simply mimic Google. http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/07/07/why-apples-transit-maps-are-rolling-out-so-slowly Rating: 1 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming MacBook Pro June 2017 Minor update to latest Kaby Lake processors expected at WWDC.

The relaunched handset went on sale in some Asian markets, featuring identical specs to the original model, with the exception of its storage; while the iPhone 6 was previously sold with 16GB, 64GB and 128GB storage options, the 'new' model is only available with 32GB. Since then, Apple has also brought the device to the United States, and to some European countries, through select carrier partners. Now, the 32GB iPhone 6 has also been released in the United Kingdom. The UK's largest carrier, EE, is offering the handset at no upfront cost on 24-month plans priced from £35.49 a month. At that price, you'll get 2GB of 4G data at up to 60Mbps, along with unlimited texts, 1000 minutes of talktime, and 3 months of BT Sport app access, as well as European roaming. The device is also available on a range of other plans, all of which include a free six-month Apple Music subscription. However, independent retailer Carphone Warehouse is also offering the iPhone 6 at far lower prices, not only on EE, but also on other networks, including O2 and Vodafone. On O2, for example, you can get the 32GB iPhone 6 from Carphone Warehouse for £0 upfront on a two-year plan priced at £29 a month, including unlimited minutes and texts, and 6GB of 4G data. The retailer is also selling the handset for £399 SIM-free for use on any network. Before you rush to buy it, though, don't forget that the iPhone 6 is almost three years old now, and that makes it ancient in the fast-moving smartphone market. Since the iPhone 6 made its debut in 2014, Apple has launched the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and its next-gen handsets are now just a few months away.

The bridge will enable all Wemo devices currently on the market to interact with an Apple user’s HomeKit setup. This will allow voice control of Wemo lights, plugs and switches via Siri as well as manual control through the iOS 10 Apple Home app. Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial The bridge will be available to buy in the fall for an unannounced price. The small puck-sized bridge connects to the home Wi-Fi router via an Ethernet cable. It then uses the Wi-Fi signal to communicate with Wemo devices in range and any iOS devices on the network, allowing the products to interoperate via HomeKit. Like bridges from other HomeKit accessory makers, the Apple Home app will display all Wemo accessories independently even though they are originating from the single Bridge. This allows users to individually toggle lights and add select accessories to scenes and automation triggers, as if they were independent products. The news means current and future Wemo products will work seamlessly with Apple devices (including a potential Siri Speaker rumored to be announced next month) once the bridge is available to buy. HomeKit integration means that Wemo users will be able to tell Apple’s voice assistant, Siri, things like ‘Turn off the lights’ and have their Wemo light switches dutifully obey. Belkin says the announcement answers an overwhelming request from customers who want to use Wemo devices with HomeKit. “Wemo is offering this bridge to address the overwhelming request from customers to make currently installed Wemo products work with HomeKit and other HomeKit compatible products,” said Brian Van Harlingen, chief technology officer at Belkin International. “We’re proud to work with Apple to bring together two of the most influential Smart Home platforms.  Wemo has been providing smart home devices for more than five years, and millions of people use Wemo devices every day.  The Wemo Bridge will allow current and future Wemo users to experience the benefits of HomeKit, including Siri integration and interoperability with other HomeKit devices while also leveraging all the Wemo features customers enjoy.” The beauty of HomeKit is that it allows iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch owners to integrate smart home products from different manufacturers into a single experience. This means if you already own some Wemo smart devices today, you can add them into your HomeKit home alongside accessories from Philips Hue, or whoever else. The Wemo Bridge will be available in the fall with pricing yet to be announced. Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

Notably, apps such as Airbnb, TripAdvisor are created with Swift. The curriculum can be downloaded for free from Apple's iBooks Store. This full-year course is designed by Apple engineers and educators with an aim to teach students the elements of app design using Swift, which is one of the most widely used programming languages. Initially, the curriculum will be offered to six community colleges in the US. Not only this, local businesses will also provide mentoring and internships to students in some of the campuses.

The app economy and software development are among the fastest-growing job sectors in America and we're thrilled to be providing educators and students with the tools to learn coding," commented Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Community colleges play a critical role in helping students achieve their dreams, and we hope these courses will open doors for people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue what they love," he further added. The colleges which will offer this course are the Alabama Community College System, Columbus State Community College, Harrisburg Area Community College, Houston Community College, Mesa Community College and San Mateo Community College District. Besides this, some select high schools will also introduce the app development curriculum to their students. App Development with Swift is an extension of Apple's open-to-all K-12 Everyone Can Code curriculum.

All links to apple.com/pr now redirect to apple.com/newsroom. At the same time, the company has also updated its executive biography pages with a fresh design update to fit in with the company’s recent website design trends and adopts the San Francisco typeface, finally retiring the Lucida Grande font. Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial The default Newsroom page focuses heavily on imagery, resulting in a pretty appearance but low information density. An Archive view exists for journalists that just want to see a compact list of press releases. The refreshed Apple Leadership page removes the extraneous surrounding chrome and focuses on the Apple executive’s photos and titles. The site now resides at a new URL: apple.com/leadership. The design of detail pages for individual executives have also been modernized, with a simpler header and two-column text layout. Any outdated elements present in the previous design, like the bezelled content view or janky ‘Continue reading’ pagination, have been removed. You can see a comparison of Tim Cook’s bio page in the screenshots below. Previous design New, modern, design As part of these changes, Denise Young Smith is now named as ‘Denise Young’. Her bio has not yet been updated to reflect her new role as Vice President of Inclusion and Diversity. The update brings a cleaner look and feel to a part of Apple’s web presence that was certainly showing its age; many of the elements of the previous design hadn’t even been updated for Retina displays. With iOS 10, Apple introduced a new application theme for stock apps like Music, News, and Home. Various parts of Apple’s website have also adopted this kind of appearance in recent months. About a month ago, Apple moved the Newsroom to a bolder San Francisco font weight too. Apple Newsroom design updated overnight with bold fonts, a design trend Apple started with some apps in iOS 10. pic.twitter.com/VPXl7spWW3 — Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) April 22, 2017 Little is known about Apple’s plans for iOS 11, but these changes certainly point towards a new global user interface language for Apple’s products and services. It would be great to see the new bolder aesthetics Apple introduced in iOS 10 spread to more apps in iOS 11.

One notably missing feature is the glass staircase which has traditionally been a signature design element of Apple’s retail stores. There is instead what is being reported as a stone staircase but may be a ceramic one. This design was first seen in the Nanjing store in China, and appears to be destined for the refitted 5th Avenue store in NY too … NordVPN CNET draws attention to the handrail, which is a carved slot in the wall following the spiral curve of the stairs – and looks quite stunning. Another rarely-seen feature is a boardroom intended for private meetings. Some other stores have these, using them for meetings with business customers and sometimes individuals, but they are tucked away out of sight. During the Apple Watch launch, they were used to hold private try-on appointments for the gold Edition model. The boardroom also has paintings of the Apple Park. Other interior elements are by now familiar: the Genius orchard, the wooden ‘bowling ball’ headphone holders, the giant screen and cube seating. You can see a selection of photos below, with more at CNET and MrBrown. Ben Lovejoy @benlovejoy Ben Lovejoy is a British technology writer and EU Editor for 9to5Mac.

Forums Join   Apple Submits Application to Test Millimeter Wave Broadband by Karl Bode Thursday May 25 2017 07:40 EDT You can add Apple to the long and growing list of companies conducting millimeter wave broadband trials as fifth generation (5G) broadband looms on the horizon. An application filed with the FCC for an experimental license indicates that Apple will be testing millimeter wave technology in two locations near the company's offices in Milpitas, California. The application makes particular reference to using the 28 and 39 GHz bands, which the FCC approved for commercial use for 5G services last year. "Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum," the application states. "These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks," the company added. Apple joins a growing roster of companies testing millimeter wave broadband including Starry, Google, Facebook, and most major cellular carriers. Because millimeter wave (mmWave) transmits at higher frequencies and a smaller wavelength of between 30 GHz and 300 GHz, it's capable of reducing latency and notably expanding data transmission capacity. There are, however, still line of sight issue with mmWave that hardware vendors are working to minimize. While companies are testing the hardware and software that will make up the standard eventually, the 5G standard still hasn't been completed, and any serious deployment of 5G technology isn't expected to occur until at least 2020. What exactly an Apple millimeter wave offering would look like in commercial practice isn't spelled out in the application. tags: competition · business · wireless · hardware · alternatives · consumers · cellular · Apple · 5G News Jump Consumers Demand FCC Investigate Bogus Net Neutrality CommentsVerizon's New SmartHub LTE Router Brings Unlimited Data HomeAt $98 Million, Charter CEO Nation's Highest Paid ExecutiveGOP Busted Using Cable Lobbyist Net Neutrality Talking PointsThursday Morning Links Altice Considering a Wireless Service, SomedayComcast Vendor Tries to Shutter Pro Net Neutrality WebsiteVerizon Promises Speeds up to 40 Gbps With Next-Gen FiOSDespite Promises, Comcast Customer Satisfaction Gets WorseFCC Net Neutrality Order Released, Comments Open Again----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Forums → Apple Submits Application to Test Millimeter Wave Broadband view: topics flat nest  tc1uscg join:2005-03-09 Wahiawa, HI tc1uscg Member Yesterday 8:13 am Here we go.

If you have an iPhone, it comes with the crap you need. If you want additional crap not supported by your device, then buy a device capable of supporting your crap. If the value doesn't exist in buying a different device then you've still got a fully functional device with existing crap. As for iPhones in corporate environment, I have one and don't have an issue. Everything corporate is done within Good (eventually AirWatch). Maybe I'm just lucky or naïve?

I was a switch tech for 10 years for sprint. would it make you feel any better if we were talking about Nortel switches and I said "oh by the way, I was a switch tech for Sprint for 10+ years", would that add any value to my rant about the shortage of reliable circuit packs? Or if I said that in that 10 years I have provisioned and used more cell phones for feature set testing then you will ever use in your life time, unless you were a switch tech, you would have no idea what I've worked with and on. My point was, as a IT guy, I deal with everything IT, including setting up phones. In my IT world, I deal with everything from our servers, firewalls, switches, routers, phones (both cell and VoIP desksets), printers, plotters, faxes, software, webpage(s) and SQL modifications for our database system. The ONLY support we rely on from a "vendor" is sending us replacement phones when one is broke. We take care of the rest.

Rock the gear that works best for your use and your wallet. Heck go Blackberry, or Windows if it tickles you right. The article is about testing mm wavelengths for new wireless and possible early attempts to bring devices into the still nonexistence 5G standards. Good on Apple for thinking ahead this time instead of delaying LTE like the 5 series. Maybe they learned something from the past, and are prepping for the future.

Since Cook took over, Apple's products and software has been a lot less stable, especially at launch. This is what happens when a company puts cutting-edge over quality. Personally, I'd rather have stability and reliability over cutting-edge, and I think a lot would agree.

Pretty sure I stated Rock the gear that works best for your use your wallet? My personal preference is bleeding edge tech. Some people like modified cars I like router computer and phones. Apple networth is in the 10 digit numerical value mines in the 6 digit value. They are certainly doing something better then me. I actually like the fact there trying to get ahead and be ready next generation wireless before standards are finalized makes me feel good about buying stock. Whatever there intent with the patent I hope they use it well. Again my post is against the devolving topic of Android/Apple. Hoping to stay on topic about the possibility of the tech and not flaming wars about who's product is better.

We have gotten to the point we do not stock spair buds, chargers, etc anymore for apple devices. We just order them when something breaks. Heck, I'm still using charge cables I used with my droids from 7 years ago and they work just fine, all fast charging and all. I was just kind of ranting since I had most of my morning wasted dealing with what I consider some short comings of apple phones and having to explain to some users why certain things don't work the way they use too. I'm sure they are good phones to the people who use them, but in my EXPERIENCE, I wouldn't use one if I got one free (I would give it to one of my kids).

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple was the first to deliver a MacBook with only USB-C Ports and now Intel will be bringing this to the PC in 2018 | Main | Apple has been in Talks with China's BOE Technology Group who has Patented Displays that recognize Fingerprint ID » May 25, 2017 Apple Continues to Advance a Hybrid Notebook with a Reconfigurable Surface Supporting a Virtual Keyboard & more   Back in 2011 Patently Apple posted a patent report titled "Apple Talks Up Smart Bezels + Live & Reconfigurable MacBooks." It was one of Apple's first MacBook patents that introduced a full virtual keyboard as noted in our cover graphic. The invention covers an illuminated MacBook input surface, a set up assistant, a live reconfigurable surface supporting a virtual keyboard and more. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a continuation patent application from Apple that refines and adds specific new patent claims to protect this invention. By adding new patent claims we're also able to verify that the project is still alive and that it's progressing as Apple refines certain aspects of the design.   Apple's patent FIG. 6 below provides us with a general overview of the proposed system that will rely on light sensors and haptics to form a virtual keyboard or other configuration that could technically support gaming, music playback and more; FIG. 10B illustrates a portable computing device having a virtual keyboard.   Apple's new Patent Claims In-Part   Patent Claim #1: Apparatus comprising: a display; a housing; and a virtual keyboard comprising: a plurality of sensors mounted within the housing, wherein the housing overlaps and hides the plurality of sensors from view, and wherein the plurality of sensors receive input through the housing; and a plurality of output devices mounted within the housing, wherein the plurality of output devices generate output in response to the input received by the plurality of sensors through the housing.   Patent Claim #4: The apparatus defined in claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises an array of capacitive sensors that receive the user finger input through the housing.   Patent Claim #5: The apparatus defined in claim 4, wherein the plurality of output devices comprises an array of light sources that illuminate the housing.   Patent Claim #6: The apparatus defined in claim 5, wherein the light sources illuminate the housing with symbols that change based on an input mode in which the apparatus is operating.   Patent Claim #7: The apparatus defined in claim 1, wherein the housing comprises a smooth surface without gaps that extends over the plurality of sensors and the plurality of output devices.   Patent Claim #8: A keyboard comprising: a housing layer; an array of capacitive sensors extending across the housing layer, wherein the capacitive sensors are configured to receive user touch input supplied to the housing layer; and an array of haptic output components extending across the housing layer that are configured to provide haptic feedback through the housing layer in response to the user touch input received by the capacitive sensors.   Patent Claim #10: The keyboard defined in claim 8, wherein the housing layer is formed of plastic.   Patent Claim #14: An electronic device comprising: a housing that forms a reconfigurable input surface configured to receive user touch input in a plurality of different input modes; an array of sensors that extend beneath and are hidden from view by the reconfigurable input surface, wherein the array of sensors detect the user touch input through the reconfigurable input surface; and an array of light sources that extend beneath the reconfigurable input surface and illuminate the reconfigurable input surface with lighted symbols that change based on the input mod.   Patent Claim #17: The electronic device defined in claim 14, wherein the lighted symbols illuminate a QWERTY keyboard pattern on the reconfigurable input surface in one of the plurality of input modes.   18. The electronic device defined in claim 17, wherein the lighted symbols illuminate controls for a media application including a play button on the reconfigurable input surface in another one of the plurality of input modes.   A Possible new Hybrid Device   The secret to this invention is that it also oddly covers tablets. You could read our original report for information on that. The reason that I'm bringing this up is because I've always communicated that the patent was about a MacBook. Yet technically it could be some kind of hybrid device. Technically it could now be updated to work with Apple Pencil which didn't exist when this patent was first filed.   Last September Patently Apple posted a patent report that covered two iPads being magnetically attached to form a dual iPad device. Of course this is what this patent covers but under the guise of a notebook design supporting USB ports etc.   This past February, an Apple patent application covered an iPad Pro smart cover that supported a new virtual keyboard. So it's evident that Apple is coming at this project from many angles. Which way Apple will go is unknown at this time. On the flipside, Apple could go both ways so that one is an iOS device while the other for macOS.   Apple's continuous patent application 20170147087 was filed in February 2017. The original filing date goes back to 2009. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   This kind of product is gaining popularity. Last month Expert Reviews gave the Lenovo Yoga Book five out of five stars. A video review from TechnoBuffalo below gives it two thumbs up as well, even with a few minor annoyances. The reviewer views it as a hybrid device and this is why I think Apple may be looking for a hybrid device as well.   While it won't be a device for everyone, with the right killer apps for gaming, iMovie editing, GarageBand and drawing apps, the hybrid could find a nice audience looking for a thin, super light reconfigurable device.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Sir Jonathan Ive, who is chief designer at the California-based company, told BBC Radio’s Today Programme that access to top talent “is terribly important for creating a context for multiple companies to grow and in a healthy way explore and develop new products and new product types". Sir Jonathan said the UK has a “fabulous tradition of design education” but is behind Silicon Valley as a technology hub.  Read more Fears of Brexit brain drain increase as engineers look to head home He celebrated the "tremendous cultural diversity" of Silicon Valley, which is home to tech giants such as Google and Facebook. The area has, "infrastructures to support start-up companies ... ranging from technological support through to funding", he said. "And there is the sense that failure isn't irreversible, so very often people will work on an idea, and there isn't the same sense of stigma when one idea and perhaps one company doesn't work out." The designer, who was recently appointed chancellor of the Royal College of Art, led Apple’s design team through its renaissance in the 1990s. He is responsible for Apple's signature style which so many other companies have since tried to imitate.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple New iPhone 8 pictures mean our worst nightmare might be happening Chris Mills BGR News May 24, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share If this new series of leaks is correct, Apple could be about to make a huge mistake. The biggest outstanding question about the iPhone 8’s design is whether it will have a Touch ID sensor on the rear, or build a fingerprint scanner into the screen itself. Rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, conveniently placed in optimum smudging location next to the camera, are a slap in the face to common sense. Samsung went that route with the Galaxy S8 this year, but a recent series of leaks suggested that Apple had come up with a better solution. Now, we’re not so sure.     Don't Miss: Somehow, everyone walked away from this massive Tesla crash Images that appeared on Weibo, spotted by 9to5Mac, show the front and back of an iPhone 8 in different colors. Most of the design lines up perfectly with other leaks we’ve seen: dual camera lenses, mounted vertically, and a full-screen edge-to-edge display on the front. But none of that really matters. What we’re focusing on here is the Touch ID sensor, prominently located on the back. It looks exactly like the Touch ID sensor you’re used to seeing on the iPhone, but located just below the Apple logo on the rear. That, by the way, lines up perfectly with a set of schematics that were shared last month. Now, it’s perfectly possible that those schematics and these images are fake. It’s incredibly simple to Photoshop one button into an image, especially since we have plenty of references for what a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor would look like. But the fact is that we definitely can’t rule out a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor on the iPhone 8. Playing devil’s advocate for a second, the execution of the Touch ID sensor in these images isn’t the worst. The major problem with how Samsung did the rear-mounted sensor on the Galaxy S8 is location: it sits right next to the camera, meaning you’re guaranteed to smudge the lens up all the time. In this image, you can see that the fingerprint sensor is much lower than the camera, nearly in the middle of the phone. The camera module is also in the top-right of the phone, far enough away from the fingerprint sensor that you probably can’t even reach it when holding the phone with one hand. Don’t get me wrong: moving from a front-mounted fingerprint sensor to one on the back is still a step back, and all of my fingers are crossed hoping that this leak is a fake.

TODAY file photo mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:45 PM, May 25, 2017 Updated: 8:00 PM, May 25, 2017 SINGAPORE — The Apple store at Orchard Road — officially known as Apple Orchard Road — will open its doors to the public on Saturday (May 27) at 10am. RelatedNews Singapore Apple store along Orchard Road to open May 27 May 17 At a media preview on Thursday, Apple Retail senior marketing director Denny Tuza said he believes the it "will be among the most popular in the world". Here's what you should know about Apple Orchard Road before its debut on Saturday. DESIGNED TO KEEP CUSTOMERS COMING BACK Apple has nearly 500 stores worldwide in 20 countries. Last year, the tech company rebooted its retail space design worldwide to improve customer experience.  The reboot was led by Apple's Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and senior vice president of retail Angela Ahrendts. Mr Ive is most famed for designing the iPod, which paved the way for the iPhone and iPad. Ms Ahrendts meanwhile left Burberry in 2014 to join Apple and was ranked 25th in Forbes list of the most powerful women in the world in 2015. Apple Orchard Road's interior design is in many ways similar to those around the world. The first floor is "The Avenue" where its core products — the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Macs — are on display, and also has "Windows" where peripheries are displayed according to categories like music, photography or gaming.  On the second floor, Apple attempts to evoke a "modern day town square" where customers can come to speak, learn or get tech support from the experts. The centrepiece is "The Forum", with seats for customers to listen in to talks or workshops that can be screened on a large high definition display. Flanking "The Forum" are two "Genius Groves". Apple Orchard Road is the first in the world to have two, instead of one Grove. They replace the "Genius Bar" found in older Apple stores. A canopy of trees in each grove, with cushioned seats for customers to speak to its tech experts are the main feature. When Apple first rebooted its stores, the idea was to get customers to see the products, learn how they all work together, and eventually buy into more products and services to improve their experience. To emphasise customer experience even further, Mr Tuza says its 36.6m long and 14m tall glass facade was "painstakingly" made to be extremely clear so as to blur the lines between the store and its exterior. "We want to remove any obstacles between us and the local community," he said. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY Apple Orchard Road runs entirely on renewable energy, using rooftop solar installations provided by Singapore-based solar energy provider Sunseap Group. Apple’s current corporate office at One North is also entirely powered by solar energy, making the company the first in Singapore to run exclusively on renewable energy. LEARNING FOR EVERYONE Local photographers, film makers, musicians, illustrators, developers and entrepreneurs will be conducting a series of educational sessions at the store once it opens. This will come under the Today at Apple programme which launched worldwide on May 17. The sessions will be held at "The Forum". The company is also organising photo and sketch walks out of its store. For instance, there will be sessions in street photography or shooting in low light carried out by in-house creative pros, or the Red Dot Heroes - local experts engaged by Apple. On May 28, photographer Chia Aik Beng will be holding a session about street photography in Singapore from 11am to 12.30pm. There will also be a session for kids on movie making on May 31 from 10am to 11am. Other sessions like coding or arts and design will also be held.  STORE INFORMATION Apple Orchard Road will open daily from 10am to 10pm. It is located at Knightsbridge Mall, 270 Orchard Road, sandwiched between The Paragon and The Heeren. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Singapore READ COMMENTED “Good progress” made in containing oil spillage after recent collisions “Bedding-in” period of several months to be expected for DTL2: Khaw ‘Zero tolerance’ for religious preaching that fans violence: Shanmugam ‘You have made Singapore very proud today’: PM Lee to Yip Pin Xiu ‘Wrecked dorm’ videos an isolated incident: SCDF Worker at S’pore Botanic Gardens jailed for showing obscene photo to boy Wholesale trade in Q1 2017 continues to climb What you should know about Apple Orchard Road ahead of its May 27 opening Two new bus services to launch with debut of Tuas West Extension Trump officially nominates KT McFarland to be next US ambassador to Singapore Trans-Cab to up checks after 10% of cabs fail tests Trans-Cab taxi catches fire at Marymount Road, second case in a month Trainee teacher becomes first female Singaporean to scale Everest in 2017 TODAY's morning brief for Wednesday, May 24 TODAY's morning brief for Tuesday, May 23 Inside Today World Philippines says foreigners fighting alongside IS-linked rebels Air strike in east Syria kills 35: Observatory Indonesia police arrest three suspected of links to Jakarta bombing Singaporeans among foreign militants fighting Philippine army in Marawi China executes former senior police officer for murder, bribery Business U.S. inflation path since 2012 is worrisome, policymaker says China's reforms not enough to arrest mounting debt: Moody's OPEC disappointment hits oil, stocks; sterling down on UK vote jitters Singapore’s firm orders six Airbus jets worth S$1.45 billion Fed's Bullard says BOJ must communicate carefully any tapering to markets Sports Cristiano Ronaldo faces minimum 15 months prison sentence over alleged tax fraud Medal at world championships a tall order for Team Singapore paddlers Sports Hub CEO Sawhney resigns, slams allegations Schooling’s gunning for more than one medal at World C’ships in July Football: Liverpool and Leicester to play in Hong Kong in July Entertainment Ling Kai to sing her No. 1 hit in star-studded concert ‘Baywatch’: A romp full of surf, sand and lots of skin What is it really like to be The Sam Willows?

Footage of an iPhone 8 dummy model hands-on has emerged online, confirming some of the most talked about possibilities for the new Apple flagship device. Posted on YouTube by Benjamin Geskin using the account iVenyaWay, the 10-second footage provides iPhone 8 anticipators a quick-but-meaningful glance at the new Apple device. According to Tech Times, this clip offers clues about what the upcoming flagship device would look like ahead of its release. The video shows a black iPhone with metallic lining on the side where buttons presumably for the volume and phone lock functions. Apple’s iPhone 8 alleged dummy also appears to have no home button or any visible parts that can serve as the Touch ID sensor which may have confirmed some of the early speculations about the new Apple phone. In November 2016, Gadgets 360 reported about rumors going around that Apple is ditching the Home Button for the iPhone 8 which will have an edge-to-edge screen. The article which described the home button as “the most important way of interacting with an iPhone” noted how the Cupertino-based company has taken initial steps towards this goal after the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were both launched without the physical Home button. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] “The fact that this year’s iPhone models ditched the physical button with a haptic simulation of a button press, makes the rumor somewhat believable.” With the alleged iPhone 8 dummy model hands-on video surfacing, such rumors may soon become a reality as Benjamin Geskin adds insult to the injury by sharing pictures of the alleged device on Twitter. Check it out. #iPhone8 Dummy pic.twitter.com/YyKJm3a7MO — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 23, 2017 Based on the footage of the iPhone 8 dummy, Apple’s new flagship device will be encased in solid black glass—both front and back—matched with the traditional volume control and power buttons on each of the metal sides. At the bottom is a part which looks like either a mic grille or speaker as well as a port for USB-C or a lightning-like connection. If the subject of the video is really Apple’s iPhone 8 dummy model, Tech Times believes that this could mean that Apple will either embed the sensor under the display like what it did with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus or trade the Touch ID sensor with an iris scanner. Aside from that, the presence of the physical volume control and power buttons on the sides also debunks the idea that the company is removing all physical buttons. Of course, all that is based on whether or not such dummy model is indeed an authentic copy of the highly anticipated iPhone 8 so it would be best to take such information with a grain of salt. iPhone 8 Release Date & Specs Rumor Round-Up Based on GSM Arena’s collection of rumored specs for the device, iPhone 8 will sport a 4.7-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen display which is made of ion-strengthened glass with “oleophobic coating.” In terms of memory and RAM, the device is said to have 32, 128, and 256 GB memory variants paired with a 3GB RAM. Its rear camera is pegged to be 12 megapixels that can take 4K video and 8MP image while recording simultaneously. The selfie snapper is rumored to be 7 megapixels, with face detection, HDR, and panorama capabilities. While Tech Times already mentioned the possibility of an iris scanner on Apple’s iPhone 8, the device’s specs in GSM Arena only included a front-mounted fingerprint sensor for its accessibility and security features.

Qualcomm has effectively accused Apple of blackmailing it by instructing its suppliers to withhold royalty payments. Qualcomm makes the accusation in a court filing requesting an injunction against all four of Apple’s iPhone manufacturers … NordVPN Barrons cited the relevant section – the bold part is our emphasis. Apple has interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing contracts with the Contract Manufacturers, instructing them to withhold more than [redacted] in royalties (to date) owed under the terms of their license agreements. But Apple has not stopped there. Instead, Apple has made clear that it will continue to embargo all Qualcomm royalties, for all Apple products, for the indefinite future. By withholding billions of dollars in royalties so long as Qualcomm defends itself against Apple’s claims, Apple is hoping to make litigation unbearable for Qualcomm and, thereby, to extract through a forced settlement what it knows it cannot obtain through judicial process—a below-market direct license. Apple’s tactics are egregious. Apple is tortiously interfering with the Contract Manufacturers’ license agreements; its conduct also provides a separate and independent basis for concluding that Apple is an unwilling licensee; Apple is not disputing that it must pay royalties to Qualcomm for patented wireless technology, but it believes that a contract which requires it to pay a percentage of the cost of an iPhone is unreasonable. CNET highlighted comments made about the case by Apple CEO Tim Cook during the most recent earnings call. The reason that we’re pursuing this is that Qualcomm’s trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s Q2 investors call. “And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it’s one small part of what an iPhone is. It’s not — it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don’t think that’s right, and so we’re taking a principled stand on it.” Although a percentage of the iPhone cost has always been the basis of the agreement between the two companies, Apple likely wants to change this as it prepares the iPhone 8, which is expected to sell for a higher price than earlier models. The most recent analyst estimate suggests that the iPhone 8 will max out at $1,070. The battle began when the FTC accused Qualcomm of effectively giving itself a monopoly by saying that it would charge Apple higher patent royalties unless the company agreed not to source baseband processors from its competitors. Apple then sued Qualcomm in several different countries, Qualcomm countersued, tried to get iPhone imports banned and said that iPhone suppliers were withholding around $1B in overdue royalties. It subsequently sued the suppliers directly, and now seeks an injunction forcing them to continue payments until the main case is resolved.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Published:May 25, 2017 4:35 pm In the application, Apple has mentioned 28 and 39GHz bands, which were approved by FCC for commercial use of 5G apps last year. Apple is reportedly testing 5G technology near its headquarters in California, and has filed an application for experimental license, according to a report in Business Insider (BI). The site quoted excerpts from FCC document, which reads, “Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum. These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks.” Apple will make use of millimeter wave technology of mmWave to perform the tests. In the application, the Cupertino technology giant has  mentioned 28 and 39GHz bands, which were approved by FCC for commercial use of 5G apps last year. The company will test the next-generation wireless technology at two fixed points in California – Milpitas and Mariana Avenue. 3GPP, which is the Cellular Standards group, has already unveiled the approved logo for 5G. However, a report in The Verge points out that 5G technology mostly doesn’t exist yet given International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the 3GPP haven’t released standards for 5G. Last month, AT&T started testing 5G Evolution technology in select areas in Austin. It will be rolled out for over 20 major metro areas by the end of this year. The 5G Evolution internet speeds are said to be twice the speed of AT&T’s 4G network, and Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+ users will be able to access the same. In India, Nokia and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) will team up to accelerate the development of a 5G ecosystem.

 Qualcomm wants manufacturers to pay up during its massive legal fight with Apple Shona Ghosh May 25, 2017, 6:55 AM 2,255 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP Qualcomm isn't backing down in its massive legal fight with Apple over royalty payments. The chipmaker has asked a US court to force iPhone suppliers to keep paying it royalty fees, while it continues its legal battle with Apple. In an injunction filed on Wednesday, Qualcomm said it wants third-party manufacturers for the iPhone, like Foxconn, to pay licensing fees. We first saw the filing reported by Axios. In a statement given to Axios, Qualcomm general counsel Dan Rosenberg said: "We are confident that our contracts will be found valid and enforceable but in the interim it is only fair and equitable that our licensees pay for the property they are using." This is just one strand of Qualcomm and Apple's complicated fight. The dispute began when Apple sued Qualcomm in the US, UK, and China. Qualcomm licenses technologies that are used in the iPhone. It doesn't license to Apple directly, but to third parties like Foxconn. And, according to Apple, Qualcomm massively overcharges for those patents. The firm has denied that charge, calling Apple's claims "baseless." Apple stopped paying its third-party manufacturing partners for those Qualcomm licenses last month and, with its latest filing, the chipmaker's trying to force payments while the dispute is ongoing. Qualcomm said it would suffer "irreparable harm," because the fees being withheld are worth "billions of dollars." There's another layer of complexity: Qualcomm filed a bunch of counter-claims last month, and added to these in a separate filing on Wednesday. The company said Apple had built the most valuable tech firm in the world by "relying significantly" on technologies "pioneered" by Qualcomm. It also complained about Apple's "strong-arm tactics." "Apple’s tactics are egregious," the company wrote. Apple has argued that Qualcomm charges for royalties it has nothing to do with, and that the chipmaker's benefiting from Apple's innovation rather than its own. In an earnings called in January, Apple CEO Tim Cook compared Qualcomm to a shady furniture seller. "It's somewhat like buying a sofa and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the house that it goes into," he said.

Sarah Schmid Stevenson May 24th, 2017 @XconomyDET_AA @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints As the CEO shake-up at Ford was unfolding this week—Mark Fields was ousted from the top spot in favor of Jim Hackett, who had been leading the automaker’s self-driving car and mobility efforts—Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen issued a sick burn: “Today’s car makers are like Nokia—right before it was crushed by Apple.” Ouch. Andreessen was talking to Bloomberg about the race between the auto and tech industries to get self-driving cars on the road, and his belief that “the entire experience of being in the car will be defined by software.” While few analysts would argue with that, there remains some debate about who will take autonomous vehicle technology to the consumer market first. Will it be a company similar to Apple or Google, or will it be a Ford or GM? Meanwhile, the Detroit News reports that on Tuesday morning, Hackett was interviewed by Paul W. Smith on WJR radio, a station based in metro Detroit. Hackett said Ford is going all in on self-driving cars because it expects the reams of data generated and collected by autonomous vehicles to be profitable enough to withstand the auto industry’s uncertain sales cycles. Car makers have enjoyed a more profitable couple of years recently, thanks in part to the pent-up demand that grew during the recession. But that period is coming to a close, and anyone with teenagers in their family can tell you how little interest young people have in driving cars, let alone owning them. In order to survive these demographic and economic trends, the auto industry will have to explore other avenues, like monetizing the vast amount of data that will come with self-driving cars. Hackett contended that traditional auto manufacturers are undervalued by investors compared to sexier companies like Tesla. From the Detroit News: “‘(Auto companies) generate tremendous value for shareholders,’ but investors don’t appreciate that, he said. ‘The long-term fix to that though, is that inside of our industrial businesses will be digital businesses, businesses that today have (ratios) a dozen times more than ours. And I think the vehicle business will always be the larger portion, but the digital businesses will not only add earnings power, but they’ll be anti-cyclical. Because when we have a recession, while maybe the vehicle sales will drop, people will still use them, and we’re going to earn revenue around use in the future in a really profound way.'” Andreessen would likely disagree with Hackett. He told Bloomberg that Tesla is going to revolutionize cars the same way Microsoft innovated desktop computers with its Windows operating system. “There’s no existing legacy car company in the world today” that would agree with that, he said. “They would all say that they are best at making cars, and that the software is a component that goes in the cars. Our thesis is, no, what’s actually going to happen is the value will flow to the software layer.” However, autonomous vehicles can’t exist without the hardware, and that hardware still needs to pass a heap of safety regulations before being approved for the open road. Nor can self-driving cars be properly commercialized without a network of dealerships or some other distribution channel that allows people to kick the tires, so to speak, before plunking down their hard-earned money. Ford has long claimed to be leading its fellow manufacturers in the development of autonomous vehicles, going so far as to predict it will have self-driving cars on the road by 2021. But that doesn’t track with the way investors view the company, according to the Detroit News. Its analysts say Ford appears to be lagging behind Tesla, Uber, and rival GM in “disruptive mobility.” Jeff Schuster, LMC Automotive’s senior vice president of forecasting, told the newspaper that “even if all of Ford’s investments and projects are progressing steadily, the company is behind General Motors Co., Google’s self-driving Waymo spinoff and others that have rolled out new developments and partnerships in recent years.” Hackett told Smith during his radio interview that Ford needs to do a better job communicating its innovation strategy with investors and consumers, and make faster decisions in a notoriously slow-moving industry. Andreessen, whose venture firm has invested in self-driving car companies such as Comma.ai and DeepMap, said car companies like Ford are already lagging behind the tech industry. “As you know, in phones you used to have these companies like Nokia, RIM and others that made phones and used software as just this sort of add-on to the hardware. Car CEOs, the new generation, they’re all working on this. They’re spending a lot of time out here [in Silicon Valley], and they’re spending a lot of time with us. But literally, the way they frame that question is, ‘We, existing car company, do not want to be the Nokia of cars.'” Andreessen predicts that Tesla, with its Apple-like model of producing both the hardware and software needed for self-driving cars, will win the race, but cautions that there is a flood of new Silicon Valley competitors nipping at its heels.

Light Reading reports that Apple wants to test on 28GHz and 39GHz spectrum as momentum grows in 5G research from the device perspective. It also notes that most US operators have holdings in those spectrum bands and that there is a growing global consensus that these will be key components to the high data-rate features of 5G, although many issues still need to be resolved before such tech is viable in the field. “Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum. These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks,” said the Apple FCC filing.

And, now, technology giant Apple, based on a recent filing with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, is getting into the mix. Based on the application, Apple will conduct its testing in high-band frequencies ranging from 27.5 GHz to 28.35 GHz and 38.6 GHz to 40 GHz. The experimental link will span about 10 miles between facilities in Cupertino and Milpitas, California. A lot of these 5G-related testing applications list familiar vendor names like Nokia and Ericsson. What stands out in the Apple application is that the company is working with equipment manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz, a major test and measurement firm, and companies Analog Devices and A.H. Systems. Analog Devices has a deep bench of RF-related products including solutions to address operation in millimeter wave and microwave frequencies as well as tools related to multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) and beamforming. The company’s CTO of the Communications Business Unit Thomas Cameron wrote in a whitepaper, “As the arrival of 5G gets ever closer, it will continue to generate challenges for designers. When determining the best technology solution for millimeter wave radio applications, it is beneficial to consider all aspects of the signal chain, as well as the various advantages of different IC processes. As the 5G ecosystem develops, Analog Devices is focused on and committed to providing our customers with a broad technology portfolio, including a wide range of circuitry design processes, and a systems level approach, based on our unique bits to millimeter wave capability.” A.H. Systems also has a broad portfolio that includes everything from antennas and probes to RF cables and amplifiers. According to a narrative taken from Apple’s application paperwork and first published by Business Insider, “Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum. These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks.” The testing “will include the use of a horn antenna with a half-power beamwidth of 20 degrees in the E-plane and H-plane and a downtilt between 20 – 25 degrees.” While Apple hasn’t publicly articulated any of it’s plans specific to 5G, the company has been a member of the Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance since 2014.   Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Posts Related Posts 5G Apple millimeter wave Rohde & Schwarz test and measurement About Author Sean Kinney Managing EditorSean Kinney focuses on multiple subject areas including DAS, small cells, cloud computing, 5G and Internet of Things vertical applications.

PYMNTS.com data showed that the percentage of iOS users that had tried Apple Pay fell to 21.9% in March, 2017 from 23.8% in June last year. Furthermore, of those that had used Apple Pay, just 18.7% said they "use it at every opportunity" compared with 48% who said so a year earlier. Perhaps Jennifer Bailey's announcement, reported in The Telegraph, will boost Apple Pay adoption. Bailey, head of Apple's payments business, advised that the majority of the contactless terminals in the UK are now "limitless" which means retailers can accept far higher-value payments than the current £30 cap. "Limitless" is something of a misnomer as most retailers will set a limit. While some reports suggest that mobile payments have struggled to gain traction among consumers, others provide a more positive outlook. Apple, too, are optimistic.

The announcement was made last week on Apple's iTunes Connect resource page, and the first reports are coming through that the price changes are equating to small savings in some countries, owing to favorable exchange rates. App Store pricing in Romania is now showing in the country's Leu currency, which has made books, apps, and songs a little cheaper, according to iTutorial.ro. For example, an individual music track that cost 15,42 lei before the change, now costs 14,99. Small savings also extend to Apple Music and iCloud subscriptions. Similar subscription savings have been reported by ThinkApple in Poland, where many prices have been converted at a rate of 1 euro to around 4 zloty, which is currently lower than that offered by banks. Savings in the region aren't as forthcoming in the App Store, however, with some prices actually a little higher. As well as Poland and Romania, Apple is switching store currencies in Bulgaria (Lev), Czech Republic (Koruna), and Hungary (Forint). In addition, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, and Peru are changing to local currency from the U.S. dollar. Developer proceeds will also be paid out in local currencies as and when the transitions complete.

[Photo: Geran de Klerk] By Jared Newman7 minute Read If you’re planning to build a smart home around Apple’s HomeKit platform, be prepared for higher prices, more clutter, and fewer choices than other platforms. advertisement That’s because unlike competitors such as SmartThings and Wink, Apple doesn’t support the most popular smart home wireless protocols through a central connection hub. Instead, some HomeKit products such as smart light bulbs and dimmers require their own bridge hardware to connect with Apple devices, adding cost and complexity. And because of Apple’s security requirements for third-party HomeKit bridges, some companies may charge more for HomeKit-compatible hardware or avoid the platform entirely. All of these problems could theoretically be solved by an official HomeKit hub, capable of managing multiple smart home devices through a single connection point. But for Apple, following other smart home players into the hub business would also bring trade-offs in complexity and functionality. As we approach the third anniversary of Apple’s HomeKit announcement–and the company’s WWDC conference, which could bring HomeKit news, approaches–it’s worth revisiting whether a HomeKit hub really makes sense for Apple. Philips’ Hue hub Radio Silence When Apple announced HomeKit in 2014, the company seemed to be betting on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as its wireless protocols of choice. Because iPhones, iPads, and Apple TV boxes already have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios inside, they can connect directly to certain HomeKit devices with no additional bridges or hubs. Apple TVs and iPads even have some hub-like features, such as being able to relay a Bluetooth signal onto a Wi-Fi network, and enabling remote device control from outside the home. But Wi-Fi and Bluetooth aren’t always ideal for smart-home products. Wi-Fi tends to be power hungry, making it a poor fit for battery-operated sensors, doorbells, and locks. Bluetooth is more power efficient but has a shorter range, and can’t connect to devices outside the house on its own. Although an upcoming version of Bluetooth will allow many devices to form a single “mesh” network, device makers say they’re uncertain about when this will launch, and how well it will work in smart home applications. For those reasons, smart home device makers often turn to a couple of well-established smart home protocols known as ZigBee and Z-Wave. Both operate at lower power than Wi-Fi because they’re optimized for sending smart home commands rather than a firehose of data, but they have longer range than Bluetooth. They can even extend their range further by relaying a signal across a chain of devices. “There is a strong reason for companies making light bulbs, like us, to use a protocol like ZigBee, which is basically designed for these whole-home networks,” says George Yianni, head of home systems technology for Philips Lighting, maker of the popular Hue smart bulbs. The big trade-off is that Hue bulbs require a middleman device to relay commands between the ZigBee radios inside each bulb and the Wi-Fi radios inside phones, tablets, laptops, and other general-purpose computing devices. A Philips Hue bridge sells for $60 by itself, or for $70 in a bundle with two basic Hue bulbs (normally $15 apiece). Lutron also offers a bridge for its Caseta smart dimmers, priced at $80 by itself or $89 with one dimmer and remote. advertisement With other platforms such as Wink and Samsung’s SmartThings, multiple bridges aren’t entirely necessary. Both systems offer $100 hubs that connect with any ZigBee or Z-Wave device, so users can connect to bulbs, switches, buttons, and sensors from a variety of companies. While the up-front cost is greater than buying a bridge for a single smart home product, the cost over time can be cheaper as you add more devices to your home. Lutron’s light switch and hub HomeKit’s Hindrances Requiring multiple bridges creates complications for HomeKit beyond the added cost. To become certified for HomeKit, each bridge or standalone device must have a licensed MFi chip from Apple, which provides encryption and authentication. While Apple’s high security standards are laudable, they place a bigger burden on device makers, one that might not be necessary with a central MFi-approved hub. That burden helps explain why Keen Home, a maker of smart air vents, has so far avoided putting an MFi chip in its own bridge, which is required for users who don’t have their own hubs. Will McLeod, Keen’s cofounder and chief of product, says that although the company and its manufacturing partner are MFi-licensed, including the chip would have raised costs for all consumers, including those who don’t want to use HomeKit. Keen is now considering whether to release a separate HomeKit bridge, which would cost more than the current version. “It’s a non-trivial change, and it’s something that we would have to pass onto consumers, but it might also be something that people are willing to pay more for,” McLeod says. The MFi chip requirement also creates trade-offs for device makers who stick it out with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for their HomeKit products. Fibaro, for instance, traded Z-Wave for Bluetooth in the HomeKit versions of its water leak and motion sensors. The Bluetooth and MFi chips put a bigger strain on battery life than Z-Wave would have, prompting Fibaro to strip away some features such as more frequent temperature readings and more fine-grained light sensitivity controls. “It’s something that was a challenge for us,” says Rich Bira, Fibaro USA’s general manager. “Some manufacturers, if they don’t do the algorithms correctly, or they don’t spend a lot of time on it, the battery can be a bit worse.” Keen Home’s smart air vent Waves Of Change Although it may seem that Apple could solve all these problems by releasing a HomeKit hub, it wouldn’t be a panacea. The up-front cost for a multi-purpose hub would likely be higher than a single-purpose bridge, and could require users to educate themselves about wireless protocols that aren’t in their vernacular. advertisement “I definitely understand where Apple is coming from,” Keen Home’s Will McLeod says. “It’s less for a consumer to understand and learn about.” McLeod also points out a problem with all multi-purpose hub devices: They don’t support all the things that a device maker might want to do. For example, a platform like HomeKit might not anticipate that a smoke detector should talk to a set of smart vents, telling them to shut off in case of a fire. “We realize, because we’re deep in the heart of it, that the No. 1 cause of death in a fire is smoke inhalation, and if you can close off the vents when a smoke detector detects smoke, you can prevent that from spreading throughout the home,” McLeod says. “That’s definitely something we want to build, but that’s not something that becomes baked in on a third-party’s platform that’s not thinking about intricacies like that.” Several other vendors I spoke to also bemoaned the lack of control afforded by generalist hubs. Philips’ George Yianni, for instance, notes that lighting controls are more responsive through the company’s own bridge, and that certain effects such as fading in with the sunrise are more tightly coordinated. Although Philips is open to the idea of putting all its features and integrations onto a third-party hub, the device would need to have enough resources to duplicate everything its own bridge can do, and would require strong business agreements to ensure that Hue support doesn’t get abandoned or fragmented. “Today, one of the reasons we’re able to keep pushing new features and functionality is we’re able to ensure that all our bridges in the field are running the same software,” Yianni says. Perhaps the way forward, then, is to approach the hub as an optional add-on for enthusiasts and professionals, rather than a central component of the HomeKit experience. In January, Z-Wave demonstrated a proof-of-concept hub that could map HomeKit controls onto Z-Wave devices. Raoul Wijgergangs, vice president of the Z-Wave business unit at Sigma Designs, which makes the protocol’s hardware modules, says that one company is already working on a HomeKit-enabled Z-Wave hub for later this year. (He won’t give more details, but confirms that it won’t be an Apple product.) “I think that smart home has proven to be more complex for Apple than they initially realized,” Wijgergangs says. “I’ve experienced them taking a different stand over time toward the more established technologies in this place, and also the more established players and service providers.” advertisement To clear the path for a Z-Wave hub, Sigma spent two years working with Apple on a new security framework, which is now required for all new Z-Wave devices. The upcoming HomeKit hub will have its own MFi chip, and will support all those devices automatically, Wijgergangs says. Although this may create new complexities for consumers, he notes that 80% of the current smart home market is professionally installed. Z-Wave is prominent in that market, so a HomeKit hub could help Apple extend its reach in ways that weren’t possible with just bridges, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. “They are taking more of an approach to embrace some of the values and essentials of this industry,” Wijgergangs says, “rather than take the more traditional Apple stance of, ‘We know it better, we’re going to change everything, and we’re Apple, so the world will adhere to the way we view it.'” About the author Jared Newman covers apps and technology for Fast Company from his remote outpost in Cincinnati.

Photo courtesty Jaden Banson Apple takes a shine to Ontario teen’s tech project By  Evan Boudreau, The Catholic Register May 25, 2017 Tweet What started out as Jaden Banson’s annoying hobby has evolved into a passion which is catching the eye of Apple Inc. Top Stories Monument honours lives of two religious sisters fatally stabbed in 2016 Laos’ new cardinal is ethnic Khmu, known for kindness Toronto Catholic's Angela Gauthier retiring after 40 years in education Faith still a powerful personal force, Angus Reid poll finds Apple takes a shine to Ontario teen’s tech project “When I was younger I used to take small things around the house apart,” said Banson, a Grade 11 student at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Secondary School in Mississauga, Ont. “I used to take apart like TV remotes or my little RC cars to see what was inside because I always wondered how things worked. My mom would sometimes get angry at me for it, but my dad is an engineer so he was always fine with it.” That boyish enthusiasm for gadgets has advanced to the point where the 17-year-old is creating entirely new projects of his own, and one of them has caught the attention of the world’s largest information technology company. Apple has invited Banson to take part in the annual World Developers Conference, June 5-9 in San Jose, Calif. He’s one of 350 students from around the world who earned an invitation after suitably impressing the tech giant with his program that was selected from more than 10,000 projects. The program, called the 3D Molecular Visualizer, provides a three-dimensional rendering of specific molecules, with each image accompanied by a description, list of properties and chemical details such as bonding relations with other molecules. The program, still in the demo stage, contains five molecules: water, carbon dioxide, sulphur trifluoride, sulphur tetrafluoride and boron trichloride. Banson said it could eventually serve as a supplement, or even replacement, to traditional chemistry textbooks. “If I were to make it quite a bit larger it would be an alternate solution to a textbook,” he said, adding that a search engine would also have to be developed. “I hope to speak to some of the really talented engineers at Apple and see how they create their software. Maybe they can take a look at it and give me some advice on how to properly structure my program for handling more data, different molecules, or building a search engine because there are some really really brilliant people at Apple.” Banson also said the program could be used to create sister software for areas such as physics and biology. “(Textbooks) do not accurately represent the way something might actually scientifically look and it doesn’t give the proper perspective of how it should look so students might find that confusing and might become uninterested,” he said. “It is just kind of boring compared to seeing something on a screen and getting to have that perspective of how things really look like.” In fact, it was boredom that gave birth to the Visualizer. “I was in fourth period chemistry class and I was studying for this test on molecules and as I was looking at the book some of the 2D molecules were kind of overly complicated,” he said. “That made the textbook really boring and un-engaging. So I said there just has to be an easier way and instead of waiting around for someone to make it why don’t I just make it.” This is Banson’s second year applying to the Apple-sponsored convention for a coveted scholarship, which pays for his transportation, hotel and conference fee. “Last year I applied with a different project but I wasn’t very familiar with the language so it wasn’t a very good project,” he said. “I was disappointed at first but I took it as a lesson and learned a lot ... learning something does pay off. Disappointment at first turned into hard work (and) hard work turned into success.” St. Joan of Arc principal Carl Cini had praise for both Banson and his teachers. “We are very proud of this young man and want to congratulate him on all his hard work,” said Cini. “We have some incredible dedicated and energetic and enthusiastic teachers that push the envelope with the students and get them to think about technology in different ways.” The Apple conference is a magnet for software developers and it’s a chance to meet with the company’s engineers, as well as preview the latest technologies. “Ever since I was in elementary school I had an iPod and I would just look at how clean it is yet how functional it was at the same time,” he said. “When I look at Apple as a company I think they do a lot of great stuff and they are always trying to look for new innovative solutions.” Tweet Tagged under: Apple Inc tech project Jaden Banson St Joan of Arc Catholic Secondary School More in this category: « Photos: Jesuit ordinations at Toronto's Our Lady of Lourdes Toronto Catholic's Angela Gauthier retiring after 40 years in education » Comments (0) There are no comments posted here yet   Quick Login Username Password Login Sign Up Leave your comments Posting comment as a guest.

With the most ardent fans sometimes branded ‘sheeple’ for their unbending commitment to the company and its products, Apple is clearly very good at customer retention. A recent survey by Morgan Stanley confirms this, showing that 92 percent of iPhone owners intending to upgrade within the next twelve months will stick to an iOS driven handset. Not only is this an impressive figure, second-placed Samsung is way off the pace. With 77 percent saying they would buy again next time round, the Galaxy brand clearly still doesn’t inspire the same levels of devotion as its Californian competitor. You will find more statistics at Statista However it’s not all good news for Apple. Apple’s brand value has taken a dive according to Brand Finance’s “Global 500” 2017 report. “Apple’s evangelists are beginning to lose their faith”, the report’s authors suggest. One reason is that Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and new devices just haven’t caught on with consumers like earlier gadgets did. Its value has dropped 27 percent year-on-year. This leaves Google as the MVP of the brand world with an estimated worth of close to $110 billion (+24 percent). This has to do with the fact that Google remains largely unchallenged in its core internet search business, which generates heavy advertising revenue.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Founder of Apple-Acquired Tech Company Launches TRVL.Com, a Peer-To-Peer Travel Booking Platform TRVL product shot TRVL is TripAdvsior with an earning model Amsterdam, Netherlands (PRWEB) May 25, 2017 TRVL.com is a peer-to-peer travel booking platform, where everyone can act as an amateur travel agent — applying their knowledge, experience and love for travel — and introduces an attractive earning model. Think of TRVL as TripAdvisor with an earning model. TRVL has been in beta testing for 9 months and is now launching to the public. The founder and CEO of TRVL is Jochem Wijnands, who sold his previous company Prss, a mobile publishing platform, to Apple in 2014. Jochem Wijnands: “When researching and planning a trip for the people you travel with or for others, or when sharing your tips and reviews, you’re essentially doing the work of a travel agent. But you don’t get rewarded for it. TRVL is going to change that.” “Artificial Intelligence is neat, but nothing beats a personal recommendation, from one human to another. That is still the most appreciated and most valuable travel advice there is.” Research confirms this: Millennials rate “friends, family, and coworkers” as their most trusted source of information on where to stay when traveling (83% trustworthy). (Sabre company, July 2016). Friends/family are a critical source of travel inspiration, second only to the internet. (Ipsos MediCT Study commissioned by Google). TRVL’s own research shows that 91.7% of the respondents value personal recommendations from friends highly or very highly (more results in this release). The COO of TRVL is Arthur Hoffman. He is a travel industry veteran who set up businesses for Expedia in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and India. Arthur Hoffman: “TRVL is breaking down the traditional barriers of the travel industry by turning everybody into a TRVL Agent and introducing an earning model. Today we can find all hotels online, but how do we know which one is right for us? We often end up spending many nights behind our laptop, researching a destination, and building up enough confidence to make a booking. A personalized recommendation often helps us cut right to the chase.” Recent quotes from other industry veterans suggest that TRVL is solving an industry-wide problem: Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi thinks the travel industry will move back to the model of customers visiting a travel agent. A digital travel agent, that is. (Seattle Times, May 2016) Trivago CEO Rolf Schrömgens says: „I think there is a major problem unsolved, and that is getting you into the ideal hotel. I don’t think that is happening right now. There is a huge value that can be unlocked.” (CNBC, Dec 2016). How TRVL works: Signing up as a TRVL Agent is free, and it only takes seconds. Anybody can sign up, as long as they are 18 years or older. The platform grants you access to 1.4 million hotels and vacation rentals and lets you earn a commission on every booking you make. You can use TRVL to Research and book trips for yourself and the people you’re traveling with Research, recommend, and share trips with others Set up shop and run your own customizable travel booking website TRVL’s partners are Booking.com, Expedia-owned Hotels.com and TripAdvisor. TRVL expects to announce new partners and products in the coming months. TRVL receives a commission on every booking made through the platform and passes on the majority share of that commission to the TRVL Agent responsible for the booking. TRVL Survey results: Recently, TRVL sent its mailing list a questionnaire to which 1,066 people responded. Here are the most important results: After making a booking online, 89.2% are not sure whether they have made the right choice. 75.3% completely or somewhat agree that they’re spending too much time planning a trip, even the short ones. When planning a trip, 84.2% completely or somewhat agree that the number of hotels to choose from can be overwhelming. 91.7% value personal recommendations from friends highly or very highly. 87.8% would be interested in earning money from their travel recommendations if their friends didn’t end up paying more. History: TRVL started in 2010 as the first iPad exclusive magazine in the world. It then developed a mobile publishing platform called Prss, which was acquired by Apple in 2014 for an undisclosed amount. The team moved to California and helped build Apple News. Founder story: TRVL is the brainchild of the photographer, writer, and global wanderer Jochem Wijnands. He was a travel photographer for National Geographic and other global publications for 15 years. In 2010, he started TRVL as an iPad magazine and together with Michel Elings created Prss, which was acquired by Apple in 2014 and would later become Apple News. The deciding moment was when Jochem, still living in California, was planning a vacation to Mexico. He asked his team at Apple for tips, and somebody came forward with a passionate story about a tiny village called Yelapa that could only be reached by boat. The hotel she recommended was simple but right on the beach, and it came with a natural pool. Two months later, when he found himself with his family, perfectly happy, on the crescent-shaped beach of Yelapa, a light bulb went off. He wondered where he would have ended up without this recommendation from another traveler and consequently decided to create a world where this type of travel advice would be available on demand. TRVL mission: TRVL’s mission is to make travel better. Travel writer Pico Iyer compared travel to love, saying: “Travel is a heightened state of awareness, in which we are mindful, receptive, undimmed by familiarity and ready to be transformed.” TRVL believes this to be true. It explains why we love sharing our travel experiences. It is that classic traveler’s conversation that we’re all part of: “Where have you been? Any tips?” Your friends already ask you for travel tips, and you ask them. TRVL is – “Where have you been? Any tips?” – multiplied a million times. This is a link to TRVL’s video campaign “Why do we travel?” https://vimeo.com/218059426 Team, location, funding: TRVL’s team of 12 is based in Amsterdam and Rotterdam (software). TRVL is funded by the same group of angel investors that had funded Prss before it was acquired by Apple. TRVL expects to announce news about its funding in June.

It has been acquiring tech companies left, right and center for the past three years or so. It has also been involved in various researches that it thinks will benefit its line of products. Last year, it was reported that the company has delved into development of micro-LED displays for its future products. Now, it seems like everything is moving ahead as it prepares for the Apple Watch Series that may be released sometime this year. According to Digitimes, Apple has already put a small order of micro-LED displays that will be used for the Apple Watch refresh. Furthermore, Taiwan-based startup PlayNitride will be the one to setup the facility for the trial production of the displays. At the moment, it seems like Apple is only focusing on smaller displays fit for the Apple Watch Series 3. This is mainly because the procedures involving the manufacturing of the said display is still at its early stage. Right now, the cost outweighs the yield for micro-LED displays. The current level of technology that is available is still being developed by Apple and its subsidiaries. Apple Watch Series 2 (via apple.com) To those who are unaware, micro-LED display is the newest form of display technology in the market. The research for the display began in the year 2000. Until today, the display is still far from being mass produced. Micro-LED displays are far superior than LCD in term of pixel density, high contrast ratio, colour saturation, and reaction time. Many experts believe that if done right, this could even compete with the OLED panels used on various high-end mobile devices in the market. So far, there have been far fewer reports of the Apple Watch Series 3. Almost every news channels on the Internet are focusing on the iPhone 8. Nevertheless, there is a strong chance that Apple might introduce another refresh for the smartwatch sometime after the September event. It is possible that the unveiling of the third generation of Apple Watch may take place sometime in October this year.

Unsecured debt per household was £13,200 in 2016, according to the TUC, which is the highest figure since the financial crisis, and only marginally below the peak of £13,300 in 2007. It’s set to reach a record high of £13,900 in 2017 and will exceed £15,000 before the end of the next parliament, the TUC said. Read more Rights of middle and low income earners 'could be eroded after Brexit' The sharp rise reflects a “living standards crisis” and is putting the economy “in the danger zone”, said TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady. “We’ve got this problem because wages haven’t recovered. Credit cards and payday loans are helping to prop up household spending for now, but millions of families are running on empty,” she said. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics last week confirmed that real wages are now falling and the TUC said that wages in the UK are still worth around £20 per week less than before the financial crisis. Read more British maternity pay is one of the worst in Europe, reveals TUC NHS faces crisis unless rights of 145,000 EU workers guaranteed- TUC Workers fear they will 'pay the price' for UK leaving Single Market Working people need greater share of economic gains, says TUC chief Nominal total average wages grew at an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in the three months to March, which was fractionally higher than inflation in March of 2.3 per cent. But according to the ONS, prices were up 2.7 per cent in April, meaning that inflation-adjusted wages are now likely to be negative for the first time since 2014. The spike in inflation reflects a near 13 per cent slump in the value of the pound against the dollar since last June's Brexit vote. “The next Government must act urgently to deliver the higher wages Britain needs for sustainable growth. They must boost the minimum wage, and end pay restrictions for public servants like nurses, firefighters and midwives,” Ms O’Grady said.

Pre-tax profit came in at £176.4m for the year, while sales were broadly steady at £10.6bn. Food revenue was up 4.2 per cent. Reuters 3/29 Apple named world’s most value company in tech-dominated Forbes ranking - Tuesday 23 May Tech behemoth Apple has been named the most valuable brand in the world for a seventh consecutive year.

LOCAL STORIES | GREEN | OPINIONS | ARTS&CULTURE | CALENDAR | MUSIC | DINING | FILM | GUIDES | N&R EVENTS | CLASSIFIEDS   |     Tweet Take the money and stay By Sheila Leslie This article was published on 05.25.17. Advertisement If a corporation’s net income in the second quarter of this year was $11 billion, and it had a cash reserve of $257 billion, shouldn’t the corporation be able to afford its state and local taxes? Apparently not if its name is Apple. Two courageous elected officials said “no” to corporate welfare recently, refusing to support a continuing multi-million dollar subsidy of one of the wealthiest corporations the world has ever seen. They received eye rolls and barely hidden contempt for their principled stand from many who think attracting an Apple warehouse is a tremendous coup for the Reno economy. First, the Washoe County School Board took up an amendment to a prior agreement with Apple, allowing the company to purchase land to build a warehouse of 17,000 square feet in the Tessera “Tourist Improvement District,” even though the warehouse hardly meets the definition of a tourist attraction. But the deal allows Apple to store large amounts of data center equipment in downtown Reno while avoiding paying millions in taxes to state and local government. Tourists can go elsewhere for their entertainment needs. Veronica Frenkel was the only school board member who voted against the new deal. She offered a detailed explanation of her position, complaining about the new taxes residents are paying for the privilege of educating Apple’s future consumers. “Since 2012, Reno citizens and businesses have been asked to step up and shoulder the burden of supporting education in our community, first with the passage of the Commerce Tax in 2015, a tax on businesses specifically to support education, and most recently with the passage of WC-1, which has meant that since April all of us, including those with limited resources, have and will continue to pay higher sales taxes in support of school construction and educating our children. “Later in this agenda we are addressing a budget deficit and the challenge of paying for the quality education that our 64,000 students deserve. I, for one, am not comfortable exempting any business coming into our community from shouldering its fair share of the tax burden and from its responsibility to contribute to the education of our children, especially as other businesses and as all the citizens of our community have been asked to bear them.” The next day, Reno Councilmember Jenny Brekhus also said no to Apple. She pointed out the Council had an opportunity to “unwind this pattern of giveaways” and worried about the inability of the City’s budget to maintain infrastructure for a growing population. Brekhus noted, “Reno has about 21,000 more residents since 2010 but approximately 60 fewer sworn police officers. Nearly one out of every five local roads is in a failure status. The fiscal health of local governments seem to not be calculated into the State of Nevada economic development policies that are promoting economic activity and accompanying growth. We have $5 million less in property tax than in 2010, and, when Reno and other local governments bring this up to those in Carson City, it falls on deaf ears. Our residents are also struggling with increased utility rates, tax increases and escalating housing rental prices.” Brekhus urged her colleagues to at least put metrics for performance into the deal, citing a new report from the Pew Charitable Trusts that criticized the failure of many states, including Nevada, to effectively evaluate the economic benefits generated by massive tax breaks. The report noted Nevada’s “supersize incentive deals with businesses in recent years” despite the lack of “a process to regularly evaluate them.” But no worries, Reno. The City’s tough negotiations with Apple resulted in an agreement to add signage to the warehouse property, visibility Apple usually avoids. The sign will provide a daily reminder of the folly of allowing super-rich corporations to dodge their taxes.

This comes after news of the Apple retail store here first broke in October 2015, after a former tenant of the mall, the Pure Fitness gym chain, sent a letter to its members informing them of its closure to make room for the store. Four other tenants were also moved. Apple Orchard Road, the first official Apple store in Singapore and South-east Asia, will take up two levels in Knightsbridge mall. The first level will sell Apple products like the iPhone, iPad, MacBook, iMac and accessories, such as Beats headphones and phone cases. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up A set of stone stairs spiral up from the first floor to the second level, and its design is inspired by Apple Park, the new Apple campus in Cupertino. For one thing, the stairs are designed such that they appear to have railings etched into the wall, with smooth seamless lines. The store's second level is dominated by a large space called the forum where free hands-on sessions, such as for iPhone photography and iPad illustration, will be conducted.   Sneak preview of Apple Orchard Road Store Related Story Apple Orchard Road store unveiled These sessions, collectively known as Today at Apple, will be conducted by Apple's Creative Pros and Red Dot Heroes, who are local creatives appointed by Apple. The forum is flanked by two Genius Groves peppered with living trees. Here, Apple technical Geniuses will answer customers' technical questions on their Apple products. While other official Apple stores have only one Genius Grove, this is the first time an Apple store has two. The area has many seats for customers to sit and talk to the Geniuses about their technical issues or just chill. One of the main features of the Apple store is its 36.6m long glass facade made up of 13 glass panels. Each panel of glass stands 14m tall. Mr Denny Tuza, senior marketing director of Apple Retail, said that Apple has painstakingly made each panel extremely clear, so as to blur the line between being inside and outside the store. "We want to remove any obstacles between us (Apple store) and the local community," he said. A 7.62m-long canopy was also specially built to protect the store from sunlight as well as provide shelter from the rain. There are nearly 500 Apple stores around the world in 20 countries, as of April, that welcomes more than a million visitors a day. "We believe that Apple Orchard Road will be among the most popular in the world," said Mr Tuza. Apple Orchard Road will run on 100 per cent clean energy using rooftop solar installations provided by Singapore-based solar energy provider Sunseap Group.

PHOTO: HUAWEI Smartphone maker Huawei just announced a wide range of laptops and tablets to take on tech giants Apple and Microsoft. The new devices launched by the Chinese firm include the MateBook X and Matebook D laptops along with a revamped version of last year’s Windows 10 tablet, the MateBook E. The highlight of Huawei’s event, however, was its first ever clamshell laptop — the MateBook X which seems to target Apple’s flagship MacBook line. PHOTO: HUAWEI The Windows 10 laptop is the first fan-less 13-inch model with an Intel U-Series processor. It has a sleek aluminium chassis that’ll be available in gold, grey and pink. It terms of its size and dimensions, the new laptop is similar to Apple’s MacBook. On the hardware side, the Huawei laptop features a power button that also doubles as a fingerprint sensor, similar to some Huawei phones, and it works with Windows Hello. In addition to this, it’s also the first laptop to have Dolby’s Atmos sound system, which features integrated software and hardware solutions for superior sound quality. With the option to get an Intel Core i7 CPU and 8GBs of RAM, the new laptop also pegs itself against the more up spec MacBook Pro. The new device, however, doesn’t come cheap with a starting price of $1,399 and can go up to $1,699. PHOTO: HUAWEI Huawei also unveiled a mid-ranged laptop the MateBook D, that features a larger but lower-resolution screen and a Nvidia GeForce 930MX GPU for better gaming graphics. The MateBook D also comes in much cheaper at $799. PHOTO: HUAWEI The Matebook E tablet, on the other hand is an updated version of last year’s model. The Windows 10 tablet was notable for its iPad Pro-like chassis, but doesn’t include the keyboard case in its base price. Available in gray and gold, the device takes on Apple’s iPad Pro and has a premium, high-end look and feel. All in all, Huawei’s latest line of devices shows the company is capitalising on its gains in the smartphone market and now aims  to take on tech giants Microsoft and Apple in the PC sector.

Digital Trends Home > Apple > Apple reportedly making strides with next-gen… Apple reportedly making strides with next-gen micro LED display tech By Adam Ismail — May 24, 2017 12:15 pm Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple's devices could one day have significantly brighter screens while simultaneously being more efficient with micro LED technology. As the world waits patiently to find out whether Apple’s next iPhone will feature an OLED screen, the company is researching an even more groundbreaking display technology for future products. According to Digitimes, the Cupertino, California company is currently experimenting with micro LED displays in the hopes of beginning “trial production” on a limited scale at the end of the year. While Digitimes’ report does not mention what devices would receive the technology first, some speculated years ago that the company would look to micro LED to power the Apple Watch’s display. Instead, the company turned to OLED, which allows for greater color contrast and is more efficient than conventional LED screens, as it allows pixels to be powered independently without a backlight. Micro LED looks to be even more efficient than both of those technologies, however, and has yet to launch in any consumer device. Apple acquired a developer of such panels, Luxvue, in 2014. At the time, Luxvue was promoting micro LED as a technology that could deliver nine times the brightness of conventional LEDs — which are already considerably brighter than OLED displays — while simultaneously drawing less power from a device’s battery. The energy benefits make it clear why Apple might opt to use micro LED in its watches down the road, as the extremely small batteries in wearables make longevity on a charge a top priority. However, do not expect to see these kinds of displays hitting the market very soon. For one, this is an unverified rumor about an emerging technology, so it would be wise not to take it at face value. Further, another report from the Taipei Times in March quotes industry analyst Annabelle Hsu as saying micro LED likely will not become commercially viable until 2020. Also, Apple has never demonstrated a propensity to jump on hot and unproven technologies before its competitors — as evidenced by its slow adoption of OLED displays, while many other phone makers have been using them for more than five years. There is a first time for everything, of course, and the fact still remains Apple purchased a company that specializes in the technology — so there is a clear ambition to one day deliver micro LED to the masses. But that day appears still a ways off.
