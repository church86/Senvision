Registered developers can download the fifth iOS 10.3 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. iOS 10.3 is a major update, introducing several new features and changes to the iOS 10 operating system. The biggest new consumer-facing feature is "Find My AirPods," which is designed to help AirPods owners locate a lost earphone. Find My AirPods records the last known location of when an AirPod was connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth and can play a sound on a lost AirPod. Apple's latest update also introduces a new Apple File System (APFS), installed when an iOS device is updated to iOS 10.3. APFS is optimized for flash/SSD storage and includes features like strong encryption. Apple plans to introduce some App Store changes in iOS 10.3, allowing developers to respond to customer reviews for the first time. iOS users are also able to label reviews in the App Store as "Helpful" or "Not Helpful," which should help surface the most relevant review content. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also plans to limit the number of times developers can ask for a review, allow customers to leave app reviews without exiting an app, and provide a "master switch" that will let users turn off all app review request prompts. Also new in iOS 10.3 is a redesigned app open/close animation, an Apple ID profile in Settings, a better breakdown of iCloud storage usage, warnings about outdated apps that won't work with future versions of iOS, HomeKit support for programmable light switches, improvements to SiriKit (bill paying, bill status, and scheduling future rides), CarPlay interface improvements, iCloud analytics options, and more. Update: iOS 10.3 beta 5 is also available for public beta testers.

(Hopefully this is the last one before a public release, I love the speed improvements of this release so far) Sorry, but saying "oh here we go with those msgs", is on the same level as "what about dark mode" comments.. they're obvious and filling the thread with useless offtopic content. this reply i just made, probably adds to that :D Rating: 10 Votes AppleFan91 1 week ago Five betas is kinda scary for a point upgrade. Don't turn on the news. Also, this is not uncommon lately. Most of them are going 5-7. I much prefer this method in comparison to no betas or 1 or 2 and a flawed release personally. Rating: 8 Votes imnotthewalrus 1 week ago Five betas is kinda scary for a point upgrade. How so? Before the beta program, there was always a "risk" of jumping on a new iOS release. I personally am glad to see Apple giving developers and PB users an opportunity to have a sneak peek and offer feedback while others can just keep an eye on it to see whether they want to upgrade or not when the GM is released. Multiple betas should be good news (that bugs are being discovered and fixed prior to official release), not "kinda scary". Just my two cents. Rating: 6 Votes C DM 1 week ago Five betas is kinda scary for a point upgrade. Not really unusual, and certainly pretty far from anything like scary.

Rating: 4 Votes C DM 1 week ago so for the 99.999% of owners who don't have airbuds this update will mean nothing. If the rest of the things that are changed are also not counted. Rating: 4 Votes SteveJobzniak 6 days ago at 04:56 am I love the priorities of this article: - The biggest new consumer-facing feature is "Find My AirPods," a feature which sounds like the kind of parody news The Onion would joke about. - "Oh and there's a brand new filesystem which is modern, corruption-proof, fast and safe and replaces everything we've known about Apple for the last 30 years of living with the old and buggy HFS+.

The archive released on Tuesday claims to show the CIA exploiting weaknesses it discovers in hardware and software systems -- without informing manufacturers of the flaws in question. "While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities," Apple said in an emailed statement. "We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates." Samsung offered a similar response. "Protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung," a statement from the South Korean electronics giant said. "We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter." The whistleblowing foundation claims the document dump reveals full details of the CIA's 'global covert hacking program', including 'weaponised exploits' used against operating systems including Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows and "even Samsung TVs, which are turned into cover microphones". The documents claim that CIA's Mobile Devices Branch has created multiple tools for hacking both Android and iOS smartphones, enabling it to remotely acquire location data, audio and text communications, and to switch on the phones' camera and microphones at will. Microsoft's Windows OS is also named a target, with WikiLeaks noting that "the CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware." In response, Microsoft said vaguely that it is "aware of the report in question" and "urgently looking into the matter." Linux has also fallen victim to the CIA's shady hacking tactics, according to the leak, but the Linux Foundation has yet to comment. Human rights watchdog Privacy International has been quick to comment on the revelations. "If today's leaks are authenticated, they demonstrate what we've long been warning about government hacking powers - that they can be extremely intrusive, have enormous security implications, and are not sufficiently regulated," a spokesperson told the INQUIRER. "Insufficient security protections in the growing amount of devices connected to the internet or so-called "smart" devices, such as Samsung Smart TVs, only compound the problem, giving governments easier access to our private lives. If the CIA knew of security weaknesses in the devices many of us use - from "smart" phones to "smart" TVs - they should have been working with companies to fix the vulnerabilities, not exploit them. "Privacy International continues to fight for transparency and accountability around government hacking and sharing powers, as well as improvements in the security of our networks and devices. "Without such, we increasingly face a world where we are vulnerable in ways most of us cannot imagine, and our governments contribute to the problem as often as they try to fix it."

Fresh rumours suggest that we’ll see the new devices on 4 April, alongside a launch event of sorts. The rumour, originating at the Apple World Today blog, emerges from speculation based on the fact that Apple will not ship new 12.9-inch iPad Pros until 4 April 2017. The device is currently out of stock. It’s not much to go on, but Apple World Today’s guess is as good as ours on this matter. Apple is yet to send out invites to an event, which has historically been held in early or late March. It’s equally possible that Apple will hold the event in late March with a promise to ship devices a week later, i.e. 4 April. Lending credence to Apple World Today’s speculation, however, is the fact that Apple’s new campus and HQ, Apple Park, is scheduled to open in April. Speaking of new iPads, we’re expecting to see a brand new, 10.5-inch iPad to replace the existing 9.7-inch iPad Air 2, a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro. There’s no word on an updated iPad Mini and at this point, one can assume that we won’t be seeing one this year.

The video, created by Jacek Zięba, showcases new features that many are hoping would arrive on iOS 11. These features include group FaceTime calling, dark mode, and iPhone split screen apps. For quite some time now, many have been wishing that Apple would include a system wide dark mode on iOS. The potential of such a feature has been imagined by Zięba on the video he created by coming up with a Night Mode that flawlessly changes the theme on different apps. Since Theater Mode has been introduced, it’s only a matter of time before Apple integrates a dark mode on iOS. Hopefully, it would be this year. Back in January, there was a claim that Apple was working on introducing a group FaceTime video calling feature for iOS 11. Using this idea, Zięba imagined what it would be like by having a split view on the screen with a floating picture-in-picture window. Apart from dark mode and group FaceTime video calling, Zięba showcases how multiple user accounts would be like on an iOS device. As imagined by the video creator, a hidden user tray would be accessible through the lock screen. Currently, this feature is already available on iPads in the classroom. Unfortunately, this feature is limited to iOS 10 education. The split screen feature imagined by the graphic artist is largely similar to Android as it has a video playback and an app picker for the iPad. This is a feature that could largely be available on the rumored 5.8-inch iPhone. Other features envisioned by the video creator include improved 3D Touch Control Center support, rotation lock for video players, game mode for alerts, and   As of now, there’s no word on which of these envisioned features will be available on the upcoming iOS 11 update. But with WWDC 2017 set to take center stage on June 5th, it’s interesting to see just what Apple has lined up for the event.   Tags: iOS 11 About Christine Torralba View all posts by Christine

Apple’s financial and marketing power combined with an installed base of hundreds of millions of iOS devices seemed like a tough combination to beat for the Swedish music streaming pioneers. And yet, ever since Apple launched its own streaming service halfway through 2015, Spotify has managed to keep Apple Music at arm’s length. Going back and forth in announcing new subscriber milestones, the gap between Spotify and Apple Music has remained remarkably steady over the past 20 months. Last week, Spotify rather casually announced that it had just passed 50 million paid subscribers, extending its lead over Apple to 30 million paying customers. Now it’s Apple’s turn again to come out with another milestone. And it would be a big surprise if the company’s announcement of 30 million Apple Music subscribers wouldn’t come soon.

We’re still months away from iOS 11’s launch, but we can now picture out how Apple could implement its rumored features to an iPhone, thanks to a concept video Jacek Zieba created. Here’s a breakdown of what the creator included in the video. Dark Mode Zieba, an editor at My Apple, threw a handful of cool features into the mix. For starters, he included the Dark Mode, a setting which according to Techno Buffalo is already an option in tvOS for the Apple TV. It changes the device’s usual vibrant theme into a more muted one to ease the eyes at night. iOS users have long requested such a feature. Apple could very well implement it in the next big iOS update, although it could also arrive as early as 10.3, which is expected this month. Multiple User Accounts The video also imagines how multiple user accounts could work on the platform. As seen in the clip, you can access it using a simple swipe up on the lock screen to select a user before it requests authentication using the Touch ID. The Cupertino-based company already did a version of this for iPads in the classroom. However, the feature is only limited to education on iOS 10. Group FaceTime Perhaps, the most interesting feature from the entire bunch is group FaceTime calling. This has been in demand lately, given the popularity of group video chat apps like Skype and the iMessage add-on, House Party and Fam. In the demonstration, you are no longer required to have a one-on-one call and are free to add more people to the conversation if you wish. Split Screen, Siri Assistant & More! WCCFTech reports that a split view and a floating picture-in-picture window which shows at least three video feeds were demonstrated as well. Other potential iOS 11 features are better storage management, an enhanced 3D Touch Control Center support, ‘Siri Assistant,’ and even a game mode for alerts. Check out the video below: While details about the next major iOS update are sparse at this point, Zieba’s concept is not too farfetched. Unfortunately, whether or not we’ll see them in iOS 11 is still up for debate. Regardless, Zieba did a good job of showing what the future versions of the platform could offer us. We’ll see just how accurate this concept video in three months’ time. Apple will likely introduce iOS 11 at Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2017 on June 5. What do you think of Zieba’s iOS 11 concept? Are those the features you want to see in the next big update? Did it miss another feature that’s important to you?

WikiLeaks has published thousands of documents that it says come from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, a dramatic release that appears to give an eye-opening look at the intimate details of the agency's cyberespionage effort. ﻿﻿ Manuel Balce Ceneta AP Photo FILE - This April 13, 2016, file photo shows the seal of the Central Intelligence Agency at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. An alleged CIA surveillance program disclosed by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, March 7, 2017, purportedly targeted security weaknesses in smart TVs, smartphones, personal computers and even cars, and enabled snooping that could circumvent encryption on communications apps such as Facebook’s WhatsApp. WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used. But WikiLeaks claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. Carolyn Kaster, File AP Photo 1 of 2 i By ANICK JESDANUN AP Technology Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK Maybe the CIA is spying on you through your television set after all. Documents released by WikiLeaks allege a CIA surveillance program that targets everyday gadgets ranging from smart TVs to smartphones to cars. Such snooping, WikiLeaks said, could turn some of these devices into recorders of everyday conversations — and could also circumvent data-scrambling encryption on communications apps such as Facebook's WhatsApp. WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used "until a consensus emerges" on the nature of the CIA's program and how the methods should be "analyzed, disarmed and published." But WikiLeaks — a nonprofit that routinely publishes confidential documents, frequently from government sources — claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. MORE PRIVACY CLASHES If true, the disclosure could spark new privacy tensions between the government and the technology industry. Relations have been fraught since 2013, when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed secret NSA surveillance of phone and digital communications. Just last year, the two sides feuded over the FBI's calls for Apple to rewrite its operating system so that agents could break into the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. The FBI ultimately broke into the phone with the help of an outside party; the agency has neither disclosed the party nor the nature of the vulnerability, preventing Apple from fixing it. According to WikiLeaks, much of the CIA program centered on dozens of vulnerabilities it discovered but didn't disclose to the gadget makers. Common practice calls for government agencies to disclose such flaws to companies privately, so that they could fix them. Instead, WikiLeaks claims, the CIA held on to the knowledge in order to conduct a variety of attacks. As a result, tech companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft haven't been able to make the necessary fixes. "Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability," WikiLeaks wrote in a press release. "If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others." A BIG YAWN TO SOME Not everyone is worried, though. Alan Paller, director of research for the cybersecurity training outfit SANS Institute, said the case boils down to "spies who use their tools to do what they are paid to do." He said criminals already have similar tools — and he's more worried about that. Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis, said that agencies gathering intelligence on other organizations and governments need, by definition, technical exploits that aren't public. If they're authentic, the leaked CIA documents frame a stark reality: It may be that no digital conversation, photo or other slice of life can be shielded from spies and other intruders prying into smartphones, personal computers, tablets or just about device connected to the internet. "It's getting to the point where anything you say, write or electronically transmit on a phone, you have to assume that it is going to be compromised in some way," said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney who now specializes in cybersecurity and privacy for the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. SIDESTEPPING ENCRYPTION WikiLeaks claims the hacks allowed the CIA to collect audio and other messages from data-scrambling communication apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Confide by intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it's decoded. The CIA didn't appear to compromise the apps themselves, but rather the phone's underlying operating system. WikiLeaks says the CIA had separate teams looking for vulnerabilities in iPhones and Android phones and also targeted tablets such as iPads. According to WikiLeaks, the vulnerabilities were discovered by the CIA itself or obtained from other government agencies and cyberweapon contractors. CARS, TRUCKS AND TVS WikiLeaks also claims that the CIA worked with U.K. intelligence officials to turn microphones in Samsung smart TVs into listening devices. The microphones are normally there for viewers to make voice commands, such as requests for movie recommendations. If the TV is off, there's no listening being done. But WikiLeaks claims that a CIA hack makes the target TV appear to be off when it's actually on — and listening. WikiLeaks says the audio goes to a covert CIA server rather than a party authorized by Samsung. In such cases, audio isn't limited to TV commands but could include everyday conversations. Other tools in the CIA's arsenal target PCs running Microsoft's Windows system, according to WikiLeaks, which says many of the attacks are in the form of viruses designed to spread through CDs and USB drives. WikiLeaks also says the CIA was also targeting control systems used by cars and trucks. Although WikiLeaks didn't have details on how that might be used, it said the capability might allow the CIA to "engage in nearly undetectable assassinations." Microsoft said it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Apple said an initial analysis showed many of the security gaps brought up in the leaked documents were already patched in the latest iOS. "We will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities," it said. Google and Samsung didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement, General Motors said it would be premature to comment on the documents, including its authenticity. But GM added that it knew of no injuries or death resulting from the hacking of a vehicle.

Image INQUIRER.net stock Photo Last year, Apple said not to expect much from the 2016 iPhone release because they were apparently planning something big for 2017. Japanese news site Macotara is serving up a dash of new speculations on the 2017 iPhone release and says that the upcoming 5-inch high-end model could be called the “iPhone Edition”, reports 9to5Mac. According to the report, Apple is said to be testing various flagship prototypes. Some of these models are said to have no Home button while others retain it. Some prototypes apparently also have aluminum, glass and ceramic chassis designs. ADVERTISEMENT Prototype testing is reportedly being carried out alongside engineering validation testing (EVT). However, Apple will need more time to procure materials to proceed with design validation testing and make final decisions. It is because of this that Macotakara claims that the iPhone may have a late release this year. Other details contained in the Macotakara report mentions a possible OLED display, wireless charging, dual-cameras and a 5-5.1-inch screen real estate. Finally, Macotakara claims that the iPhone Edition should be announced by September, together with the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Should September actually be the release date of the “iPhone 8″, then that leaves fans quite a lot of time to save up for what should be a major iPhone update.

The global technology research and consulting firm's newly released Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker shows that the region saw the shipment of 5.98 million units in Q4 2016, up 7.7% on the previous quarter. When viewed year on year, however, the shipment numbers for Q4 2016 do not make good reading, translating into a downturn of -30.5% on the corresponding quarter of 2015. Taking a look at the year as a whole, the region's mobile phone market experienced a sharp slowdown in 2016, with total shipments down nearly -25% on the year before. "While the rate of Q-o-Q growth varied from country to country in Q4 2016, Qatar was the only member of the GCC to post a decline (-2.2%)," says Isaac T. Ngatia, a senior research analyst at IDC Middle East and Africa. "Saudi Arabia, which had suffered the worst declines in previous quarters, saw a reversal of fortunes in Q4 2016 by posting the region's highest Q-o-Q increase at 11.9%. The market is beginning to stabilize following the Saudization of the mobile industry and the challenging macroeconomic climate that compounded the effects of its introduction." "The UAE, which is the GCC's second-largest market, also saw a considerable improvement in Q4 2016, with shipments up by about 5% Q-o-Q for the final three months of 2016," continues Ngatia. "Q4 is traditionally the best-performing quarter of the year due to spending splurges in line with customary end-of-year and New Year festivities.  As such, only time will tell whether temporary seasonal factors were the main drivers of the market's turnaround in Q4 2016." Advertisement IDC's research shows that Samsung continued to lead the GCC smartphone market in Q42016, with almost 35% share.  However, its shipments were down slightly (-0.3%) Q-o-Q. It is worth noting that this does not include the recall of Galaxy Note 7 shipments, which are not recorded in IDC's report. Meanwhile, Apple was the market's biggest gainer in Q4 2016, recording Q-o-Q growth of 20% to secure 23% share of the GCC smartphone market. "Apple registered a solid quarter, which can be attributed to the success of its iPhone 7 and the gap created in the market by the Samsung Note 7 recall," says Nabila Popal, a senior research manager at IDC Middle East and Africa. "While the majority of Note 7 customers opted to stay within the Samsung family, Apple benefited from the fact that there are limited Android alternatives occupying the same price band as the Note 7, experiencing a clear boost in iPhone 7 sales as a result." When viewing 2016 as a whole, the overall GCC smartphone market shrank 23% year on year (Y-o-Y) in unit terms, with the leading vendors Samsung and Apple experiencing declines of 32% and 21%, respectively. Only Huawei bucked the trend to record a 9% Y-o-Y increase in its shipments. The introduction of competitive flagship devices, the positioning of models across a variety of price categories, and strong investments in marketing initiatives were among the drivers of Huawei's impressive growth in what was an extremely tough year for its competitors.   Another noteworthy development was the drop in average sales price of Android devices. Only a quarter of Android smartphone shipments to the GCC in 2016 were of phones priced above $450, a figure that stood at 50% just three years earlier. With falling prices, the proportion of smartphones with 4G capabilities continues to rise, accounting for 80% of devices shipped in 2016, up from less than half in 2014. Despite the positive Q-o-Q figures for Q4 2016, channels and retailers are still struggling to keep up with the ever-changing mobile landscape. Consolidation will likely continue at both the market and vendor level, making brand development and engagement key to penetrating the market. The lesser-known or smaller brands may find it more difficult to penetrate an already saturated market. All in all, IDC expects the GCC mobile market to see only modest Y-o-Y growth of 3% in 2017, as the market begins its long recovery from the -25% decline seen in 2016.

Reuters/Jason Reed Apple was granted a patent for a face detection technology on Tuesday. The company’s new asset, which involves human face recognition in digital video feeds via depth map information, could be utilised as a full-fledged feature on the upcoming iPhone 8. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) awarded the Cupertino, California-based tech titan its US Patent No. 9,589,177 for “Enhanced face detection using depth information.” The patent involves a computer vision technology derivative that uses dedicated hardware and software systems to perform facial recognition. Here’s what the patent description states: “A method for face detection includes capturing a depth map and an image of a scene and selecting one or more locations in the image to test for presence of human faces. At each selected location, a respective face detection window is defined, having a size that is scaled according to a depth coordinate of the location that is indicated by the depth map. Apart of the image that is contained within each face detection window is processed to determine whether the face detection window contains a human face. Similar methods may also be applied in identifying other object types.” The patent was filed by Apple on March 22, 2015. The company may incorporate the new technology on the upcoming iPhone 8. While no official word from Apple has been made (since the Mac maker has been mum about its upcoming releases), recent reports indicate that the company is going to equip the next premium iPhone with the new feature. According to the most recent info from KGI insider Ming-Chi Kuo, the forthcoming iPhone 8 is likely to equip a “revolutionary” front-facing 3D camera system that can be used for an assortment of applications, including security verification and gaming. But advanced biometrics is only one of the speculated features of this year’s iPhone, which is said to be feature-packed since 2017 marks the iconic Apple handset’s decade-long dominance of the mobile phone industry. The company is expected to beef up the next iPhone with stuff never before seen in previous models. The iPhone 8, if it pushes through, could be the first Apple smartphone to use an OLED display panel. Not only that, the handset is reportedly going to furnish a 5.8-inch edge-to-edge curved display just like the new Samsung Galaxy S8 (see related story below). Unfortunately, innovation is costly, and the premium anniversary iPhone is projected to sell for about US$1,000 (AU$1,315).

The company said that the latest public version of iOS, released in January, has already patched “many” critical vulnerabilities that had been detailed in the files, while Apple engineers continue to work to fix others that were known to the CIA. On Tuesday night, Wikileaks published 8,761 documents and files that it claims were obtained from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence. In addition to vulnerabilities in Android and Samsung Smart TVs, the documents detail 14 iOS exploits, describing how these security holes could be used to track users, monitor their communications, or even take control of their phones. Here's Apple's statement on iOS-related stuff in the WikiLeaks CIA data dump. pic.twitter.com/QiAWx8ZXpT— John Paczkowski (@JohnPaczkowski) March 8, 2017 “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS,” the statement reads, “[Apple] will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.” The company doesn’t specify exactly which of the 14 flaws have already been fixed, nor when it plans to roll out patches for vulnerabilities that persist, but it says that iOS users should keep up to date to get them as soon as possible. “We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates,” Apple says.

The name would reportedly signal that the phone is a higher end model, similar to how Apple names the Apple Watch Edition. The "Edition" moniker lines up with reports that the model could cost upwards of $1,000. The report goes on to note that Apple is currently testing multiple prototypes alongside the iPhone 8. The prototypes experiment with screen technology and materials, with some prototypes using an LCD display while others use AMOLED. The prototypes are also in testing with and without home buttons. Further, Apple is using them to test glass, aluminum and white ceramic chassis. Apple is trying to gauge which materials and technologies they can procure at mass scale for production, according to Mac Otakara. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Nikkei and the Wall Street Journal have reported the iPhone 8 will feature an OLED screen, while the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch lower-end models will sport LCD displays. Mac Okatara says the only features Apple is reportedly certain of are a 5-inch display, wireless charging and dual cameras. The 5-inch display Mac Otakara is referring to is the usable space on the display. The iPhone 8 is expected to utilize an edge-to-edge display that puts a 5.8-inch display in a handset roughly the size of a 4.7-inch iPhone. 5.15 inches of the 5.8-inch display will be usable. The difference will be used for a wide row of virtual buttons. The Cupertino company is also expected to announce a more standard 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus alongside the "iPhone Edition." According to Mac Otakara, while those two models are expected to launch in September, the "iPhone Edition" may not launch until well after that.

Rating: 36 Votes sharleyP 1 week ago When I see rumours about the $1000 iPhone it always reminds me about this quote from Steve Jobs: "What ruined Apple wasn't growth. What ruined Apple was values. John Sculley ruined Apple and he ruined it by bringing a set of values to the top of Apple which were corrupt and corrupted some of the top people who were there, drove out some of the ones who were not corruptible, and brought in more corrupt ones and paid themselves collectively tens of millions of dollars and cared more about their own glory and wealth than they did about what built Apple in the first place -- which was making great computers for people to use. They didn't care about that anymore. They didn't have a clue about how to do it and they didn't take any time to find out because that's not what they cared about. They cared about making a lot of money. So they had this wonderful thing that a lot of brilliant people made called the Macintosh and they got very greedy. And instead of following the original trajectory of the original vision -- which was to make this thing an appliance, to get this out there to as many people as possible -- they went for profits and they made outlandish profits for about four years. Apple was one of the most profitable companies in America for about four years. What that cost them was the future. What they should have been doing was making reasonable profits and going for market share, which was what we always tried to do. Rating: 25 Votes snebes 1 week ago $10k and $17k base price.

Lawmakers cast Congress' initial votes on the legislation as House Speaker Paul Ryan praised the proposal as "what good, conservative health care reform looks like." The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and AARP, the nation's largest advocacy group for older people, were arrayed against the GOP measure. Seven years ago their backing was instrumental in enacting President Barack Obama's health care statute, which President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are intent on erasing. The hospitals — major employers in many districts — wrote lawmakers complaining about the bill's cuts in Medicaid and other programs and said more uninsured Americans seem likely, adding, "We ask Congress to protect our patients." Groups representing public, children's, Catholic and other hospitals also expressed opposition. Early Wednesday, leaders began pushing the legislation through two committees — Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce — but as nighttime set in neither panel seemed near final approval. GOP leaders faced rebellion within their own ranks, including from conservative lawmakers and outside conservative groups. Top Republicans knew if the upheaval should snowball and crush the legislation it would be a shattering defeat for Trump and the GOP, so leaders hoped passage by both House committees would give them momentum. ___ GOP health care bill is critical first test for Trump WASHINGTON (AP) — As conservatives revolt over Republican health care legislation, Donald Trump faces a crucial first test of his presidency: Can he translate his bully pulpit and popularity with conservative voters into a legislative win? For Trump, it is a new arena five rocky weeks into his presidency. Thus far the accomplishments he has notched have been carried out via executive authority or appointments ratified by the Senate, often overshadowed by self-inflicted distraction. Now the Washington newcomer finds himself in the more complex realm of legislative deal-making, as GOP leaders push forward their long-promised plan to undo former President Barack Obama's health care law and replace it with a conservative blueprint that shrinks the federal role and reduces assistance to help voters buy coverage. With the plan under attack from conservatives as well as medical groups and the AARP on Wednesday, congressional Republican leaders made clear they will rely on Trump to corral restive lawmakers and bring them in line. A lot of them haven't experienced what it's like "with Air Force One landing in their district," Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said Wednesday before his panel met to begin voting on the legislation. "I think when the president of the United States, who campaigned on repeal and replace, says this is the repeal-and-replace bill ... I think the dynamic changes." ___ 10 Things to Know for Thursday Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Thursday: 1. WHO PUSHES FOR UNITY AS HOUSE PANELS DEBATE GOP HEALTH BILL House Speaker Paul Ryan tries rallying divided Republicans behind their high-stakes drive to overhaul the U.S. health care system, as committees take Congress' first votes on the Republican effort. 2. WHAT'S A CRITICAL FIRST TEST FOR TRUMP The new Republican health care bill, which has left GOP congressional leaders confronting a conservative backlash, and counting on the president to cajole reluctant lawmakers into getting the legislation over the finish line. ___ Women go on strike in US to show their economic clout PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Many American women stayed home from work, joined rallies or wore red Wednesday to demonstrate how vital they are to the U.S. economy, as International Women's Day was observed with a multitude of events around the world. The Day Without a Woman protest in the U.S. was put together by organizers of the vast women's marches that drew more than 1 million Americans the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration. The turnout on the streets this time was much smaller in many places, with crowds often numbering in the hundreds. There were no immediate estimates of how many women heeded the call to skip work. "Trump is terrifying. His entire administration, they have no respect for women or our rights," said 49-year-old Adina Ferber, who took a vacation day from her job at an art gallery to attend a demonstration in New York City. "They need to deal with us as an economic force." The U.S. event — inspired in part by the Day Without an Immigrant protest held last month — was part of the U.N.-designated International Women's Day. ___ Will WikiLeaks work with tech firms to defeat CIA hacking? WASHINGTON (AP) — The anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks raised the prospect Wednesday of sharing sensitive details it uncovered about CIA hacking tools with leading technology companies whose flagship products and services were targeted by the government's hacker-spies. If that sharing should take place, the unusual cooperation would give companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and others an opportunity to identify and repair any flaws in their software and devices that were being exploited by U.S. spy agencies and some foreign allies, as described in nearly 9,000 pages of secret CIA files WikiLeaks published on Tuesday. The documents, which the White House declined anew Wednesday to confirm as authentic, describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features for computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs. They include the world's most popular technology platforms, including Apple's iPhones and iPads, Google's Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. "This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our security, our country and our well-being," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. "This alleged leak should concern every single American." Spicer defended then-candidate Donald Trump's comment in October 2016 — "I love WikiLeaks!" — after it published during the presidential campaign private, politically damaging emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. Spicer said there was a "massive, massive difference" between WikiLeaks publishing stolen, personal emails of a political figure and files about national security tools used by the CIA. ___ Former Trump aide Flynn says lobbying may have helped Turkey WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who was fired from his prominent White House job last month, has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before Election Day that may have aided the Turkish government. Paperwork filed Tuesday with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit said Flynn and his firm were voluntarily registering for lobbying from August through November that "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." It was filed by a lawyer on behalf of the former U.S. Army lieutenant general and intelligence chief. After his firm's work on behalf of a Turkish company was done, Flynn agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign government or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. A Turkish businessman who hired Flynn's consulting firm told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the amended filings were made in response to pressure from Justice Department officials in recent weeks. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, said in a phone call from Istanbul that the changes were a response to "political pressure" and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. ___ IS gunmen in white lab coats kill 30 in Kabul hospital KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Gunmen wearing white lab coats stormed a military hospital in Afghanistan's capital on Wednesday, killing at least 30 people and wounding dozens in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. The attack on the 400-bed military facility, located near two civilian hospitals in Kabul's heavily-guarded diplomatic quarter, set off clashes with security forces that lasted several hours. The brazen assault reflected the capability of militant groups in Afghanistan to stage large-scale and complex attacks in the heart of Kabul, underscoring the challenges the government continues to face to improve security for ordinary Afghans. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said there were "more than 30 killed and more than 50 wounded" in the attack. Afghan forces battled the attackers floor by floor, he added. The ministry said the attackers were dressed like health workers. According to Waziri, four gunmen were involved, including two suicide bombers who detonated their explosives vests once the group was inside the hospital. ___ Probe sought after AP report on church abuse allegations A district attorney has asked the state to investigate two assistant prosecutors after an Associated Press story that quoted former congregants of a North Carolina church as saying the men derailed criminal probes into allegations of abuse by sect leaders. David Learner said Wednesday that he wants the State Bureau of Investigation to look into the accusations against his employees, who are members of the evangelical Word of Faith Fellowship church. The AP story, released Monday, cited nine former Word of Faith members who said Frank Webster and Chris Back provided legal advice, helped at strategy sessions and participated in a mock trial for four congregants charged with harassing a former member. The ex-congregants also said that Back and Webster, who is sect leader Jane Whaley's son-in-law, helped derail a social services investigation into child abuse in 2015 and attended meetings where Whaley warned congregants to lie to investigators about abuse incidents. "This is long overdue," said Rick Cooper, a U.S. Navy veteran who spent more than 20 years as a congregant at Word of Faith and raised nine children in the church. "I'm glad they're finally taking this seriously." ___ In her words: Casey Anthony talks to AP about Caylee's death WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Casey Anthony — the Florida woman accused, then acquitted, of killing her 2-year-old daughter — spoke with The Associated Press five times over a weeklong period. During the interviews, she talked about her love for her daughter, Caylee Marie, and showed photos of her and artwork she finger-painted. Anthony maintains her innocence in the death and insists she doesn't know how the last hours of Caylee's life unfolded. ___ THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: "You were convicted of one thing." ANTHONY: "Lying to the cops. People lie to the cops every day. Cops lie to people every day; I'm just one of the unfortunate idiots who admitted that they lied. " AP: "Was the lying out of panic?" ___ 'Fearless Girl' statue stares down Wall Street's iconic bull NEW YORK (AP) — A new statue of a resolute young girl staring down Wall Street's famous Charging Bull was erected by a major asset managing firm for International Women's Day to make a point: There's a dearth of women on the boards of the largest U.S. corporations. State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, had the statue created to push companies to increase the number of women directors. Artist Kristen Visbal's "Fearless Girl" drew crowds Wednesday that initially came to pose for pictures with the bull, but the novelty quickly became a New York hot spot. The girl is sculpted in bronze, her hands firmly planted on her waist, ponytailed head held high. "Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference," reads a plaque at her feet.

New Tablet Lineup Launch On April 4 In Apple Park: Reports By Rishabh Jain On 03/08/17 AT 12:11 AM Close The buzz around Apple’s 2017 iPad lineup is getting louder. As we wait for the iPad launch to happen, rumors concerning the company's tablet offering keep emerging — the newest one claiming that the devices could be launched in April, and not in May, as rumored earlier. Additionally, the rumor from Apple World says the launch could be held at the company’s spaceship campus in Apple Park. The website first reported Tuesday that clicking on the ‘Check Availability’ option for the upcoming 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 on Apple’s website shows April 4. The report added that Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed earlier that the company’s MacBook Pro 2016 event, held at Apple’s old headquarters Infinite Loop 1, would be the last Apple event to be held there. Furthermore, Apple Park is scheduled to open in April, which means Apple could inaugurate the campus by holding the iPad launch there, at the 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater on-site. What appears to be interesting is that many carriers are offering $150 discounts on various existing iPad models. The important information here is that the deals mostly end on April 1 (one of them ends April 3). It could mean retailers are clearing stock to make way for the new iPad lineup. So we might get to know soon what Apple has up its sleeves. The company is expected to launch 4 new tablets in 2017, including: A 7.9-inch iPad Mini A 9.7-inch tablet replacing the iPad Air 2 A 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 There is also the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, perhaps the most important new product from the lineup, which could be the most highly anticipated tablet of 2017 due to its desirability by both professionals and regular consumers alike. The iPad Pro 2 is expected to be the company’s flagship tablet for 2017, and will likely have features like a Touch Bar similar to one on the 2016 MacBook Pro, a new Apple Pencil, an A10X chipset, a 12-megapixel rear camera and iOS 10.3.

By: AP | Updated: March 8, 2017 10:41 am WikiLeaks also claims that the CIA worked with U.K. intelligence officials to turn microphones in Samsung smart TVs into listening devices. (Source: AP) Maybe the CIA is spying on you through your television set after all. Documents released by WikiLeaks allege a CIA surveillance program that targets everyday gadgets ranging from smart TVs to smartphones to cars. Such snooping, WikiLeaks said, could turn some of these devices into recorders of everyday conversations – and could also circumvent data-scrambling encryption on communications apps such as Facebook’s WhatsApp. Watch all our videos from Express Technology WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used “until a consensus emerges” on the nature of the CIA’s program and how the methods should be “analyzed, disarmed and published.” But WikiLeaks – a nonprofit that routinely publishes confidential documents, frequently from government sources – claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. MORE PRIVACY CLASHES If true, the disclosure could spark new privacy tensions between the government and the technology industry. Relations have been fraught since 2013, when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed secret NSA surveillance of phone and digital communications. Just last year, the two sides feuded over the FBI’s calls for Apple to rewrite its operating system so that agents could break into the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. The FBI ultimately broke into the phone with the help of an outside party; the agency has neither disclosed the party nor the nature of the vulnerability, preventing Apple from fixing it. The disclosure could spark new privacy tensions between the government and the technology industry. (File Photo) According to WikiLeaks, much of the CIA program centered on dozens of vulnerabilities it discovered but didn’t disclose to the gadget makers. Common practice calls for government agencies to disclose such flaws to companies privately, so that they could fix them. Instead, WikiLeaks claims, the CIA held on to the knowledge in order to conduct a variety of attacks. As a result, tech companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft haven’t been able to make the necessary fixes. “Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability,” WikiLeaks wrote in a press release. “If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others.” A BIG YAWN TO SOME Not everyone is worried, though. Alan Paller, director of research for the cybersecurity training outfit SANS Institute, said the case boils down to “spies who use their tools to do what they are paid to do.” He said criminals already have similar tools – and he’s more worried about that. Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis, said that agencies gathering intelligence on other organizations and governments need, by definition, technical exploits that aren’t public. WikiLeaks claims the hacks allowed the CIA to collect audio and other messages from data-scrambling communication apps such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram by intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. (Source: AP) If they’re authentic, the leaked CIA documents frame a stark reality: It may be that no digital conversation, photo or other slice of life can be shielded from spies and other intruders prying into smartphones, personal computers, tablets or just about device connected to the internet. “It’s getting to the point where anything you say, write or electronically transmit on a phone, you have to assume that it is going to be compromised in some way,” said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney who now specializes in cybersecurity and privacy for the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. SIDESTEPPING ENCRYPTION WikiLeaks claims the hacks allowed the CIA to collect audio and other messages from data-scrambling communication apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Confide by intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. The CIA didn’t appear to compromise the apps themselves, but rather the phone’s underlying operating system. According to WikiLeaks, the vulnerabilities were discovered by the CIA itself or obtained from other government agencies and cyberweapon contractors. (Source: AP) WikiLeaks says the CIA had separate teams looking for vulnerabilities in iPhones and Android phones and also targeted tablets such as iPads. According to WikiLeaks, the vulnerabilities were discovered by the CIA itself or obtained from other government agencies and cyberweapon contractors. CARS, TRUCKS AND TVS WikiLeaks also claims that the CIA worked with U.K. intelligence officials to turn microphones in Samsung smart TVs into listening devices. The microphones are normally there for viewers to make voice commands, such as requests for movie recommendations. If the TV is off, there’s no listening being done. But WikiLeaks claims that a CIA hack makes the target TV appear to be off when it’s actually on – and listening. WikiLeaks says the audio goes to a covert CIA server rather than a party authorized by Samsung. In such cases, audio isn’t limited to TV commands but could include everyday conversations. Also Read: WikiLeaks Vault 7 shows your next smart device is actually a stupid idea Other tools in the CIA’s arsenal target PCs running Microsoft’s Windows system, according to WikiLeaks, which says many of the attacks are in the form of viruses designed to spread through CDs and USB drives. WikiLeaks also says the CIA was also targeting control systems used by cars and trucks. Although WikiLeaks didn’t have details on how that might be used, it said the capability might allow the CIA to “engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.” Microsoft said it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Apple, Google and Samsung didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement, General Motors said it would be premature to comment on the documents, including its authenticity. But GM added that it knew of no injuries or death resulting from the hacking of a vehicle.

An alleged CIA surveillance program disclosed by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, March 7, 2017, purportedly targeted security weaknesses in smart TVs, smartphones, personal computers and even cars, and enabled snooping that could circumvent encryption on communications apps such as Facebook’s WhatsApp. WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used. But WikiLeaks claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. (AP/Carolyn Kaster) WikiLeaks published thousands of documents Tuesday described as secret files about CIA hacking tools the government employs to break into users' computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. The documents describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features intended to keep the private information of citizens and corporations safe from prying eyes. U.S. government employees, including President Donald Trump, use many of the same products and internet services purportedly compromised by the tools. The documents describe CIA efforts — cooperating with friendly foreign governments and the U.S. National Security Agency — to subvert the world's most popular technology platforms, including Apple's iPhones and iPads, Google's Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. The documents also include discussions about compromising some internet-connected televisions to turn them into listening posts. One document discusses hacking vehicle systems, indicating the CIA's interest in hacking modern cars with sophisticated on-board computers. WikiLeaks has a long track record of releasing top secret government documents, and experts who sifted through the material said it appeared legitimate. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said he was very concerned about the release and had asked the intelligence community for more information about it. Former CIA Director Mike Hayden told MSNBC he had undertaken only a cursory review of the documents, but that if they were what they were purported to be, it would amount to a "very extensive file of the tactics, techniques, procedures, targets and other political rules" under which the CIA hacks targets. "If it is that, it would be very, very damaging," he said. Jonathan Liu, a spokesman for the CIA, said: "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents." White House spokesman Sean Spicer also declined comment. Missing from WikiLeaks' trove are the actual hacking tools themselves, some of which were developed by government hackers while others were purchased from outsiders. WikiLeaks said it planned to avoid distributing tools "until a consensus emerges" on the political nature of the CIA's program and how such software could be analyzed, disarmed and published. Tuesday's disclosure left anxious consumers who use the products with little recourse, since repairing the software vulnerabilities in ways that might block the tools' effectiveness is the responsibility of leading technology companies. The revelations threatened to upend confidence in an Obama-era government program, the Vulnerability Equities Process, under which federal agencies warn technology companies about weaknesses in their software so they can be quickly fixed. It was not immediately clear how WikiLeaks obtained the information, and details in the documents could not immediately be verified. WikiLeaks said the material came from "an isolated, high-security network" inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence but didn't say whether the files were removed by a rogue employee or whether the theft involved hacking a federal contractor working for the CIA or perhaps breaking into a staging server where such information might have been temporarily stored. "The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive," WikiLeaks said in a statement. Some technology firms on Tuesday said they were evaluating the information. Microsoft Corp. said it was looking into the report, while the maker of secure messaging app Signal said the purported CIA tools affected users' actual phones and not its software design or encryption protocols. White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during the White House press briefing, Tuesday, March 7, 2017, in Washington.(AP/Evan Vucci) Read also: WikiLeaks: Assange's internet link 'severed' by state actor The manufacturer of the popular Telegram mobile messaging app said in a statement that manufacturers of cellphones and their operating systems, including Apple, Google and Samsung, were responsible for improving the security of their devices. It said the effort will require "many hours of work and many security updates" and assured its customers that "If the CIA is not on your back, you shouldn't start worrying yet." The tools described in the documents carried bizarre names, including Time Stomper, Fight Club, Jukebox, Bartender, Wild Turkey, Margarita and "RickyBobby," a racecar-driving character in the comedy film, "Talladega Nights." That RickyBobby tool, the documents said, was intended to plant and harvest files on computers running "newer versions of Microsoft Windows and Windows Server." It operated "as a lightweight implant for target computers" without raising warnings from antivirus or intrusion-detection software. It took advantage of files Microsoft built into Windows since at least 10 years ago. The files include comments by CIA hackers boasting in slang language of their prowess: "You know we got the dankest Trojans and collection tools," one reads. The documents show broad exchanges of tools and information among the CIA, NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as intelligence services of close allies Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. WikiLeaks claimed the CIA used both its Langley, Virginia, headquarters and the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, as bases for its covert hackers. The AP found that one purported CIA hack that imitates the Domain Name System — the internet's phone book — traced to an internet domain hosted in Germany. In an unusual move, WikiLeaks said it was withholding some secrets inside the documents. Among them, it said it had withheld details of tens of thousands of "CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States." WikiLeaks also said its data included a "substantial library" of digital espionage techniques borrowed from other countries, including Russia. If the authenticity of the documents is officially confirmed, it would represent yet another catastrophic breach for the U.S. intelligence community at the hands of WikiLeaks and its allies, which have repeatedly humbled Washington with the mass release of classified material, including from the State Department and the Pentagon. Tuesday's documents purported to be from the CIA's "Embedded Development Branch" discuss techniques for injecting malicious code into computers protected by the personal security products of leading international anti-virus companies. They describe ways to trick anti-virus products from companies including Russia-based Kaspersky Lab, Romania-based BitDefender, Dutch-based AVG Technologies, F-Secure of Finland and Rising Antivirus, a Chinese company. In the new trove, programmers also posted instructions for how to access user names and passwords in popular internet browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Some documents were classified "secret" or "top secret" and not for distribution to foreign nationals. One file said those classifications would protect deployed hacks from being "attributed" to the U.S. government. The practice of attribution, or identifying who was behind an intrusion, has been difficult for investigators probing sophisticated hacks that likely came from powerful nation-states. __________ Satter reported from Paris.

Andrew Harnik AP i By Tim Johnson tjohnson@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON A formidable CIA hacking division has amassed hundreds of tools to control smartphones and TVs, and it employed hidden flaws in products made by trusted firms such as Apple, Microsoft and Google for espionage purposes without notifying the companies of the vulnerabilities, WikiLeaks said Tuesday. WikiLeaks released what it said were 8,761 documents taken from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia, in what it described as “the largest intelligence publication in history.” The documents indicate that the CIA has collected “more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses and other ‘weaponized’ malware” that allow the agency to seize direct control of devices made by the biggest high-tech firms worldwide. One document indicated that the unit sought to develop ways to commandeer the control systems of vehicles. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:14 Parkville boat ramp where Toni Anderson's car was found Pause 3:24 Missouri baseball coach Steve Bieser on record start: 'It's hard to fathom' 0:36 Puppy saved from hot car during Royals game safe at KC Pet Project 2:45 Recent off-court events involving KU basketball team and McCarthy Hall 4:40 KU senior Landen Lucas on NCAA tourney: 'This is exactly where we want to be' 6:16 Chow Town Live: Beer Kitchen makes its fries crisp outside, fluffy in the middle 3:00 Brookside residents detail flooding woes 1:50 Adoption by the numbers 0:54 Family Wanted: Five siblings want to stay together 1:12 Shawnee Mission superintendent's advice to lawmakers Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Smartphones getting smarter UnifyID chief executive John Whaley talks about how smartphones can use 'implicit authentication' so that users don't need to always be identifying themselves on the internet. tjohnson@mcclatchydc.com WikiLeaks said the CIA had purposefully withheld information from the manufacturers about the vulnerabilities in their systems, undercutting a 2014 pledge by former President Barack Obama to disclose the vulnerabilities so they could be patched and made safe. A CIA spokesman declined to say whether the published materials were authentic. “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,” spokesman Jonathan Liu said. White House spokesman Sean Spicer also declined to comment. The House Intelligence Committee chair, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called the WikiLeaks disclosure “very, very serious.” The documents obtained by WikiLeaks, which the anti-secrecy group said span 2013 to 2016, reveal an arsenal of malware and dozens of “zero day” exploits against a wide range of products, including Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android, Microsoft’s Windows and even Samsung smart televisions, which can have their microphones activated covertly. A “zero day” is a previously undetected hole or vulnerability in software. It is so named because a victim has zero time between discovery of the flaw and penetration by an attacker. Some of the tools disclosed in the documents would allow the penetration of networks, implantation of malicious code, control of systems and removal of material. The tools target all kinds of everyday work and entertainment devices, from networks and desktop computers to smartphones and even computerized vehicle operating systems. EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM Specific tools target the most popular brands of smartphones, giving remote operators access to the phone’s location and its audio and text communications, and permitting covert activation of the camera and microphone, perhaps from a great distance. While iPhones compose only 14.5 percent of the global smartphone market, WikiLeaks said the focus on Apple’s iOS operating system “may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.” EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM The documents indicate that the CIA controlled 24 different vulnerabilities for Google’s Android operating system, which is used in as many as 5 out of 6 smartphones worldwide. “These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the smartphones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied,” WikiLeaks said. One document reveals collaboration between the CIA and Britain’s premier electronic signals intelligence agency, known as GCHQ, as well as a private cybersecurity company, Baitshop, in finding vulnerabilities in the iPhone. Another document shows collaboration between the CIA unit and MI5, the British domestic spying agency, to create “Weeping Angel,” a program that turns Samsung smart TV sets into covert listening devices. EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM Colorful names of other CIA hacking tools include “Brutal Kangaroo,” “Assassin,” “Hammer Drill,” “Swindle” and “Cutthroat.” The leaked documents indicated that the CIA tools could jump into isolated systems unconnected to the internet, maintain network infections after discovery and hide data in images. WikiLeaks said the CIA unit had “lost control” of much of its hacking arsenal and that the cyber weapons now circulated among hackers and contractors associated with the Center for Cyber Intelligence. It did not provide many details. It said one of those people objected to the unit’s lack of accountability and duplication of efforts with the National Security Agency, a rival intelligence arm, and had given the material to WikiLeaks to spark public discussion. place_quote1 “The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons,” WikiLeaks said. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM Major U.S. high-tech companies did not offer immediate reaction but they are likely to be angry over the government’s keeping vulnerabilities from them. In 2014, Obama ordered that if any agency wanted to keep a “zero day” vulnerability out of the public eye, it would have to argue its case to an Equities Review Board chaired by the National Security Council. U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., called for an immediate congressional investigation. place_quote2 “We need to know if the CIA lost control of its hacking tools, who may have those tools and how do we now protect the privacy of Americans,” Lieu said in a statement, adding that the “ramifications could be devastating.” EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE In other disclosures, WikiLeaks said: ▪  The CIA operated a covert hacker base out of the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, traveling throughout Europe from there. ▪  One CIA hacker unit, known as UMBRAGE, took malware from nations like Russia and adapted it for CIA purposes, with the intent of leaving the cyber “fingerprints” of another nation behind, throwing people off the trail. The technique was used in webcam capture, data destruction and escalating through target networks, according to the documents. ▪  A CIA tool known as Fine Dining could be loaded on a thumb drive and plugged into a target computer in front of the victim, ostensibly to show a video, play a computer game or run a fake virus scanner. While the decoy program runs, the underlying system is “ransacked.” The Center for Cyber Intelligence is directly under one of five directorates at the top of the CIA, the Directorate of Digital Innovation, according to an organizational chart. The CIA reports show the USG developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open. Reckless beyond words.&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 7, 2017 Exiled NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, in a tweet, described as “reckless beyond words” the CIA practice of finding vulnerabilities in products, then allowing the holes to remain open. Vince Houghton, a historian and curator at the International Spy Museum in Washington, said much of the information in the leak was likely dated. “Even if you pulled CIA programs from six months ago, they might already be obsolete,” said Houghton, an Army veteran who served in the Balkans and worked with intelligence agencies. “The speed at which these cyber programs work, if you haven’t pulled something from yesterday it might already be obsolete.” WikiLeaks said in a statement that it had redacted 70,875 portions of the released documents, including names, internet protocol addresses and specific coding for malware that could be used by criminals or others.

The documents describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features intended to keep the private information of citizens and corporations safe from prying eyes. U.S. government employees, including President Donald Trump, use many of the same products and internet services purportedly compromised by the tools. The documents describe CIA efforts — cooperating with friendly foreign governments and the U.S. National Security Agency — to subvert the world's most popular technology platforms, including Apple's iPhones and iPads, Google's Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. The documents also include discussions about compromising some internet-connected televisions to turn them into listening posts. One document discusses hacking vehicle systems, indicating the CIA's interest in hacking modern cars with sophisticated on-board computers. WikiLeaks has a long track record of releasing top secret government documents, and experts who sifted through the material said it appeared legitimate. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said he was very concerned about the release and had asked the intelligence community for more information about it. Former CIA Director Mike Hayden told MSNBC he had undertaken only a cursory review of the documents, but that if they were what they were purported to be, it would amount to a "very extensive file of the tactics, techniques, procedures, targets and other political rules" under which the CIA hacks targets. "If it is that, it would be very, very damaging," he said. Jonathan Liu, a spokesman for the CIA, said: "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents." White House spokesman Sean Spicer also declined comment. Missing from WikiLeaks' trove are the actual hacking tools themselves, some of which were developed by government hackers while others were purchased from outsiders. WikiLeaks said it planned to avoid distributing tools "until a consensus emerges" on the political nature of the CIA's program and how such software could be analyzed, disarmed and published. Tuesday's disclosure left anxious consumers who use the products with little recourse, since repairing the software vulnerabilities in ways that might block the tools' effectiveness is the responsibility of leading technology companies. The revelations threatened to upend confidence in an Obama-era government program, the Vulnerability Equities Process, under which federal agencies warn technology companies about weaknesses in their software so they can be quickly fixed. ALSO READ: House intelligence committee chairman concerned about WikiLeaks It was not immediately clear how WikiLeaks obtained the information, and details in the documents could not immediately be verified. WikiLeaks said the material came from "an isolated, high-security network" inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence but didn't say whether the files were removed by a rogue employee or whether the theft involved hacking a federal contractor working for the CIA or perhaps breaking into a staging server where such information might have been temporarily stored. "The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive," WikiLeaks said in a statement. Some technology firms on Tuesday said they were evaluating the information. Microsoft Corp. said it was looking into the report, while the maker of secure messaging app Signal said the purported CIA tools affected users' actual phones and not its software design or encryption protocols. The manufacturer of the popular Telegram mobile messaging app said in a statement that manufacturers of cellphones and their operating systems, including Apple, Google and Samsung, were responsible for improving the security of their devices. It said the effort will require "many hours of work and many security updates" and assured its customers that "If the CIA is not on your back, you shouldn't start worrying yet." The tools described in the documents carried bizarre names, including Time Stomper, Fight Club, Jukebox, Bartender, Wild Turkey, Margarita and "RickyBobby," a racecar-driving character in the comedy film, "Talladega Nights." That RickyBobby tool, the documents said, was intended to plant and harvest files on computers running "newer versions of Microsoft Windows and Windows Server." It operated "as a lightweight implant for target computers" without raising warnings from antivirus or intrusion-detection software. It took advantage of files Microsoft built into Windows since at least 10 years ago. The files include comments by CIA hackers boasting in slang language of their prowess: "You know we got the dankest Trojans and collection tools," one reads. The documents show broad exchanges of tools and information among the CIA, NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as intelligence services of close allies Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. WikiLeaks claimed the CIA used both its Langley, Virginia, headquarters and the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, as bases for its covert hackers. The AP found that one purported CIA hack that imitates the Domain Name System — the internet's phone book — traced to an internet domain hosted in Germany. In an unusual move, WikiLeaks said it was withholding some secrets inside the documents. Among them, it said it had withheld details of tens of thousands of "CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States." WikiLeaks also said its data included a "substantial library" of digital espionage techniques borrowed from other countries, including Russia. If the authenticity of the documents is officially confirmed, it would represent yet another catastrophic breach for the U.S. intelligence community at the hands of WikiLeaks and its allies, which have repeatedly humbled Washington with the mass release of classified material, including from the State Department and the Pentagon. Tuesday's documents purported to be from the CIA's "Embedded Development Branch" discuss techniques for injecting malicious code into computers protected by the personal security products of leading international anti-virus companies. They describe ways to trick anti-virus products from companies including Russia-based Kaspersky Lab, Romania-based BitDefender, Dutch-based AVG Technologies, F-Secure of Finland and Rising Antivirus, a Chinese company. In the new trove, programmers also posted instructions for how to access user names and passwords in popular internet browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Some documents were classified "secret" or "top secret" and not for distribution to foreign nationals. One file said those classifications would protect deployed hacks from being "attributed" to the U.S. government. The practice of attribution, or identifying who was behind an intrusion, has been difficult for investigators probing sophisticated hacks that likely came from powerful nation-states.

Apple today has started informing developers that use “hot code push” SDKs that it will soon start rejecting their applications. In a thread on the Apple Developer Forums, developers are reporting that they have started receiving messages from the company explaining that the code must be removed before any further updates will be approved. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case While Apple has yet to publicly comment on the change, the email sent to affected developers seems to imply that services like Rollout.io are the cause. The email reads: “Your app, extension, and/or linked framework appears to contain code designed explicitly with the capability to change your app’s behavior or functionality after App Review approval, which is not in compliance with section 3.3.2 of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and App Store Review Guideline 2.5.2. This code, combined with a remote resource, can facilitate significant changes to your app’s behavior compared to when it was initially reviewed for the App Store.” For those unfamiliar, hot code push services like Rollout allow developers to update their applications after they have been submitted to the App Store and approved. Here’s how Rollout describes itself: Rollout’s revolutionary SDK lets you react to production issues or modify your app in real time. And you don’t need to modify any existing code in advance. Whether it’s a bug you just discovered, a feature you want to toggle, or something else, you can use Rollout to modify any method or data in your app, instantly. It really shouldn’t come as too big of a surprise that Apple is starting to crack down on these type of SDKs. Seeing that they allow changes to be made to an app after App Store review, it’s really a miracle that they have lasted so long in Apple’s generally rather restricted ecosystem. Whether or not this is a good policy on Apple’s part, though, is up for debate. Specific information about Apple’s new policy on hot code push services like Rollout is unclear at this point. The way the email makes it seem, though, is that if developers want to be able to push official updates through the App Store, the Rollout code has to be removed or else the update will be rejected.

According to today’s report, the previously rumored 5-inch iPhone is actually the high-end model that has been rumored time and again. The report also claims that Apple may call this high-end model the “iPhone Edition.” Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case This evening’s report explains that Apple is currently testing a variety of different prototypes for its flagship model for this year. Specifically, the company is said to be prototyping models with and without the Home button, as well as models with glass, ceramic, and aluminum chassis designs. Additionally, Apple is apparently testing models with LCD TFT and OLED displays. Apple is said to be carrying out prototype testing in parallel with engineering validation testing, or EVT. In order to proceed to design validation testing, however, Apple reportedly needs more to time to procure materials needed to make final design decisions. Because of this, Macotakara says that production of the flagship iPhone may be late this year compared to previous years. Last year we published the article about additional iPhone 7s & iPhone 7s Plus model and the article about the 5 inch model equipped with the iSight Duo camera, but this 5 inch model would highly possibly be the “iPhone Edition” which is the premium model. Multiple prototype models exist for this model and the development continues to be carried out in parallel with EVT. The production level of development on various models are being done such as the models with IPS TFT, AMOLED, the model with or without home button, in addition to the models with a new glass, aluminum chassis, white ceramics etc. The report goes on to explain that a few things have been finalized at this point, including the concept of a 5-inch display, dual-cameras, and wireless charging. What seems to be happening here is that Macotakara is reporting the usable screen space, whereas other sources, such as KGI, have commonly referred to the total screen space including the function area. With the function area taken into account, it’s expected that the usable screen real estate will be somewhere around 5-inches or 5.1-inches. As far as the display type goes, it seems as if OLED is the goal but that it depends on supply of the panels as to whether or not Apple ends up using that technology. Macotakara says that the so-called “iPhone Edition” will be announced in September, as has been the case for all of the recent iPhone announcements. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are also expected at that event. The iPhone Edition, however, “may be very much behind” the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in terms of actual release, something that was reported last week, as well. What do you think of the possibility of Apple calling its flagship smartphone the iPhone Edition? Let us know down in the comments.

Shares13 Wed, 8 Mar 2017-09:43am , Washington , Reuters WikilLeaks reveal how some devices can be turned to spy on their owners. Anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks on Tuesday published what it said were thousands of pages of internal CIA discussions about hacking techniques used over several years, renewing concerns about the security of consumer electronics and embarrassing yet another U.S. intelligence agency. The discussion transcripts showed that CIA hackers could get into Apple iPhones, Google Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. Cyber security experts disagreed about the extent of the fallout from the data dump, but said a lot would depend on whether WikiLeaks followed through on a threat to publish the actual hacking tools that could do damage. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate. A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in U.S. hacking tools told Reuters the documents included correct "cover" terms describing active cyber programs. Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other U.S. and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. The files did not indicate the actual encryption of Signal or other secure messaging apps had been compromised. The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest breach in recent years of classified material from U.S. intelligence agencies. Security experts differed over how much the disclosures could damage U.S. cyber espionage. Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection. "This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices ... I haven't yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices," said Tarah Wheeler, senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec. Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States. Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicized. In one case, the documents say, U.S. and British personnel, under a program known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. The CIA and White House declined comment. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. Google declined to comment on the purported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter. Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U.S. government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end-to-end encryption tools like Signal. Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as "confirmation that what we're doing is working." Signal and the like are "pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive, high-risk, extremely targeted attacks." CIA CYBER PROGRAMS The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any U.S. data for counterintelligence purposes. The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: U.S. intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products. Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA's "entire hacking capacity." The documents only include snippets of computer code, not the full programs that would be needed to conduct cyber exploits. WikiLeaks said it was refraining from disclosing usable code from CIA's cyber arsenal "until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analysed, disarmed and published." U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia's security services. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win the presidency. WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies. Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign, often citing hacked emails it published to bolster his attacks on Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks said on Tuesday that the documents showed that the CIA hoarded serious security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public, as called for under a process established by President Barack Obama. Rob Knake, a former official who dealt with the issue under Obama, said he had not seen evidence in what was published to support that conclusion. The process "is not a policy of unilateral disarmament in cyberspace. The mere fact that the CIA may have exploited zero-day [previously undisclosed] vulnerabilities should not surprise anyone," said Knake, now at the Council on Foreign Relations. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material. In a press release, the group said, "The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive." U.S. intelligence agencies have suffered a series of security breaches, including Snowden's. In 2010, U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks. Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the secrets in his home.

Apple Claims It Has Already Patched Exploits Unveiled in Latest CIA Leaks GO Many of these iOS bugs have been addressed in latest updates Mar 8, 2017 04:14 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Following the recent publishing of documents allegedly originating from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), Apple has issued an official statement claiming that many of the exploits mentioned have already been addressed. As per documents released by WikiLeaks yesterday, CIA employs various cyber intrusion techniques under the name of “Vault 7.” No less than 14 iOS exploits are mentioned in these documents, which could be used to surveil or even remotely command and control an iPhone. Apparently, CCI bought many zero-day exploits from the open market, but also gathered other assets through other agencies, which allowed CIA to develop certain spy tools to continue surveillance of iOS devices. Apple has responded today and said that most of the exploits mentioned in the leaked documents have been patched in the latest public version of iOS, which was released back in January. Some security vulnerabilities have yet to be patched “Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' privacy and security. The technology built into today's iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we're constantly working to keep it that way. Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80 percent of users running the latest version of our operating system. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.” Since not all exploits have been addressed, Apple says it will continue to work on patching the remaining ones. Obviously, the Cupertino-based company did not reveal which exploits have yet to be patched and which ones have already been addressed. Besides the iOS-specific exploits, WikiLeaks published documents suggesting CIA is using special code to infiltrate Android devices and Samsung smart TVs. #Vault 7#Apple exploits#Apple iOS update#iOS exploits#CIA hack subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Leaves iOS 10 Kernel Unencrypted on Purpose for Increased Security Apple Disables Old Flash Player Versions Due to Security Vulnerabilities Mozilla to End Firefox Support for OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8 in August FBI “Doesn’t Know” How It Hacked Terrorist iPhone Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    Apple iOS 10 New Mac Apps Tidy Up!: A complex duplicate finder solution for macOS that is able to analyze various types of files, such as images, music, applications, and more Things: A stylish and easy to use task management application for Mac OS X that enables you to create, filter and organize tasks by different criteria.

Mobile 2 0 0 March 7, 2017 iPhone 8: Will Apple Release Version With Stylus Support? Daryl Deino The iPhone 8 is one of the most talked-about future smartphones, but there hasn’t been much said about the iPhone 8 Plus (if that’s what it will be called). A couple months back, Patently Apple revealed that a new patent showed the Apple Pencil working with the iPhone. “One of today’s patent applications that were published by the US Patent & Trademark Office reveals Apple Pencil working with the iPhone and with an expanded array of applications for the iPhone and iPad.” The article added that the Pencil will eventually work beyond the Notes app and users will be able to use it to select portions of videos, portions of pictures, and do other things on a future iPhone. This would certainly hurt Samsung, who is still dealing with the fallout from the Galaxy Note 7 recalls. Many suspect that the iPhone 8 Plus could have a smaller Apple Pencil attached to the smartphone. Besides the size of the phone and the ability to use a stylus, the iPhone 8 Plus is said to have all the features of the regular iPhone 8. Most sources point out that the iPhone 8 series will include an edge-to-edge OLED display. BGR reports that Apple might have an ultrasound Touch ID built into the display. The iPhone 8 could have an ultrasound Touch ID feature. [Image by Sascha Steinbach/Getty Images] “A new report indicates that Apple has found a way to integrate Touch ID into the OLED screen of the iPhone, revealing the fingerprint sensor will be based on novel technology,” writes columnist Chris Smith, adding that supply chain sources familiar with the new iPhone decided to ignore the usual type of fingerprint sensor and instead use its own Authentech algorithm and Privaris’ glass identification technology to create a different kind of fingerprint ID solution. The downside of all this is that it would push iPhone production to the beginning of September. For the past couple of years, the main production on the iPhone has started in August — just in time to release the phone to stores in September. However, many of the commenters, who appear to be Samsung fans, certainly don’t think the new Touch ID is a big deal. “You mean Apple looked at Qualcomm’s Sense ID [for Samsung phones], said that’s awesome and went off to make their own version?” sarcastically asks Chipsy6. “They’ll buy Qualcomm’s and claim they invented it. Their sheep will believe it, also sue other phones that use it,” answers Aggie. BGR mentions in another article that Apple may release three different versions of the iPhone 8. The next iPhone will come in 3 different versions. [Image by Daryl Deino] “The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this fall, will come in three configurations — two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display. By adding more large-screen options to the lineup to meet growing demand for BIG, Apple intends to raise the average iPhone price, which has already gone up by about 10% in the past three years to nearly $700.” The article adds that the iPhone 8 will mark the first major change in form factor since Apple released the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September of 2014. The redesign features extremely small bezels, which will allow Apple to fit in a much larger display than usual. Twitter is brewing with excitement for the iPhone 8. iphone 8 leaks got me excited — Euros (@euzzzz_) March 2, 2017 i can't wait to get the iphone 8. ive had my iphone 6 for two years. — kelsey (@bieberult) March 7, 2017 As the Inquisitr reported this past weekend, the updated iPad Pro could very well be the next product launch from Apple. There have been new commercials released to promote how an iPad is a personal computer replacement — something a lot of people would disagree with. Still, 2017 appears to be the year of Apple’s big comeback.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 8 March 2017 | MYT 11:30 AM Songwriters sing blues over diminished royalties from streaming by lucas shaw Play it again, Sam: Songwriters are complaining – again – that streaming services like Spotify pay them too little for their songs, but streaming services counter that they already pay more than they can really afford to musicians, and blame gatekeepers – record labels, music publishers and others – for keeping the lion's share of the money. — Spotify The writers who craft songs for artistes from Garth Brooks to Beyoncé plan to tell a panel of judges this week that the increasing popularity of music-streaming services like Spotify will destroy their profession unless they get more royalties.  In a hearing scheduled to begin March 8, songwriters and the organisations representing them will try to persuade three US federal judges on the Copyright Royalty Board in Washington to adopt a new standard that could earn songwriters a higher rate from streaming. Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Pandora Media Inc and Spotify Ltd are countering with their own proposals.  On-demand streaming has boosted overall industry sales two years in a row, surpassing iTunes and physical CDs as the largest source of revenue for the music industry. Songwriters say the shift has cut their pay and see the hearing as their best chance to propose a palatable status quo. Whatever rate the court picks will last five years.  Under the current model, streaming services give songwriters the greatest number of three possible outcomes – all of which amount to a share of revenue generated by the services. Songwriters want to add a per-stream rate to protect them from a number of changes in the industry that could limit their share of future sales in the industry’s fastest-growing sector.  “We should get compensated every time someone streams a song,” said David Israelite, chief executive officer of the National Music Publishing Association, a trade organisation. “The structure is a complicated formula that’s about percentages of revenue, and we don’t think that works well for us, or that it’s fair to songwriters.”  Same tune  It’s a familiar refrain. The music industry has been fighting Internet companies in court and public for almost 20 years. While record labels’ sales have grown recently, they still have a long way to go to recover from listeners’ shift from CDs to pirated songs, singles from iTunes and free videos on YouTube.  All five streaming companies tout how much money they already pay back to musicians, and blame gatekeepers – record labels, music publishers and others – for keeping too much of the money. Apple has proposed a per-streaming royalty rate, but the songwriters say it’s too low.  Neither Spotify nor Pandora is profitable, and both companies argue that they already give away more than they can afford. Spotify, the largest of the music-streaming services, has been contemplating an initial public offering, but questions have lingered about its ability to make money eventually.  Alphabet’s Google unit declined to comment on the hearing in Washington. Spokesmen for the other companies didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Awarding royalties for songwriters is a byzantine process. While record labels can negotiate with Spotify on the open market, songwriters’ rates in the US are subject to government regulation due to a law written in the era of the player piano. Some publishers, which represent songwriters and administer their royalties, already have their own deals with the streaming companies, but the hearing this week gives them a chance to set a new bar for the arrangements.  While recording artistes have turned to touring to make up for lost CD sales, songwriters have no similar recourse. The number of composers working in Nashville has shrunk to less than 400 today from around 3,500 about 13 years ago, according to Lee Thomas Miller, one of the songwriters who may testify at the hearing.  “Spotify or Pandora will play a song millions and millions of times, and those are worth US$10 (RM44),” said Miller, who has written hits performed by country stars Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw and Brad Paisley. “The business of songwriting and publishing is over unless they change the way we get paid.”  Battle averted  Songwriters and online services avoided a drawn-out legal fight five years ago – the last time the rates were reviewed. Then, most of the major streaming services were either small or non-existent, and the framework for those deals was based on projections for a business that didn’t yet exist.  Paid streaming services have since ballooned. More than 100 million people around the world pay for a service of some kind, with Spotify and Apple Music attracting the lion’s share of customers.  On-demand streaming services make the majority of their money from paying subscribers, and some, such as Apple, don’t offer any free on-demand music. But the majority of music listening still occurs on free, advertising-supported services offered by YouTube and Spotify. Spotify generates a small fraction of its overall revenue from free customers, and songwriters would like a bigger portion of those proceeds, too.  Free tunes  Amazon gives its streaming services for free to customers of its Prime delivery service, and publishers anticipate that other companies, such as mobile providers, will offer music as a free enticement for their packages. That could undercut their share of sales.  Publishers also expect that the growth in paying subscribers will slow even as consumption keeps growing.  “You have these giant companies using music to drive economics of other things about their business,” Israelite said. “Because of that, we’re likely to have a big war over how much they should pay songwriters to do things they do.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Google ramps up investment in fibre cable, training Africans Capcom and Disney team for retro game collection Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

It always holds its own conferences at its own pace, though those usually do coincide with some major events. Around this time last year, Apple was preparing for an iPhone SE and 9.7-inch iPad Pro. This year, however, Apple’s traditional Spring gathering might be running a wee bit late. According to speculation, Apple could be holding that event, where it is expected to launch three new iPads, in the first week of April and at its brand new campus. The speculation is, funnily enough, based on the availability dates noted on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s store page. Stocks for the first and largest iPad Pro has so far been scarce, leading to speculation that a refresh is on the way. If the “2-3 weeks shipping time” is any indicator, that refresh and resupply will happen in the first week of April, possibly 4th April. That also happily coincides with the opening of Apple’s new Park. Though the new HQ isn’t yet completely done, with landscaping work still ongoing, Apple already said that the site will be open to some employees starting next month. Specifically, the 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater could be the venue for that opening ceremony and iPad unveiling. As for the tablets themselves, Apple has been rumored to have three new iPads to announced. A 12.9-inch iPad Pro will basically replace the year-old model while a 9.7-inch iPad is set to be Apple’s entry-level tablet. Completely new to the roster, and quite unusual for Apple, is a 10.5-inch iPad Pro setting up camp in between.

Apple this evening has issued a statement on the matter, saying that “many of the issues leaked today were already patched” in the most recent version of iOS. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In the statement (via Kif Leswing) Apple explains that it is deeply committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of its customers. While it says that “many” of the issues leaked today have already been patched, Apple also says that it will continue to work to address any identified vulnerabilities. “Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers’ privacy and security. The technology built into today’s iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers and we’re constantly working to keep it that way. Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80 percent of users running the latest version of our operating system. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue to work rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.” The WikiLeaks data claimed that the CIA had “lost control” of the majority of its hacking arsenal, including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. The leaked data today included charts that detail iOS exploits that would allow the CIA to surveil iPhone users and control their devices. Several security experts commented on the leaked data, though some iOS developers were left unimpressed and stated that nothing in the leaked data dump was new. The documents have been posted on Wikileaks and more of the technical details can be found there. Either way, Apple seems rather calm about the entire situation at this point.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues IT professionals think Apple devices are easier to manage, according to new survey Oscar Raymundo 8 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Productivity A recent survey has found that your IT department thinks a Mac is more manageable than a PC or Chromebook. According to a survey of IT professionals, Macs and iOS devices are easier to manage when it comes to security, device configuration, software deployment, and support. Of those surveyed, 62 percent said the Mac is as easy or easier to deploy than PC, and 93 percent said it’s as easy or easier to deploy an iPhone or iPad over another device. While most IT professionals found Apple’s products easier to manage overall, that is not the case when it comes to Mac integration. Only 36 percent of IT professionals claim that it is easy or easier to integrate Macs into other environments. The survey is based on responses from 300 IT professionals and was commissioned by Jamf, the software management firm that focuses solely on Apple devices. In addition, the survey found that a whopping 99 percent of companies have iOS devices in use, while 90 percent use Macs. Jamf speculates that Apple’s penetration in enterprise is being fuelled by device choice programs, with user preference leaning towards Apple devices. According to the survey, 71 percent of companies offered employees a choice between an iPhone, an Android device, or a Windows phone, while 44 percent offered them their choice between a Mac or PC. Employees’ use of Apple devices also went up in 2016, with 76 percent of companies seeing an increase in iOS adoption and 74 percent seeing an increase in Mac adoption. Jamf cites IBM as an example of a device choice program that led to the world’s largest Mac deployment for enterprise. Since 2015, IBM has deployed almost 100,000 Macs. According to IBM’s internal survey, 73 percent of its employees choose a Mac as their next computer. User preference was also a key factor driving adoption of Apple products in education, according to the survey. Ninety percent of K-12 schools use iPads, and 70 percent use Mac. In higher education, 94 percent have iOS users and 80 percent use Mac, the survey found. “Similar to the enterprise, the education sector agrees that Mac and iPad are easier to manage than other devices,” read the press release. These findings may seem to counter an earlier report that found a decrease in shipments of Apple products to K-12 schools. That report, however, was based on new shipments, not already installed products. So, while more Chromebooks may have shipped to schools in 2016, it’s possible that Macs still account for a higher percentage of laptops installed in classrooms. Why this matters: Despite just recently starting to lose ground to Google, Apple’s grip on education is not necessarily loosening. After all, it was just in 2013 when nearly half of all products shipped to classrooms came from Apple. And those products have not yet been replaced by Chromebooks or Windows tablets, at least according to the Jamf survey.

The documents describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features intended to keep the private information of citizens and corporations safe from prying eyes. US government employees, including President Donald Trump, use many of the same products and internet services purportedly compromised by the tools. The documents describe CIA efforts - cooperating with friendly foreign governments and the US National Security Agency - to subvert the world's most popular technology platforms, including Apple's iPhones and iPads, Google's Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. The documents also include discussions about compromising some internet-connected televisions to turn them into listening posts. One document discusses hacking vehicle systems, indicating the CIA's interest in hacking modern cars with sophisticated on-board computers. WikiLeaks has a long track record of releasing top secret government documents, and experts who sifted through the material said it appeared legitimate. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said he was very concerned about the release and had asked the intelligence community for more information about it. Former CIA Director Mike Hayden told MSNBC he had undertaken only a cursory review of the documents, but that if they were what they were purported to be, it would amount to a "very extensive file of the tactics, techniques, procedures, targets and other political rules" under which the CIA hacks targets. "If it is that, it would be very, very damaging," he said. Jonathan Liu, a spokesman for the CIA, said: "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents." White House spokesman Sean Spicer also declined comment. Missing from WikiLeaks' trove are the actual hacking tools themselves, some of which were developed by government hackers while others were purchased from outsiders. WikiLeaks said it planned to avoid distributing tools "until a consensus emerges" on the political nature of the CIA's program and how such software could be analyzed, disarmed and published. Tuesday's disclosure left anxious consumers who use the products with little recourse, since repairing the software vulnerabilities in ways that might block the tools' effectiveness is the responsibility of leading technology companies. The revelations threatened to upend confidence in an Obama-era government program, the Vulnerability Equities Process, under which federal agencies warn technology companies about weaknesses in their software so they can be quickly fixed. It was not immediately clear how WikiLeaks obtained the information, and details in the documents could not immediately be verified. WikiLeaks said the material came from "an isolated, high-security network" inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence but didn't say whether the files were removed by a rogue employee or whether the theft involved hacking a federal contractor working for the CIA or perhaps breaking into a staging server where such information might have been temporarily stored. "The archive appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive," WikiLeaks said in a statement. Some technology firms on Tuesday said they were evaluating the information. Microsoft Corp. said it was looking into the report, while the maker of secure messaging app Signal said the purported CIA tools affected users' actual phones and not its software design or encryption protocols. The manufacturer of the popular Telegram mobile messaging app said in a statement that manufacturers of cellphones and their operating systems, including Apple, Google and Samsung, were responsible for improving the security of their devices. It said the effort will require "many hours of work and many security updates" and assured its customers that "If the CIA is not on your back, you shouldn't start worrying yet." The tools described in the documents carried bizarre names, including Time Stomper, Fight Club, Jukebox, Bartender, Wild Turkey, Margarita and "RickyBobby," a racecar-driving character in the comedy film, "Talladega Nights." That RickyBobby tool, the documents said, was intended to plant and harvest files on computers running "newer versions of Microsoft Windows and Windows Server." It operated "as a lightweight implant for target computers" without raising warnings from antivirus or intrusion-detection software. It took advantage of files Microsoft built into Windows since at least 10 years ago. The files include comments by CIA hackers boasting in slang language of their prowess: "You know we got the dankest Trojans and collection tools," one reads. The documents show broad exchanges of tools and information among the CIA, NSA and other US intelligence agencies, as well as intelligence services of close allies Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. WikiLeaks claimed the CIA used both its Langley, Virginia, headquarters and the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, as bases for its covert hackers. The AP found that one purported CIA hack that imitates the Domain Name System - the internet's phone book - traced to an internet domain hosted in Germany. In an unusual move, WikiLeaks said it was withholding some secrets inside the documents. Among them, it said it had withheld details of tens of thousands of "CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States." WikiLeaks also said its data included a "substantial library" of digital espionage techniques borrowed from other countries, including Russia. If the authenticity of the documents is officially confirmed, it would represent yet another catastrophic breach for the US intelligence community at the hands of WikiLeaks and its allies, which have repeatedly humbled Washington with the mass release of classified material, including from the State Department and the Pentagon. Tuesday's documents purported to be from the CIA's "Embedded Development Branch" discuss techniques for injecting malicious code into computers protected by the personal security products of leading international anti-virus companies. They describe ways to trick anti-virus products from companies including Russia-based Kaspersky Lab, Romania-based BitDefender, Dutch-based AVG Technologies, F-Secure of Finland and Rising Antivirus, a Chinese company. In the new trove, programmers also posted instructions for how to access user names and passwords in popular internet browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Some documents were classified "secret" or "top secret" and not for distribution to foreign nationals. One file said those classifications would protect deployed hacks from being "attributed" to the US government. The practice of attribution, or identifying who was behind an intrusion, has been difficult for investigators probing sophisticated hacks that likely came from powerful nation-states.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive High-speed chase ends in fiery crash; Apple Valley man arrested Tuesday Mar 7, 2017 at 6:01 PM Mar 7, 2017 at 6:17 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — A man allegedly responsible for a high-speed chase that ended in a fiery crash was arrested Friday, authorities said Tuesday. Randall Lee Cline, 63, of Apple Valley, was arrested following the incident, which ended when Cline's vehicle collided with another vehicle during the pursuit. The crash left a man with “non-life threatening” injuries, Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station Trish Hill said. The chase started when deputies attempted to stop a silver Ford Taurus with no license plates near Navajo Road and Highway 18 just after 2 p.m Friday. The driver, later identified as Cline, failed to stop and fled the scene at a high rate of speed toward Navajo Road and Sitting Bull Road, authorities said. “(Cline) continued driving in speeds exceeding 100 mph,” Hill said. “He was passing vehicles left and right and blowing stop signs. He actually went through a school zone right around the time school is out.” With deputies close behind, Cline continued driving until his vehicle collided with a green Ford Ranger near Tussing Ranch and Deep Creek roads. The Taurus burst in flames after it struck the back of the Ranger, Hill said. The man in the Ford Ranger was the truck’s only occupant. He was taken to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary for treatment of his injuries. No further updates on his condition were available Tuesday. Cline fled on foot following the crash but was detained after a short pursuit. Hill said he was taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center but was treated and released before he was booked into the West Valley Detention Center. Cline remains in custody in lieu of $100,000 bail. Court records show prosecutors charged him with a count of felony evading a peace officer and a count of hit-and-run causing injury. He pleaded not guilty to both charges on Tuesday. Cline’s next court appearance is scheduled at 8:30 a.m. next Wednesday. Paola Baker may be reached at 760-955-5332 or PBaker@VVDailyPress.com. Follow her on Twitter at @DP_PaolaBaker.

But will it ever make money? By Emily Bary March 7, 2017 6:41 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Spotify has built a sizeable lead over Apple in the world of streaming music. Photo: Jason Davis/Getty Images Apple, the pioneer in selling digital music, has clearly met its match when it comes to streaming. Last week, Spotify announced it had reached 50 million paid streaming subscribers. That’s more than double Apple’s base for its newer streaming service called Apple Music. And while streaming seems to be offsetting much of the revenue lost to disappearing CD sales, it’s still not clear that it’s good business. More from Barron’s Next Key Executive Calls Pandora ’Overvalued’ What Warren Buffett Learned About the iPhone at Dairy Queen When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare One notable media executive had some harsh words for streaming music services during a speech at a Deutsche Bank investor conference on Monday. “We think it’s a very unattractive business,” said Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei, noting the high cost of music rights. “You’ve seen that with Spotify now with 50 million users [and] still not profitable.” Granted, Maffei has a horse in the ring. His company controls Sirius XM Holdings, the satellite-radio business, and streaming music isn’t exactly good for radio. (Though Liberty has been floated as a potential buyer of Pandora Media, Maffei said Monday that such a scenario was “unlikely” to happen.) In the end, Spotify might end up being the more attractive takeover candidate among streaming-music companies, according to one Wall Street analyst. “Stop thinking about Spotify as a music service and start thinking about it as a media platform that simply started with music, but has the potential to be so much more,” BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield wrote last week. “Homescreen-worthy apps like Spotify that are sustainably used daily, let alone hourly, are nearly impossible to create,” he added. Greenfield sees the potential for Spotify to become a platform where other companies can push add-on services, much the way Amazon.com allows users to buy subscriptions to Showtime and HBO through Prime Video. Big Picture: Spotify is lapping Apple when it comes to streaming music, but the win comes at a high cost.

But WikiLeaks claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — WikiLeaks published thousands of documents Tuesday described as secret files about CIA hacking tools the government employs to break into users' computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. The documents describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features intended to keep the private information of citizens and corporations safe from prying eyes. U.S. government employees, including President Donald Trump, use many of the same products and internet services purportedly compromised by the tools. The documents describe CIA efforts — cooperating with friendly foreign governments and the U.S. National Security Agency — to subvert the world's most popular technology platforms, including Apple's iPhones and iPads, Google's Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. The documents also include discussions about compromising some internet-connected televisions to turn them into listening posts. One document discusses hacking vehicle systems, indicating the CIA's interest in hacking modern cars with sophisticated on-board computers. WikiLeaks has a long track record of releasing top secret government documents, and experts who sifted through the material said it appeared legitimate. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said he was very concerned about the release and had asked the intelligence community for more information about it. Former CIA Director Mike Hayden told MSNBC he had undertaken only a cursory review of the documents, but that if they were what they were purported to be, it would amount to a "very extensive file of the tactics, techniques, procedures, targets and other political rules" under which the CIA hacks targets. "If it is that, it would be very, very damaging," he said. Jonathan Liu, a spokesman for the CIA, said: "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents." White House spokesman Sean Spicer also declined comment. Missing from WikiLeaks' trove are the actual hacking tools themselves, some of which were developed by government hackers while others were purchased from outsiders. WikiLeaks said it planned to avoid distributing tools "until a consensus emerges" on the political nature of the CIA's program and how such software could be analyzed, disarmed and published. Tuesday's disclosure left anxious consumers who use the products with little recourse, since repairing the software vulnerabilities in ways that might block the tools' effectiveness is the responsibility of leading technology companies. The revelations threatened to upend confidence in an Obama-era government program, the Vulnerability Equities Process, under which federal agencies warn technology companies about weaknesses in their software so they can be quickly fixed. It was not immediately clear how WikiLeaks obtained the information, and details in the documents could not immediately be verified. WikiLeaks said the material came from "an isolated, high-security network" inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence but didn't say whether the files were removed by a rogue employee or whether the theft involved hacking a federal contractor working for the CIA or perhaps breaking into a staging server where such information might have been temporarily stored.

It said the effort will require "many hours of work and many security updates" and assured its customers that "If the CIA is not on your back, you shouldn't start worrying yet." The tools described in the documents carried bizarre names, including Time Stomper, Fight Club, Jukebox, Bartender, Wild Turkey, Margarita and "RickyBobby," a racecar-driving character in the comedy film, "Talladega Nights." That RickyBobby tool, the documents said, was intended to plant and harvest files on computers running "newer versions of Microsoft Windows and Windows Server." It operated "as a lightweight implant for target computers" without raising warnings from antivirus or intrusion-detection software. It took advantage of files Microsoft built into Windows since at least 10 years ago. The files include comments by CIA hackers boasting in slang language of their prowess: "You know we got the dankest Trojans and collection tools," one reads. The documents show broad exchanges of tools and information among the CIA, NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as intelligence services of close allies Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. WikiLeaks claimed the CIA used both its Langley, Virginia, headquarters and the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, as bases for its covert hackers. The AP found that one purported CIA hack that imitates the Domain Name System — the internet's phone book — traced to an internet domain hosted in Germany.

NEW YORK >> Maybe the CIA is spying on you through your television set after all. Documents released by WikiLeaks allege a CIA surveillance program that targets everyday gadgets ranging from smart TVs to smartphones to cars. Such snooping, WikiLeaks said, could turn some of these devices into recorders of everyday conversations — and could also circumvent data-scrambling encryption on communications apps such as Facebook’s WhatsApp. WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used “until a consensus emerges” on the nature of the CIA’s program and how the methods should be “analyzed, disarmed and published.” But WikiLeaks — a nonprofit that routinely publishes confidential documents, frequently from government sources — claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. MORE PRIVACY CLASHES If true, the disclosure could spark new privacy tensions between the government and the technology industry. Relations have been fraught since 2013, when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed secret NSA surveillance of phone and digital communications. Just last year, the two sides feuded over the FBI’s calls for Apple to rewrite its operating system so that agents could break into the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. The FBI ultimately broke into the phone with the help of an outside party; the agency has neither disclosed the party nor the nature of the vulnerability, preventing Apple from fixing it. According to WikiLeaks, much of the CIA program centered on dozens of vulnerabilities it discovered but didn’t disclose to the gadget makers. Common practice calls for government agencies to disclose such flaws to companies privately, so that they could fix them. Instead, WikiLeaks claims, the CIA held on to the knowledge in order to conduct a variety of attacks. As a result, tech companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft haven’t been able to make the necessary fixes. “Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability,” WikiLeaks wrote in a press release. “If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others.” A BIG YAWN TO SOME Not everyone is worried, though. Alan Paller, director of research for the cybersecurity training outfit SANS Institute, said the case boils down to “spies who use their tools to do what they are paid to do.” He said criminals already have similar tools — and he’s more worried about that. Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis, said that agencies gathering intelligence on other organizations and governments need, by definition, technical exploits that aren’t public. If they’re authentic, the leaked CIA documents frame a stark reality: It may be that no digital conversation, photo or other slice of life can be shielded from spies and other intruders prying into smartphones, personal computers, tablets or just about device connected to the internet. “It’s getting to the point where anything you say, write or electronically transmit on a phone, you have to assume that it is going to be compromised in some way,” said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney who now specializes in cybersecurity and privacy for the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. SIDESTEPPING ENCRYPTION WikiLeaks claims the hacks allowed the CIA to collect audio and other messages from data-scrambling communication apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Confide by intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. The CIA didn’t appear to compromise the apps themselves, but rather the phone’s underlying operating system. WikiLeaks says the CIA had separate teams looking for vulnerabilities in iPhones and Android phones and also targeted tablets such as iPads. According to WikiLeaks, the vulnerabilities were discovered by the CIA itself or obtained from other government agencies and cyberweapon contractors. CARS, TRUCKS AND TVS WikiLeaks also claims that the CIA worked with U.K. intelligence officials to turn microphones in Samsung smart TVs into listening devices. The microphones are normally there for viewers to make voice commands, such as requests for movie recommendations. If the TV is off, there’s no listening being done. But WikiLeaks claims that a CIA hack makes the target TV appear to be off when it’s actually on — and listening. WikiLeaks says the audio goes to a covert CIA server rather than a party authorized by Samsung. In such cases, audio isn’t limited to TV commands but could include everyday conversations. Other tools in the CIA’s arsenal target PCs running Microsoft’s Windows system, according to WikiLeaks, which says many of the attacks are in the form of viruses designed to spread through CDs and USB drives. WikiLeaks also says the CIA was also targeting control systems used by cars and trucks. Although WikiLeaks didn’t have details on how that might be used, it said the capability might allow the CIA to “engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.” Microsoft said it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Apple, Google and Samsung didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement, General Motors said it would be premature to comment on the documents, including its authenticity. But GM added that it knew of no injuries or death resulting from the hacking of a vehicle.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley Choice Energy information meeting draws full house Tuesday Mar 7, 2017 at 5:16 PM Mar 7, 2017 at 6:15 PM Steve Hunt Editor @SteveHunteditor APPLE VALLEY — Beginning April 1, town residents will have a simple choice when it comes to electricity, Apple Valley Public Services Manager Joseph Moon told a large crowd on Tuesday afternoon: Save money or don't. A near-capacity crowd estimated at 300 people turned out at the Apple Valley Conference Center for one of two informational meetings on the town's Choice Energy program. A second meeting was held Tuesday night. "The ultimate goal is to provide a choice for citizens of Apple Valley and save money," Moon said. "You can do that or not. "Before this, how many choices did you have for energy? You had one choice (Southern California Edison). Now you do have a choice." Unless residents opt-out of the Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) program, the town will become Apple Valley's default energy provider on April 1. All that means is the town has the opportunity to buy energy on the open market and sell it to its residents at a lower rate than Southern California Edison now offers. Moon said Apple Valley has signed a five-year contract with Shell Energy North America, a subsidiary of Shell Oil, thus locking in a stable electricity rate for its residents for those five years. That's why the town will be able to offer a 3 percent savings to residents on the cost of that electricity, Moon said. He said Southern California Edison will continue to transmit the energy, send out residents' electricity bills and handle any issues that may arise, such as downed power poles or outages. The 3 percent savings won't apply to a resident's total monthly bill, just that portion of the bill that pertains to energy use. (For example, SCE bills for energy transmission separate of use.) Though this program is new to the Victor Valley, it's not new to the state. The city of Lancaster has been involved in the CCA program, as well as several Northern California cities. "There are one million customers in California under the CCA umbrella," Moon said. "Most of them are up north. This will be commonplace in the next year or two. We are at the forefront. "I started looking at CCAs in 2010. But in 2010 it was not feasible. It would have cost too much for citizens. Finally, in late 2015, early 2016 it became feasible, because the cost of energy had gone down." "Lancaster has had it a couple years now and it's been very beneficial," Town Manager Frank Robinson said. "They started out just providing to commercial customers, then opened it up to residential. "Now we're getting calls from other communities, not just here in the Valley but also down the hill." Robinson said he thought having a CCA could help Apple Valley attract businesses, especially those whose energy use is substantial, as 3 percent savings could be an a significant amount of money. The great thing for the town is it doesn't take on the cost of generation or transmission, both Moon and Robinson said, all it has to do is buy the energy, which residents ultimately pay for. Although Moon said the General Fund will loan the program $2.5 million for startup costs — which he said would be repaid with interest — Southern California Edison will continue to deliver the electricity to residents' homes or to businesses. After Moon's presentation, he and one of the town's consultants spent more than an hour answering residents' questions. Some of the questions were fairly straightforward, while others were speculative, wild or both. Moon said many had no basis in fact or reality. Opting out is pretty simple. If you don't want to save money, you don't have to, Moon said. Just let the town know. There will be an opportunity to opt back in, however, you can't bounce in and out of the program at will. There are no fees to either opt out or opt back in, Moon said. Through its contracts, the town already is guaranteed to meet the state mandate of 33 percent energy from renewable sources by 2020, Moon said. He said the town will get more than 35 percent of its energy from renewable sources. If residents want to support the environment and ensure 50 percent use of renewable energy, Moon said they can opt to do so by paying $2 more per month.

Jeffrey Brown has our further look. JEFFREY BROWN: The material comes from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence. It includes a range of documents from 2013 to 2016 which describe cyber-tools for hacking cell phones, computers, television, and even vehicles. The documents also contain computer code. One program, dubbed Weeping Angel, entails infecting Samsung smart TVs, turning them into bugging devices. Another program is aimed at hacking Apple and Android cell phones, undercutting encryption on services like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram. WikiLeaks also says these documents show that when the CIA discovered flaws in computer code written by Apple, Google or Samsung, it failed to notify those companies about the vulnerabilities to allow fixes to be made. Mark Mazzetti of The New York Times has been covering this, and joins us now. Mark, welcome to you. So, the CIA hasn’t said much so far. What do we know about the authenticity of the documents and where they came from? MARK MAZZETTI, The New York Times: Well, we’re still trying to confirm the authenticity. We have several people we have spoken to today who say they believe they’re authentic. We have heard nothing thus far from the government indicating that they are not. Some people we have spoken to have said that some of the code names that were cited in the documents are, indeed, legitimate. So it does appear at the moment — and I should say at the moment — that they are legitimate. JEFFREY BROWN: Well, when you look at the totality, Mark, of all of these cyber-tools that being described, help us understand, what are they aimed at? What is this program about? MARK MAZZETTI: Well, they’re a series of — and we’re talking about thousands of documents that are laying out some of the tools the CIA allegedly has to carry out hacking of any number of different devices, as you said, cars, against foreign adversaries or people overseas. I should stress that there is — unlike the Snowden disclosures, there were not specific mentions of where these have been used. But they’re more sort of like the toolkit the CIA has. And it’s pretty expansive, if the documents are to be believed. And in terms of where they came from, you asked. I mean, that’s another thing we’re still trying to figure out. WikiLeaks said today that they had a source come to them who was concerned about the use of these tools. We don’t know anything about the source. And there’s a lot of questions still at the moment. JEFFREY BROWN: WikiLeaks said that it had redacted some names and some information in its release. But how potentially damaging is this to the CIA? MARK MAZZETTI: Well, again, if they’re confirmed to be true, any revelations about actual capabilities that the CIA or any other intelligence agency has would limit the ability of the agency to continue to do those activities. You saw that to a degree with Snowden and others. And so that is where the concern is, that you will have a lot of — these tools may not be used because they’re now revealed. But, again, we have to — we still have to report out exactly, you know, what has been used and, to a large extent, how much of this is actual truth. JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, and I realize so much of that is going on. I mentioned one particular program, which is the Weeping Angel, using Samsung smart televisions as covert listening devices. But that’s one concrete example that’s come out today. MARK MAZZETTI: Yes. And the — in a nutshell, the idea was that the Samsung smart TVs have a feature that allowed access to the Internet, and by having this — you’re basically turning this smart feature on. The CIA is turning it into a microphone and allowing eavesdropping in a home. And another thing you cited was questions about the ability of the agency’s hackers to sort of sort of bypass traditional encryption and very popular encryption software like Signal or WhatsApp. The idea is not that the programs themselves are hacked or compromised. It’s that, if you’re in the phone, if the CIA were to be in the phone, they would be able to get the data before it was then encrypted by these applications. JEFFREY BROWN: And just, Mark, in 10 seconds, in a word here, so much of the attention has been on the NSA programs in the past. Is it a surprise to learn that the CIA may have its own program? MARK MAZZETTI: Well, it’s pretty well known that the CIA has been building up this capability and are determined to because they see computer hacking and computer cyber-warfare as the future. So, they are very much in that game. JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Mark Mazzetti of The New York Times, thank you very much. MARK MAZZETTI: Thank you.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP)  WikiLeaks published thousands of documents Tuesday described as secret files about CIA hacking tools the government employs to break into users' computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. The documents describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features intended to keep the private information of citizens and corporations safe from prying eyes. U.S. government employees, including President Donald Trump, use many of the same products and internet services purportedly compromised by the tools. The documents describe CIA efforts  cooperating with friendly foreign governments and the U.S. National Security Agency  to subvert the world's most popular technology platforms, including Apple's iPhones and iPads, Google's Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. The documents also include discussions about compromising some internet-connected televisions to turn them into listening posts. One document discusses hacking vehicle systems, indicating the CIA's interest in hacking modern cars with sophisticated on-board computers. WikiLeaks has a long track record of releasing top secret government documents, and experts who sifted through the material said it appeared legitimate. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said he was very concerned about the release and had asked the intelligence community for more information about it. Former CIA Director Mike Hayden told MSNBC he had undertaken only a cursory review of the documents, but that if they were what they were purported to be, it would amount to a "very extensive file of the tactics, techniques, procedures, targets and other political rules" under which the CIA hacks targets. "If it is that, it would be very, very damaging," he said. Jonathan Liu, a spokesman for the CIA, said: "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents." White House spokesman Sean Spicer also declined comment. Missing from WikiLeaks' trove are the actual hacking tools themselves, some of which were developed by government hackers while others were purchased from outsiders. WikiLeaks said it planned to avoid distributing tools "until a consensus emerges" on the political nature of the CIA's program and how such software could be analyzed, disarmed and published. Tuesday's disclosure left anxious consumers who use the products with little recourse, since repairing the software vulnerabilities in ways that might block the tools' effectiveness is the responsibility of leading technology companies. The revelations threatened to upend confidence in an Obama-era government program, the Vulnerability Equities Process, under which federal agencies warn technology companies about weaknesses in their software so they can be quickly fixed. It was not immediately clear how WikiLeaks obtained the information, and details in the documents could not immediately be verified. WikiLeaks said the material came from "an isolated, high-security network" inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence but didn't say whether the files were removed by a rogue employee or whether the theft involved hacking a federal contractor working for the CIA or perhaps breaking into a staging server where such information might have been temporarily stored. "The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive," WikiLeaks said in a statement. Some technology firms on Tuesday said they were evaluating the information. Microsoft Corp. said it was looking into the report, while the maker of secure messaging app Signal said the purported CIA tools affected users' actual phones and not its software design or encryption protocols. The manufacturer of the popular Telegram mobile messaging app said in a statement that manufacturers of cellphones and their operating systems, including Apple, Google and Samsung, were responsible for improving the security of their devices. It said the effort will require "many hours of work and many security updates" and assured its customers that "If the CIA is not on your back, you shouldn't start worrying yet." The tools described in the documents carried bizarre names, including Time Stomper, Fight Club, Jukebox, Bartender, Wild Turkey, Margarita and "RickyBobby," a racecar-driving character in the comedy film, "Talladega Nights." That RickyBobby tool, the documents said, was intended to plant and harvest files on computers running "newer versions of Microsoft Windows and Windows Server." It operated "as a lightweight implant for target computers" without raising warnings from antivirus or intrusion-detection software. It took advantage of files Microsoft built into Windows since at least 10 years ago. The files include comments by CIA hackers boasting in slang language of their prowess: "You know we got the dankest Trojans and collection tools," one reads. The documents show broad exchanges of tools and information among the CIA, NSA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as intelligence services of close allies Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. WikiLeaks claimed the CIA used both its Langley, Virginia, headquarters and the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, as bases for its covert hackers. The AP found that one purported CIA hack that imitates the Domain Name System  the internet's phone book  traced to an internet domain hosted in Germany. In an unusual move, WikiLeaks said it was withholding some secrets inside the documents. Among them, it said it had withheld details of tens of thousands of "CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States." WikiLeaks also said its data included a "substantial library" of digital espionage techniques borrowed from other countries, including Russia. If the authenticity of the documents is officially confirmed, it would represent yet another catastrophic breach for the U.S. intelligence community at the hands of WikiLeaks and its allies, which have repeatedly humbled Washington with the mass release of classified material, including from the State Department and the Pentagon. Tuesday's documents purported to be from the CIA's "Embedded Development Branch" discuss techniques for injecting malicious code into computers protected by the personal security products of leading international anti-virus companies. They describe ways to trick anti-virus products from companies including Russia-based Kaspersky Lab, Romania-based BitDefender, Dutch-based AVG Technologies, F-Secure of Finland and Rising Antivirus, a Chinese company. In the new trove, programmers also posted instructions for how to access user names and passwords in popular internet browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Some documents were classified "secret" or "top secret" and not for distribution to foreign nationals. One file said those classifications would protect deployed hacks from being "attributed" to the U.S. government. The practice of attribution, or identifying who was behind an intrusion, has been difficult for investigators probing sophisticated hacks that likely came from powerful nation-states. ___ Satter reported from Paris.

Such snooping, WikiLeaks said, could turn some of these devices into recorders of everyday conversations - and could also circumvent data-scrambling encryption on communications apps such as Facebook’s WhatsApp. The battle for online privacy: What you need to know as the FCC reconsiders rules Codenamed “Vault 7,” the disclosures reveal cyberespionage tools that can take over internet connected, or “smart” TVs and record audio, CBS News’ Jeff Pegues reports. The documents also cite the ability to hack iPhone or Google Android smartphones. Codenamed “Vault 7,” the disclosures reveal cyberespionage tools that can take over internet connected, or “smart” TVs and record audio. The documents also cite the ability to hack iPhone or Google Android smartphones. CBS News Those hacks allow the CIA to then monitor the communications of terrorist groups like ISIS, which have been using encrypted apps to communicate. Critics have wondered why apps like WhatsApp or Telegram haven’t been disabled. But the documents suggest analysts have the ability to exploit them. WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used “until a consensus emerges” on the nature of the CIA’s program and how the methods should be “analyzed, disarmed and published.” But WikiLeaks -- a nonprofit that routinely publishes confidential documents, frequently from government sources -- claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. Play Video CBSN What WikiLeaks' CIA hacking documents may reveal Tuesday, WikiLeaks published thousands of documents that they say reveal the scope of the CIA's global hacking program. Mike Baker, a former CIA ... MORE PRIVACY CLASHES If true, the disclosure could spark new privacy tensions between the government and the technology industry. Relations have been fraught since 2013, when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed secret NSA surveillance of phone and digital communications. Just last year, the two sides feuded over the FBI’s calls for Apple to rewrite its operating system so that agents could break into the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. The FBI ultimately broke into the phone with the help of an outside party; the agency has neither disclosed the party nor the nature of the vulnerability, preventing Apple from fixing it. According to WikiLeaks, much of the CIA program centered on dozens of vulnerabilities it discovered but didn’t disclose to the gadget makers. Common practice calls for government agencies to disclose such flaws to companies privately, so that they could fix them. Instead, WikiLeaks claims, the CIA held on to the knowledge in order to conduct a variety of attacks. As a result, tech companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft haven’t been able to make the necessary fixes. “Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability,” WikiLeaks wrote in a press release. “If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others.” A BIG YAWN TO SOME Not everyone is worried, though. Alan Paller, director of research for the cybersecurity training outfit SANS Institute, said the case boils down to “spies who use their tools to do what they are paid to do.” He said criminals already have similar tools - and he’s more worried about that. Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis, said that agencies gathering intelligence on other organizations and governments need, by definition, technical exploits that aren’t public. If they’re authentic, the leaked CIA documents frame a stark reality: It may be that no digital conversation, photo or other slice of life can be shielded from spies and other intruders prying into smartphones, personal computers, tablets or just about device connected to the internet. “It’s getting to the point where anything you say, write or electronically transmit on a phone, you have to assume that it is going to be compromised in some way,” said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney who now specializes in cybersecurity and privacy for the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. SIDESTEPPING ENCRYPTION WikiLeaks claims the hacks allowed the CIA to collect audio and other messages from data-scrambling communication apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Confide by intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. The CIA didn’t appear to compromise the apps themselves, but rather the phone’s underlying operating system. WikiLeaks says the CIA had separate teams looking for vulnerabilities in iPhones and Android phones and also targeted tablets such as iPads. According to WikiLeaks, the vulnerabilities were discovered by the CIA itself or obtained from other government agencies and cyberweapon contractors. A visitor checks out a Samsung Smart TV television at the Samsung hall at the IFA 2011 consumer electronics and appliances trade fair on the first day of the fair’s official opening on Sept. 2, 2011 in Berlin, Germany.  Sean Gallup/Getty CARS, TRUCKS AND TVS WikiLeaks also claims that the CIA worked with U.K. intelligence officials to turn microphones in Samsung smart TVs into listening devices. The microphones are normally there for viewers to make voice commands, such as requests for movie recommendations. If the TV is off, there’s no listening being done. But WikiLeaks claims that a CIA hack makes the target TV appear to be off when it’s actually on - and listening. WikiLeaks says the audio goes to a covert CIA server rather than a party authorized by Samsung. In such cases, audio isn’t limited to TV commands but could include everyday conversations. Other tools in the CIA’s arsenal target PCs running Microsoft’s Windows system, according to WikiLeaks, which says many of the attacks are in the form of viruses designed to spread through CDs and USB drives. WikiLeaks also says the CIA was also targeting control systems used by cars and trucks. Although WikiLeaks didn’t have details on how that might be used, it said the capability might allow the CIA to “engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.” Microsoft said it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Apple, Google and Samsung didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement, General Motors said it would be premature to comment on the documents, including its authenticity. But GM added that it knew of no injuries or death resulting from the hacking of a vehicle.  © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple’s iPad Event Could Possibly Take Place On April 4 By Tyler Lee on 03/07/2017 16:30 PDT Apple typically holds around four events a year. One takes place early in the year, another middle of the year which would be WWDC, another in the third quarter to announce their new iPhones, and another event towards the end of the year for other products/services. This is why we weren’t surprised to hear that Apple could be planning an iPad event soon. Now the previous rumor had suggested that it could take place later this month, but a report from Apple World Today (via 9to5Mac) has suggested that the event might take place a little later, possibly in the first week of April. How did they arrive at this conclusion? By checking the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s availability. It seems that the tablet is currently showing a 2-3 weeks shipping estimate, but clicking the “Check availability” link for the tablet, the 4th of April, 2017 date shows up. This is applicable to pretty much any configuration you want in terms of size, color, and connectivity. They speculate that due to this date, the event could take place on the 4th of April where the newly announced tablets would be made available right away. Of course an alternate possibility is that a late March announcement is still in the cards, and that the tablets would only be available a week or two later following their announcement. In any case take it with a grain of salt, but if Apple is holding an event this month, we should be able to expect invites to start making their rounds very soon. Filed in Apple >Rumors >Tablets.

If you don’t know about it, chances are you might never come across it. But if you give 3D Touch a try, even make it a habit, it can enhance lots of tiny little interactions, adding up to one big benefit. If you aren’t sure where to start with 3D Touch, though, there are plenty of Apple and third-party apps that make good use of it. Give these a try. Apple’s Keyboard I use 3D Touch on Apple’s keyboard probably dozens of times a day, if not more. The first time you 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard, you can start dragging the cursor around to place it in a specific spot. It’s a great way to get exact placement without fidgeting with your finger. But, if you don’t lift your finger after that first 3D Touch and do it again, you’ll select the adjacent full word. 3D Touch one more time without lifting, and you’ll select the entire sentence surrounding the cursor. These extra actions take a little practice, but they’re darn handy once you get them down. Notification Center Force-press on top (x) in Notification Center to clear all Notifications, not just for one day or one app. Clear All Notifications with 3D Touch Safari 3D Touch Safari on your homescreen for a quick way to create a new regular or private tab. Music Apple Music supports a variety of 3D Touch features, but my favorite is the popup menu you get on any song while browsing music. You can: add the song to a playlist start a station add it to Up Next in your queue “Love” the song to trigger Apple Music recommendation magic 3D Touch options in Music Tweetbot Tweetbot makes great use of 3D Touch. Use it on a tweet to glance at replies and take a few actions, use it on someone’s icon to glance at their profile, and on a photo in your timeline. The homescreen icon has a couple key shortcuts, too, like tweeting the last photo you shot and opening straight to your stats. Slack If you use Slack to its fullest in at least one team, 3D Touch the homescreen icon for a few killer shortcuts: Open the messages & files search for your current team Open the channels & DMs picker Switch back to the last team you used 3D Touch Options in Slack Day One The homescreen icon has a few handy shortcuts, as well as a widget that displays “on this day” photos from your camera roll that you can tap to create an entry. Messages The icon has quick shortcuts for messaging some of your recent contacts. But if you 3D Touch on a conversation in messages, you’ll get shortcuts for starting FaceTime calls, email, and a good ol’ fashioned phone call. Airmail The app icon has shortcuts, my favorite which takes you straight to an Attachments view across all your messages. Waze Quickly create directions to home or work right from the app icon. Lyft Ditto. FXNOW 3D Touch the app icon to play a random Simpsons episode if you’re a subscriber, or clips if you aren’t. You heard me. 3D Touch options with FXNOW App Switcher 3D Touch on the left side of the screen to activate the App Switcher. This one might be tricky to master. But since it can be used anywhere along the left side, it’s handy if you own a Plus model or you’re prone to changing your grip on your iPhone. Give Peek & Pop a whirl Lots of apps have adopted this feature as a quick way to preview and take action on content. Try it on emails in Mail, articles in Apple News and Newsify, notes in Evernote, and links in just about any app. Fantastical 2 Use 3D Touch on a day in the calendar to quickly start creating an event for that day. Use it on an event in the list to preview it’s details and take a handful of actions. A good start for now This list could go on for miles, but I’m sure you get the idea. Make a point to give 3D Touch a try in a couple places, and it can quickly catch on as a new habit. Just like when we all raced to hold the Option and Command keys while clicking around in OS X macOS to see what happened, 3D Touch has plenty of surprise, time-saving perks waiting around iOS for you.

At least one report says yes. Apple is rumoured to be developing three new iPad models that will release in 2017, including a refreshed 9.7-inch iPad model, a refreshed 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and an entirely new 10.5-inch iPad model with an edgeless display. Now, based on previous release patterns, we can expect Apple to hold a "special event" sometime around March, and at that event, we should see these new iPads debut.  Which iPad is best for you? Apple iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Pro 12.9: What's the difference? Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review Right on cue, a report from from Steve Sande of Apple World Today has arrived, suggesting the rumoured event will be held on 4 April. Sande has based his prediction after looking at various availability dates for the iPad Pro, and he noticed a pattern that pointed to 4 April. Sande also predicted the event will take place at the 1,000-seat Steve Jobs theatre in Apple’s new spaceship campus that'll open around April. All this evidence is circumstantial, of course, and there's a whole lot of guess work applied here. It's okay to be skeptical. Still, an April event does seem conceivable. Guess we'll know more in the coming weeks.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Windows tablets grow 60% in Australian market, now holds 27% market share 1 by Surur  @mspoweruser Mar 8, 2017 at 23:31 GMT1 week ago Australian analyst company Telsyte reports that Windows tablets surged in the Australian market in the second half of 2016, growing 60% Year on Year and taking 27% market share, lifting the overall tablet market, which was 1.64 million units strong, by 2%. This takes Windows tablets to a close 3rd place to Android, which holds 29% market share, but still far off Apple tablets, which hold a dominant 44%. iPads were however down 9% YoY, while Android tablets were down 13% suggesting Windows tablets would soon hold second position, and that even Apple’s lead was at risk. Growth was also led by Convertible 2-in-1 devices across all brands, with 30% of devices being convertible, up from 15% a year earlier. The move to more powerful devices also led to a “significant” move away from cheaper tablets, which now form only 10% of the market, with 40% of Australians saying they are willing to pay more for “top quality electronics”. Australians were also happy to buy accessories for their tablets, with 71% buying cases and keyboard-type covers, while sales of pen input or stylus devices featured prominently for owners of 2-in-1 devices. Telsyte’s Australian Tablet Market Study 2017 found Australian tablet users spend on average two hours per day on their tablets, with primary usage still being at home (over 80 percent). The average time spent on 2-in-1 devices is more than three hours per day and over 30 percent of Australians use them outside of home, suggesting more productivity-focused usage. In further good news for Microsoft, around 80 percent of ICT decision makers in Australia and New Zealand surveyed by Telsyte indicated that they are already buying or interested in buying larger format touch screen computers such as the Surface Studio and presumably the Surface Hub for their organisation. Currently desktop touch screen PCs are mainly found with creative professionals, businesses, and high-end households rather than the mainstream buyer, Telsyte said. Hopefully this surge in Windows tablet sales, confirmed by other analysts like the IDC, will lead to a corresponding increase in developer interest in the Windows Store and Windows Store apps, which would make the whole ecosystem more sustainable.

There are huge chances of this happening, as leaks have indicated a lot of new things that the Cupertino company will be adopting with the iPhone 8. Firstly there are rumors going around of the device having an edge-to-edge display which will do away with the top and bottom bezels. What about the selfie camera and the fingerprint scanner you ask? They will be integrated into the display itself. And all this while still maintaining the waterproofing which the previous-gen iPhone had introduced. 2017 will also mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, which means there’s another reason for Apple to put more effort into making the device outstanding. Technically, this is the year of the iPhone 7S, but talk on the street is that Apple will be skipping that name in favor of iPhone 8, since there are so many new innovations onboard the handset. Leaks have even indicated that this device will be ditching aluminum and going for a glass rear surface. Now based on all the information that is available out there, a number of designers from around the world have come up with some really interesting concepts of the iPhone 8. We’ve sifted through all of them, and have created this list for those interested in viewing the best among them.

Documents released by WikiLeaks allege a CIA surveillance program that targets everyday gadgets ranging from smart TVs to smartphones to cars. Such snooping, WikiLeaks said, could turn some of these devices into recorders of everyday conversations – and could also circumvent data-scrambling encryption on communications apps such as Facebook’s WhatsApp. WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used “until a consensus emerges” on the nature of the CIA’s program and how the methods should be “analyzed, disarmed and published.” But WikiLeaks claims the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. MORE PRIVACY CLASHES If true, the disclosure could spark new privacy tensions between the government and the technology industry. Relations have been fraught since 2013, when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed secret NSA surveillance of phone and digital communications. Just last year, the two sides feuded over the FBI’s calls for Apple to rewrite its operating system so that agents could break into the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. The FBI ultimately broke into the phone with the help of an outside party; the agency has neither disclosed the party nor the nature of the vulnerability, preventing Apple from fixing it. According to WikiLeaks, much of the CIA program centered on dozens of vulnerabilities it discovered but didn’t disclose to the gadget makers. Common practice calls for government agencies to disclose such flaws to companies privately, so that they could fix them. Instead, WikiLeaks claims, the CIA held on to the knowledge in order to conduct a variety of attacks. As a result, tech companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft haven’t been able to make the necessary fixes. A BIG YAWN TO SOME Not everyone is worried, though. Alan Paller, director of research for the cybersecurity training outfit SANS Institute, said the case boils down to “spies who use their tools to do what they are paid to do.” He said criminals already have similar tools – and he’s more worried about that. Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis, said that agencies gathering intelligence on other organizations and governments need, by definition, technical exploits that aren’t public. If they’re authentic, the leaked CIA documents frame a stark reality: It may be that no digital conversation, photo or other slice of life can be shielded from spies and other intruders prying into smartphones, personal computers, tablets or just about device connected to the internet. SIDESTEPPING ENCRYPTION WikiLeaks claims the hacks allowed the CIA to collect audio and other messages from data-scrambling communication apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Confide by intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. The CIA didn’t appear to compromise the apps themselves, but rather the phone’s underlying operating system. WikiLeaks says the CIA had separate teams looking for vulnerabilities in iPhones and Android phones and also targeted tablets such as iPads. According to WikiLeaks, the vulnerabilities were discovered by the CIA itself or obtained from other government agencies and cyberweapon contractors.

News Nation & World Why the CIA is using your TVs, smartphones and cars for spying 10 years of WikiLeaks A glimpse at the history of WikiLeaks, which has been publishing news leaks and secret information for 10 years. A glimpse at the history of WikiLeaks, which has been publishing news leaks and secret information for 10 years. Craig Timberg, Ellen Nakashima, Elizabeth DwoskinThe Washington Post The latest revelations about the U.S. government's powerful hacking tools potentially take surveillance right into the homes and hip pockets of billions of technology users worldwide, showing how a remarkable variety of everyday devices can be turned to spy on their owners. Televisions, smartphones and even anti-virus software are all vulnerable to CIA hacking, according to WikiLeaks documents released Tuesday. The capabilities described include recording the sounds, images and private text messages of users, even when they resort to encrypted apps to communicate. While many of the attack technologies had been previously discussed at cybersecurity conferences, experts were startled to see evidence that the CIA had turned so many theoretical vulnerabilities into functioning attack tools against staples of modern life. These include widely used Internet routers, smartphones, and Mac and Windows computers. In the case of a tool called "Weeping Angel" for attacking Samsung smart TVs, WikiLeaks wrote, "After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server." The CIA reportedly also has studied whether it could infect vehicle control systems for cars and trucks, which WikiLeaks alleged could be used to conduct "nearly undetectable assassinations." And a specialized CIA unit called the Mobile Devices Branch produced malware to control and steal information from iPhones, which according to WikiLeaks were a particular focus because of the smartphone's popularity "among social, political, diplomatic and business elites." The agency also targeted popular phones running Google's Android, the world's leading mobile operating system. WikiLeaks reveals CIA trove alleging wide-scale hacking Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima A vast portion of the CIA's computer hacking arsenal appeared to have been exposed Tuesday by the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks, which posted thousands of files revealing secret cyber tools used by the agency to convert cellphones, televisions and other ordinary devices into implements of... A vast portion of the CIA's computer hacking arsenal appeared to have been exposed Tuesday by the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks, which posted thousands of files revealing secret cyber tools used by the agency to convert cellphones, televisions and other ordinary devices into implements of... (Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima) WikiLeaks said it redacted lists of CIA surveillance targets, though it said they included targets and machines in Latin America, Europe and the United States. The anti-secrecy group also said that by developing such intrusive technology - rather than helping tech companies patch flaws in their products - the CIA was undermining efforts to protect the cybersecurity of Americans. "The argument that there is some terrorist using a Samsung TV somewhere - as a reason to not disclose that vulnerability to the company, when it puts thousands of Americans at risk - I fundamentally disagree with it," said Alex Rice, chief technology officer for HackerOne, a startup that enlists hackers to report security gaps to companies and organizations in exchange for cash. The trove released Tuesday, which The Washington Post could not independently verify and the CIA has declined to confirm, included 8,761 documents - the first batch in a series of planned releases, WikiLeaks said.

In this Aug. 14, 2015, file photo a Samsung Smart TV is for sale in Sacramento, Calif. (Rich Pedroncelli / AP) This first group, at least, has important differences from the 2013 revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. His trove of documents largely described mass surveillance of Internet-based communications systems, while the WikiLeaks release more often describes attacks on individual devices. By targeting devices, the CIA reportedly gains access to even well-encrypted communications on such popular apps as Signal and WhatsApp, without having to crack the encryption itself. The WikiLeaks reports acknowledged that difference by saying that the CIA had found ways to "bypass," as opposed to defeat, encryption technologies. "The idea that the CIA and NSA can hack into devices is kind of old news," said Johns Hopkins University cryptography expert Matthew Green. "Anyone who thought they couldn't was living in a fantasy world." Snowden's revelations and the resulting backlash made strong encryption a major, well-funded cause for privacy advocates and, perhaps more important, technology companies that had the engineering expertise and budgets to protect data as it flowed across the world. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo and many other companies announced significant new initiatives, in part to protect their brands against accusations by some users that they had made it too easy for the NSA to collect information from their systems. Many websites, meanwhile, began encrypting their data flows to users to prevent snooping. Encryption tools such as Tor were strengthened. Encrypting apps for private messaging, such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp, exploded in popularity, especially among users around the world who were fearful of government intrusion. In the days after the U.S. presidential election last fall, Signal was among the most downloaded programs in Apple's app store, and downloads grew by more than 300 percent. Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal, released a statement Tuesday saying, "The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption." WhatsApp declined to comment, and Telegram did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment, while Samsung did not respond to requests for comment. "Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' privacy and security. The technology built into today's iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we're constantly working to keep it that way," Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said Tuesday in a statement. "While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates." U.S. government authorities had complained loudly that the post-Snowden wave of encryption was undermining their ability to investigate serious crimes, such as terrorism and child pornography. The FBI in 2016 sued Apple in hopes of forcing it to unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernadino, California, killers before announcing, amid heavy public criticism, that it had other ways to crack the device. Against that backdrop, many privacy advocates argued that devices - often called "endpoints" for their place in chains of communications that can criss-cross continents - were the best available targets in a world with widespread online encryption. The WikiLeaks documents suggest that the CIA may have reached the same conclusion. "It would certainly be consistent with the hypothesis that we've made real progress in the encryption we've been introducing," said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. "It's impossible to be 100 percent certain, but reading the tea leaves, it's plausible." The WikiLeaks revelations also serve as a reminder that, whatever the political backlash to revelations about digital spying, it is not going away and probably will continue to grow. Aside from the United States, many other advanced nations such as China, Russia, Britain and Israel have extremely sophisticated tools for digital spying. Less-advanced nations have gained access to powerful online spying technology through a robust and lightly regulated industry of surveillance contractors throughout the world. On Tuesday, resignation and frustration rippled through Silicon Valley as technologists grappled with the revelations of yet another U.S. government attempt to exploit their systems. And cybersecurity experts reacted with alarm. "This is explosive," said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition InfoSec, a cybersecurity firm. The material highlights specific anti-virus products that can be defeated, going further than a release of NSA hacking tools last year, he said. The WikiLeaks release revealed that the CIA has sophisticated "stealth" capabilities that enable hackers not only to infiltrate systems but to evade detection, as well as abilities to move inside a system freely as if they owned it. Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, said the dates in the WikiLeaks files suggest that the documents were taken in February or March 2016. At least two of them are marked top secret, "which suggests that somebody in early 2016 managed to compromise a top-secret CIA development system and is willing to say that they did." One internal CIA document listed a set of Apple iPhone "exploits" - tools that can be used to compromise the device by taking advantage of software flaws. Some of the tools are based on "zero days," which are software vulnerabilities that have not been shared with the manufacturer. So "some of these descriptions will allow Apple to fix the vulnerabilities," Weaver said. "But at the same time, they're out in the public, and whoever stole this data could use them against U.S. interests."

A Storm is Coming: “App-pocalypse” To See Nearly 200,000 Apps Culled Now Available To Pre-Order On iBooks: ‘The CARTEL 7’ Apple Wikileaks: #Vault7 iOS Sec Vulnerabilities ‘Already Patched,’ Says Apple By Arron Hirst 8th Mar 17 4:16 am Share Tweet In a statement given to BuzzFeed on Wednesday, Apple insisted that the various security holes found in its mobile operating system –which became the intense focus of a leaked set of documents, earlier this week– have already been patched. “Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers’ privacy and security,” the statement read. The technology built into today’s iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we’re constantly working to keep it that way. Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80 percent of users running the latest version of our operating system. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. “We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates,” the company added. The collection of once-secret CIA documents specifically claimed to outline the contents of VAULT 7 – an unknown and highly mysterious sector of the CIA said to be dedicated towards finding ‘zero-day’ exploits within the most popular of today’s technological systems, and devices. As BuzzFeed explains: “Zero days are essentially problems within a machine or system that the manufacturer has had zero days to fix, so whether within an app on an iPhone or Microsoft Word, hackers can use it to break in.” That’s not to say that the information dump WikiLeaks divulged publicly, this week, didn’t have any credibility – but rather that Apple may have already patched the majority of these so-called “Year Zero” exploits, said to have been previously used by those working for the organisation, before -or very shortly after– the papers were released.

Gen. Michael Hayden told Stephen Colbert of CBS' Late Show on Tuesday that the CIA does not spy on Americans. Earlier on Tuesday, WikiLeaks unveiled what it says are official CIA documents showing that the agency has the capability to hack into smartphones and televisions, which it then uses to spy on people. 'I can tell you that these tools would not be used against an American,' Hayden told Colbert. When Colbert pressed the point as to why the CIA wouldn't use the technology to gather information about Americans, Hayden replied: 'There are some bad people in the world who have Samsung TVs too.' The former head of the CIA, General Michael Hayden (left), sought to calm anxious Americans who may be worried that the vaunted US spy agency is eavesdropping through their smart television sets. Hayden appeared on CBS' Late Show with Stephen Colbert (right) on Tuesday 'I can tell you that these tools would not be used against an American,' Hayden told Colbert 'There are people out there that you want us to spy on. You want us to have the ability to actually turn on that listening device inside the TV to learn that person's intentions.' The anti-secrecy organization on Tuesday published what it said were thousands of pages of internal CIA discussions about hacking techniques used over several years, renewing concerns about the security of consumer electronics and embarrassing yet another US intelligence agency.

Share this article Share The discussion transcripts showed that CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc iPhones, Google Inc Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software.  Cyber security experts disagreed about the extent of the fallout from the data dump, but said a lot would depend on whether WikiLeaks followed through on a threat to publish the actual hacking tools that could do damage.  The anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks on Tuesday published what it said were thousands of pages of internal CIA discussions about hacking techniques used over several years. The CIA logo is seen at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, in this 2016 file photo The discussion transcripts showed that CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc iPhones, Google Inc Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate.  A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in US hacking tools told Reuters the documents included correct 'cover' terms describing active cyber programs. Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other US and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. The files did not indicate the actual encryption of Signal or other secure messaging apps had been compromised.  Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other US and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp (seen above), Telegram and Signal One document claims that US and British personnel use a program known as Weeping Angel, which is capable of taking over a Samsung smart television (above), making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest breach in recent years of classified material from US intelligence agencies.  Security experts differed over how much the disclosures could damage US cyber espionage.  Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection.  'This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices ... I haven't yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices,' said Tarah Wheeler, senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec.  Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States.  Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicized.  In one case, the documents say, US and British personnel, under a program known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room.  Meanwhile, it was learned that FBI Director James Comey has canceled a scheduled public appearance at an Austin, Texas, music and arts festival where he was expected to address allegations of wiretapping made by President Donald Trump, according to The Washington Examiner. Over the weekend, Trump dropped a bombshell by claiming that then-President Barack Obama ordered wiretaps of his phones at Trump Tower during the election campaign. Comey has reportedly asked the Justice Department to push back on the claim. The FBI chief was scheduled to appear Monday at SXSW in Austin, but event organizers put out a statement on Tuesday saying that he won't be able to attend due to 'scheduling conflicts.'  Read more: FBI Director James Comey drops out of SXSW conference | Washington Examiner Share or comment on this article e-mail 247 shares Most watched News videos Homeless man brought to tears following incredible transformation Dancing Prince seen talking to mystery woman at Verbier party Little girl is overcome with emotion as her dad meets her from school Train ploughs snow as it pulls into New York station Good samaritan saves police deputy by shooting his attacker Will's got the love!

(Image: Reuters) Anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks published what it said were thousands of pages of internal CIA discussions about hacking techniques used over several years, renewing concerns about the security of consumer electronics and embarrassing yet another U.S. intelligence agency. The discussion transcripts showed that CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc iPhones, Google Inc Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software.

Read more: China Set to Launch World's First Hack-Proof Quantum Communication Satellite Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate. A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in U.S. hacking tools told Reuters the documents included correct "cover" terms describing active cyber programs. Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other U.S. and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. The files did not indicate the actual encryption of Signal or other secure messaging apps had been compromised. The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest breach in recent years of classified material from U.S. intelligence agencies. Security experts differed over how much the disclosures could damage U.S. cyber espionage. Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection. "This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices ... I haven’t yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices," said Tarah Wheeler, senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec. Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States. Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicised. In one case, the documents say, U.S. and British personnel, under a program known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. The CIA and White House declined to comment. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. Google declined to comment on the purported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter. Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U.S. government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) did not respond to a request for comment. The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end-to-end encryption tools like Signal. Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as "confirmation that what we’re doing is working." Signal and the like are "pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive, high-risk, extremely targeted attacks." CIA CYBER PROGRAMS The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any U.S. data for counterintelligence purposes. The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: U.S. intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products. Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA's "entire hacking capacity." The documents only include snippets of computer code, not the full programs that would be needed to conduct cyber exploits. WikiLeaks said it was refraining from disclosing usable code from CIA's cyber arsenal "until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should be analysed, disarmed and published." U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia's security services. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win the presidency. WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies. Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign, often citing hacked emails it published to bolster his attacks on Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks said on Tuesday that the documents showed that the CIA hoarded serious security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public, as called for under a process established by President Barack Obama. Rob Knake, a former official who dealt with the issue under Obama, said he had not seen evidence in what was published to support that conclusion. The process "is not a policy of unilateral disarmament in cyberspace. The mere fact that the CIA may have exploited zero-day [previously undisclosed] vulnerabilities should not surprise anyone," said Knake, now at the Council on Foreign Relations. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material. In a press release, the group said, "The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive." U.S. intelligence agencies have suffered a series of security breaches, including Snowden's. In 2010, U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks. Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the secrets in his home.

The leaks detail a number of iOS exploits that can be used to bypass security on devices. Tonight, Apple said in a statement provided to TechCrunch that most of the vulnerabilities detailed in the leaks have been patched. “Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers’ privacy and security. The technology built into today’s iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we’re constantly working to keep it that way. Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80 percent of users running the latest version of our operating system. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates."Apple says its initial analyses indicates that many of the exploits detailed were patched in the latest version of iOS, and that it will continue to patch identified vulnerabilities. The Cupertino company closes by saying that it always urges users to download and install the latest version of iOS to ensure that they have the most recent security updates. The Vault 7 revelations aren't the first time the CIA has targeted Apple's mobile devices. In 2015 it was reported that the CIA worked on ways to compromise both iPhones and iPads. The full list of so-called "Year Zero" documents can be found on found on WikiLeaks' website.

Rating: 21 Votes intofx 1 week ago It will always be a cat and mouse game. I think Apple is one of the most proactive and pro-privacy companies around. Its funny how people complain about how many updates and betas Apple seeds yet read a article like this and complain about how there are holes that need to be patched. The perfect product will never exist. It will always take progression and innovation. Rating: 15 Votes farewelwilliams 1 week ago Many? so...some haven't been patched. uh oh. Rating: 13 Votes 69Mustang 1 week ago Hopefully they'll be faster than the bad guys that are doubtlessly poring over the leaked code at this moment. In any case, I'm pretty sure iOS devices will be fixed much faster than most Android phones, not to mention things like smart TVs ... Is this really the thread to bring that silly iOS vs Android crap? Instead of my OS is better than your OS, how about hoping that this serves as a wake up call to the tech industry that security should be paramount in the products being put out in the public. It should be a wake up call to the big players, but more importantly to the smaller IoT players as well. That's a vector that ripe for exploit. Oh, and I wouldn't be so overjoyed by Apple's statement that many of the vulnerabilities have been patched. It means many others haven't been. Also keep in mind, those were just the leaked vulnerabilities. Dollars to doughnuts the CIA has other nasty stuff that wasn't leaked. It's the CIA after all. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the leak didn't all of a sudden make them stop working on more nefarious means which they will go to extremes to keep from leaking. It's an ongoing battle and iOS looks to be a favorite target of the CIA's armaments. This post isn't really directed at you personally Rigby. Just my rant against turning this topic into something that takes the focus off what we need to be focused on. Rating: 10 Votes KPOM 1 week ago Great news! [doublepost=1488946354][/doublepost] Even though this is the cia's doing , I'm finding it tough to believe Cook ISNT a globalist pig. Maybe the whole privacy thing is just good PR and now they're e caught with their pants down on this one. Better privacy than google android , but not really at this point since everything is fair game Kinda hard to beat someone with unlimited resources. TC is doing the best he can. Rating: 7 Votes Abazigal 1 week ago I'm not criticizing for stepping on an ant. I'm criticizing for doing little to fix the Foxconn issues, and treating their manufacturing workforce like disposable ants, generally speaking with other companies too like Pegatron that do the same but apple also uses, and being based in Chynnnuh, constantly feeling the need to react to anything the president does internally in a memo to his employees too I am picking my battles thanks Also outside of the whole unlocking the iPhone thing with obama at the end and unlocking that 5c from the san barandino tragedy and apple doubling down on security (good), that stood to put apple in harms way publicly speaking I don't remember cook repeatedly speaking out about obama wrongdoing. Whereas now it feels rampant. Where was the outrage over 2.5 million immigrants deported during obama terms? And even if Apple had done all this, you would likely just find some other fault to criticise Apple for, because they obviously can't solve every problem out there, nor is it their responsibility to. Here's how I see it. The opposite of good is not bad but neutral. To me, there is nothing Apple has to do as a publicly-traded company, so if they decide to take the extra step to pay their workers more or speak out on some public issue, that's a plus. But not doing anything is by no means a negative, because Apple isn't obligated to. No you're just saying Foxconn employees are treated well and I disagree. Or they aren't expose to Samsung chemicals so they're fine. If it's so great You should go work there potentially (Foxconn) and lemme know how it goes Classic straw man argument. It's like I donate $10 to a beggar and you scold me for not giving him $20 instead. When the reality is that I didn't even have to fork out a single cent at all. What's your yardstick of acceptable treatment then? What Apple does, you are probably going to use the "yeah, but they could have done more..." card. Rating: 6 Votes Parasprite 1 week ago Apple Says Some of the Vulnerabilities Detailed in 'Vault 7' Leaks Still Work Rating: 6 Votes Abazigal 1 week ago This also destroys the argument that stock iOS is THAT much more secure than a wise jailbreaker using his/her jailbroken device. A wash at this point since everyone is vulnerable There are varying degrees of security. My money is more secure in a safe than if I just left it on the table, but doesn't render my money impervious to theft. The thief can still crack the lock or bomb the door open. It just makes it harder for the thief to strike.

CIA CYBER PROGRAMS The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any US data for counterintelligence purposes. The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: US intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products. Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA's "entire hacking capacity." The documents only include snippets of computer code, not the full programs that would be needed to conduct cyber exploits. WikiLeaks said it was refraining from disclosing usable code from CIA's cyber arsenal "until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published." US intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia's security services. During the 2016 US presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win the presidency. WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies. Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign, often citing hacked emails it published to bolster his attacks on Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks said on Tuesday that the documents showed that the CIA hoarded serious security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public, as called for under a process established by President Barack Obama. Rob Knake, a former official who dealt with the issue under Obama, said he had not seen evidence in what was published to support that conclusion. The process "is not a policy of unilateral disarmament in cyberspace. The mere fact that the CIA may have exploited zero-day [previously undisclosed] vulnerabilities should not surprise anyone," said Knake, now at the Council on Foreign Relations. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material. In a press release, the group said, "The archive appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive." US intelligence agencies have suffered a series of security breaches, including Snowden's. In 2010, US military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks. Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the secrets in his home.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 March 2017 by Military News WinX MediaTrans, 1st iPhone Manager to Embrace Movies, Music and Audio Books Purchased from iTunes Sichuan, China — (SBWIRE) — 03/07/2017 — Digiarty Software, a reputed and innovative multimedia software company, announces to the world that new WinX MediaTrans V3.3 is the first to support transferring iTunes purchases. This release is a big jump from previous versions, embracing all Apple music, movies and audio books purchased from the iTunes Store and iBooks Store. That is to say, this tool will facilitate flexible playback, making it possible to export and play all iTunes items on Windows 10 PC, Android or other devices. Now, Digiarty welcomes all people around the world to get their hands on this newly-updated and unique iOS file manager at 50% off from WinX MediaTrans Full Version Deals. This activity which has been shared by thousands of people is the first official promotion of WinX MediaTrans in 2017. WinX MediaTrans is a Windows-based program specially designed to transfer files between iPhone/iPad/iPod and PC without using iTunes. Since its debut in July 2016, it has been updated for a couple of times, with the supported input files increasing: the initial release supports regular video, music and photos only; before long, it includes iBook, Ringtone, Voice Memos, iTunes U and Podcast into the list; and now, it extends to movies, music and audio books purchased from iTunes Store, making it become the first iPhone file manager that supports the purchased iTunes content. It empowers users to export iTunes content from iPhone to PC to free up space, make a backup, convert file format later or transfer to other electronic devices like Kindle Fire and Windows Phone. „Someone who buys a file from iTunes Store can only play it on the device on which he or she has bought the content or the ones connected to his or her Apple ID. But with WinX MediaTrans, we can convert iTunes purchases to open-ended files and make them playable on any device we own,” said by Jack Han, CEO of Digiarty Software. „Certainly, we shouldn’t make use of this feature to share copy-protected content with others.” Besides the important addition, this PC-oriented and all-sided iPhone file transfer software offers new categories under Photo Transfer, including Selfies, Bursts, Panoramas and Screenshots, just like what iPhone does. Thus, it is convenient to pick out target items. As of now, WinX MediaTrans is available to: – Transfer various files (incl. photos, music, videos, eBooks, ringtones, voice memos, iTunes U, Podcast) between iDevice accompanied by iOS 10 and earlier and computer running on Windows 10 and lower; – Convert video to MP4 and convert music to MP3 or AAC automatically while transferring files from PC to iPhone/iPad/iPod; – Make custom ringtones for iPhone; – Set iPhone as a flash drive to save all sorts of file types; – Export EPUB book to PDF, TXT and HTML for special purpose; – Create music playlist and edit music metadata. Pricing and Availability WinX MediaTrans is originally priced at $39.95, but now only $19.95 is enough to get a license for 1PC, $29.95 for 2 PCs and $49.95 for 6 PCs, at least 50% off the regular price. This full-featured iOS file manager supporting all iTunes purchases, free upgrade to new version and timely technical support is available at https://www.winxdvd.com/specialoffer/iphone-transfer.htm. About Digiarty Software, Inc. Digiarty Software, Inc. specializes in multimedia software based on Windows, macOS and iOS, which provides personal and home-use video audio software across Apple, Android, Microsoft, Samsung, HTC, Google, Sony and other platforms or devices, including DVD rippers, video converters, iOS 10 file manager, DVD author, DVD copy software, online video downloader, media player, video audio streaming app, etc. To find out more about Digiarty, please visit https://www.winxdvd.com/.

Highlights WikilLeaks reveal how some devices can be turned to spy on their owners Anti-virus softwares also vulnerable to CIA hacking: WikiLeaks docs Devices like Internet routers and Mac and Windows computers included The latest revelations about the U.S. government's powerful hacking tools potentially take surveillance right into the homes and hip pockets of billions of technology users worldwide, showing how a remarkable variety of everyday devices can be turned to spy on their owners. Televisions, smartphones and even anti-virus software are all vulnerable to CIA hacking, according to WikiLeaks documents released Tuesday. The capabilities described include recording the sounds, images and private text messages of users, even when they resort to encrypted apps to communicate. While many of the attack technologies had been previously discussed at cybersecurity conferences, experts were startled to see evidence that the CIA had turned so many theoretical vulnerabilities into functioning attack tools against staples of modern life. These include widely used Internet routers, smartphones, and Mac and Windows computers. In the case of a tool called "Weeping Angel" for attacking Samsung smart TVs, WikiLeaks wrote, "After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server." The CIA reportedly also has studied whether it could infect vehicle control systems for cars and trucks, which WikiLeaks alleged could be used to conduct "nearly undetectable assassinations." And a specialized CIA unit called the Mobile Devices Branch produced malware to control and steal information from iPhones, which according to WikiLeaks were a particular focus because of the smartphone's popularity "among social, political, diplomatic and business elites." The agency also targeted popular phones running Google's Android, the world's leading mobile operating system. WikiLeaks said it redacted lists of CIA surveillance targets, though it said they included targets and machines in Latin America, Europe and the United States. The anti-secrecy group also said that by developing such intrusive technology - rather than helping tech companies patch flaws in their products - the CIA was undermining efforts to protect the cybersecurity of Americans. "The argument that there is some terrorist using a Samsung TV somewhere - as a reason to not disclose that vulnerability to the company, when it puts thousands of Americans at risk - I fundamentally disagree with it," said Alex Rice, chief technology officer for HackerOne, a startup that enlists hackers to report security gaps to companies and organizations in exchange for cash. The trove released Tuesday, which The Washington Post could not independently verify and the CIA has declined to confirm, included 8,761 documents - the first batch in a series of planned releases, WikiLeaks said. This first group, at least, has important differences from the 2013 revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. His trove of documents largely described mass surveillance of Internet-based communications systems, while the WikiLeaks release more often describes attacks on individual devices. By targeting devices, the CIA reportedly gains access to even well-encrypted communications on such popular apps as Signal and WhatsApp, without having to crack the encryption itself. The WikiLeaks reports acknowledged that difference by saying that the CIA had found ways to "bypass," as opposed to defeat, encryption technologies. "The idea that the CIA and NSA can hack into devices is kind of old news," said Johns Hopkins University cryptography expert Matthew Green. "Anyone who thought they couldn't was living in a fantasy world." Snowden's revelations and the resulting backlash made strong encryption a major, well-funded cause for privacy advocates and, perhaps more important, technology companies that had the engineering expertise and budgets to protect data as it flowed across the world. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo and many other companies announced significant new initiatives, in part to protect their brands against accusations by some users that they had made it too easy for the NSA to collect information from their systems. Many websites, meanwhile, began encrypting their data flows to users to prevent snooping. Encryption tools such as Tor were strengthened. Encrypting apps for private messaging, such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp, exploded in popularity, especially among users around the world who were fearful of government intrusion. In the days after the U.S. presidential election last fall, Signal was among the most downloaded programs in Apple's app store, and downloads grew by more than 300 percent. Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal, released a statement Tuesday saying, "The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption." WhatsApp declined to comment, and Telegram did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment, while Samsung and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. government authorities had complained loudly that the post-Snowden wave of encryption was undermining their ability to investigate serious crimes, such as terrorism and child pornography. The FBI in 2016 sued Apple in hopes of forcing it to unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernadino, California, killers before announcing, amid heavy public criticism, that it had other ways to crack the device. Against that backdrop, many privacy advocates argued that devices - often called "endpoints" for their place in chains of communications that can criss-cross continents - were the best available targets in a world with widespread online encryption. The WikiLeaks documents suggest that the CIA may have reached the same conclusion. "It would certainly be consistent with the hypothesis that we've made real progress in the encryption we've been introducing," said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. "It's impossible to be 100 percent certain, but reading the tea leaves, it's plausible." The WikiLeaks revelations also serve as a reminder that, whatever the political backlash to revelations about digital spying, it is not going away and probably will continue to grow. Aside from the United States, many other advanced nations such as China, Russia, Britain and Israel have extremely sophisticated tools for digital spying. Less-advanced nations have gained access to powerful online spying technology through a robust and lightly regulated industry of surveillance contractors throughout the world. On Tuesday, resignation and frustration rippled through Silicon Valley as technologists grappled with the revelations of yet another U.S. government attempt to exploit their systems. And cybersecurity experts reacted with alarm. "This is explosive," said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition InfoSec, a cybersecurity firm. The material highlights specific anti-virus products that can be defeated, going further than a release of NSA hacking tools last year, he said. The WikiLeaks release revealed that the CIA has sophisticated "stealth" capabilities that enable hackers not only to infiltrate systems but to evade detection, as well as abilities to move inside a system freely as if they owned it. Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, said the dates in the WikiLeaks files suggest that the documents were taken in February or March 2016. At least two of them are marked top secret, "which suggests that somebody in early 2016 managed to compromise a top-secret CIA development system and is willing to say that they did." One internal CIA document listed a set of Apple iPhone "exploits" - tools that can be used to compromise the device by taking advantage of software flaws. Some of the tools are based on "zero days," which are software vulnerabilities that have not been shared with the manufacturer. So "some of these descriptions will allow Apple to fix the vulnerabilities," Weaver said. "But at the same time, they're out in the public, and whoever stole this data could use them against U.S. interests."

Source: AFP So your smart phone is far from safe and your TV can be used to watch and record your every movement and conversation. George Orwell's 1984 might be here and now, but today's revelations that the CIA can break into phones, communication apps and other devices, though alarming, are not really a bombshell. The truth is the CIA, NSA and state-sponsored hackers from other like-minded nations have been able to attack and penetrate these everyday digital items for some time. It is the laying out in plain sight and great detail of the majority of the spy agency's hacking arsenal and toolkit that is disturbing. It is the rattling of our assumed right to privacy that has us shaken. Yet, under our noses, ongoing cyber warfare is being carried out by the US, Russia, China, North Korea, UK, Israel, Iran and to a lesser extent ISIS. There are no bombs dropped or body bags coming home. But malicious computer worms, mass surveillance, fake news and destabilisation of economies and political systems is the battleground of today. Traditional superpowers and other smaller ambitious players are recruiting their smartest minds and pouring vast resources into an unseen war of cyber offence and defence. Then US President George W Bush speaks to reporters with then CIA Director Porter Goss at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency 03 March, 2005 in Langley, Virginia. Source: AFP Against this murky backdrop, anti-privacy group Wikileaks promises 'Vault 7' is its biggest ever leaks of CIA documents. Although the 8,761 documents are yet to verified as authentic, Wikileaks has a solid reputation for exposing very real, highly-classified documents. The most explosive contents in the trove of documents are: -- CIA malware can take over a person's Apple or Android phone; monitoring text messages and audio, while using the phone's camera and microphone to record -- A tool called "Weeping Angel" attacks Samsung SmartTVs; you believe your TV is off but it is covertly recording everything happening in the room -- Car hacking: The CIA has explored the possibility of infecting internet-connected systems of modern vehicles, potentially to carry out assassinations -- Encrypted apps not secure: CIA can bypass so-called encryption on popular phone and messaging services such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram -- Attributing CIA hacks to other states: Wikileaks claims an entire department is dedicated to "misdirect attribution" and plant digital fingerprints that point to other groups, such as hackers in Russia, China or North Korea -- "Zero days": Unpatched backdoor vulnerabilities, known as "zero days" on devices intentionally left open, potentially allowing access by other hacking groups. Some of the vulnerabilities detailed in the documents have since been patched with software updates by the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Google and other tech firms. However, it is widely believed the CIA will have discovered and manufactured new weaknesses and further "zero days" opportunities. https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/839172609484914688 Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 17, 2015. Source: AFP Wikileaks editor Julian Assange did not disclose from who or where the 'Vault 7' leak came. Since the 2016 US elections, when the Hillary Clinton camp seemed almost exclusively targeted by damaging dumps from Wikileaks, the allegiance of Assange's organisation has come under increasing political scrutiny. There are rumblings in Washington that 'Vault 7' represents just the latest act in cyber warfare and destabilisation tactics between the US and Russia. Assange, in a statement accompanying today's leak, directly commented on cyber warfare representing a new kind of arms race. "There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'," he cautioned, amid one the biggest leaks of classified information in recent years. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visiting the Natanz uranium enrichment facilities some 300 kms south of the capital Tehran. Source: AFP If indeed the 'Vault 7' leak was the work of Russian hackers, the ability to penetrate a US government network is nothing new for Kremlin-backed operatives. One of Russia's most audacious acts of cyber espionage happened in Kabul, Afghanistan in 2008. Ironically, it was a masterful low-fi tactic that allowed Russian spies to breach a classified US government network that wasn't even connected to the internet. The act of cunning was detailed in a book called Dark Territory: a history of cyberwar and later The New Yorker. Russian spies put infected USB sticks in shops located around NATO's headquarters in Kabul on the cunning assumption that eventually an unsuspecting American would buy one and insert it into their work computer. Around a year later, a malicious computer worm that took out a once-secret Iranian nuclear complex showcased the devastating capability of cyber warfare. Supporters of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange prepare a placard with posters showing Assange's portrait with a US flag over his mouth outside the Ecuadorian embassy in central London on June 21, 2012. Source: AFP Stuxnet, as the attack came to be known, was linked to US and Israel, though no players - state-sponsored or otherwise - have ever claimed responsibility. The Stuxnet virus infected and manipulated computers at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, effectively causing widespread malfunctions and sabotaging critical centrifuges. Sources told The Washington Post that Stuxnet had been developed under the George W. Bush presidency. The attack on Natanz was an extreme example of how cyber warfare, away from the battlefield, is used to take down critical infrastructure. Hackers can inflict chaos and havoc on nation states by going after food supply chains, financial institutions and critical utilities, such as water, fuel and electricity. In December last year the work of a Russian hacking operation was detected in the system of a major Vermont utility electrical company. No attack was carried out, but the Russians had been there. It seemed to be a case of 'we can get in here, and we can do damage if we want to'; a kind of new Cuban missile crisis. In 2013, according to The New Yorker, Russia began a massive recruitment drive for cyber warfare soldiers. The Kremlin ads encouraged the nation's young men to join the "Research Squadron of the Russian Federation". Emotive imagery showed a soldier laying down his gun and taking up a keyboard. The 'we want you' call to arms is indicative of a new breed of soldier and the arsenal of cyber weapons they will be asked to create for their country.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen NEW YORK — Maybe the CIA is spying on you through your television set after all. Documents released by WikiLeaks allege a CIA surveillance program that targets everyday gadgets ranging from smart TVs to smartphones to cars. Such snooping, WikiLeaks said, could turn some of these devices into recorders of everyday conversations – and could also circumvent data-scrambling encryption on communications apps such as Facebook’s WhatsApp. READ MORE: WikiLeaks releases trove of new documents on alleged CIA hacking tools WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used “until a consensus emerges” on the nature of the CIA’s program and how the methods should be “analyzed, disarmed and published.” But WikiLeaks – a nonprofit that routinely publishes confidential documents, frequently from government sources – claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. More privacy clashes coming Story continues below WATCH ABOVE: WikiLeaks vs. U.S. intelligence If true, the disclosure could spark new privacy tensions between the government and the technology industry. Relations have been fraught since 2013, when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed secret NSA surveillance of phone and digital communications. Just last year, the two sides feuded over the FBI’s calls for Apple to rewrite its operating system so that agents could break into the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. The FBI ultimately broke into the phone with the help of an outside party; the agency has neither disclosed the party nor the nature of the vulnerability, preventing Apple from fixing it. READ MORE: Donald Trump celebrated leaks during campaign, now he says it’s ‘un-American’ According to WikiLeaks, much of the CIA program centered on dozens of vulnerabilities it discovered but didn’t disclose to the gadget makers. Common practice calls for government agencies to disclose such flaws to companies privately, so that they could fix them. Instead, WikiLeaks claims, the CIA held on to the knowledge in order to conduct a variety of attacks. As a result, tech companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft haven’t been able to make the necessary fixes. “Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability,” WikiLeaks wrote in a press release. “If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others.” A big yawn for some Donald Trump and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange are pictured in this combination of 2016 file photos. Evan Vucci/Frank Augstein/AP Photos Not everyone is worried, though. Alan Paller, director of research for the cybersecurity training outfit SANS Institute, said the case boils down to “spies who use their tools to do what they are paid to do.” He said criminals already have similar tools – and he’s more worried about that. Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis, said that agencies gathering intelligence on other organizations and governments need, by definition, technical exploits that aren’t public. READ MORE: Is a stalker spying on you through your phone? Here’s what to look for If they’re authentic, the leaked CIA documents frame a stark reality: It may be that no digital conversation, photo or other slice of life can be shielded from spies and other intruders prying into smartphones, personal computers, tablets or just about device connected to the internet. “It’s getting to the point where anything you say, write or electronically transmit on a phone, you have to assume that it is going to be compromised in some way,” said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney who now specializes in cybersecurity and privacy for the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. Sidestepping encryption? WikiLeaks claims the hacks allowed the CIA to collect audio and other messages from data-scrambling communication apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Confide by intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. The CIA didn’t appear to compromise the apps themselves, but rather the phone’s underlying operating system. WikiLeaks says the CIA had separate teams looking for vulnerabilities in iPhones and Android phones and also targeted tablets such as iPads. According to WikiLeaks, the vulnerabilities were discovered by the CIA itself or obtained from other government agencies and cyberweapon contractors. Cars and TVs targeted WikiLeaks also claims that the CIA worked with U.K. intelligence officials to turn microphones in Samsung smart TVs into listening devices. The microphones are normally there for viewers to make voice commands, such as requests for movie recommendations. If the TV is off, there’s no listening being done. But WikiLeaks claims that a CIA hack makes the target TV appear to be off when it’s actually on – and listening. WikiLeaks says the audio goes to a covert CIA server rather than a party authorized by Samsung. In such cases, audio isn’t limited to TV commands but could include everyday conversations. Other tools in the CIA’s arsenal target PCs running Microsoft’s Windows system, according to WikiLeaks, which says many of the attacks are in the form of viruses designed to spread through CDs and USB drives. WikiLeaks also says the CIA was also targeting control systems used by cars and trucks. Although WikiLeaks didn’t have details on how that might be used, it said the capability might allow the CIA to “engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.” WATCH: WikiLeaks posts alleged trove of CIA hacking tools Microsoft said it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Apple said an initial analysis showed many of the security gaps brought up in the leaked documents were already patched in the latest iOS. “We will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities,” it said. Google and Samsung didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement, General Motors said it would be premature to comment on the documents, including its authenticity. But GM added that it knew of no injuries or death resulting from the hacking of a vehicle.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 8 March 2017 | MYT 8:46 AM WikiLeaks says it releases files on CIA cyber spying tools Big brother: CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc iPhones, Google Inc Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. — Reuters WASHINGTON: Anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks published what it said were thousands of pages of internal CIA discussions about hacking techniques used over several years, renewing concerns about the security of consumer electronics and embarrassing yet another US intelligence agency. The discussion transcripts showed that CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc iPhones, Google Inc Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. Cybersecurity experts disagreed about the extent of the fallout from the data dump, but said a lot would depend on whether WikiLeaks followed through on a threat to publish the actual hacking tools that could do damage. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cybersecurity experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate. A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in US hacking tools told Reuters the documents included correct "cover" terms describing active cyber programs. Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other US and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. The files did not indicate the actual encryption of Signal or other secure messaging apps had been compromised. The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest breach in recent years of classified material from US intelligence agencies. Security experts differed over how much the disclosures could damage US cyber espionage. Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection. "This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices ... I haven’t yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices," said Tarah Wheeler, senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec. Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States. Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicised. In one case, the documents say, US and British personnel, under a programme known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. The CIA and White House declined comment. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. Google declined to comment on the purported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter. Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the US government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Apple Inc did not respond to a request for comment. The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end-to-end encryption tools like Signal. Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as "confirmation that what we’re doing is working." Signal and the like are "pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive, high-risk, extremely targeted attacks." CIA cyber programmes The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any US data for counterintelligence purposes. The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: US intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products. Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA's "entire hacking capacity." The documents only include snippets of computer code, not the full programs that would be needed to conduct cyber exploits. WikiLeaks said it was refraining from disclosing usable code from CIA's cyber arsenal "until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should be analysed, disarmed and published." US intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia's security services. During the 2016 US presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win the presidency. WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies. Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign, often citing hacked e-mails it published to bolster his attacks on Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks said on Tuesday that the documents showed that the CIA hoarded serious security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public, as called for under a process established by President Barack Obama. Rob Knake, a former official who dealt with the issue under Obama, said he had not seen evidence in what was published to support that conclusion. The process "is not a policy of unilateral disarmament in cyberspace. The mere fact that the CIA may have exploited zero-day [previously undisclosed] vulnerabilities should not surprise anyone," said Knake, now at the Council on Foreign Relations. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material. In a press release, the group said, "The archive appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive." US intelligence agencies have suffered a series of security breaches, including Snowden's. In 2010, US military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks. Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the secrets in his home. —  Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Google ramps up investment in fibre cable, training Africans CEO of Australia's Atlassian says he'll meet seven-day Tesla batteries deadline Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

An alleged CIA surveillance program disclosed by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, March 7, 2017, purportedly targeted security weaknesses in smart TVs, smartphones, personal computers and even cars, and enabled snooping that could circumvent encryption on communications apps such as Facebook's WhatsApp. WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used. But WikiLeaks claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) By The Washington Post The latest revelations about the U.S. government's powerful hacking tools potentially take surveillance right into the homes and hip pockets of billions of technology users worldwide, showing how a remarkable variety of everyday devices can be turned to spy on their owners. Televisions, smartphones and even anti-virus software are all vulnerable to CIA hacking, according to WikiLeaks documents released Tuesday. The capabilities described include recording the sounds, images and private text messages of users, even when they resort to encrypted apps to communicate. While many of the attack technologies had been previously discussed at cybersecurity conferences, experts were startled to see evidence that the CIA had turned so many theoretical vulnerabilities into functioning attack tools against staples of modern life. These include widely used Internet routers, smartphones, and Mac and Windows computers. In the case of a tool called "Weeping Angel" for attacking Samsung smart TVs, WikiLeaks wrote, "After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server." The CIA reportedly also has studied whether it could infect vehicle control systems for cars and trucks, which WikiLeaks alleged could be used to conduct "nearly undetectable assassinations." And a specialized CIA unit called the Mobile Devices Branch produced malware to control and steal information from iPhones, which according to WikiLeaks were a particular focus because of the smartphone's popularity "among social, political, diplomatic and business elites." The agency also targeted popular phones running Google's Android, the world's leading mobile operating system. WikiLeaks said it redacted lists of CIA surveillance targets, though it said they included targets and machines in Latin America, Europe and the United States. The anti-secrecy group also said that by developing such intrusive technology - rather than helping tech companies patch flaws in their products - the CIA was undermining efforts to protect the cybersecurity of Americans. "The argument that there is some terrorist using a Samsung TV somewhere - as a reason to not disclose that vulnerability to the company, when it puts thousands of Americans at risk - I fundamentally disagree with it," said Alex Rice, chief technology officer for HackerOne, a startup that enlists hackers to report security gaps to companies and organizations in exchange for cash. The trove released Tuesday, which The Washington Post could not independently verify and the CIA has declined to confirm, included 8,761 documents - the first batch in a series of planned releases, WikiLeaks said. This first group, at least, has important differences from the 2013 revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. His trove of documents largely described mass surveillance of Internet-based communications systems, while the WikiLeaks release more often describes attacks on individual devices. By targeting devices, the CIA reportedly gains access to even well-encrypted communications on such popular apps as Signal and WhatsApp, without having to crack the encryption itself. The WikiLeaks reports acknowledged that difference by saying that the CIA had found ways to "bypass," as opposed to defeat, encryption technologies. "The idea that the CIA and NSA can hack into devices is kind of old news," said Johns Hopkins University cryptography expert Matthew Green. "Anyone who thought they couldn't was living in a fantasy world." Snowden's revelations and the resulting backlash made strong encryption a major, well-funded cause for privacy advocates and, perhaps more important, technology companies that had the engineering expertise and budgets to protect data as it flowed across the world. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo and many other companies announced significant new initiatives, in part to protect their brands against accusations by some users that they had made it too easy for the NSA to collect information from their systems. Many websites, meanwhile, began encrypting their data flows to users to prevent snooping. Encryption tools such as Tor were strengthened. Encrypting apps for private messaging, such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp, exploded in popularity, especially among users around the world who were fearful of government intrusion. In the days after the U.S. presidential election last fall, Signal was among the most downloaded programs in Apple's app store, and downloads grew by more than 300 percent. Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal, released a statement Tuesday saying, "The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption." WhatsApp declined to comment, and Telegram did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment, while Samsung and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. government authorities had complained loudly that the post-Snowden wave of encryption was undermining their ability to investigate serious crimes, such as terrorism and child pornography. The FBI in 2016 sued Apple in hopes of forcing it to unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernadino, California, killers before announcing, amid heavy public criticism, that it had other ways to crack the device. Against that backdrop, many privacy advocates argued that devices - often called "endpoints" for their place in chains of communications that can criss-cross continents - were the best available targets in a world with widespread online encryption. The WikiLeaks documents suggest that the CIA may have reached the same conclusion. "It would certainly be consistent with the hypothesis that we've made real progress in the encryption we've been introducing," said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. "It's impossible to be 100 percent certain, but reading the tea leaves, it's plausible." The WikiLeaks revelations also serve as a reminder that, whatever the political backlash to revelations about digital spying, it is not going away and probably will continue to grow. Aside from the United States, many other advanced nations such as China, Russia, Britain and Israel have extremely sophisticated tools for digital spying. Less-advanced nations have gained access to powerful online spying technology through a robust and lightly regulated industry of surveillance contractors throughout the world. On Tuesday, resignation and frustration rippled through Silicon Valley as technologists grappled with the revelations of yet another U.S. government attempt to exploit their systems. And cybersecurity experts reacted with alarm. "This is explosive," said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition InfoSec, a cybersecurity firm. The material highlights specific anti-virus products that can be defeated, going further than a release of NSA hacking tools last year, he said. The WikiLeaks release revealed that the CIA has sophisticated "stealth" capabilities that enable hackers not only to infiltrate systems but to evade detection, as well as abilities to move inside a system freely as if they owned it. Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, said the dates in the WikiLeaks files suggest that the documents were taken in February or March 2016. At least two of them are marked top secret, "which suggests that somebody in early 2016 managed to compromise a top-secret CIA development system and is willing to say that they did." One internal CIA document listed a set of Apple iPhone "exploits" - tools that can be used to compromise the device by taking advantage of software flaws. Some of the tools are based on "zero days," which are software vulnerabilities that have not been shared with the manufacturer. So "some of these descriptions will allow Apple to fix the vulnerabilities," Weaver said. "But at the same time, they're out in the public, and whoever stole this data could use them against U.S. interests." --- Authors Information: Craig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Post.

Apple and other big consumer tech companies face allegations from a WikiLeaks data dump of alleged government documents that the CIA was able to hack iOS and other operating systems. comments SAN FRANCISCO — The tech industry just can't shake the ghost of Edward Snowden. Nearly a year after a unified front of companies fought the FBI's attempt to hack the encrypted iPhone of a terrorist, the biggest consumer tech names (Apple, Samsung, Google, Microsoft) are facing a deep and multi-fronted new series of allegations that federal authorities can override their best efforts at security.  Thousands of documents published by WikiLeaks Tuesday describe an arsenal of CIA hacking tools that can turn iPhone and Android smartphones, TVs, computers and other coveted consumer products into "covert microphones." The data trove threatens to reprise the public distrust of tech companies that hit a peak when ex-federal contractor Snowden revealed NSA spying and collaboration between the government and Internet and phone companies used by millions. Waving the flag of consumer privacy, tech companies have been trying to repair the brand damage since.  On Tuesday CIA issued a statement declining comment on the "purported" documents. USA TODAY has not yet been able to confirm the authenticity of the documents nor seen anything in them thus far to indicate the tools were used in the U.S.  So far, Silicon Valley has responded with resounding silence to the latest WikiLeaks bombshell. Microsoft, Google, Samsung and WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) said they are looking into the matter. Apple and Signal did not respond to email messages for comment on the report. If true, the blockbuster disclosures not only will rock the tech world but could foster widespread paranoia among consumers that their most prized digital devices could be spying devices, casting doubt on their security and the companies that design and build them, say cybersecurity experts. "Everybody should have been worried before, but this is reason to worry more," says Phil Reitinger, CEO of the Global Cyber Alliance and a former director of the National Cyber Security Center. "There is a soaring risk for attack that this feeds into." — Developers created programs in homage to popular culture, including RickyBobby, an “implant” to computers running Microsoft Windows referencing the 2006 Will Farrell movie Talladega Nights. Another program, called a trojan, was dubbed Fight Club. Spread via thumb drives, it referenced the 1996 novel and 1999 movie with Brad Pitt. — Hackers have lists of targeted information like: geolocation data, user identification information, counter-intelligence, pattern of life, return information and general machine information. — A specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch "produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads." — Government hackers were able to infiltrate Android phones and collect “audio and message traffic before encryption is applied,” WikiLeaks said in a statement. — Some of the hacks can be deployed via games like 2048, a single-player sliding block puzzle game, or Sudoko. Others deploy from communication programs like Skype or virus-prevention programs such as McAfee. — Encrypted messaging tools for popular phone and messaging services, including WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal, were bypassed, according to a New York Times report. — Some of the WikiLeaks documents describe tests of hacksdesigned to infiltrate network routers, the computers that are responsible for directing traffic on the internet. For Silicon Valley, the disclosure is the latest example of a government agency posing a serious threat to global trust in their products, , says Richard Henderson, global security strategist at cybersecurity firm Absolute Software. "This takes the topic to a deeper level," Henderson says. What Snowden started jolted the market into accepting that “we are more vulnerable than we thought we were,” adds Casey Ellis, CEO of security company Bugcrowd. "The 'Vault 7’ disclosures are simply taking us deeper down the rabbit-hole of how, why, and where."

They’re Economic Necessities Apple To make it in America, you have to hustle. Fast-food worker or CEO, Uber driver or student, you have to stay connected in an economy built on the assumption that anyone is always reachable anywhere. In 2017, that means you need a smartphone. When Apple released the iPhone in 2007, the world understood it as a gadget, a novelty, a cool thing you plunked down a handful of cash for if you were lucky enough to have the money. Then you just needed to figure out what to do with it. At first the answer was: play games and take pictures of things, text and talk. A decade later, the smartphone has become the lifeblood of social interaction and upward mobility. People from every economic stratum use them to stay in contact. What’s more, smartphones have become the engine of the gig economy, which today employs about one in three American workers. The choice between health care and a smartphone is no choice at all. All of which makes the false equivalence Utah representative Jason Chaffetz drew today the more maddening. “Rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care,” Chaffetz said on CNN by way of defending the House of Representative’s new health care bill. Chaffetz either doesn’t realize or refuses to acknowledge that in the 21st century, the choice between health care and a smartphone is no choice at all. The vast majority of Americans use the internet every day—88 percent according to the Pew Research Center. In 2016, three quarters of all Americans owned a smartphone, with lower-income people and people over the age of 50 accounting for much of the most recent growth. Last year, the United Nations Human Rights Council declared that the internet was a basic human right. People without access to the internet—some 60 million Americans and billions more around the world—face a substantial disadvantage. “I can show you young students who do their homework on smartphones in the parking lots of McDonalds. I can show you grandmas who haven’t talked to their grandkids in years, because they don’t have the internet,” says Chike Aguh, CEO of the nonprofit EveryoneOn, which works to close the digital divide by getting everyone online. Just having the internet at home improves a child’s chances of graduating from high school, Aguh says. “If you misunderstand that you misunderstand and trivialize a really big barrier to economic mobility and a source of economic inequality in this country.” For people with the least money, the smartphone takes on even greater importance. If you can’t afford a computer or an at-home broadband connection, the smartphone becomes your primary way of getting online. You can apply for jobs via your phone, arrange childcare, or trade shifts with your co-workers. For homeless people who use the internet to find beds at shelters or apply for jobs, a smartphone could be a literal lifesaver. Related Stories Sarah Zhang Telemedicine Can’t Help the People Who Need It the Most Emily Dreyfuss The Cognitive Bias President Trump Understands Better Than You Issie Lapowsky Obamacare’s Demise Is a Looming Disaster for Mental Health And, contra Chaffetz, a lifesaver that costs at least an order of magnitude less than the kind that covers your doctors’ bills. You can get a free smartphone from Verizon and pay $35 monthly for access, or a little more than $420 per year. If you can’t afford a monthly bill, you can buy a smartphone for less than $100 and rely on free Wi-fi hotspots to use it. By contrast, the average health care spending per person in America rose to nearly $9,990 in 2015, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Cutting out a smartphone and its bill won’t suddenly give most Americans the ability to afford a monthly health insurance premium. Ironically, access to the internet can actually have positive effects on people’s health. In 2014, the FCC and the University of Mississippi gave people suffering from chronic diabetes access to a mobile internet device that tracked their blood sugar. In just the first six months, the 85 people in the test program went to the hospital less and had gained more control over their disease. And the hospital had saved $339,184 in ER visits, according to Aguh, who can recite that number by heart. Elsewhere, cancer patients use mobile phones to manage their disease—an inexpensive way to start closing the gap in care between wealthy patients and everyone else. Far from being an indulgence, a smartphone could make health care more affordable to everyone, not less. Claiming that one is a necessity and the other a luxury doesn’t just defy the realities of what it takes to participate in the US economy—it displays a willful lack of imagination to recognize the power of technology to make Americans’ lives better.

Washington:  The CIA can turn your TV into a listening device, bypass popular encryption apps, and possibly control your car, according to a trove of alleged documents from the US spy agency released Tuesday by WikiLeaks. The group posted nearly 9,000 documents it said were leaked from the Central Intelligence Agency, in what it described as the largest-ever publication of secret intelligence materials. WikiLeaks claimed that a vast trove of CIA documents, hacking tools and code representing "the majority of its hacking arsenal" were leaked within the cyber security community -- and that it had received, and released, a part of them. "This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA," it said, warning of a risk of cyber weapons proliferation. Neither the CIA nor the White House would say if the documents were genuine. If corroborated, the leak could represent a huge new embarrassment to US intelligence, adding to Edward Snowden's 2013 expose of National Security Agency spying on Americans' communications, and the arrest last year of an NSA official for removing massive amounts of top-secret material to his home over 20 years. WikiLeaks said the data shows that the CIA is now rivaling the NSA, the US government's main electronic spying body, in cyber warfare, but with less oversight. - Bypassing encryption - The archive shows the CIA exploiting weaknesses it discovers in hardware and software systems, including those made by US companies -- without letting anyone know about the flaws in question. Documents show the CIA has produced more than 1,000 malware systems -- viruses, trojans and other software that can infiltrate and take control of personal electronics, WikiLeaks noted. These hacking tools have targeted iPhones, Android systems such as the personal phone reportedly still used by President Donald Trump, popular Microsoft software, and Samsung smart TVs, which can be transformed into covert microphones, according to WikiLeaks. The agency has also examined hacking into the electronic control systems on cars and trucks, potentially enabling it to control them remotely. By infecting and effectively taking over the software of smartphones, WikiLeaks said, the CIA can get around the encryption technologies of popular apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo, and Confide by collecting communications before they are encrypted. - 'Looks authentic' - The CIA would neither confirm nor deny the documents were genuine. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," said spokesman Jonathan Liu in an email. White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined to comment, saying "That's something that has not been fully evaluated." But Devin Nunes, chairman of the House of Representatives's Intelligence Committee, said the disclosures "appear to be very, very serious." "We are very concerned," he said. The documents allegedly come from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, which operates both from its Langley, Virginia, headquarters near Washington, and from an office in the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, according to WikiLeaks. "The archive appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive," the group said. Snowden, who was a contract employee for the NSA before he stole and leaked secret materials, said via Twitter that the document trove "looks authentic." - Cyber weapons 'proliferation' - WikiLeaks said the documents' leak suggests that the CIA has not sufficiently controlled its own cyber weapons, potentially permitting them to fall into the hands of other hackers. Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, blasted the CIA for not helping companies plug the security gaps in their devices. "The dark side of this story is that the documents confirm that the CIA holds on to security vulnerabilities in software and devices -- including Android phones, iPhones, and Samsung televisions -- that millions of people around the world rely on," she said in a statement. "As these leaks show, we're all made less safe by the CIA's decision to keep --  rather than ensure the patching of -- vulnerabilities." The release showed WikiLeaks's readiness to continue publishing secret material on the United States despite having been severely criticized in Washington for last year's leaks of materials that damaged Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential bid. US intelligence officials said in January that WikiLeaks had knowingly or unknowingly become a tool of a high-level Russian operation to interfere in the US election with those disclosures.

VR is perfect for marketing... By Tom Foremski for Tom Foremski: IMHO | March 7, 2017 -- 23:49 GMT (15:49 PST) | Topic: Virtual Reality Anastasiya Sharkova talks about her VR experience at a SpiritualVR event. What if we had a "Dream Marketing Machine" a way to easily and reliably churn out emotionally passionate customers for any brand? Like Apple's fanboys but much quicker and for a lot less money. At a recent event hosted by SpiritualVR, panelist Anastasiya Sharkova said she was deeply moved by her first experience with virtual reality (VR) -- a title called theBlu:Encounter in which you go eye to eye with a blue whale. special feature VR and AR: The Business Reality Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are going to be useful for far more than just gaming. We explore the ways the technology will be used for training, marketing, product design, and much more. Read More She said the experience is so powerful and overwhelming that it bypassed all reason and logic. She knew it was all computer generated yet when she looked into eye of the blue whale she immediately felt a deep emphatic connection that lasted for days. And she noticed a curious effect: she used a lot less water for the next two weeks. This scares me. What if the Blue Whale represents a brand such as Big Blue -- IBM and I'm suddenly emotionally bonding with a commercial organization and I can't control it? We know that VR can affect behavior because it is already used in therapeutic applications treating post traumatic stress disorders. Its widespread use in marketing is inevitable and when combined with AI, biometric sensors and personalization -- it will become extraordinary in its effectiveness. A Dream Marketing Machine. Dream or nightmare? It's a dream for marketers because all they talk about is creating compelling and emotionally authentic media content. I recently spoke with Yuval Boger, CEO of open-source VR tech design company Sensics. "We are still in early stages and the headsets and equipment needs to improve and cost less but we are seeing a lot of interest in marketing applications. There are some excellent opportunities to create powerful branded VR experiences." Oculus Rift VR We must control virtual reality before it controls us We must face up to the potential dangers of widespread virtual reality technology before it's too late. Read More - But would you willingly agree to a VR experience that you knew was designed to persuade you and manipulate your emotions for commercial gain? And then continue to influence your behavior long after the event? - Would you allow the Disney whale to try to emotionally bond with your child? - What if your new job required a swim with the company culture whale as part of HR's on-boarding? - What if your government insists you swim with its patriotic whale? Don't get hung up on these balaenopteran examples. The creature will be chosen and shaped just for you -- for maximum effect. Total sphere of control... Marketing is mostly confined to the periphery of our daily experience such as with online ads, billboards, etc. VR gives creators control over the entire 360 degree sphere of the user experience -- every pixel every sound and every aspect of the narrative. Marketers have never ever had so much control. Mass media critic Marshall McLuhan in the 1960s was alarmed by tiny TV screens. - I wouldn't let my children into any marketing VR experience; - I wouldn't use it; - and I'd be mistrustful of hiring someone who had VR training at a competitor. Joseph Stalin got his US atomic bomb secrets because of spies motivated by an emotional connection to the Soviet Union and not because of money. VR for social uses? How about using VR for positive purposes? Using less water, getting fitter, eating better because of crafted VR experiences that work to change our behavior? What if socially responsible VR experiences are sponsored by brands? Would that be OK? Would we trust them? Question the future... Society gains nothing by allowing its people to be ensnared by emotional bonds to abstract entities. If our technologies of persuasion become too good at what they do -- and they will eventually reach that point -- then they become too good to use. The question is: Who has the right to access our emotions? The government? Hollywood? Or anyone at anytime and in any way? As our technologies of persuasion become more advanced the answer has to be: No one. Until we understand that answer -- and make it work -- the world of marketing will rush into VR faster than Elon Musk in a Hyperloop pod.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

It is, after all, how the salaries get paid, and how funds are raised for re-election and looking after the country, often in that order. Consider the UK as an example. Starting in April, there will be a new set of tax regulations based on the IR35 guidelines. With the uncertainty surrounding this change there has been a rush of IT contractors leaving government positions, in many cases over half, halting a wide range of projects. This has been happening for over a year now with, as an example, the Ministry of Defence losing 30 out of 32 contractors last year. When the process of government is stopped because of taxes imposed, you're probably doing something wrong. The Galaxy S8 will be out by the end of April in two versions, a 5.8-inch screen full-rectangle and a 5.6-inch screen with rounded corners, along with 64GB of RAM with microSD support for up to 256GB extra. It will also come with 4GB of RAM, 12MP dual lens rear and 8MP front cameras, water- and dust-resistant IP68, iris and fingerprint scanner, wireless charging and a Quad HD+ Super AMOLED display. The latter is an 18:9-ratio screen probably something like 1440x2880 pixels -- so, a lot. As usual all of this may or may not be true when it comes to the real thing. You can expect, however, that the S8 will feature a number of improvements over the S7. Samsung has recently announced a new virtual-reality device, the Gear VR, a couple of new tablets and the Galaxy Book that runs Windows instead of Android. The Galaxy Book comes in 10.6-inch (1920x1280 pixels) and 12-inch (2160x1440) versions, including keyboard covers and the S-Pen. The 10.6-inch version comes with 4GB RAM and 64 or 128GB storage with the Intel's dual-core 2.6 GHz m3 processor. The 12-inch version has a dual-core 3.1 GHz i5 processor, 4 or 8GB RAM, and 128 or 256GB storage. Both versions support microSD cards. Today's hacking story comes to us from Apple and ESET. If you haven't yet upgraded to version 6.4.168.0 then you should. Also, who numbers their products with an IP address? If you don't, then you get root-level remote-code execution on a Mac by intercepting the ESET antivirus package's connection to its back-end servers, insert yourself as a man-in-the-middle, and exploit an XML library hole. Yes, Apple Macs can indeed be hacked. It's beginning. There is a "feature" in Windows Insider Preview Build 15042 that allows administrators to block the installation of any Win32 application not sourced from Microsoft's software marketplace. This feature potentially makes Microsoft like, well, Apple. An Insider Build is not necessarily the same as the one seen by the public, and this "feature" has not yet been confirmed as part of the April Creator's Update. It is also a feature that would be immediately disabled by a large number of non-company users such as game players. A conspiracy theorist may conclude that it will start as optional, and then become mandatory, then permanent, and finally the option will be removed. According to Huawei's European president, Samsung and Apple phones are overpriced. I would note that the latest Huawei offerings have skyrocketed in price, to where they're not all that far behind the one's so named. Huawei does spend less on marketing, however. Huawei has been gradually improving its products to the point where they now compete in the upper end of the market. Huawei has two top-end streams, the Mate for the business user and the P series for the artier person who wants to take photos. Huawei does have a great fast-charge system that after half-an-hour will give an average day's use, whatever the definition of that is. It is amazing what you can find while surfing the net. Before the Samsung Note and its issues, Boeing had patented a battery-powered personal-device case with a built-in fire-suppression system. With the move from flight manuals to tablets, the aim of the patent was for devices in plane cockpits, where it would take steps if the unit started to heat up or burst into flames. But the device is clearly useful for airlines, because we know many have moved their flight manuals from paper to tablet computers. Giving those devices a place to rest that also prevents them from bursting into flames seems a worthwhile innovation. I wonder if we will see similar devices for our smartphones? In this week's "irony much?" segment, a group from the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) in Darmstadt, Germany, called TeamSIK looked into the safety of Android-based password managers. These are applications you use to safely store and track all your passwords. Looking at nine of them, the verdict was: not all that safe. If you happen to be using My Passwords, Informaticore Password Manager, LastPass, Keeper, F-Secure KEY, Dashlane, Hide Pictures Keep Safe Vault, Avast Passwords or 1Password, they were all found to have vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to get all your passwords.

Assuming the two companies can make the deal come together, they’ll be in a strong position to steal Apple’s memory business away from Samsung. Foxconn wants to buy Toshiba’s NAND flash memory division The plan, according to Foxconn chairman Terry Guo, is to let Toshiba continue operating as a stand-alone company, much like Sharp does. Foxconn purchased Sharp last year in a US$3.5 billion deal, and while it has a great deal of control over who sits on Sharp’s board of directors, the company still operates independently. News of the proposed buyout comes via China’s Liberty Times. The paper said Foxconn and TSMC are preparing now for March 29th’s first-round bidding. Assuming the two land the winning bid, Foxconn plans to help Toshiba grow its memory chip business. The move isn’t, however, completely altruistic because Foxconn expects memory storage demands to increase when 8K video resolution takes off. Since Foxconn is already the world’s largest storage equipment maker, the Toshiba deal will give the company a competitive advantage. Landing Toshiba’s Memory Business Foxconn has plans to grow its large screen display business and owning Toshiba’s NAND flash memory business will help ensure the chips it needs will be available. The deal will also set up Toshiba to be Apple’s primary memory chip supplier instead of Samsung. The money Foxconn and TSMC invest in Toshiba will help ramp up the production infrastructure to meet not only Apple’s demands, but Foxconn’s, too. That’s assuming Foxconn and TSMC land the winning bid to buy Toshiba. Toshiba is spinning off its flash memory devision to help cover a US$6.3 billion loss. It’s planning on selling a stake in the new company, but is open to selling the entire business to the right bidder. Foxconn and TSMC aren’t saying how much money they’re willing to spend to buy Toshiba’s memory business, but Mr. Guo said he’s very serious about landing the deal.

Wikileaks called the CIA documents “Vault 7,” a trove of 7,818 pages and files disclosing cyber weapons and hacking tools. Among other revelations, the one making the biggest headlines is that the CIA worked extensively on iPhone hacks. CIA Leak Targets iPhones It should come as no surprise that a government agency wants to hack into smartphones. It appears as though the CIA has dedicated teams working to break into Apple products like iPhones, iPads and even AirPorts, which is Apple’s line of routers. Although the iPhone only has a 15% market share, it’s a smartphone favored by “social, political, diplomatic and business elites.” iOS exploit data. Credit: Wikileaks The Mac Observer received a statement from Representative Todd Lieu (L.A. County), a member of the House Foreign Affairs and House Judiciary Committees. He also happens to have a degree in computer science, one of four CS degrees in Congress. He says: WikiLeaks’ alleged release of thousands of documents describing the CIA’s hacking capabilities is of monumental concern. The group claims the CIA managed to bypass encryption on secure messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal and developed code to turn cellphones, computers, and televisions into listening devices…As a computer science major, I am deeply disturbed by the allegation that the CIA lost its arsenal of hacking tools. The ramifications could be devastating. I am calling for an immediate congressional investigation. We need to know if the CIA lost control of its hacking tools, who may have those tools, and how do we now protect the privacy of Americans. Is Your iPhone Vulnerable? Wondering whether you’re vulnerable to these hacking tools is probably the first thing on everyone’s mind. In an article by Business Insider, security professional Will Strafach says it might not be a concern for Apple customers. So far, there is zero cause for concern. They definitely have vulnerability research (looks very similar to my own company’s internal wiki), but nothing which should be of any concern to a user on the latest iOS. In other words, the most important step you can take is to update to the latest iOS version, if possible. Apple regularly releases bug and exploit fixes in almost every version of its operating systems. On your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings > General > Software Update to see if you have the latest update.

Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection."This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices ... I haven’t yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices," said Tarah Wheeler, senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec.Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States.Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicized.In one case, the documents say, U.S. and British personnel, under a program known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. The CIA and White House declined comment. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement.Google declined to comment on the purported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter.Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U.S. government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies.Apple Inc did not respond to a request for comment.The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end-to-end encryption tools like Signal.Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as "confirmation that what we’re doing is working." Signal and the like are "pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive, high-risk, extremely targeted attacks." CIA CYBER PROGRAMS The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any U.S. data for counterintelligence purposes.The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: U.S. intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products.Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage.WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA's "entire hacking capacity."The documents only include snippets of computer code, not the full programs that would be needed to conduct cyber exploits.WikiLeaks said it was refraining from disclosing usable code from CIA's cyber arsenal "until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should be analyzed, disarmed and published." U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia's security services. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win the presidency.WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies.Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign, often citing hacked emails it published to bolster his attacks on Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.WikiLeaks said on Tuesday that the documents showed that the CIA hoarded serious security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public, as called for under a process established by President Barack Obama.Rob Knake, a former official who dealt with the issue under Obama, said he had not seen evidence in what was published to support that conclusion.The process "is not a policy of unilateral disarmament in cyberspace. The mere fact that the CIA may have exploited zero-day [previously undisclosed] vulnerabilities should not surprise anyone," said Knake, now at the Council on Foreign Relations.U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material.In a press release, the group said, "The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive."U.S. intelligence agencies have suffered a series of security breaches, including Snowden's.In 2010, U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks.Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the secrets in his home.

(Andrew Gombert/European Pressphoto Agency) By Ellen Nakashima By Ellen Nakashima March 7 Follow @nakashimae WikiLeaks’ release on Tuesday of a massive cache of data describing CIA hacking tools has renewed a debate over how well the U.S. government balances the protection of Americans’ cybersecurity against the need to protect national security. Some of the tools, the anti-secrecy group said, are based on “zero-day” flaws — or previously unknown software bugs — for targeting iPhone and Android devices. “At a time of increasingly damaging hacking by cybercriminals and governments, it’s essential that U.S. agencies not undermine the security of our digital systems,” said Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. “These documents, which appear to be authentic, show that the intelligence community has deliberately maintained vulnerabilities in the most common devices used by hundreds of millions of people.” He added, “Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone’s digital life safer.” [WikiLeaks: CIA is using popular TVs, smartphones and cars to spy on their owners] To date, WikiLeaks has not released actual source code for the exploits, or the tools built to take advantage of the flaws, although security experts who have reviewed the internal documents say descriptions of the exploits may be detailed enough to recreate source code. But former Obama administration cyber officials take a more tempered view. “The idea that there’s an operational need for the CIA to target Apple and Google overseas shouldn’t surprise anybody, given the pervasiveness of the Android and iPhone,” said Rob Knake, a former White House cyber official who left the administration in 2015. The Obama officials established a policy in early 2014 that called for agencies including the CIA, the National Security Agency, the FBI and the Secret Service to submit software flaws they discovered or purchased for review by all the agencies with an interest in their use or disclosure. The policy is called the “Vulnerabilities Equities Process,” and it is not designed “to disclose all vulnerabilities,” Knake said. “The policy is not unilateral disarmament of the United States.” Former officials could not comment on whether the CIA disclosed the specific vulnerabilities cited in the WikiLeaks cache, but in general, they said, all the agencies, including the CIA, participated in the process. Michael Daniel, the former top cybersecurity adviser to President Barack Obama, said that while officials would “weigh very heavily toward disclosure” a software flaw found in an Apple or Microsoft or other widely-used product, “there’s no hard-and-fast rule that says because this is in an Apple system, we must disclose it.” The “default assumption,” he said, is disclosure. But in a minority of cases, he said, the government will opt to keep secret the flaw so it can continue to be used in hacking operations. “You might have a vulnerability in a system that is not widely used in the U.S., or it might be the only way we know of to get access to certain kinds of networks,” he said. Even if a decision is made to withhold information about a flaw, the policy requires that the decision be periodically reviewed, he said. Others were dismayed at what WikiLeaks exposed. “The CIA reports show the USG [U.S. government] developing vulnerabilities in U.S. products, then intentionally keeping the holes open,” tweeted Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who in 2013 released documents about widespread government surveillance. “Reckless beyond words.” One of the documents shows that the CIA purchased some of its tools to exploit flaws, and some were bought by the NSA and shared with the CIA. Under the Obama-era policy, an agency buying information about a flaw must agree to submit it to the vulnerabilities review, Daniel said. But if an agency has bought a hacking tool without the rights to the underlying flaw, it may not be able to do so, he said. A case in point involved the FBI, which last year paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for a solution to crack an iPhone that had been used by a terrorist in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shootings in 2015. “As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones), they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable,” WikiLeaks said in a news release. On Tuesday, technology firms were scrambling to review the documents to determine which, if any, of the security flaws mentioned might still exist. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said in a statement, “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.” The CIA data dump, coming on the heels of a massive breach of NSA hacking tools last year, underscores the importance of the vulnerabilities review process in a new administration, said Ross Schulman, senior counsel at New America’s Open Technology Institute, a think tank. He noted that the review policy “existed by the grace of the Obama administration.” Trump cyber officials have indicated that it will continue, he said. But there’s no law requiring the review, and critics have said it could have stronger transparency requirements. “Congress ought to pass a law saying that something like the [Vulnerabilities Equities Process] ought to exist,” Schulman said.

Apple Roses Are As Easy To Make As They Are Beautiful Claire Lower Mar 8, 2017, 11:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apples baking clips cooking desserts food kitchen skillet Share Though there is something rewarding and cathartic about baking a finicky, labour-intensive dessert, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy an easy, though still fancy-looking sweet thing. Apple roses are not only deliciously warm and comforting, but they're just plain pretty, and a cinch to make. My boy Justin Chapple can walk you through the whole process in the video above, but all you'll need is a few apples, some puff pastry, cinnamon sugar and apricot jam. Slice the apples into thin half-moons, and cut the pastry into 12 even rectangles. Brush on a little jam — thin it out with water first — and lay your apple slices on top of the pastry, overlapping them so they look like petals. Sprinkle some cinnamon sugar all over that mess, fold the bottom of the pastry up over the apples, and roll it up into a rose. Put it your fruity flowers in a muffin tin, and bake at 160C for about 45 minutes. Sprinkle on some powdered sugar, and serve to your guests with a just a touch of smugness and a "oh, these took me know time at all!"

They can be out by plus or minus 34 beats per minute, leading to warnings users with bad hearts should not treat them as medical devices. PA:Press Association 2 Best seller Apple Watch has been proven to report inaccurate heartbeat data In a study, top sellers including the Apple Watch were put through their paces by 50 healthy gym-goers. Most were found to be fairly accurate when the ­volunteers were at rest. But readings varied wildly during 18-minute workouts, especially when exercise became more vigorous. Getty Images 2 None of the fitness watches can beat the old-fashioned chest strap monitor All were outperformed by a traditional chest strap monitor when readings were compared to an ECG, also hooked up to the volunteers. Apple’s gadget tended to be most reliable. Others tested in the US experiment included the Fitbit Blaze, Garmin Forerunner 235 and TomTom Spark Cardio. MOST READ IN NEWS WHAT WILLS KATE SAY?

The current version sells for US$249. — Screen capture via NestSAN FRANCISCO, March 9 — Alphabet Inc’s Nest, seeking a bigger share of the connected home market, is developing a cheaper version of its flagship thermostat and new home security products, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company is working on a version of its “learning thermostat,” which adjusts the temperature based on usage patterns, that would sell for under US$200 (RM890.90), the person said. The current version sells for US$249. The cheaper model would include less expensive components and at least one internal prototype lacks the flagship model’s metal edges, the person said.  A home-security alarm system, a digital doorbell and an updated indoor security camera are also in the works, representing potential good news for a company that has struggled to release many new products.  Co-founded by Tony Fadell, a former Apple Inc executive who helped create the iPod, Nest was acquired by Google for US$3.2 billion in 2014 after the first version of its thermostat sold well. Fadell left last year after some employees complained publicly about his aggressive management style. The business is now run by Marwan Fawaz, a former executive vice president of Motorola Mobility.  The new, cheaper thermostat may launch by next year, the person said. Nest is also developing remote sensors for its thermostat that would let users control the temperature of individual rooms versus just the entire home. A spokesperson for Palo Alto, California-based Nest declined to comment on future products. Hardware product roadmaps are often in flux and may change. Nest is also working on an end-to-end home security alarm solution with the goal of shipping this year, the person said. One of the prototype versions of the system includes a central hub with a keypad, a pack of alarm sensors to be placed on windows and doors, and a fob for key rings for arming and disarming the alarm system, the person said. Like a standard home alarm system, the alarm will ring when a person enters the room until the correct code is entered into the keypad. The fob could also be used to enable and disable the alarm, according to the person.  The security system would be paired with a smartphone application that would allow a home owner to approve entry for a specific person, such as a dog walker or visitor, the person said. The Information reported on an upcoming Nest security system last year.  Nest is also developing a second-generation version of its indoor security camera. Originally launched last year with technology obtained with the acquisition of startup Dropcam, the security camera can currently determine when a person walks into a room and notify a user via a mobile app. The new camera may be released as soon as this fall, the person said. Nest has internally discussed enhancements to the indoor camera for identifying specific people in the frame, the person added.  The company is also exploring the development of a digital doorbell system for release as soon as next year, the person said. The digital doorbell would include a video camera and integrate with an app so that a resident could theoretically communicate visually with a person before opening the door. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Horizon Zero Dawn’ passes 2.6 million sales, sets specific record Want to protect your smartphone?

WikiLeaks announced it had published a new series of leaks about the CIA – Vault 7 – on 7 March. The leaks contain details of exploits the CIA used on connected devices. Included was an “arsenal” of malware based on zero-day exploits, which the CIA could use to control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and products running iOS. Apple said it is committed to safeguarding customers’ privacy and security, and its device security “represents the best data security available to consumers”. “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities,” said Apple. “We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.” Now read: WikiLeaks leaker Chelsea Manning to be freed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Apple iOS iphone Vault 7 WikiLeaks Share your thoughts: Many iOS vulnerabilities in WikiLeaks relea… Latest news Twitter to open live streaming service The most sought-after skills in South Africa South African-developed concrete tough enough for Trump’s wall Partner Content 8 solutions businesses require Innovation starts with us, and continues with you This is one of the most innovative startups in Africa Show comments Join the conversation Autoload comments Comments section policy: Any attacks on MyBroadband, its journalists, or other readers will result in a ban.

The discussion transcripts showed that CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc iPhones, Google Inc Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. Cyber security experts disagreed about the extent of the fallout from the data dump, but said a lot would depend on whether WikiLeaks followed through on a threat to publish the actual hacking tools that could do damage. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate. A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in U.S. hacking tools told Reuters the documents included correct "cover" terms describing active cyber programs. Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other U.S. and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. The files did not indicate the actual encryption of Signal or other secure messaging apps had been compromised. The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest breach in recent years of classified material from U.S. intelligence agencies. Security experts differed over how much the disclosures could damage U.S. cyber espionage. Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection. "This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices ... I haven’t yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices," said Tarah Wheeler, senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec. Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States. Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicized. In one case, the documents say, U.S. and British personnel, under a program known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo/Illustration The CIA and White House declined comment. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. Google declined to comment on the purported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter. Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U.S. government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Apple Inc did not respond to a request for comment. The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end-to-end encryption tools like Signal. Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as "confirmation that what we’re doing is working." Signal and the like are "pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive, high-risk, extremely targeted attacks." CIA CYBER PROGRAMS The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any U.S. data for counterintelligence purposes. The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: U.S. intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products. Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA's "entire hacking capacity." The documents only include snippets of computer code, not the full programs that would be needed to conduct cyber exploits. WikiLeaks said it was refraining from disclosing usable code from CIA's cyber arsenal "until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should be analyzed, disarmed and published." U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia's security services. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win the presidency. WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies. Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign, often citing hacked emails it published to bolster his attacks on Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks said on Tuesday that the documents showed that the CIA hoarded serious security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public, as called for under a process established by President Barack Obama. Rob Knake, a former official who dealt with the issue under Obama, said he had not seen evidence in what was published to support that conclusion. The process "is not a policy of unilateral disarmament in cyberspace. The mere fact that the CIA may have exploited zero-day [previously undisclosed] vulnerabilities should not surprise anyone," said Knake, now at the Council on Foreign Relations. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material. In a press release, the group said, "The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive." U.S. intelligence agencies have suffered a series of security breaches, including Snowden's. In 2010, U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks. Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the secrets in his home. برچسب ها: wikileaks ، cia ، cyber spying بازگشت به بالای صفحه 0 .به کانال تلگرام ما بپیوندید روی خط سایت ها سوپرمارکت آنلاین سوالات ناسا برای روز جهانی عدد پی یه پیشنهاد فوق العاده رزرو آنلاین هتل مدیا ویدیوی شیوه عجیب پاسخگویی وزیر راه در فرودگاه / ویدیوی تکنیک جالب گران فروشی طلافروشان / ویدیوی حرف های مهناز افشار درباره... آخرین گفت وگوی مرحوم افشین یداللهی/ شعارهایی که هیچ وقت به آنها عمل نمی شود/ خرج عروسی؛ مبلغی که می‌توان... دیدار با رئیس‌جمهور اصلاحات تخلف شناخته نشد/محمدمهدی زاهدی: دولت به‌گونه‌ای رفتار می‌کند که انگار مردم... راز طول عمر بالا از زبان پیرمرد ۲۵۶ ساله چینی!/ خبری محرمانه از اردوگاه انتخاباتی احمدی نژاد/ اعتراف... نظر شما نام: ایمیل: * نظر: آخرین اخبار ویدیو: خلاصه آ اس رم 2-1 لیون ویدیو: خلاصه منچستریونایتد 1-0 روستوف آیا بانک صادرات در مسئله میزان تخلف کرده است؟ وزرای دفاع عربستان و آمریکا دیدار کردند از «بازار شب عید خودروهای وارداتی» تا «تاثیر انتخابات هلند و افزایش نرخ بهره بر بورس‌های جهانی» عوامل انباشت «خانه خالی» در بازار مسکن خودروسازان در ۱۱ ماه چقدر درآمد داشتند؟ ترافیک نیمه‌سنگین در محور مواصلاتی قزوین-کرج عفو 13 ایرانی با دستور رییس جمهور‌آذربایجان سقوط داربست بر روی ۵ خودرو همه آنچه باید در مورد حداقل دستمزد ۹۶ بدانید آخرین آمارهای تکان دهنده از بحران شش ساله سوریه «السیسی» فرمان ایجاد نمایندگی دائم مصر در ناتو را صادر کرد «زیگمار گابریل» از سیاست خارجی آمریکا انتقاد کرد از تلاش عراق در راستای مبارزه با تروریسم حمایت می کنیم وب گردی ++Instagram چیست و چطور آن را بدون جیلبرک دانلود کنیم؟ آموزش تصویری عدم نمایش وضعیت آنلاین در تلگرام 6 اثر جانبی دریافت بیش از اندازه ویتامین D تردد خودروهای پلاک کیش در کل کشور آزاد شد کابوس :علت و درمان بیماری های قلبی و عروقی با نوشابه انرژی زا نخستین سایت رزرو هتل،آپارتمان،ویلا و...در داخل وخارج کشور تاثیر مصرف بیش از اندازه قند بر خواب خواص کاسنی چیست تماشا کنید: قطارهای مغناطیسی با سرعت 580 کیلومتر بر ساعت لکسس UX» کانسپت توليد خواهد شد+تصاویر سرطان هایی که دیر تشخیص داده می شوند چرا عمر زنها طولانی تر از مردهاست حراج آخر فصل تا 70 درصد تخفیف تورهای ویژه نوروز 96- لحظه آخر فهمیدن رمز عبور کاربران در گوگل کروم و فایرفاکس آموزش تصویری تقسیم صفحه نمایش در سیستم عامل اندروید درمان انگل و کرم روده پربازدید ها پربحث ترین عناوین افشین یداللهی شاعر و ترانه‌سرا بدرود حیات گفت + ویدیو زنگ خطر جدی برای بخش سلامت و اقتصاد واکنش محمدبنا به ازدواجش با دخترکارخانه دار پولدار زنی که 24 ساعت همسر هیتلر بود ماجرای توصیه عباس جدیدی به «تتلو»!/ انتقاد آیت‌الله مکارم شیرازی از استانداران/پیش بینی معاون رئیس جمهور درباره پیروز انتخابات/ نظر شهرام ناظری پیرامون ربنای شجریان/ درخواست علی مطهری از وزیر اطلاعات/ پیامک های روحانی چقدر آب خورد؟ واکنش هنرمندان به درگذشت علی معلم واکنش وزیر اطلاعات به رفتار مجری تلویزیون واکنش غیر مستقیم ظریف به نامه احمدی‌نژاد/ عکس العمل شدید نوبخت به انتقادات از دولت/ هدف مشایی از نامه‌نگاری به رئیس دولت اصلاحات چه بود؟/ شکایت ۸۷۰۰ مسافر کربلا از ۲ مدیر! تصاویر تحقیرآمیزی که خشم ترکیه را برانگیخت راز طول عمر بالا از زبان پیرمرد ۲۵۶ ساله چینی!/ خبری محرمانه از اردوگاه انتخاباتی احمدی نژاد/ اعتراف معاون گردشگری به گرانی سفر/ علت پیروزی ترامپ از زبان خودش/ ۶ وزیر روحانی ثروتی از ۳۰۰ تا هزار میلیارد دارند‌! حداقل حقوق سال ۹۶ کارگران به همراه جزئیات اعلام شد ابتکار جالب محیط‌بان دلسوز برای بازگرداندن آهوان گریزپا! +تصاویر یک بازیگر دیگر درگذشت استقبال گسترده مردم، خانم مجری رئوف را غافلگیر و نیازمندان را ذوق زده کرد دیدار با رئیس‌جمهور اصلاحات تخلف شناخته نشد/محمدمهدی زاهدی: دولت به‌گونه‌ای رفتار می‌کند که انگار مردم فهم و شعور ندارند به نظر شما چه اتفاقاتی در سال 95 کام ایرانیان را شیرین کرد؟  (۱۲۵ نظر) سومین بیانیه احمدی نژاد منتشر شد  (۱۱۱ نظر) عاملان وقوع آتش سوزی در «پلاسکو» اعتراف کردند  (۳۶ نظر) ابتکار جالب محیط‌بان دلسوز برای بازگرداندن آهوان گریزپا! +تصاویر  (۳۲ نظر) حداقل دستمزد کارگران تعیین شد  (۳۲ نظر) اتمام حجت مسئولان با آنهایی که قصد سفر به ترکیه دارند  (۲۹ نظر) آرزوی خلبان شدن کودک ۸ ساله برآورده شد  (۲۸ نظر) پنج تنبیه برای دستگیرشدگان‌چهارشنبه‌سوری  (۲۶ نظر) چه زمانی شیوه افزایش ذره‌ای حقوق سالانه تغییر خواهد کرد؟  (۲۴ نظر) گام مهم در مجلس برای کاهش آمار اعدام در کشور  (۲۴ نظر) «کسی چیزی را مجانی به دیگری نمی‌دهد»؛ الا وعده!  (۲۲ نظر) قیمت جایگزین پراید تعیین شد  (۱۹ نظر) سگ گردانی داخل شهر ممنوع  (۱۸ نظر) ورزشگاه فوق مدرن وزيباي ايران دركرمان+عكس  (۱۷ نظر) صید ماهی ۱۰ گرمی از دریای خزر  (۱۶ نظر) فارسی العریبة صفحه نخست تابناک جهان اقتصادی ورزشی اجتماعی مجلس ویدیو انتخابات درباره ما تماس با ما خبرنامه پیوندها جستجو آرشیو آب و هوا اوقات شرعی RSS تمام حقوق مادی و معنوی این سایت متعلق به تابناک می باشد و استفاده از مطالب با ذکر منبع بلامانع است. طراحی و تولید "ایران سامانه"

The site notes that the device will be a premium model that is suitable for use alongside the Apple Watch Edition. Apple is said to be testing numerous prototypes and has yet to settle on a design. There are multiple prototype models, and development is continued in parallel with the engineering verification test (Engineering Verification Test). In addition to the glass enclosure, the aluminum enclosure, the white ceramic enclosure, IPS TFT, There are possibilities that various models such as AMOLED, models with home buttons, models without home buttons, etc. have been developed at the level close to the product. Macotakara claims the only features decided are: a 5-inch display, dual camera, wireless charging, and Lightning connector. It's unclear if the site is referring to the 5.8-inch screen with 5.15-inches of actual display area previously rumored. While the 'iPhone Edition' will be unveiled at the same time as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, the device will allegedly be released much later. This corroborates some other recent reports that have suggested production may not start until September. Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone is widely expected to be a big update.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 8 March 2017 | MYT 1:43 PM WikiLeaks says it has CIA spy tools as McCain cites dangers by nafeesa syeed, michael riley, andalistair barr Don't freak out yet: WikiLeak's latest info dump purportedly includes evidence that the CIA developed ways to hack into myriad devices in order to monitor conversations and messages, but experts have said that nothing in the WikiLeaks documents would allow for the mass interception of communications. — Reuters The Central Intelligence Agency’s hackers have developed tools letting them break into devices to monitor conversations and messages, according to documents released by WikiLeaks that – if true – could expose US operations in countries from North Korea to Iran.  “If they can hack into the CIA they can hack into anyone,” Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said of WikiLeaks. “This is very, very serious.”  WikiLeaks, which specialises in disclosing government secrets, posted 8,761 documents and files March 7 that it said came from the CIA’s Centre for Cyber Intelligence. The group said the centre developed ways to hack into devices, from Apple Inc’s iPhones and phones based on Google’s Android system to Samsung “smart” televisions, in order to monitor conversations and messages.  The trove, if legitimate, discloses malware, viruses and security vulnerabilities known as “zero days.” It also reveals that the agency has the ability to break into devices and intercept messages before they can be encrypted by applications such as Facebook Inc’s WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Confide.  'Probably legit’  “At first glance it is probably legit or contains a lot of legitimate stuff, which means somebody managed to extract a lot of data from a classified CIA system and is willing to let the world know that,” Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, said in an e-mail.  CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in an e-mail, “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.”  Foreign governments that think their computers and devices have been infiltrated could follow the digital trail to pinpoint exactly where the CIA has been – and potentially track down insiders who may have aided in those intelligence operations, according to a former US intelligence official who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.  In the worst case, some of the agency’s most sensitive operations could be exposed in countries such as North Korea, Iran, and Russia, setting back US intelligence efforts, the former official said.  Hard to replace  The types of hacking capabilities purportedly disclosed by WikiLeaks aren’t easily replaced once they are disclosed, and targets can develop defences against them, according to a former National Security Agency cyber engineer, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information. The alleged leaks are a reminder of how important, yet difficult, data protection is for intelligence agencies, added the former official, who said there appears to be a crisis in operational security over maintaining confidentiality.  But a technology entrepreneur, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters, said that nothing in the WikiLeaks documents would allow for the mass interception of communications. The executive said the material is malware, mostly for older operating systems, and isn’t especially advanced technically.  WikiLeaks boasted March 7 that its CIA leak “eclipses” the number of pages in Edward Snowden’s 2013 disclosures of National Security Agency programs. But its posting on March 7 disclosed mostly instructions about how to deploy hacking tools rather than the specifics that would be most useful to the CIA’s adversaries.  Redacted information  WikiLeaks said it redacted and removed some identifying information from the content, including the names of CIA employees and tens of thousands of “CIA targets and attack machines’’ in Latin America, Europe and the US The group said it obtained portions of the CIA’s hacking archive, which has several hundred million lines of code. WikiLeaks said it withheld releasing “armed” cyberweapons until “a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA’s program and how such 'weapons’ should analysed, disarmed and published.”  “It could be potentially more dangerous than Snowden,” said Bob Stasio, a fellow at the Truman National Security Project. “The Snowden leaks were damaging but were never linked to an actual threat of life that we know of. If this leak turns out to be genuine, the lives of people who have worked with the CIA could be at risk.”  Last year, WikiLeaks posted thousands of stolen emails to and from Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign chairman. WikiLeaks has denied that it obtained the Clinton emails from Russia, which US intelligence agencies have said was responsible for hacking during last year’s campaign to hurt Clinton and, ultimately, help Donald Trump win the White House.  In an analysis it released March 7, WikiLeaks said the CIA’s Remote Devices Branch has a group called UMBRAGE, which maintains a “substantial library” of attack methods from malware produced in other countries, including Russia.  WikiLeaks said the CIA documents showed the agency is able to defeat encryption on popular applications such as WhatsApp and Signal by simply hacking into the devices “that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.”  Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems, which maintains the Signal app, said in an email that the CIA’s alleged techniques don’t involve breaking Signal’s encryption. He said that’s “confirmation that what we’re doing is working. Ubiquitous end-to-end encryption is pushing intelligence agencies like the CIA from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to very selectively use high-risk, expensive, targeted attacks.”  Underscoring the same theme, Telegram wrote on Twitter that the problem was with phones and operating systems, not its messaging app. “This one is for the device and OS manufacturers to fix,” the company said.  WhatsApp has 1.2 billion monthly users, while Telegram has more than 100 million. Signal was the 32nd most popular app on Google’s Play app as of March 6, according to App Annie, which tracks app data. Telegram was 37th and WhatsApp was second.  Islamic State  Activists, journalists and others often turn to such outlets for secure communications, while terrorist groups such as Islamic State have used Telegram to go undetected. US intelligence and law enforcement agencies have said that they need new powers to break into encrypted applications and devices.  WikiLeaks said the material it disclosed “appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.”  While the material may reveal sensitive CIA techniques, it doesn’t list “executables or exploits” – details on actual attacks that have been carried out and the targets – according to Weaver of the International Computer Science Institute, who was beginning to analyse the documents.  Google’s Android runs more than 85% of the world’s smartphones, while Apple’s iOS runs 13%, according to research firm IDC.  Apple said many of the issues identified have already been addressed in the latest version of iOS and the company is committed to safeguarding customer privacy and security.  “Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80% of users running the latest version,” Apple said in a statement. “We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.”  Google said it is “actively investigating” the WikiLeaks disclosures. Facebook declined to comment.  The CIA also “runs a very substantial effort to infect and control” Microsoft Windows users with its malware, including infecting removable media such as USB drives, WikiLeaks said. The Windows operating system runs more than 90% of desktop computers, according to Net Applications.  Microsoft said it will patch any security vulnerabilities that turn up from the WikiLeaks disclosures. A company official last month called for countries to leave civilians out of any hacking.  'Weeping Angel’  In a tactic dubbed “Weeping Angel” in the documents, hackers attack Samsung smart TVs, “transforming them into covert microphones,” according to WikiLeaks. Samsung didn’t respond to a request for comment.  The agency uses the US consulate in Frankfurt as a “covert base for its hackers” covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to WikiLeaks.  The leaked documents show that the government has “deliberately maintained vulnerabilities in the most common devices used by hundreds of millions of people,” Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, said in a statement. “Those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world.”  Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a statement that the leaks show “we’re all made less safe by the CIA’s decision to keep – rather than ensure the patching of – vulnerabilities. Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Google ramps up investment in fibre cable, training Africans CEO of Australia's Atlassian says he'll meet seven-day Tesla batteries deadline Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

Lodhi Garden will be covered in the first phase and gradually, it will be implemented at the other parks, important monuments, metro stations and marketplaces under our jurisdiction," the official added. The civic body had earlier invited expressions of interest (EOIs) for establishing and maintaining a mesh Wi-Fi network. However, it later asked the interested parties to assess the feasibility, also to maximise its revenue. While the NDMC had partnered with Tata Docomo in 2014 to provide free Wi-Fi service at the inner and outer circles of Connaught Place, it had joined hands with Airtel-Vodafone joint venture FireFly Networks to provide the facility at Khan Market. However, with the two ambitious projects losing popularity due to poor connectivity, the civic body has now tied up with MTNL for the purpose. "The council is planning to form an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) with a subsidiary of MTNL to offer the Wi-Fi service," the official said. free wi fi Lodhi Garden NDMC First Published: March 8, 2017, 10:05 AM IST Read full article Next Story Recommended For You Anushka Sharma's Style Is Effortlessly Cool, Says Celebrity Stylist Allia Al Rufai SRK's Car Injures a Photographer Outside Alia Bhatt's Residence PM Modi Responds to Ravi Shastri's Witty Tweet Game of Thrones: Sansa Stark to Die in Season 7?

The document dump seemed to confirm even the most paranoid American’s worst nightmare — that the government can spy on you through household devices in your living room and even your pants pocket. The agency also developed a way to hack into smartphones, accessing Apple and Google Android operating systems, to read even messages encrypted through apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. In another frightening scenario, the spy agency as of October 2014 was looking into ways to hack the vehicle control systems of modern cars and trucks, allowing the CIA “to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations,” according to WikiLeaks. The CIA didn’t just craft the hacking tools, it appears to have allowed them to be stolen, according to WikiLeaks. The anti-secrecy group did not allege that the CIA is actively conducting listening operations on Americans using the hacking techniques, but blamed the Obama administration for breaking promises by not reporting the vulnerabilities to high-tech companies so they could fix the problems. “In the wake of Edward Snowden’s leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis — rather than hoard — serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or ‘zero days’ to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers,” WikiLeaks wrote yesterday. “Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities, so can others.” Snowden on Twitter yesterday also warned that “any hacker can use the security hole the CIA left open to break into any iPhone in the world.” President Obama decided in January 2014 that the National Security Agency should turn over information about major flaws in internet security, but also created a major loophole for “a clear national security or law enforcement need,” The New York Times reported at the time. The latest files date from 2013 to 2016 and are dubbed by WikiLeaks as Vault 7. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee yesterday expressed concern and hinted at an investigation. “These appear to be very, very serious,” said California U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes. “We are extremely concerned, and we are following it closely.” Herald wire services contributed to this report.

The alleged cyber-weapons are said to include malware that targets Windows, Android, iOS, OSX and Linux computers as well as internet routers. Some of the software is reported to have been developed in-house, but the UK's MI5 agency is said to have helped build a spyware attack for Samsung TVs. A spokesman for the CIA would not confirm the details. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," he said.A spokesman for the UK Home Office was unable to comment. Wikileaks said that its source had shared the details with it to prompt a debate into whether the CIA's hacking capabilities had exceeded its mandated powers.These latest leaks - which appear to give details of highly sensitive technical methods - will be a huge problem for the CIA. There is the embarrassment factor - that an agency whose job is to steal other people's secrets has not been able to keep their own. Then there will be the fear of a loss of intelligence coverage against their targets who may change their behaviour because they now know what the spies can do. And then there will be the questions over whether the CIA's technical capabilities were too expansive and too secret. Because many of the initial documents point to capabilities targeting consumer devices, the hardest questions may revolve around what is known as the "equities" problem. This is when you find a vulnerability in a piece of technology how do you balance the benefit to the public of telling the manufacturer so they can close it and improve everyone's security with the benefit to the spy agency of leaving it in place so they can exploit it to collect intelligence. The NSA has already faced questions about whether it has this balance right when many of its secrets were revealed by Edward Snowden, and now it may be the CIA's turn. Hacked TVs The effort to compromise Samsung's F8000 range of smart TVs was codenamed Weeping Angel, according to documents dated June 2014. They describe the creation of a "fake-off" mode, designed to fool users into believing that their screens had been switched off. Instead, the documents indicate, infected sets were made to covertly record audio, which would later be transferred over the internet to CIA computer servers once the TVs were fully switched back on, allowing their wi-fi links to re-establish. Under a "future work" section, it is suggested that video snapshots might also be taken and the wi-fi limitation be overcome.Samsung has not commented on the allegations. Apple attacks Wikileaks also claims that as of last year, the CIA has built up an arsenal of 24 Android "zero days" - the term given to previously unknown security flaws in code. Some of these are said to have been discovered by the CIA, but others were allegedly obtained from the UK's GCHQ agency as well as the NSA and unnamed third-parties. Devices made by Samsung, HTC and Sony, among others, were said to have been compromised as a result, allowing the CIA to read messages on Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram and Weibo among other chat services.It is also claimed that a specialised CIA unit was set up to target iPhones and iPads, allowing the agency to see a target's location, activate their device's camera and microphone, and read text communications. The unit is also reported to have made use of further iOS "zero days" obtained from GCHQ, the NSA and FBI. "It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters," GCHQ told the BBC. "Furthermore, all of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate." Other claims say the CIA: --was trying to find ways to infect vehicles' computer control systems. Wikileaks claims these might have been used for undetectable assassinations. --had found ways to infect "air-gapped" computers - machines that are not linked up to the internet or other insecure networks. Methods are said to have included hiding data in images or hidden parts of computer storage. --had developed attacks against popular anti-virus products. --had built up a library of hacking techniques "stolen" from malware developed in Russia and elsewhere. Wikileaks describes its release as the first in a series of planned leaks about the CIA's cyber-activities, which it refers to as Vault 7. It added that the material had already circulated among hackers who used to work for the US government as well as contractors in an unauthorised manner. Analysis: Mark Ward, Technology reporter There is a huge amount of information in the CIA data dump but a lot of it, such as its apparent success in compromising smart TVs, is not that surprising. Lone researchers have managed similar hacks, so smart government agents were always going to be able to go further. Plus, we kind of know that a lot of the modern internet-of-things gear is broken as all kinds of holes have been found in all kinds of gadgets - including cars. What's more interesting is the work said to have been done on iPhone and Android handsets. That's because Apple works hard to make sure iOS is secure and Google has made a real effort lately to secure its operating system. For a spy agency, access to those gadgets is key because they travel everywhere with a target. What is likely to hit the CIA the hardest is losing control of all the zero day exploits and malware detailed in the papers. It is more than likely that the agency paid millions to build up an arsenal of tools that are guaranteed to work - largely because they are based on flaws, bugs and vulnerabilities that have never been seen before. Operating systems of all stripes are really big haystacks and the information in some of the leaks looks like a good map to all the needles hiding within. With the zero days now largely burned the CIA may have to re-trench for a while but it will doubtless have other unused attack tools stored and ready to deploy. What's potentially more worrying is that as information about the bugs gets out then the bad guys will pile in and use them. We saw that with the zero days released in the much smaller Hacking Team data breach, and there is much more useful data to be found in this trove.

It was not immediately clear how WikiLeaks obtained the information, which included more than 8,700 documents and files. The CIA tools, if authentic, could undermine the confidence that consumers have in the safety and security of their computers, mobile devices and even smart TVs. WikiLeaks said the material came from “an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia”. It didn’t say how the files were removed, such as possibly by a rogue employee, by hacking a federal contractor working for the CIA or breaking into a staging server where such hacking tools might be temporarily stored. The more than 8,000 documents cover a host of technical topics, including what appears to be a discussion about how to compromise smart televisions and turn them into improvised surveillance devices. WikiLeaks said the data also include details on the agency’s efforts to subvert American software products and smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Microsoft Windows. The information dump could not immediately be authenticated by The Associated Press, and the CIA declined comment, but WikiLeaks has a long track record of releasing top secret government documents. Experts who’ve started to sift through the material said that it appeared legitimate and that the release was almost certain to shake the CIA. Jonathan Liu, a spokesman for the CIA, said: “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.” WikiLeaks said the archive “appears to have been circulated among former US Government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive”. If the authenticity of the documents is officially confirmed, it would represent yet another catastrophic breach for the US intelligence community at the hands of WikiLeaks and its allies, which have repeatedly humbled Washington with the mass release of classified material, including hundreds of thousands of documents from the State Department and the Pentagon. WikiLeaks, which has been dropping cryptic hints about the release for a month, said in a lengthy statement that the CIA had “recently” lost control of a massive arsenal of CIA hacking tools as well as associated documentation. “There’s no question that there’s a fire drill going on right now,” said Jake Williams, a security expert with Augusta, Georgia-based Rendition Infosec. “It wouldn’t surprise me that there are people changing careers, and ending careers as we speak.” One of the purported CIA malware programmes is described in the WikiLeaks documents as a “simple DLL hijacking attempt” that had been tested against Microsoft Windows XP, Vista and 7 operating systems. The technique, which the document called a “Windows FAX DLL injection”, introduces computer code that allows an attacker to gain access to a computer process’ memory and permissions while at the same time masking the attack. Williams, who has experience dealing with government hackers, said the voluminous files’ extensive references to operation security meant they were almost certainly government-backed. “I can’t fathom anyone fabricated that amount of operational security concern,” he said. “It rings true to me.” “The only people who are having that conversation are people who are engaging in nation-state-level hacking,” he said. WikiLeaks said its data also included a “substantial library” of digital espionage techniques borrowed from other countries, including Russia. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1.

Now antivirus vendors can find out Security researchers are concerned that WikiLeaks may have mislead the public with the CIA document dump Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 08 March, 2017 13:15 - - - - print email Comments Thanks to WikiLeaks, antivirus vendors will soon be able to figure out if you have been hacked by the CIA. On Tuesday, WikiLeaks dumped a trove of 8,700 documents that allegedly detail the CIA’s secret hacking operations, including spying tools designed for mobile phones, PCs and smart TVs. WikiLeaks has redacted the actual source code from the files to prevent the distribution of cyber weapons, it said. Nevertheless, the document dump -- if real -- still exposes some of the techniques that the CIA has allegedly been using. Among those techniques are ways to bypass antivirus software from vendors including Avira, Bitdefender and Comodo, according to some of the leaked documents. The CIA's playbook out in the open The documents even include some snippets of code that antivirus vendors can use to detect whether a hacking attempt may have come from the CIA, said Jake Williams, founder of security company Rendition InfoSec. “In the documents, they (the CIA) mention specific code snippets used in operational tools,” Williams said. Antivirus vendors can use this to look at their customers’ networks for any traces of past intrusions. That might be a big blow to the CIA’s surveillance operations. Now anyone, including foreign governments, can use the WikiLeaks dump to figure out if the CIA ever targeted them, according to Williams. “I would bet my bank account that the hackers of the CIA have spent all day trying to remove their tools from high value networks,” he said. WikiLeaks hasn’t said who supplied the secret documents. But the anonymous source is hoping to spark debate over whether the CIA abused its authority by developing so many hacking tools without public oversight, WikiLeaks said.   "There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons',” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange added in a statement. But some security researchers believe WikiLeaks is trying to mislead the public by exaggerating the CIA's hacking capabilities. “The press is getting taken for a ride today,” said Will Strafach, CEO of Sudo Security Group who studies vulnerabilities in Apple’s iOS. How real are the risks? Although WikiLeaks has said the CIA documents show the agency can hack iPhones and Android smartphones for spying purposes, consumers shouldn’t necessarily be concerned, he said. That’s because the dumped documents mostly mention exploits for iOS that appear to already be publicly known and have been patched. “I have not found anything here that could be a danger to anyone running iOS 10 or above,” Strafach said. Earlier news headlines and a tweet from WikiLeaks on Tuesday also suggested that the CIA hacking tools can bypass the encryption on messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal. But there’s no evidence that the CIA ever cracked the encryption, only that the agency developed exploits and malware to take over devices. “The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption,” tweeted Open Whisper Systems, which developed the encryption used in the apps. Journalists and security researchers are still looking over the dumped documents. But it doesn’t appear the hacking tools equate to mass surveillance, said Robert Graham, CEO of security firm Errata Security.   One hacking tool, code-named Weeping Angel, allegedly involves turning a Samsung smart TV into a monitoring device. But the tool seems to only work if a CIA agent can physically install it on the TV.   “When we look at the tools, they really give off the impression that they are used locally,” Graham said. “That some CIA agent has to walk in. It’s not remote hacking.” Questions over vulnerabilities Still, some privacy advocates are worried by the WikiLeaks document dump. They say it confirms that the U.S. government has known about key vulnerabilities in tech products, but decides to develop hacking tools around them, rather than help vendors patch them. A document in the dump shows that CIA exploits for Apple’s iOS were allegedly purchased from the U.S. National Security Agency, British intelligence or bought from third-party providers.  The key danger is that malicious groups, such as foreign government hackers, might discover the vulnerabilities too -- putting everyday users in harm's way. “As these leaks show, we're all made less safe by the CIA's decision to keep -- rather than ensure the patching of -- vulnerabilities,” wrote Cindy Cohn, executive director of privacy advocate, the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans," she said. But others aren't so sure the document dump really shows that the CIA has been stockpiling information about vulnerabilities. "It is difficult to tell this from the info we have at this point," Ari Schwartz, a former White House senior director for cybersecurity, said in an email. "Questions that I would have are:  Are they really previously unknown?" Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

The anti-secrecy website said the covert hacking program taps into Google’s Android, Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which can be turned into covert microphones. WikiLeaks posted nearly 9,000 documents on Tuesday it said were leaked from the Central Intelligence Agency, in what it described as the largest-ever publication of secret intelligence materials. It said the trove of documents “appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive”. Jonathan Liu, a spokesman for the CIA, said: “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents. Experts who have started to sift through the material said that it appeared legitimate and that the release was almost certain to shake the CIA. The leak, named “Vault 7 by WikiLeaks, claims the CIA developed a malware to infect mobile phones to allow easier surveillance – but lost control of the technology. If the CIA really lost control of the technology, hackers worldwide could use the programme to steal data. Matthew Green, professor of computer science, said hat “ordinary people” should not be worried about the revelations. “What I would perhaps worry about is that some of this might get into the hands of very sophisticated criminal organisations or foreign governments and be used in a very targeted way against activists or human rights workers,” he said. WikiLeaks said the documents show that the CIA is rivalling the National Security Agency (NSA), the US government’s main electronic spying body, in cyber warfare, but with less oversight. WikiLeaks said the documents show the CIA has produced more than 1,000 malware systems – viruses, trojans, and other software that can infiltrate and take control of target electronics. These hacking tools have targeted iPhones, Android systems such as the kind of personal phone reportedly still used by President Donald Trump, popular Microsoft software and Samsung smart TVs, which can be transformed into covert microphones, according to WikiLeaks. The agency has also examined hacking into the electronic control systems on cars and trucks, potentially making it able to control them. By infecting smartphones, WikiLeaks said, the CIA can get around the encryption technologies of popular apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo, and Confide by collecting communications before they are encrypted. – Al Jazeera.

The discussion transcripts showed that CIA hackers could get into iPhones, Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. Cyber security experts disagreed about the extent of the fallout from the data dump, but said a lot would depend on whether WikiLeaks followed through on a threat to publish the actual hacking tools that could do damage. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate. A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in U.S. hacking tools told Reuters the documents included correct “cover” terms describing active cyber programs. WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other U.S. and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other U.S. and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. The files did not indicate the actual encryption of Signal or other secure messaging apps had been compromised. The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest breach in recent years of classified material from U.S. intelligence agencies. Security experts differed over how much the disclosures could damage U.S. cyber espionage. Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection. “This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices ... I haven’t yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices,” said Tarah Wheeler, senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec. Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States. Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicized. In one case, the documents say, U.S. and British personnel, under a program known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. The CIA and White House declined comment. “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,” CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. Google declined to comment on the purported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter. Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U.S. government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end-to-end encryption tools like Signal. Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as “confirmation that what we’re doing is working.” Signal and the like are “pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive, high-risk, extremely targeted attacks.” CIA Cyber Programs The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any U.S. data for counterintelligence purposes. The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: U.S. intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products.

Inside a hacker’s world Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA’s “entire hacking capacity.” The documents only include snippets of computer code, not the full programs that would be needed to conduct cyber exploits. WikiLeaks said it was refraining from disclosing usable code from CIA’s cyber arsenal “until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should be analysed, disarmed and published.” U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia’s security services. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win the presidency. WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies. Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign, often citing hacked emails it published to bolster his attacks on Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks said on Tuesday that the documents showed that the CIA hoarded serious security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public, as called for under a process established by President Barack Obama. Rob Knake, a former official who dealt with the issue under Obama, said he had not seen evidence in what was published to support that conclusion. The process “is not a policy of unilateral disarmament in cyberspace. The mere fact that the CIA may have exploited zero-day [previously undisclosed] vulnerabilities should not surprise anyone,” said Knake, now at the Council on Foreign Relations. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material. In a press release, the group said, “The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.” U.S. intelligence agencies have suffered a series of security breaches, including Snowden’s. In 2010, U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks. Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the secrets in his home. tags Wikileaks CIA Cyber spying Android iPhone more from tech Mobile internet usage up 29% over previous quarter: Report Mar 16, 2017 16:39 IST Coolpad launches Note 5 Lite smartphone in India Mar 16, 2017 16:22 IST Wake up before the next question Partnered feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

The company is rumored to be adding further enhancements to the OS’s “smart features.” The first new feature is reportedly called Copy Less which will somehow eliminate the need to copy a text in one app in order to paste it into another, according to VentureBeat’s source. For example, a user having a chat with a friend talking about where to eat could go to the Yelp app to find a restaurant. When the user switches from the Yelp app back to the chatting app and type “it’s at,” the restaurant’s address will be suggested by the keyboard. One thing that wasn’t made clear about the Copy Less feature is where exactly it’s going to function. It might simply be baked into Google’s Gboard keyboard app, or it might be included in the Android software itself. Google has implemented automated features for the Gboard keyboard app before. One important feature was letting users share contact information using the Gboard app. This was implemented sometime after Apple included the same feature for iOS’s Messages app last year. VentureBeat’s source indicated that Google engineers have been experimenting with how Android functions with certain types of texts in messaging apps. Another feature that might be included in Android O is the ability to recognize addresses in messages. For example, a user might receive an address sent by a friend on a messaging app. When the user taps on the address, Android O will automatically open up Google Maps. However, the source is unsure whether this feature will only be available on Android’s stock messaging app, or it will work across other messaging services. Nevertheless, it's clear that Google is playing catchup with Apple. After all, iOS has had this feature on its Messages app for years now. Lastly, another feature that Google is working on for Android O is added finger gestures to open certain apps or settings. For example, a user can simply draw the letter “C” on a smartphone’s screen in order to open recent contacts. It’s possible that users will have the option to make this feature function for other apps as well. They could draw the letter “C” and it may launch the camera app instead, as pointed out by Droid-Life. Although these new smart features for Android O seems promising, the source says that it’s possible that Google might not include them all.

SHEAR 7:50 PM ET President Trump’s $1.1 trillion spending plan envisions deep cuts to many government programs while leaving entitlements like Social Security untouched.

Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate. A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in U.S. hacking tools told Reuters the documents included correct "cover" terms describing active cyber programmes.   Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other U.S. and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. The files did not indicate the actual encryption of Signal or other secure messaging apps had been compromised.   The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest breach in recent years of classified material from U.S. intelligence agencies. Security experts differed over how much the disclosures could damage U.S. cyber espionage. Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection.   "This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices ... I haven’t yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices," said Tarah Wheeler, senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec.   Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States. Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicized.   In one case, the documents say, U.S. and British personnel, under a programme known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room.   The CIA and White House declined comment. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement.   Google declined to comment on the purported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter.   Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U.S. government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Apple Inc did not respond to a request for comment.

Lightroom Mobile version 2.7 is adding a raw high-dynamic range capture mode to help you achieve effects you were previously only able to get with a DSLR or mirrorless camera. The iPhone 7 Plus’s dual-lens system puts a DSLR-quality camera in your pocket already, and now Lightroom is upping the ante. How it works: Your iPhone captures an HDR image by stitching together two shots, but shooting in Lightroom will capture three raw shots in Adobe’s digital negative format (DNG) and automatically merge them for you. That way you get a full tonal range in low-light situations. See the below video for a full tutorial. You have to shoot on an iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, iPhone SE, or 9.7-inch iPad Pro to use the new HDR mode, because those are the only iOS devices that support DNG files. Adobe also added an Export Original option to Lightroom that lets you export your original files. Lightroom also has new 3D Touch and Notification Centre widgets that let you jump straight into the camera (either front-facing or rear-facing mode) or open the last photo you took. The update is available for free to all Lightroom users now. You don’t need a Creative Cloud membership to shoot or edit in the Lightroom app, though you do need one to sync photos across devices.

Now antivirus vendors can find out CIA-made malware? Now antivirus vendors can find out Security researchers are concerned that WikiLeaks may have mislead the public with the CIA document dump Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 08 March, 2017 13:15 - - - - print email Comments Thanks to WikiLeaks, antivirus vendors will soon be able to figure out if you have been hacked by the CIA. On Tuesday, WikiLeaks dumped a trove of 8,700 documents that allegedly detail the CIA’s secret hacking operations, including spying tools designed for mobile phones, PCs and smart TVs. WikiLeaks has redacted the actual source code from the files to prevent the distribution of cyber weapons, it said. Nevertheless, the document dump -- if real -- still exposes some of the techniques that the CIA has allegedly been using. Among those techniques are ways to bypass antivirus software from vendors including Avira, Bitdefender and Comodo, according to some of the leaked documents. The CIA's playbook out in the open The documents even include some snippets of code that antivirus vendors can use to detect whether a hacking attempt may have come from the CIA, said Jake Williams, founder of security company Rendition InfoSec. “In the documents, they (the CIA) mention specific code snippets used in operational tools,” Williams said. Antivirus vendors can use this to look at their customers’ networks for any traces of past intrusions. That might be a big blow to the CIA’s surveillance operations. Now anyone, including foreign governments, can use the WikiLeaks dump to figure out if the CIA ever targeted them, according to Williams. “I would bet my bank account that the hackers of the CIA have spent all day trying to remove their tools from high value networks,” he said. WikiLeaks hasn’t said who supplied the secret documents. But the anonymous source is hoping to spark debate over whether the CIA abused its authority by developing so many hacking tools without public oversight, WikiLeaks said.   "There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons',” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange added in a statement. But some security researchers believe WikiLeaks is trying to mislead the public by exaggerating the CIA's hacking capabilities. “The press is getting taken for a ride today,” said Will Strafach, CEO of Sudo Security Group who studies vulnerabilities in Apple’s iOS. How real are the risks? Although WikiLeaks has said the CIA documents show the agency can hack iPhones and Android smartphones for spying purposes, consumers shouldn’t necessarily be concerned, he said. That’s because the dumped documents mostly mention exploits for iOS that appear to already be publicly known and have been patched. “I have not found anything here that could be a danger to anyone running iOS 10 or above,” Strafach said. Earlier news headlines and a tweet from WikiLeaks on Tuesday also suggested that the CIA hacking tools can bypass the encryption on messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal. But there’s no evidence that the CIA ever cracked the encryption, only that the agency developed exploits and malware to take over devices. “The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption,” tweeted Open Whisper Systems, which developed the encryption used in the apps. Journalists and security researchers are still looking over the dumped documents. But it doesn’t appear the hacking tools equate to mass surveillance, said Robert Graham, CEO of security firm Errata Security.   One hacking tool, code-named Weeping Angel, allegedly involves turning a Samsung smart TV into a monitoring device. But the tool seems to only work if a CIA agent can physically install it on the TV.   “When we look at the tools, they really give off the impression that they are used locally,” Graham said. “That some CIA agent has to walk in. It’s not remote hacking.” Questions over vulnerabilities Still, some privacy advocates are worried by the WikiLeaks document dump. They say it confirms that the U.S. government has known about key vulnerabilities in tech products, but decides to develop hacking tools around them, rather than help vendors patch them. A document in the dump shows that CIA exploits for Apple’s iOS were allegedly purchased from the U.S. National Security Agency, British intelligence or bought from third-party providers.  The key danger is that malicious groups, such as foreign government hackers, might discover the vulnerabilities too -- putting everyday users in harm's way. “As these leaks show, we're all made less safe by the CIA's decision to keep -- rather than ensure the patching of -- vulnerabilities,” wrote Cindy Cohn, executive director of privacy advocate, the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans," she said. But others aren't so sure the document dump really shows that the CIA has been stockpiling information about vulnerabilities. "It is difficult to tell this from the info we have at this point," Ari Schwartz, a former White House senior director for cybersecurity, said in an email. "Questions that I would have are:  Are they really previously unknown?" ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

This means I have to re-look at the options of acquiring one in Zimbabwe. Except for when I’ve bought GTels from their local office here, I generally avoid buying smartphones locally, especially from the authorised resellers like Econet, Telecel and them. I want to support local business but it’s the prices that don’t make sense. Where in the US, you’d pay $649 for a 16GB iPhone 6s, the price in Zimbabwe is north of $1,000. Almost double. It’s not that they retailers are greedy – it’s taxes and I’m distribution channel overhead. Between a reseller in Harare and Apple in the US are many middle men & governments taking their pound of flesh. advertisement So my plan so far has been to pay for it online on a US retailer’s website, have it delivered to an address there in the US, then wait for someone travelling back to bring it along. Ofcourse there are risk doing this (once I got a faulty device) but by and large benefits are beating costs. Back here at home I just make sure I insure the device, which is, at most, an annual premium of 10% of the phone’s value a year. Here’s a quick comparison of US prices (plus Zim duty and VAT ) vs Zim reseller prices for the iPhone 6s. In the second row are the likely prices of the SE once it’s available in Zimbabwe, based on the 6s percentages.   Apple in the US Econet (iPhone 6, 6s not available)* Solution Centre Zimbabwe iClik Zimbabwe Telecel (iPhone 6, 6s not available)* Via Online + 25% duty & 15% VAT iPhone 6s (16GB) $649 $1,149 $1,099 $1,095 $945 $909 iPhone SE (16GB) $399 $835 $676 $673 $686 $559 *note that the price of the iPhone 6 in the US is $549, even cheaper in some cases on Amazon. Ofcourse I have the option of buying from the classifieds guys, but that has its own headaches – most stressing of all, if they are reselling a second hand phone that was stolen and you have to spend the weekend in jail for being in possession of stolen property. The iPhone SE is not yet available locally but make no mistake, it’ll be priced just as high.  Again, just to be clear, it’s not because the authorised resellers are greedy but that’s just how the distribution is structured. Their margin is likely quite thin because of the stiff competition from the grey imports. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Previous Post « Telecoms regulator, POTRAZ, has NOT banned WhatsApp bundles Next post Mobile money is the most credible solution to Zimbabwean cash crisis » 16 Comments Bee says: April 5, 2016 at 12:38 PM Me too!!!

I got a 64G 6s from the smaller local dealers in Bulawayo for 600 bucks. If you really want a recent phone don’t bother looking for it from the credible guys.

Turns out it had been stolen from an operator. I now always recommend to avoid classifieds type sellers. Reply Shephard says: April 7, 2016 at 10:08 AM Not everyone is a conman we have the GALAXY S7 of which no local operator has it, we source our products from our suppliers outside Zimbabwe Reply L.S.M Kabweza says: April 7, 2016 at 10:18 AM Sorry if it came off as me saying you’re a conman. I have no reason to believe you are. My point was actually that there’s a risk buying from people and small shops in town. I think the problem is actually with the police, who treat the buyer and the shop both as criminals and lock them up ( usually to pressurise until you bribe) while they investigate. Some are ok with the risk of that hassle. I’m not.

Now antivirus vendors can find out Security researchers are concerned that WikiLeaks may have mislead the public with the CIA document dump Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 08 March, 2017 13:15 - - - - print email Comments Thanks to WikiLeaks, antivirus vendors will soon be able to figure out if you have been hacked by the CIA. On Tuesday, WikiLeaks dumped a trove of 8,700 documents that allegedly detail the CIA’s secret hacking operations, including spying tools designed for mobile phones, PCs and smart TVs. WikiLeaks has redacted the actual source code from the files to prevent the distribution of cyber weapons, it said. Nevertheless, the document dump -- if real -- still exposes some of the techniques that the CIA has allegedly been using. Among those techniques are ways to bypass antivirus software from vendors including Avira, Bitdefender and Comodo, according to some of the leaked documents. The CIA's playbook out in the open The documents even include some snippets of code that antivirus vendors can use to detect whether a hacking attempt may have come from the CIA, said Jake Williams, founder of security company Rendition InfoSec. “In the documents, they (the CIA) mention specific code snippets used in operational tools,” Williams said. Antivirus vendors can use this to look at their customers’ networks for any traces of past intrusions. That might be a big blow to the CIA’s surveillance operations. Now anyone, including foreign governments, can use the WikiLeaks dump to figure out if the CIA ever targeted them, according to Williams. “I would bet my bank account that the hackers of the CIA have spent all day trying to remove their tools from high value networks,” he said. WikiLeaks hasn’t said who supplied the secret documents. But the anonymous source is hoping to spark debate over whether the CIA abused its authority by developing so many hacking tools without public oversight, WikiLeaks said.   "There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons',” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange added in a statement. But some security researchers believe WikiLeaks is trying to mislead the public by exaggerating the CIA's hacking capabilities. “The press is getting taken for a ride today,” said Will Strafach, CEO of Sudo Security Group who studies vulnerabilities in Apple’s iOS. How real are the risks? Although WikiLeaks has said the CIA documents show the agency can hack iPhones and Android smartphones for spying purposes, consumers shouldn’t necessarily be concerned, he said. That’s because the dumped documents mostly mention exploits for iOS that appear to already be publicly known and have been patched. “I have not found anything here that could be a danger to anyone running iOS 10 or above,” Strafach said. Earlier news headlines and a tweet from WikiLeaks on Tuesday also suggested that the CIA hacking tools can bypass the encryption on messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal. But there’s no evidence that the CIA ever cracked the encryption, only that the agency developed exploits and malware to take over devices. “The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption,” tweeted Open Whisper Systems, which developed the encryption used in the apps. Journalists and security researchers are still looking over the dumped documents. But it doesn’t appear the hacking tools equate to mass surveillance, said Robert Graham, CEO of security firm Errata Security.   One hacking tool, code-named Weeping Angel, allegedly involves turning a Samsung smart TV into a monitoring device. But the tool seems to only work if a CIA agent can physically install it on the TV.   “When we look at the tools, they really give off the impression that they are used locally,” Graham said. “That some CIA agent has to walk in. It’s not remote hacking.” Questions over vulnerabilities Still, some privacy advocates are worried by the WikiLeaks document dump. They say it confirms that the U.S. government has known about key vulnerabilities in tech products, but decides to develop hacking tools around them, rather than help vendors patch them. A document in the dump shows that CIA exploits for Apple’s iOS were allegedly purchased from the U.S. National Security Agency, British intelligence or bought from third-party providers.  The key danger is that malicious groups, such as foreign government hackers, might discover the vulnerabilities too -- putting everyday users in harm's way. “As these leaks show, we're all made less safe by the CIA's decision to keep -- rather than ensure the patching of -- vulnerabilities,” wrote Cindy Cohn, executive director of privacy advocate, the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans," she said. But others aren't so sure the document dump really shows that the CIA has been stockpiling information about vulnerabilities. "It is difficult to tell this from the info we have at this point," Ari Schwartz, a former White House senior director for cybersecurity, said in an email. "Questions that I would have are:  Are they really previously unknown?" 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Global smartphone profit stood at $53.7 billion, with Apple's iPhone profit accounting for $44.9 billion. Apple held 14.5 percent global smartphone marketshare in 2016, second behind Samsung's 20.8 percent global marketshare. For comparison, Samsung, which posted an $8.3 billion profit, accounted for 14.6 percent of global profits in 2016. The Cupertino company typically dominates global profit share despite not holding a large amount of marketshare in the smartphone segment. In the first quarter of 2015 alone, Apple accounted for 92 percent of global smartphone profit on 20 percent of actual smartphone sales. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2014 Apple captured nearly 90 percent of smartphone profit. Much of Apple's success in late 2014 and early 2015 can be attributed to the popularity of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, sending Android global profit share down to 11.3 percent during the fourth quarter of 2014, down from 29.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. The popularity of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus helped bolster a .5 increase in smartphone shipments year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2016, edging Samsung to make Apple the world's top smartphone maker in the quarter.

This is about profits and percentages of said profits. The resale value of used iPhones and Galaxies have nothing to do with those profits. In fact, each sale of one of those "used iPhone keeps an unbelievable value" actually takes profit away from Apple.:eek: Apple never discounts phones at mid life? Uh, that's not true. Outside of the debut period, iPhones can be found discounted as low as BOGO (buy one get one) pricing through multiple carriers. I think AT&T is still running that promo now. Speaking of AT&T, they're one of Apple's biggest customers. Not you and me. The vast majority of Apple's iPhone profit comes from their primary customers: telcos, big box retailers, etc. For the most part, Apple doesn't get paid when you go into a store to buy a phone. Apple was paid long ago when that phone was put on a boat, truck, or plane and shipped to their customers.

Some people resell their phones. Just as many people pass their phones down to family members, friends, etc. Apple's profit margins are a non-issue because Apple charges what the market will bare. Period. As long as their pricing is acceptable to the market why would they charge any less? It's a for profit, public company with a fiduciary responsibility to it's shareholders. Nothing more, nothing less. Where are you going with this and what does it have to do with iPhones? Round in circles and nothing. This guy has never had any Apple product go wrong.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Friday March 17, 2017 News World Larger / SmallerNight Mode WikiLeaks delivers again for Trump with dump of CIA secrets Paul McGeough 8 Mar 2017, 3:11 p.m. The release of almost 9000 CIA documents will be viewed through political as much as national security prisms. Donald Trump has a new stick with which to beat the US intelligence agencies - not only can they not keep his secrets, they can't keep their own. Lobbing amidst the worst stand-off ever between a new president and the agencies, Tuesday's sensational WikiLeaks dump of thousands of documents on the CIA's highly secretive, high-tech cyber arsenal reveals how the agency steals data from foreign targets by taking control of their mobile phones, computers and televisions. Seemingly legitimate, the release of almost 9000 documents will be viewed through political as much as national security prisms. WikiLeaks, increasingly denounced as a tool of Moscow, is a key player in the months-long dispute in which Trump has mocked and ridiculed the agencies. But as commander-in-chief Trump is required to address the document dump as the most embarrassing breach of national security since Edward Snowden leaked a mountain of classified documents in 2013 and, before that, Chelsea Manning leaked about three-quarters of a million classified and other sensitive documents in 2010 . The White House, the Pentagon and the CIA were caught off guard by a WikiLeaks statement that it was about to upload the documents, which it has codenamed Vault 7. Acutely embarrassed, the only response from the CIA was a terse: "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents." Apparently the first in a series, WikiLeaks said that the 8761 documents, which were dated from 2013 to 2016, came from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Centre for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. Describing their contents as "malware, viruses, Trojans and weaponised 'zero day' exploits", WikiLeaks said the files developed by a CIA unit known as the Engineering Development Group, were designed to harness vulnerabilities in Apple's iPhone, Google's Android software and Samsung TV sets. WikiLeaks said the exploits were capable of bypassing popular encryption-enabled applications like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. "At first glance [the files are] probably legitimate or contains a lot of legitimate stuff, which means somebody managed to extract a lot of data from a classified CIA system and is willing to let the world know that," Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, told The Washington Post. Trump has been infuriated by a torrent of leaks from across government, but especially from within the intelligence agencies on investigations into links between himself and his election campaign team with Russia. In July 2016 WikiLeaks became a controversial player in the US presidential election when it released 20,000 embarrassing emails that had been hacked from Democratic Party computers, creating uproar on the campaign trail. Speaking at the time from Ecuador's embassy in London, where he has taken refuge for years, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange denied early suspicion that the Russian government or its agents were responsible for the DNC (Democratic National Committee) hacking - but the combined US intelligence agencies concluded that the hacking was part of a multi-pronged Kremlin plot to help Trump win the election and to discredit US democracy. Trump celebrated the leaks, declaring "I love WikiLeaks" as he read from a sheaf of the Democratic emails at a rally in the last weeks of the campaign. For months he refused to accept that Russia was involved - even as he jokingly urged Moscow to mount a search for thousands of Hillary Clinton emails that had been processed through her controversial private email server when she was US secretary of state. On the campaign trail and in office Trump has been repeatedly wrong-footed by leaks on his Russian connections and those of his associates. He was forced to sack campaign manager Paul Manafort after allegations that he had received millions of dollars from pro-Moscow politicians in Ukraine. In February he sacked his national security adviser Michael Flynn after he was revealed to have lied about his dealings with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. And last week Attorney-General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from any Justice Department deliberations on intelligence agency and congressional investigations of the Russian links because Sessions had failed to disclose that he too had met the ambassador. During a candidates' debate in October, just days after the intelligence agencies' declaration that the Democratic hack was the work of Moscow, Trump pushed back: "They like to say the Russians did it. They think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia." As the scope of a multi-agency investigation into aspects of Trump's Russia connections became known, president-elect Trump became sharply critical of the agencies - mocking their failures in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and dismissing the need for himself to have a daily intelligence briefing on the grounds that he was "a smart person". The leaks have continued, including indications that the FBI is increasingly confident about the veracity of aspects of a dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent, which alleges that Russia had been "assisting Trump for at least five years" and that the Kremlin had recorded a so-called sex tape during Trump's 2013 visit to Moscow which it would use to compromise him as president of the US. Within days of Trump's inauguration there were reports that the agencies were withholding sensitive information because Trump was not to be trusted and might disclose it to Moscow - and in what read as a Trump threat to all the agencies, The New York Times reported that he had enlisted a billionaire buddy with no intelligence experience to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the agencies. Trump's war with the agencies became more fraught on the weekend when senior former and current officials rejected his tweeted claim that former president Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower during the election campaign - which apparently was based on reports from Trump-loyal conservative media outlets. And on Tuesday, after days of blanket denials, the White House seemed to be walking back the President's unequivocal assertion that Obama had issued such an order. When he was asked for the proof that Trump claimed he had of Obama's "order", presidential spokesman Sean Spicer said it wasn't a question of proof as a need for a congressional investigation. The story WikiLeaks delivers again for Trump with dump of CIA secrets first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Memoirs by the former president and first lady will be handled by the Crown Publishing Group. Photo: ZACH GIBSON, AFP/Getty Images Business News Roundup, March 8 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Nvidia’s new AI processor Nvidia hopes to push its presence further into robots, drones and other smart devices by introducing a credit card size graphics processor that handles artificial intelligence technology. The Jetson TX2 is a faster, more energy-efficient version of the Santa Clara chipmaker’s previous artificial intelligence processor, released in 2015. Nvidia wants to reach developers who are creating commercial robotics and smart-city applications like parking and navigation. Its $599 developers kit will ship March 14. Publishing Obamas both get book deals Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama will have their memoirs published by Crown Publishing Group. Crown’s parent company, Penguin Random House, made the announcement Tuesday. Terms of the agreement for the books — the rights for which were acquired last week — were not disclosed. The deal is rumored to be worth $65 million. No publication dates were announced. Crown published President Obama’s best-sellers “Dreams From My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope,” and Mrs. Obama’s 2012 book, “American Grown,” about the White House kitchen garden. “They will write deeply inspiring and illuminating books that draw upon their rich personal experience and dedicated public service,” Crown Publisher Maya Mavjee said in a statement. “Each publication will be a historic event.” Video Streaming just for kids A new streaming service for kids will have episodes of classic cartoons like “Scooby Doo,” “The Flintstones” and “The Jetsons” as well as original series. Time Warner’s Boomerang service joins a crowded market of online subscription video for kids. Netflix and Amazon Prime have kids sections, Nickelodeon’s Noggin streaming app is designed for preschoolers and “Sesame Street” is available from HBO. The Boomerang service will initially work only on Apple and Android phones and tablets and on computers. The cost is $5 a month. It will eventually be available for TVs through streaming gadgets like Apple TV and Roku. The service begins in a few months. The app draws from the same libraries as the Boomerang TV channel, but its videos won’t match the network’s lineup. The app isn’t part of a cable subscription like popular TV apps such as HBO Go or WatchESPN. Instead, it’s like CBS All Access, an app version of CBS, which starts at $6 a month. Acquisitions HP Enterprise buys Nimble Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed to buy Nimble Storage in a deal valued at about $1 billion, bolstering a higher-growth segment of the market for data storage. The $12.50-per-share offer for San Jose’s Nimble was 45 percent more than Monday’s closing price. Hewlett Packard Enterprise said Tuesday it also will assume about $200 million of Nimble’s unvested equity awards at the closing of the deal. CEO Meg Whitman — looking for ways to return to sales growth — is spending more on acquisitions after a multiyear effort to slim down the Palo Alto company. She had already announced three purchases this year, and the deal for Nimble will extend Hewlett Packard’s reach into flash-storage data, which uses memory chips that are much faster than traditional hard disk-based storage. The market for flash storage was estimated to be about $15 billion in 2016 and will grow to $20 billion by 2020, according to projections from International Data Corp. Nimble was founded in 2007, went public in December 2013 and has about 1,300 employees. Stocks Snap shares stumble again Snap’s stock market debut last week was celebrated as its price surged in its first two days. But analysts remain skeptical about the company’s value. Snap shares opened at $28.17 Monday, up about 4 percent from their Friday closing price and up 66 percent from the $17 IPO price. But Tuesday, they closed at $21.44. That’s below Snap’s initial trading price of $24 but still well above what several Wall Street analysts believe Snap shares are worth. Most set a target price between $10 and $23. “It’s overvalued,” Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, a financial analysis firm, said Monday. “That’s the simple answer.” Chronicle Staff and News Services Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

RocketNews24 Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese TOP » Japan » Osaka driving school offers nine months of free food and drink to students Featured Weird Studio Ghibli Jobs Osaka driving school offers nine months of free food and drink to students Master Blaster Mar 8, 2017 Tweet Come for the Drivers’ Ed, stay for the unlimited nine-month long buffet! With the declining birth rate and generally stellar public transportation systems, fewer than ever young Japanese people are seeking driver’s licenses. This means that driving schools have been feeling the pinch in recent years with enrollment steadily decreasing. In these economically dire times, schools have to dig deep and come up with a way to entice potential students for their own survival, and arguably none have come up with a better idea to date than Minoo Driving School in Osaka. Their website advertises an all-you-can-eat menu featuring various pasta, rice dishes, and sandwiches for its students. But that is not all: This buffet is available for up to nine months! By simply showing a proof of enrollment, you can conceivably eat there all day, every day for absolutely no extra charge for three-quarters of a year. The only downside appears to be that the menu is somewhat limited for those planning on using the driving school as their primary source of food for such a long time. However, the school is also said to offer special events like a cake buffet twice a month to liven things up. ▼ MENU: Curry Rice; Shrimp Pilaf; Dry Curry Rice; Carbonara; Japanese-style Mushroom Pasta; Spaghetti & Meat Sauce; Spaghetti & Tuna Cream; Toast; Sandwich; Toasted Sandwich; Coffee (hot or iced); Lemon Tea (hot or iced); Latte (hot or iced); Iced Cocoa; Iced Milk; Coca Cola; Mixed Juice; Orange Juice; Grapefruit Juice; Apple Fanta; Calpis Image: Minoo Driving School Kudos to them for boldly selecting “apple” as the only flavor of Fanta available. The offer has already been well-received by university students who joined Minoo. “As someone attending school out of town,” says third-year uni student Tatsuki, “I really appreciate it. I can save a lot of money this way and sometimes I eat there several times a day.” People online are also intrigued and impressed by this bold offering from a driving school and made the following comments: “That’s awesome.” “If you eat there every day for nine months, wouldn’t you be able to break even with the savings on food?” “No melon soda?!” “No beer?! Oh yeah, I forgot what this place is…never mind.” Someone also pointed out that nearby Toyonaka Driving College is offering a Manga Corner featuring an all-you-can-read selection of titles from Sailor Moon to Baki the Grappler, including series both obvious and ironic such as Initial D and Yowamushi Pedal respectively. Image: Toyonaka Driving College Still, nothing appeals to our primal cores quite like the offer of free food. A manga library is cool and all, but I feel quite compelled to join Minoo Driving School even though the only reason I would need a car…would be to drive to Minoo Driving School for the next eight months.

My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!

Code-named "Vault 7" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. The first full part of the series, "Year Zero," comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election. Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. - Advertisement - "Year Zero" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of "zero day" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones. Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force -- its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities. By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5,000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other "weaponized" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its "own NSA" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons. - Advertisement - Once a single cyber "weapon" is "loose" it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor, stated that "There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons,' which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of "Year Zero" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective." Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the "Year Zero" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of "armed" cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such "weapons" should [be] analyzed, disarmed and published. Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in "Year Zero" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in "Vault 7" part one ("Year Zero") already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks. Analysis CIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVs CIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA's DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA (see this organizational chart of the CIA for more details). The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide. - Advertisement - The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984, but "Weeping Angel," developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization. The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone. Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote "zero days" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. A similar unit targets Google's Android which is used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year. "Year Zero" shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 "weaponized" Android "zero days" which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors. These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the "smart" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. CIA malware targets Windows, OSx, Linux, routers The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware. This includes multiple local and remote weaponized "zero days", air gap jumping viruses such as "Hammer Drill" which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs, infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to hide data in images or in covert disk areas ("Brutal Kangaroo") and to keep its malware infestations going. Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as "Assassin" and "Medusa." Attacks against Internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by the CIA's Network Devices Branch (NDB). The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such as EDB's "HIVE" and the related "Cutthroat" and "Swindle" tools, which are described in the examples section below. CIA 'hoarded' vulnerabilities ("zero days") In the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis -- rather than hoard -- serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or "zero days" to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers. Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others. The U.S. government's commitment to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerabilities. The government stated that it would disclose all pervasive vulnerabilities discovered after 2010 on an ongoing basis. "Year Zero" documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals. As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in "Year Zero" is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts. The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities ("zero days") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable. The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable. "Cyberwar" programs are a serious proliferation risk Cyber "weapons" are not possible to keep under effective control.While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber "weapons," once developed, are very hard to retain. Cyber "weapons" are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost. Securing such "weapons" is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without leaving traces -- sometimes by using the very same "weapons" against the organizations that contain them. There are substantial price incentives for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is a global "vulnerability market" that will pay hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for copies of such "weapons." Similarly, contractors and companies who obtain such "weapons" sometimes use them for their own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling "hacking" services. Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector, which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and their contractors, such as Booz Allan Hamilton, has been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers. A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in separate incidents. Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified information. The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000 gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code for numerous hacking tools. Once a single cyber "weapon" is "loose" it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by peer states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a covert CIA hacker base In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate ("Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe" or CCIE) are given diplomatic ("black") passports and State Department cover. The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany's counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential: "Breeze through German Customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport." Your Cover Story (for this trip) Q: Why are you here? A: Supporting technical consultations at the Consulate. Two earlier WikiLeaks publications give further detail on CIA approaches to customs and secondary screening procedures. Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border area -- including France, Italy and Switzerland. A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity. These attack methods are able to penetrate high security networks that are disconnected from the internet, such as police record database. In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media. For example, the CIA attack system Fine Dining, provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2, 2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos). But while the decoy application is on the screen, the underlaying system is automatically infected and ransacked. How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of "Vault 7" -- the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems -- the agency has little legal recourse. The CIA made these systems unclassified. Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the "battlefield" of cyber "war." To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command & Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber "arms" manufactures and computer hackers can freely "pirate" these "weapons" if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets. Conventional weapons such as missiles may be fired at the enemy (i.e., into an unsecured area). Proximity to or impact with the target detonates the ordnance including its classified parts. Hence military personnel do not violate classification rules by firing ordnance with classified parts. Ordnance will likely explode. If it does not, that is not the operator's intent. Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams. For instance, attempted "malware injections" (commercial jargon) or "implant drops" (NSA jargon) are being called "fires" as if a weapon was being fired. However the analogy is questionable. Unlike bullets, bombs or missiles, most CIA malware is designed to live for days or even years after it has reached its "target." CIA malware does not "explode on impact" but rather permanently infests its target. In order to infect target's device, copies of the malware must be placed on the target's devices, giving physical possession of the malware to the target. To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command & Control (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers. But such servers are typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command and control systems are also made unclassified. A successful "attack" on a target's computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization's leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system. If there is a military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against the target's territory including observation, infiltration, occupation and exploitation. Evading forensics and anti-virus A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks. "Tradecraft DO's and DON'Ts" contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the "CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies" in "forensic review." Similar secret standards cover the use of encryption to hide CIA hacker and malware communication (pdf), describing targets & exfiltrated data (pdf) as well as executing payloads (pdf) and persisting (pdf) in the target's machines over time. CIA hackers developed successful attacks against most well known anti-virus programs. These are documented in AV defeats, Personal Security Products, Detecting and defeating PSPs and PSP/Debugger/RE Avoidance. For example, Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window's "Recycle Bin". While Comodo 6.x has a "Gaping Hole of DOOM". CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's "Equation Group" hackers did wrong and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid similar exposure. Examples The CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by "Year Zero") each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools. The majority of these projects relate to tools that are used for penetration, infestation ("implanting"), control, and exfiltration. Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs. Some example projects are described below, but see the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks' "Year Zero." UMBRAGE The CIA's hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency. Each technique it has created forms a "fingerprint" that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity. This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find likely attribution. The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques "stolen" from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the "fingerprints" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from. UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques. Fine Dining Fine Dining comes with a standardized questionnaire i.e., menu that CIA case officers fill out. The questionnaire is used by the agency's OSB (Operational Support Branch) to transform the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks (typically "exfiltrating" information from computer systems) for specific operations. The questionnaire allows the OSB to identify how to adapt existing tools for the operation, and communicate this to CIA malware configuration staff. The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff. Among the list of possible targets of the collection are "Asset," "Liason Asset," "System Administrator," "Foreign Information Operations," "Foreign Intelligence Agencies" and "Foreign Government Entities." Notably absent is any reference to extremists or transnational criminals. The "Case Officer" is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer, operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types. The "menu" also asks for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long unobserved access to the computer can be maintained. This information is used by the CIA's "JQJIMPROVISE" software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation. Improvise (JQJIMPROVISE) "Improvise" is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux (DanceFloor). Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from "Fine Dining" questionairies. HIVE HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software. The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants. The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains. Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. The public-facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a "Blot" server that handles actual connection requests from clients. It is set up for optional SSL client authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the connection is forwarded to the "Honeycomb" toolserver that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website. The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant. Similar functionality (though limited to Windows) is provided by the RickBobby project. See the classified user and developer guides for HIVE. Frequently Asked Questions Why now? WikiLeaks published as soon as its verification and analysis were ready. In Febuary the Trump administration has issued an Executive Order calling for a "Cyberwar" review to be prepared within 30 days. While the review increases the timeliness and relevance of the publication it did not play a role in setting the publication date. Redactions Names, email addresses and external IP addresses have been redacted in the released pages (70,875 redactions in total) until further analysis is complete. 1. Over-redaction: Some items may have been redacted that are not employees, contractors, targets or otherwise related to the agency, but are, for example, authors of documentation for otherwise public projects that are used by the agency. 2. Identity vs. person: the redacted names are replaced by user IDs (numbers) to allow readers to assign multiple pages to a single author. Given the redaction process used a single person may be represented by more than one assigned identifier but no identifier refers to more than one real person. 3. Archive attachments (zip, tar.gz, ...) are replaced with a PDF listing all the file names in the archive. As the archive content is assessed it may be made available; until then the archive is redacted. 4. Attachments with other binary content are replaced by a hex dump of the content to prevent accidental invocation of binaries that may have been infected with weaponized CIA malware. As the content is assessed it may be made available; until then the content is redacted. 5. The tens of thousands of routable IP addresses references (including more than 22 thousand within the United States) that correspond to possible targets, CIA covert listening post servers, intermediary and test systems, are redacted for further exclusive investigation. 6. Binary files of non-public origin are only available as dumps to prevent accidental invocation of CIA malware infected binaries. Organizational Chart The organizational chart corresponds to the material published by WikiLeaks so far. Since the organizational structure of the CIA below the level of Directorates is not public, the placement of the EDG and its branches within the org chart of the agency is reconstructed from information contained in the documents released so far. It is intended to be used as a rough outline of the internal organization; please be aware that the reconstructed org chart is incomplete and that internal reorganizations occur frequently. Wiki pages "Year Zero" contains 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments from the internal development groupware. The software used for this purpose is called Confluence, a proprietary software from Atlassian. Webpages in this system (like in Wikipedia) have a version history that can provide interesting insights on how a document evolved over time; the 7,818 documents include these page histories for 1,136 latest versions. The order of named pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). Page content is not present if it was originally dynamically created by the Confluence software (as indicated on the re-constructed page). What time period is covered? The years 2013 to 2016. The sort order of the pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). WikiLeaks has obtained the CIA's creation/last modification date for each page but these do not yet appear for technical reasons. Usually the date can be discerned or approximated from the content and the page order. If it is critical to know the exact time/date contact WikiLeaks. What is "Vault 7"? "Vault 7" is a substantial collection of material about CIA activities obtained by WikiLeaks. When was each part of "Vault 7" obtained? Part one was obtained recently and covers through 2016. Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. Is each part of "Vault 7" from a different source? Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. What is the total size of "Vault 7"? The series is the largest intelligence publication in history. How did WikiLeaks obtain each part of "Vault 7"? Sources trust WikiLeaks to not reveal information that might help identify them. Isn't WikiLeaks worried that the CIA will act against its staff to stop the series? No. That would be certainly counter-productive. Has WikiLeaks already "mined" all the best stories? No. WikiLeaks has intentionally not written up hundreds of impactful stories to encourage others to find them and so create expertise in the area for subsequent parts in the series. They're there. Look. Those who demonstrate journalistic excellence may be considered for early access to future parts. Won't other journalists find all the best stories before me? Unlikely. There are very considerably more stories than there are journalists or academics who are in a position to write them.   - Advertisement - 4   3   2   View Ratings | Rate It Go To Commenting /* The Petition Site */ The views expressed in this article are the sole responsibility of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of this website or its editors.

The new mockup comes courtesy of AlHasan Husni and shows what Apple’s rumored iPhone 8 could look like when it’s introduced later this year, including the rumored function area, smaller bezels, and more. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The most notable design change comes with the smaller bezels. On the sides of the device, this mockup shows seemingly no bezel, with the screen curving ever-so-slightly, similar to that of previous and future Samsung devices. Along the top of the device is a much smaller bezel that still houses the earpiece. What’s really interesting, however, is at the bottom of the device. As you can see, there mockup shows a new “virtual Home bar with haptic feedback.” This aspect of the image seems to be based on the function area that KGI had previously reported, which replaces the Home button altogether. Today’s mockup depicts the function area as a black bar at the bottom of the screen while the device is unlocked. While, when the device is on the lock screen, the function area houses the “Unlock with Touch ID” prompt.” As for software, this mockup depicts what the often-rumored dark mode could look like in apps such as Instagram, Settings, Music, and Control Center. There are also some tweaks to Control Center in general, though the overall appearance of iOS is the same. These mockups show an iPhone 8 that looks very similar to the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 that has been leaked numerous times over recent weeks. The iPhone 8 is expected to be announced later this year, though its release may be pushed back slightly compared to the release schedules of previous iPhone models. The device is expected to feature an all-glass design and a larger 5.8-inch display. Though, as today’s mockup shows, some of that new display real estate is expected to be taken up by the new function area. What do you think of today’s new mockups? Let us know down in the comments and keep in mind that these are mockups and nothing more. What Apple introduces officially could be entirely different.

It claims this will represent the largest dump of confidential documents on the agency in history. The first full part of the series dropped Tuesday. Called “Year Zero”, this release yields 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network inside CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. If it proves to be authentic, then it paints an intimate picture of America’s cyber-espionage efforts. Wikileaks said in its press release that Year Zero introduces the scope and direction of the CIA’s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of zero-day weaponized exploits against a wide range of US and European company products, include Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are apparently turned into covert microphones. By the end of 2016, the CIA’s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency’s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other ‘weaponized’ malware. Such is the scale of the CIA’s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its ‘own NSA’ with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More The CIA hadn’t yet confirmed or denied the information at the time of publication, but WikiLeaks does have a long track record of releasing top-secret government documents. WikiLeaks made the following claims from Twitter: For example: So far, experts who have had a look say the document dump looks authentic. One is Dave Kennedy, CEO and founder at TrustedSec, an information security consultancy based near Cleveland, Ohio: This looks to be tons of code, lots of capability overviews and tactics. This is the largest intelligence dump I think I’ve ever seen and it appears to be largely legitimate. Kennedy said the documents show that the CIA hasn’t cracked strong-grade encryption, but that it has made a concerted effort to go after endpoints and mobile devices in order to circumvent encryption and eavesdrop on communications. It also shows a number of methods for how they deployed implants, went after security technology and more. It appears they had vast methods for getting around the top security products out there to evade detection including more targeted approaches to EMET and more direct exploits. We’ll update this story as details continue to unfold.

Mar 08, 2017 Share Tweet Image via Getty/Saul Loeb On Tuesday, WikiLeaks published thousands of new documents allegedly obtained from the Central Intelligence Agency. And if the documents are legitimate, they prove the U.S. government has taken advantage of common technology to spy on users of consumer electronics. Dubbed “Year  Zero,” the trove of data is said to expose the CIA’s hacking tools used to break into phones, computers, and smart TVs. WikiLeaks and announced the leak is the first part of a new series called “Vault 7,” which will be “the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the [CIA].” Related This Wikileaks Movie Is Gonna Be Crazy Republicans Like Putin, Russia, and WikiLeaks a Lot More After Trump's Election Win Senators Call for Bipartisan Investigation of Russia's Election Interference, Which Trump Denies “Year Zero” consists of 8,761 documents and files that were reportedly taken from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence network. The bulk of the information focuses on the intelligence agency’s shady methods to bypass encryption used to prevent hacking and spying. For example, the documents claim a CIA-developed program called “Weeping Angel” allows the government to infest Samsung’s F8000 smart TVs and use the command microphone to listen to conversations. The program allegedly employs the “fake-off” mode, which fools the user into believing the device is off when, in fact, the microphone is still on. Unbeknownst to the user, the conversations could then be recorded and sent to a covert CIA server. The documents also claim the CIA’s malware has targeted some of the most popular tech products in the country, including Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android, and Microsoft Windows. via WikiLeaks dump on CIA: #NeverwatchTV pic.twitter.com/XbTYVf0LQI — Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) March 7, 2017 As expected, WikiLeaks has provided very little details about its source: Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. According to the Associated Press, the CIA and the director of national intelligence have declined to comment on the leaks; however, Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, told reporters he was “extremely concerned” about the documents, and has asked the intelligence community for more information. Some have expressed their suspicion about the timing of the leak. Experts have suggested the documents were published to distract the country from the controversy surrounding Donald Trump’s relationship with Russia and the intelligence community. .@drbvaler, cyber security expert, on #Vault7. A succinct and reasonable summary: pic.twitter.com/hb3eP1lVxr — John Haltiwanger (@jchaltiwanger) March 7, 2017 It’s also important to point out that some U.S. officials have criticized WikiLeaks for working with the Russian intelligence to give Trump the upper hand in the 2016 election. Though there is no solid evidence that Trump colluded with Russian officials during the race, there are suspicions that Russia provided WikiLeaks with the hacked emails from the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta. Trump continuously praised the hacks and encouraged WikiLeaks to reveal more.

The secretive organisation said the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency used the phone's geolocation software to tap into vehicle control systems in modern cars. The hacking organisation made the statement as it announced a huge release of confidential documents from the CIA as part of its mysterious Year Zero series, founder Julian Assange claimed. It claims the CIA has been carrying out a global covert hacking program that exploits US and European companies. It claims these include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which it says "are turned into covert microphones." Mr Assange was set to speak about Year Zero on Facebook today, but a livestream of the event was reportedly hacked. It is not clear when the event has been rescheduled to.

(Photo: Getty) The group said that from October 2014 the CIA was "looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks" to possibly enable them to "engage in nearly undetectable assassinations." They added: "The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones."

They claimed: "Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone." (Photo: REUTERS) (Photo: androidcentral) They said the CIA could then "bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the "smart" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied." In an online statement on its website, Wikileaks also claims the attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the UK's domestic intelligence agency MI5/BTSS. Cyber criminal behind £1million David Beckham blackmail plot is on the run and fears being POISONED It claims "Weeping Angel", developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones. The organisation added: "After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. "In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a covert CIA server." WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (Photo: PA) Microsoft Windows 10 (Photo: PA) Have your say on this storyComment Below They also claimed the CIA also runs "a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware, infecting CDs, DVDs and USB sticks. The hacking group said the publication release as part of Year Zero is from 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence. Wikileaks said: "Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. "This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA.

Wikileaks claimed the attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the UK's domestic intelligence agency MI5 (Photo: Samsung) "By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other "weaponized" malware. "Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. "The CIA had created, in effect, its "own NSA" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified."

In the same year, the Swedish Director of Public Prosecution opened an investigation into sexual offences Assange is alleged to have committed. In 2012, facing extradition to Sweden, he took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London after being granted political asylum. In August 2014, he announced he would be leaving the embassy "soon".

However, the brand is clearly working on a top of the line device of its own, judging by the number of leaks we've seen regarding a Nokia 8. And now we may know when to expect this to hit the market. According to a new rumor out of China, Nokia will release its flagship smartphone in June. This will come in two different sizes (thus emulating Apple's, Samsung's, and Google's strategies), with similar (if not identical) specs. Both will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, and both should get either 4 or 6GB of RAM depending on which model you buy. Nokia 6 As for build materials, expect to see metal unibodies. Dual rear cameras should be on the back of at least one of the handsets, even though we won't see PureView or Carl Zeiss branding on them. The former can't be used because of Microsoft, while on the latter Nokia Mobile itself tweeted that it's out of the question. Obviously this doesn't mean the cameras won't be good, but we do admit missing both of those brands in the past few years. Anyway, the new flagship Nokias should apparently have snappers with at least 23 MP resolution. Being the top of the line models that they will be, you'd assume they'll also be quite expensive - and it turns out that's just the case. The rumors in China claim the smaller one will go for CNY 4,000 or more (that's currently $579 or 549), while the bigger one will retail for at least CNY 4,500 ($652 or 617). Don't forget to take all of this with a grain of salt, since it's just an unconfirmed rumor for now. That said, the mentioned release timeline makes sense considering that Samsung is probably hoarding SD835 chipsets in the initial production run, which means other companies will only be able to launch products powered by that from late May to early June. This is in fact the exact release window for the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, another SD835-powered phone, and so it makes sense for the Nokia 8 (or whatever it will be called) to be out at around the same time.

In fact, all the devices launched there -- the Nokia 5, Nokia 3 and Nokia 3310 are placed below the Nokia 6, which is already selling like nuts in China. Also Read: Nokia 5, Nokia 3 and Nokia 6 to be made in India, launch in June: Report But that didn't kill the flagship Nokia is at works with, at least in the rumour mill. A new leak out of China's mydrivers and reported by gsmarena, claims that Nokia is working on a Snapdragon 835 based top end device -- known as Nokia 8 till now -- and that it will be launched sometime in June this year. Most of the Snapdragon 835 based smartphones rumoured since last year has been pushed to the second half of this year. Reason? Samsung bagged the chipset production and decided to keep all of the initial yields for its upcoming Galaxy S8 flagships, eliminating the competition. Sony Xperia XZ Premium, Xiaomi Mi 6, ZTE Gigabit, Microsoft Surface Phone are all Snapdragon 835 based smartphones that saw a delay in launch. Nokia 8 could be one of them. Similar to how Samsung and Apple have been launching their flagships in two different screen sizes and slight variants in hardware, Nokia 8 will also come in two variants, claims the leak. They will be powered by Qualcomm's top-end chipset Snapdragon 835 with 4GB and 6GB RAM respectively. The price of both the smartphones are also guessed to be CNY 4,000 or more (around Rs 38,700) and CNY 4,500 (around Rs 43,500). Also Read: Xiaomi Mi 6 to launch on April 16, take on Galaxy S8 with Snapdragon 835, curved display Cameras will be a major focus on these devices, as reported earlier as well. Nokia 8 is said to have a 23-megapixel rear camera, but the latest development has it that the optics from will not be from Carl-Zeiss or PureView. The cameras though will not be puny. Rather, they could be what Sony has used on the Xperia XZ (or the XZ premium?) for they too have a 23-megapixel sensor. The bigger size variant is expected to have a dual camera. Like Nokia's recently launched smartphones, Nokia 8 would come with Android Nougat 7.0 pre-loaded. It will have a metal unibody design as most leaked images have shown us. The phone might come to India late this year.

It alleges that CIA infested and collected intelligence through smart TVs, and phone. Code-named "Vault 7" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest-ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. It is a substantial collection of material about CIA activities obtained by WikiLeaks. Part one was obtained recently and covers through 2016. Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication, it said. WikiLeaks: How CIA hacks your Smart TV & Smartphone WikiLeaks says: The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984, but 'Weeping Angel;, developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch, which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization. The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone. In a statement, WikiLeaks said the first full part of the series, "Year Zero", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential elections. WikiLeaks said recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. "This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. "The archive appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive," it said in a statement. "There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. "But the significance of 'Year Zero' goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective," said Julian Assange, editor of WikiLeaks. In its analysis of the document, WikiLeaks said CIA malware and hacking tools are built by Engineering Development Group, a software development group within Center for Cyber Intelligence, a department belonging to the CIA's Directorate for Digital Innovation -- one of the five major directorates of the CIA. WikiLeaks alleged that as of October 2014, the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. "The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations," it said. Further, CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone, it claimed. CIA also developed malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote "zero days" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. WikiLeaks alleged that 'Year Zero' documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals. In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the US consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa, it alleged. WikiLeaks alleged that "Weeping Angel", developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones. The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the UK's MI5/BTSS. After infestation, "Weeping Angel" places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode, the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server.

Pushing buttons Nokia and BlackBerry should stay where they belong – in the past Peter Nowak: Despite what Elon Musk says, don’t count hydrogen fuel cells out just yet Five do’s and don’ts for Apple’s next iPhone When anthropologists in the apocalyptic wasteland of the near future look back to try and explain how society began its unravelling, they’ll probably focus on the obvious culprits: unhinged world leaders, ideological fanatics, maybe even rap music. I hope this column somehow survives into this Mad Max-like world because I’d like to point them toward a different, albeit more likely, culprit: gadget fanboys. These are the individuals who spend their days patrolling the internet for any mention of their favourite gizmos and gizmo-making companies, only to then pounce on even the smallest of perceived slights against them. No praise of their chosen gadgets is high enough. Any critiques are surely the products of doltish imbeciles who deserve all manner of the harshness the fanboys delight in serving up. These are the people who have been spewing vitriolic hatred online since well before anyone had ever heard of Twitter, Gamergate or the concept of fake news. It’s fair, then, to consider them the progenitors of internet-driven divisiveness, also known as one of the biggest problems in the world today. Anyone who writes about technology is more than familiar with such individuals. I’ve experienced the enmity of fanboys - they can be female as well, but studies have found they are usually male – many times. Years ago, for example, a Nintendo fanboy wrote in a forum that I should have my hands cut off so that I’d be unable to write anything more. That was in response to a poor review I’d given a game. __________________________________ At a glance ■ What: The mindset of gadget fanboys is ruining the world. ■ Why: Because the combination of tribalism and technology is making everyone a loser. ■ Further reading: A look at why fans and critics are so divided over DC Comics movies. __________________________________ More recently, someone took to a BlackBerry forum to ominously ask "what to do" about me for some perceived negativity I’d directed at the company. Fortunately, the responses ranged from "nothing" to "ignore him," but it’s disconcerting to know there’s someone out there wondering what should be done about you. Constructive feedback is good. No one knows everything on a topic or gadget, so well-mannered and good-intentioned comments can be helpful. But fanboys don’t have any interest in helping anyone. Their sole purpose is to push their team and to shout down anyone who doesn’t support it. Fanboy-ism isn’t endemic to just technology and gadgets, or journalists, of course. People develop heated opinions and blind loyalty for everything from music and movies to politics and sports. Science tells us much of these agreements, which now commonly turn into online anger, stems from the same places. Social identity theory suggests a person’s sense of self evolves from the groups he or she belongs to. It is primal tribalism that manifests as support for a sports team, political party or gadget maker. Supporting one side inevitably breeds opposition to others. The concept of "sunk cost fallacy" also comes into play when dealing with gadgets. Simply put, when you spend a good amount of money on something, you often have to convince yourself after the fact that you made the right choice. That can lead to over-inflating its pluses and glossing over its flaws. There is also the element of supporting the underdog. Popular in sports, the phenomenon also manifests in gadgets. In my experience, Nintendo, BlackBerry and Apple have tended to engender the strongest such support. All three have at some point been the incumbents of their respective markets. But they’ve also been the underdogs who have at times pugnaciously taken on bigger or better-resourced opponents. Studies find that supporting underdogs is often a psychological projection. We get behind the scrappier upstarts as a way of believing - or perhaps fooling ourselves – that we too can triumph against steep odds. We feel personally empowered when Nintendo or BlackBerry beat rivals. The truth is, many of us are guilty of fanboy-ism of one sort or another, to varying degrees. It’s fine to like things, but it’s easy to become corrosive when we cross over into criticising or demeaning someone else for preferring other things. We contribute to the toxicity affecting society when we do that, whether we know it or not. Fortunately, there are some steps each of use can take to reverse this slide toward a full meltdown. For one thing, we can stop "liking" gadgets, companies, teams and other non-human entities on social media. If we can become wary of the things we like, we can perhaps avoid being defined by them. We also need to remember the importance of chaos. Gadgets, just like sports teams, depend on a lot of luck to succeed. The best technology supported by the deepest marketing budget can still fail for a myriad of reasons, so it’s pointless to get too emotional about one company’s or product’s fortunes. Lastly, we need to remember that it’s we - the consumers - who are the underdogs. Gadget makers are almost always multi-billion-dollar corporations that employ large numbers of people whose job is to try and turn us into fans of their products, and from there it’s a slippery slope into fanboy-ism. It’s these same companies that win when we insult someone online for preferring a certain phone or game console over another. We’re the ones who end up the losers.

Or, is it still all about investing in content and infrastructure? When’s the likely inflection point when businesses could start to look at break-even? Trying to answer these questions at the CASBAA OTT Summit 2017 were -- AltDigital CEO Nachiket Pantvaidya, SonyLiv EVP and digital head Uday Sodhi and GroupM South Asia chief growth officer Lakshmi Narasimhan. Evaluating the OTT space and enumerating on the best business model, the moderator for the evening -- Provocateur Advisory principal Paritosh Joshi -- asked the head of the recently launched (soft) AltBalaji app about the mantra to grab maximum eyeballs in the OTT space. Answering the doubt, Pantvaidya said, "India is a large market and the idea with AltBalaji is to connect with the 50-70 million people which correspond to e-commerce or functional 3G. There is also a market outside India of approximately 70 million people who want content. I think it is a library game. For SVoD to take off, content and habit formation among the people is crucial -- our platform has content ranging from sublime to ridiculous. As Sameer (Nair, Balaji Telefims CEO) said, we are here to capture the market space between Narcos and Naagin." Taking cue from Pantvaidya's point, Sodhi added, "The consumer is sorted in its head about what he wants. There is a clear habit formation. They are consuming on the go. There is a difference in the watch-time and they are coming back to watch linearly same shows. Habit formation is happening." India’s online video space will predominantly be an advertising led video-on-demand (AVOD) market even though subscription led VoD shows higher growth on a low base. If the digital eco-system becomes a SVoD dominated market, will that mean no business or loss for the advertising agencies? "There has been a pricing mistake in the last three years. The platforms come with a point of view that it will surpass television. The consumers think of these platforms as channels providing content. The players have to price it that way. In the US, OTT outstrips payTV in terms of subscribers but its annual revenues are lower," added Narasimhan. Pantvaidya added, "There is lack of development in the appreciable distribution system. It can survive when there is subscription. You can share profits with them if you are a SVoD. With free content comes carriage fees. Further, Sodhi believes that its early days for everyone and there is no model which has been cast and stoned yet. He segregated the entire process into three phases. The phase one is when you throw content. In the second phase, people start coming to your platform and your focus is o retain them. Money making only comes in the third level. Citing examples of the three existing models in the world, YouTube, which is 100 per cent advertising, Netflix, SVoD based platform and Apple which is transnational pay-per-view platform. "All these platforms are fairly growing, and have reached this point after 15 years. They have come out of their strengths to build a model," said Sodhi. Narasimhan opined that the AVoD services in the OTT space have not been explored yet. He also said that data from servers indicate that kids,youth and top-end consumers are moving to digital from TV which clearly shows that the eco-system is evolving in India. Joshi posted a question at the panelists asking whether they are underestimating the willingness of the consumers to pay for content. Pantvaidya agreed to his point, and said, "Scale and volume is necessary for spending. One should have faith in their content for it to sell." Sodhi added, "There is room for so many things. Everything is falling into its right place. The run-away is getting shorter before the take-off." OTT services are exploding in India and the business is more likely to be advertising-led in the short term. The OTT sector has clearly become a space to watch out for as the infrastructure continues to improve, devices get smarter and data prices fall. Let's see what the future holds for these players. tags CASBAA OTT Roundtable Summit 2017Uday SodhiParitosh JoshiNachiket PantvaidyaALtDigitalSony LIVLakshmi NarasimhanGroupMVODOTTSVODAVODDigital Trending Fox launches video streaming service in Asia Paramount & Anonymous Content to make 'The Windfall' as a TV series Ad & marketing growth may decelerate due to 'online' slowdown & no major spending: KPI 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania' is on its way to becoming a hit Water Communications designs campaign for Dr Batra's   Latest Reads YuppTV Originals' initial focus on regional content, to start feature film production YuppTV has forayed into original content production.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment, while the CIA in a statement would not say whether the files were real or not. “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,” said CIA spokesperson Jonathan Liu. However, several current and former intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told ABC News the documents appear to be authentic, and, in fact, likely have origins at the National Security Agency where most national security hacking of overseas targets occurs. “Somebody really screwed up to let this get out,” one former official familiar with the activities outlined in the WikiLeaks-released files told ABC News. WikiLeaks said a former government contractor had leaked the tranche of files. “Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ‘zero day’ exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive,” WikiLeaks said in a statement accompanying more than 8,000 pages of documents. The WikiLeaks files also revealed that the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt is a major hacker outpost for the most important and sensitive operations, which one former official confirmed is the major nerve center for covert joint CIA and National Security Agency voice collection around the globe. The official said it was the likely origin of the hacking of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s personal phone, which was revealed in a leak by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013. In fact, many of the documents appear to be NSA hacker tools and files in the possession of the CIA, rather than the CIA’s own capabilities, an official said. “There are only specific people at [the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence] who are allowed to see tailored access operations products by NSA hackers,” the official told ABC News. The U.K.’s signals intelligence spy agency GCHQ, for example, is also known to do proxy cyber activities in places where the U.S. faces legal restrictions the British Government does not have to contend with, a former official involved in hacking said. That intelligence is often shared with, or gathered at the behest of, American spy services. The current and former officials could not corroborate WikiLeaks’ claim that a former contractor was behind the massive security breach but said it was very possible, if not highly likely. “I’m not denying there are people leaking information,” Tyler Wood, a former senior Defense Intelligence Agency cyber programs official, told ABC News Tuesday. The leaked files show a large effort undertaken by CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence to find ways to turn consumer electronic devices from smart TV’s to Google Android and Apple IOS devices, including smartphones and tablets, into remotely-activated spy devices. The files detail efforts made to access messages before they are encrypted by security apps or to turn the phone or to activate the tablet’s camera and microphone without the owner’s awareness. An entire office at CCI is devoted to exploiting mobile smart devices, the documents suggest. While Snowden – in hiding in Russia and still wanted by U.S. authorities for his breach – tweeted Tuesday that the CIA files reveal a “security hole the CIA left open to break into any iPhone in the world,” an official familiar with such intelligence activities said usually a human spy is necessary – a “cyber middleman” – who can first gain physical access to a device. That is an often dangerous task and rarely accomplished, the official told ABC News. The programs revealed Tuesday have a series of cover names, such as BrutalKangaroo, RickyBobby, AfterMidnight and WeepingAngel – the last being the name of a set of characters in a BBC mystery drama called “Dr. Who.” Countless intelligence programs with similar cover names – approved by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in an “arduous process” – had to be re-named after Snowden blew the lid on those activities. “And everything will have to be renamed after this,” an official familiar with many of the named programs told ABC News. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-AZ) said Americans should pay attention to such breaches that reveal vulnerabilities to privacy and national security. “This is of the utmost seriousness. If they can hack into the CIA, they can hack into anybody,” McCain said Tuesday. Many cybersecurity experts on social media after the leaks focused attention on the apparent capability of U.S. intelligence to hack “smart” devices such as Samsung smart TV’s, which the leaked files said can be in “fake-off mode” when in reality the microphone is turned into a room listening device without anyone nearby knowing it because the TV appears to be off. “Pretty much anything can be made into an eavesdropping device,” said a former official. Samsung, however, in its own user manuals’ privacy statement, warns users that their spoken voice could be transmitted through the Internet to third parties, which conceivably “converts your interactive voice commands to text.” In the last ten years, WikiLeaks has published an incredible amount of secret U.S. information, about military operations in Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, and more recently the e-mails of the Democratic Party hacked by Russian intelligence. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he is “extremely concerned” by the WikiLeaks publications on Tuesday, telling reporters his panel has reached out to the intelligence community for more information. “We’ve had initial inquiries into the [intelligence community]. Look, this is early on in the investigation, but these appear to be very, very serious. But at this time, that’s really all the information that I have on it,” he said. “I’ve long said this — that emails and many of our electronic devices are not safe, and they’re primarily not safe from our adversaries like the Russians and the Chinese and others who are actively trying to get into government institutions and private businesses.” Asked about supposed security vulnerabilities detailed in the documents that were relevant to their devices, Apple said, “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.” Last October, President Trump as a presidential candidate said, “WikiLeaks, I love Wikileaks. And I said write a couple of them down. Let’s see.” In the regular White House Press Briefing on Tuesday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment on the matter. Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio.

Careful planning and strategic technology decisions will help ensure a successful launch and encourage adoption. The user interface (UI), experience (UX), and desired functionalities all have to be considered before settling on a platform. Afterward, an appropriate development process should be implemented. Whether the app will be native or cross-platform will determine a lot. The app’s preferred platform and programming language play a huge role in how intuitive the product is to users, as well as the type of audience that will primarily use the app. For example, will the app only be available for Android or iOS devices? The decision to choose native or cross-platform for app development ultimately depends on the business’s goals. No matter which route is taken, each method has its own strengths and drawbacks. Native Apps Native apps are built using platform-specific programming languages. For Android, it’s Java, Windows uses C#, VB.NET or C/C++, and Objective-C or Swift is used to program iOS apps. These apps are built from scratch with the intention of operating solely on their designated platform. Pros User Interface (UI) – The look and feel, as well as the overall usability of an app, can determine the success of the product. Because native apps seamlessly integrate with the platforms for which they are created, users navigate a familiar interface. This contributes to an overall positive user experience and encourages repeated use. Performance (UX) – Native app development is optimal for apps that require a lot of interaction and extensive data processing due to heavy amounts of media, such as images, videos or animation. Native apps generally perform better because their native code speaks directly to the operating system’s unique hardware and software functions with little to no lag time. Additionally, using native code for complex apps will minimize the risk of the app freezing or crashing since it’s built specifically for a certain platform. Better Positioning – Because native apps typically rank better among users, they will often have greater visibility in app stores. Native apps usually have higher recommendations due to their high performance and user-friendly interfaces. Platform Integration – Native apps generally function flawlessly on their specific platforms. This makes their features more customizable to user preferences and gives the feeling that the app is truly an integrated part of their preferred device. Cons Time-Consuming – Developing native applications for more than one platform can greatly extend the development process. The same code will not be usable for different platforms, and developers will need to spend extra time converting, or even rewriting code. More Skillful Developers Required – To develop native apps for multiple platforms, businesses may need to invest in hiring additional, specialist developers. Depending on the platforms the company is targeting, a total of 2 developers may be needed for one application. For example, one would be the Android application developer, while the other works on the iOS platform.  Expensive – The cost of increasing the number of developers needed for each platform, combined with extending the length of the development process for the project could mean doubling or even tripling the overall budget. Cross-Platform Cross-platform apps are developed with code that is later customized to fit the OS when an app is launched. This all-in-one solution allows a single application to run on multiple platforms and is a very popular approach for businesses and developers who want to save time and money. Pros Time-saver – Unlike developing for native apps, cross-platform app development uses a single code across multiple platforms, which saves companies from having to prolong the project due to code rewrites and platform customizations. Affordable – Businesses can cut costs and have fewer developers per project. Saving time by having a “write once, run anywhere” code leads to an efficient development process and expedited deployment. Profit Maximization – Aside from cutting costs, cross-platform apps maximize profits through exposure across multiple markets targeted at platforms and users. Easy to Launch and Update – The initial launch, as well as subsequent updates and changes to the app, can be rolled out simultaneously and affect multiple platforms. Cons Performance Delay - Cross-platform apps do not integrate with their platforms as flawlessly as native apps do. As such, these apps tend to freeze or lag because the non-native code cannot seamlessly communicate with the device’s hardware or software functions. Alien – Apps with shared code do not always integrate flawlessly into platforms and usually cannot adopt previous customizations the user has made to the device. The results leave users with an app that is not able to take full advantage of the platform, which hampers the ability to use certain features on a device, such as preset gestures, the camera, and even the microphone. PhoneGap PhoneGap, also known as Apache Cordova, is a very popular open source platform for creating cross-platform/hybrid apps. It uses JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 programming languages. Pros Familiar Programming Languages – Because PhoneGap utilizes well-known programming languages like JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, developers can immediately begin working with the software. This reduces the amount of training required for developers to properly utilize PhoneGap and enables businesses to get their apps out into the market faster. Easy App Store Discoverability – PhoneGap apps install similarly to native apps; therefore, they gain the benefit of having high visibility in app stores. Plugin Architecture – PhoneGap possesses a flexible plugin architecture to extend native device APIs in a modular style. No Licensing Costs – PhoneGap is open source and free to use, so businesses do not incur expensive licensing fees. Many Libraries Available – Developers can easily access and seek assistance from countless libraries to enhance the functionality of their PhoneGap applications. Cons Performance – The performance of PhoneGap apps is often criticized. Issues may sometimes arise if there are too many graphics or complex elements in the app’s architecture, causing the app to become non-responsive or even crash. Plugins – In many cases, developers that have chosen to work with PhoneGap have done so to avoid having to work with native-specific attributes.  PhoneGap’s flexible, plugin-friendly architecture is beneficial to developers if they are able to find the necessary plugins they require for their project, or if they possess the skills to write their own plugins should they need custom ones. But if a developer is unable to find the proper plugins or easily write an appropriate one, the development process could suffer delays. Lack of Documentation – PhoneGap’s vague user guidelines and directions documents for the user interface lack the crucial information required for development. The documentation also lacks best practices information to enhance cross-platform app development. Memory Loss - Because PhoneGap lacks cache/memory management capabilities, loss of memory is often an issue. Titanium Appcelerator Titanium is an open source development platform for developing desktop, native mobile, and cross-platform apps. More than 35,000 apps have been developed in Titanium using programming languages like JavaScript, HTML5, jQuery, and CSS3. Pros Familiar Programming Languages – Titanium utilizes well-known programming languages, so it’s easy for developers to quickly begin working with the platform. Access to Advanced Features – Titanium has independent APIs that can access features on devices like the camera, microphone, touchscreen, and GPS. This allows users to perceive Titanium apps as part of their devices and enhances the user experience. Instant Feedback – Titanium reduces app development timeframes because developers can create apps with fewer lines of code.  This allows developers to build quick prototypes of their apps and evaluate how users interact with the UI and gain immediate feedback. Large Community – The Titanium / Appcelerator community boasts over 200,000 developers and offers access to its Open Mobile Marketplace. Developers can buy, sell, and share modules, templates, design elements, and extensions for web services. Cons Increased Complexity – As the complexity of apps increase, so do the costs. More often developers will find themselves dealing with technical issues, such as crashes and bugs, as well as putting in extra effort in keeping the code organized and maintaining multi-platform support.  Limits on Flexibility – Although Titanium’s API saves developers time by requiring fewer lines of code to enable certain features, its limitations can cause problems for complex applications. These limitations can cause delays and ongoing problems with the app. Unstable Features – Appcelerator offers StoreKit, a module that enables in-app purchases to the Apple App Store. However, this feature is extremely buggy and does not work 100 percent of the time. The partial functionality of this module greatly affects Titanium’s freemium pricing strategy. The free-to-download software is too unstable for the user to consistently, and properly make in-app purchases. This instability in the software could result in the app bringing in less revenue. Toolkit Trouble – Many developers agree the learning curve for Titanium has greatly increased since the introduction of Titanium Studio, an Eclipse-based IDE that is built on a modified version of Aptana that enables users to test their apps on a simulator, and manage their projects. Titanium Studio has been known to suffer from glitches, most notably those that cause the build process to ignore changes. This forces developers into an uncomfortable situation where they must constantly clean their project after each change, or restart completely with a new project. Xamarin Since its launch in 2011, the mono framework known as Xamarin has been widely used for cross-platform app development. Through APIs, Xamarin apps natively communicate with the camera and GPS functions of iOS, Android, and Windows devices. Pros One Code to Rule All Platforms – Xamarin uses C# combined with .NET framework to make apps for multiple platforms. As a result, developers can reuse a large percentage of the source code to speed up development processes. Xamarin also works with Visual Studio and Xamarin IDE, so developers do not have to switch between development environments. Mimics Native – Cross-platform apps developed with Xamarin can theoretically be classified as native since their performance metrics rival those of native apps designed specifically for one platform. Thus, Xamarin apps can leverage high visibility and ratings in app stores. Native UX – Xamarin makes it possible to customize the UI for each platform. By using the Xamarin.Forms tool, developers can build cross-platform apps that convert the app’s UI components into the platform’s specific UI. For even greater performance results, developers can use the Xamarin.iOS or Xamarin.Android tools to develop fast and reliable cross-platform apps that offer a native user experience. Functionality – With Xamarin, all hardware compatibility issues become nonexistent. Xamarin offers developers access to platform-specific APIs and can connect with native libraries to work seamlessly with nearly all devices across varying platforms without compromising on functionality or performance. No More Expensive License – Before Microsoft acquired Xamarin in mid-2016, licensing fees for Xamarin came at the expense of $1,000 per developer, per platform. This means businesses could easily spend large sums of money for a small team of three or five developers who would create apps just for the two most popular platforms. Since the acquisition, Microsoft began offering Xamarin for no extra cost for Visual Studio users and is in the process of making it a truly open source platform. Cons Small Community – Xamarin’s growth over the past few years has been steady with a majority of followers stemming from Microsoft. However, the Xamarin community remains smaller than that of the iOS and Android societies, so finding experienced Xamarin developers can be a challenge. Versatile Skill Set Required – Xamarin makes extensive use of .NET open source resources as well as other open source technologies. Developers looking to work with Xamarin should, therefore, be skilled in .NET and also have knowledge of some other platform-specific framework with JavaScript or Objective-C aspects. App Size – Xamarin requires a lot of operational software for linking codes and referencing between .NET frameworks and the platform specific operating systems.  This increases the overall size of the application. Conclusion The first step to bringing an app idea to life is deciding whether to develop natively or cross-platform. For simple apps that will only be released for a single platform, native app development is the way to go. But, if the goal is to launch the app on multiple platforms while saving time and money, then the best option is a cross-platform approach. Businesses in need of high-performance native apps will most likely incur higher development costs up front. Cross-platform app development is preferred for cost-conscious development, but each of the most popular tools possesses drawbacks. To successfully introduce new applications, enterprises must ensure they partner with a company that can offer native and cross platform options, and developers with a clear understanding of the appropriate tools to use on the project.

Televisions, smartphones and even anti-virus software are all vulnerable to CIA hacking, according to WikiLeaks documents released Tuesday. The capabilities described include recording the sounds, images and private text messages of users, even when they resort to encrypted apps to communicate. While many of the attack technologies had been previously discussed at cybersecurity conferences, experts were startled to see evidence that the CIA had turned so many theoretical vulnerabilities into functioning attack tools against staples of modern life. These include widely used Internet routers, smartphones, and Mac and Windows computers. Wikileaks releases CIA’s secret hacking toolbox In the case of a tool called “Weeping Angel” for attacking Samsung smart TVs, WikiLeaks wrote, “After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a ‘Fake-Off’ mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In ‘Fake-Off’ mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server.” The idea that the CIA and NSA can hack into devices is kind of old news. Anyone who thought they couldn’t was living in a fantasy world Matthew Green, cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins University The CIA reportedly also has studied whether it could infect vehicle control systems for cars and trucks, which WikiLeaks alleged could be used to conduct “nearly undetectable assassinations.” And a specialised CIA unit called the Mobile Devices Branch produced malware to control and steal information from iPhones, which according to WikiLeaks were a particular focus because of the smartphone’s popularity “among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.” The agency also targeted popular phones running Google’s Android, the world’s leading mobile operating system. WikiLeaks said it redacted lists of CIA surveillance targets, though it said they included targets and machines in Latin America, Europe and the United States. The anti-secrecy group also said that by developing such intrusive technology - rather than helping tech companies patch flaws in their products - the CIA was undermining efforts to protect the cybersecurity of Americans. “The argument that there is some terrorist using a Samsung TV somewhere - as a reason to not disclose that vulnerability to the company, when it puts thousands of Americans at risk - I fundamentally disagree with it,” said Alex Rice, chief technology officer for HackerOne, a startup that enlists hackers to report security gaps to companies and organisations in exchange for cash. The trove released Tuesday, which could not be independently verified and which the CIA has declined to confirm, included 8,761 documents - the first batch in a series of planned releases, WikiLeaks said. This first group, at least, has important differences from the 2013 revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. His trove of documents largely described mass surveillance of Internet-based communications systems, while the WikiLeaks release more often describes attacks on individual devices. CIA ‘bypasses encryption’ of WhatsApp, other messaging tools By targeting devices, the CIA reportedly gains access to even well-encrypted communications on such popular apps as Signal and WhatsApp, without having to crack the encryption itself. The WikiLeaks reports acknowledged that difference by saying that the CIA had found ways to “bypass,” as opposed to defeat, encryption technologies. “The idea that the CIA and NSA can hack into devices is kind of old news,” said Johns Hopkins University cryptography expert Matthew Green. “Anyone who thought they couldn’t was living in a fantasy world.” Snowden’s revelations and the resulting backlash made strong encryption a major, well-funded cause for privacy advocates and, perhaps more important, technology companies that had the engineering expertise and budgets to protect data as it flowed across the world. Encrypting apps for private messaging, such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp, exploded in popularity, especially among users around the world who were fearful of government intrusion. In the days after the US presidential election last fall, Signal was among the most downloaded programs in Apple’s app store, and downloads grew by more than 300 per cent. Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal, released a statement Tuesday saying, “The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption.” WhatsApp declined to comment, and Telegram did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment, while Samsung and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. government authorities had complained loudly that the post-Snowden wave of encryption was undermining their ability to investigate serious crimes, such as terrorism and child pornography. The FBI in 2016 sued Apple in hopes of forcing it to unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernadino, California, killers before announcing, amid heavy public criticism, that it had other ways to crack the device. Against that backdrop, many privacy advocates argued that devices - often called “endpoints” for their place in chains of communications that can criss-cross continents - were the best available targets in a world with widespread online encryption. The WikiLeaks documents suggest that the CIA may have reached the same conclusion.   Most Popular Viewed 1 How China’s rush to urbanise has created a slew of ghost towns 2 Tillerson to push for China to get tough on North Korea in landmark Xi summit 3 Is murder of Kim Jong-nam forcing China’s hand against North Korea? 4 China’s former child brides refuse to be silenced 5 How Muslim anxiety over Trump’s travel ban unfolds in Hong Kong Shared 1 How China’s rush to urbanise has created a slew of ghost towns 2 ‘Honest’ sex education textbook in China slammed for going too far 3 Hong Kong-registered companies must disclose owners by 2018 4 China’s former child brides refuse to be silenced 5 How Muslim anxiety over Trump’s travel ban unfolds in Hong Kong Commented 1 Tillerson to push for China to get tough on North Korea in landmark Xi summit 2 Food trucks turn to local fare to boost business at some locations 3 How Muslim anxiety over Trump’s travel ban unfolds in Hong Kong 4 Hong Kong’s ‘hypocrisy camp’ cannot treat CY Leung both ways 5 ‘No change needed’ in proportion of overseas judges       You may also like Asia US deploys THAAD missile defense system to South Korea Mar 8th 2017, 11:29am Useful gadgets?

Europe’s biggest carmaker has said it will invest billions of euros in electric cars, ride-hailing and automated driving, and launch over 30 electric models by 2025 as it battles to recover from its emissions test cheating. Image Credit: Volkswagen The self-driving concept car called Sedric – a so-called Level 5 vehicle capable of fully automated operation – is a precursor for more such models from the Volkswagen (VW) group in years to come, Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said on Monday on the eve of car executives’ annual gathering in Geneva. VW is hiring top specialists and plans to spend several billions of euros on automated driving alone, Mueller said, without being more specific. Sedric can carry 4 passengers and could be used for ride-sharing fleets as well as for individual consumers, VW said. Internet giant Google was a forerunner in self-driving technology with its 2015 prototype vehicle, but has since been challenged by companies ranging from Uber to Apple, as well as traditional carmakers. Manufacturers and their suppliers are working on different technology suites – including cameras, radar and laser imaging technology lidar – to enable vehicles to drive themselves, but it will take years for these vehicles to come to market. Mercedes-Benz unveiled its fully autonomous F 015 luxury concept two years ago. But Toyota has said it does not expect to see Level 5 cars in widespread use for another 10-15 years, while Ford does not plan to offer such vehicles for consumers until 2025 or later.

The CIA is accused of running a secret computer hacking programme giving its agents access to everyday items including mobile phones, TVs and iPads.  The CIA is also alleged to be targeting cars that contain onboard computers linked to the internet, amid unsubstantiated allegations that once in control of vehicles it could stage assassinations and make them look like accidents.  The catastrophic leak of data was obtained by WikiLeaks and published online yesterday, causing embarrassment to the American intelligence community at a time when it is at loggerheads with President Donald Trump.  In total, WikiLeaks published 8,761 documents, claiming it to be the largest ever release of CIA files in its history. The CIA declined to comment while experts said the documents, generated by the agency’s Engineering Development Group, between 2013 and 2016, seemed genuine. The British intelligence agencies - MI5 and GCHQ - were dragged into the row with files showing how the UK held workshops with the CIA to find ways to ‘hack’ into household devices. One exotically named programme dubbed Weeping Angel allowed spies to gain control of the Samsung F8000 range of internet-connected televisions. It was developed in a ‘joint workshop’ held in June 2014 involving MI5 and the CIA and enabled the agencies to gain control of  the TV, according to the documents.  It is alleged that MI5 created a ‘fake-off’ mode that meant television users thought sets were  switched off. In fact users can be secretly recorded by them and conversations transmitted to a CIA operative listening in. The smart televisions come with a microphone that is normally used for voice-activated controls. The leaked files also appeared to show evidence that GCHQ had collaborated with the CIA in hacking into Apple’s iPhones as well as smartphones run using Google’s rival Android software. The phones can even take photographs when owners thought them switched off. According to the documents, GCHQ, the Government’s listening agency based in Cheltenham, worked on six different methods for targeting the iOS operating system used on iPhones, iPods and iPads  and one for spying on Android phones. In total the CIA developed 14 applications targeting iPhones and 24 aimed at Android phone users. In so doing, WikiLeaks claimed the CIA was able to circumvent encryption codes used in such messaging groups as WhatsApp. The CIA is alleged to have exploited glitches in the technology that the original manufacturer or designer isn’t yet aware of - called ‘zero days’ - to hack into the devices. Another document suggests the CIA’s cyber directorate is developing ways to infect control computer systems in cars and lorries. “The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations,” said WikiLeaks. In all, the documents suggest the agency created more than 1,000 viruses and other types of malware to gain access to everyday items.  WikiLeaks also accused the US government of failing to abide by a commitment to tell technology companies of any identified vulnerabilities, instead “hoarding” weaknesses for use by spy agencies. The deal was put in place to allow the tech giants to plug weaknesses in operating systems and prevent leaks to foreign intelligence agencies, especially Russia and China. WikiLeaks claimed the archive had been circulated among former American government hackers and contractors, one of whom had passed on parts of the cache in order to start a wider debate. It is promising to release more documents in the future. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks’ founder who remains inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he is evading arrest, said: “There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber ‘weapons’.” WikiLeaks made headlines during last year’s US presidential election when it released the personal emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman and other Democratic figures, data which intelligence officials believe was originally stolen by Russian hackers. Heather Fritz Hornial, a CIA spokeswoman, said: “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.”  UK security services declined to comment but Whitehall sources stressed that spies have to act within a strict legal framework in the fight against hostile states,  terrorists and organised criminals.

The Chinese company has agreed to pay a criminal and civil penalty of about 892 million U.S. dollars and an additional penalty of 300 million dollars, which will be suspended for a seven-year probationary period to deter future violations. Zhao Xianming, chairman and CEO of ZTE, said Wednesday that reaching the settlement with U.S. authorities could" secure ZTE a solid foundation to acquire more market opportunities." He said that ZTE had established sound relations with its U.S. suppliers and created 130,000 high-tech jobs in the United States. Under a global partnership, ZTE expects continuous business growth and expansion in the years to come. U.S. authorities had claimed that ZTE and its affiliated entities had illegally shipped telecommunications equipment to certain countries in violation of U.S. regulations. The Commerce Department added ZTE on the Entity List under the Export Administration Regulations in March 2016. This made it difficult for ZTE to acquire U.S. products such as chips and software. Following the settlement, the Bureau of Industry and Security under the U.S. Commerce Department will recommend that ZTE be removed from the list, according to a ZTE statement Tuesday. ZTE currently holds about 7 percent of the U.S. smartphone market, the fourth largest after Apple, Samsung and LG. It currently has 14 offices and six research centers in the United States, with 80 percent of the total 350 staff being Americans. ZTE on Tuesday issued its 2016 performance report, showing yearly revenue topping 101.2 billion yuan (14.6 billion U.S. dollars). Deducting fines triggered by the U.S. authorities' penalties and other losses, the company listed on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges still secured 5.4 billion yuan profit in 2016, up 25.82 percent year on year. Net income applicable to its common stockholders increased 19.24 percent to 3.8 billion yuan. The company also expects an increase between 21.21 and 31.65 percent in profits in the first quarter of 2017.

The alleged cyber-weapons are said to include malware that targets Windows, Android, iOS, OSX and Linux computers as well as internet routers. Some of the software is reported to have been developed in-house, but the UK’s MI5 agency is said to have helped build a spyware attack for Samsung TVs. A spokesman for the CIA would not confirm the details. “We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,” he said. Image copyrightTWITTER Whisteblower Edward Snowden has tweeted that the leak appears to be authentic A spokesman for the UK Home Office was unable to comment. Wikileaks said that its source had shared the details with it to prompt a debate into whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities had exceeded its mandated powers. Embarrassment factor – Analysis by BBC’s security correspondent Gordon Corera These latest leaks – which appear to give details of highly sensitive technical methods – will be a huge problem for the CIA. There is the embarrassment factor – that an agency whose job is to steal other people’s secrets has not been able to keep their own. Then there will be the fear of a loss of intelligence coverage against their targets who may change their behaviour because they now know the spies can do. And then there will be the questions over whether the CIA’s technical capabilities were too expansive and too secret. Because many of the initial documents point to capabilities targeting consumer devices, the hardest questions may revolve around what is known as the “equities” problem. This is when you find a vulnerability in a piece of technology how do you balance the benefit to the public of telling the manufacturer so they can close it and improve everyone’s security with the benefit to the spy agency of leaving it in place so they can exploit it to collect intelligence. The NSA has already faced questions about whether it has this balance right when many of its secrets were revealed by Edward Snowden, and now it may be the CIA’s turn. Hacked TVs The effort to compromise Samsung’s F8000 range of smart TVs was codenamed Weeping Angel, according to documents dated June 2014. They describe the creation of a “fake-off” mode, designed to fool users into believing that their screens had been switched off. Instead, the documents indicate, infected sets were made to covertly record audio, which would later be transferred over the internet to CIA computer servers once the TVs were fully switched back on, allowing their wi-fi links to re-establish. Under a “future work” section, it is suggested that video snapshots might also be taken and the wi-fi limitation be overcome. Image copyrightSAMSUNG The CIA is alleged to have found a way to listen to conversations that took place close to Samsung TVs Samsung has not commented on the allegations. Apple attacks Wikileaks also claims that as of last year, the CIA has built up an arsenal of 24 Android “zero days” – the term given to previously unknown security flaws in code. Some of these are said to have been discovered by the CIA, but others were allegedly obtained from the UK’s GCHQ agency as well as the NSA and unnamed third-parties. Devices made by Samsung, HTC and Sony, among others, were said to have been compromised as a result, allowing the CIA to read messages on Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram and Weibo among other chat services. It is also claimed that a specialised CIA unit was set up to target iPhones and iPads, allowing the agency to see a target’s location, activate their device’s camera and microphone, and read text communications. The unit is also reported to have made use of further iOS “zero days” obtained from GCHQ, the NSA and FBI. “It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters,” GCHQ told the BBC. “Furthermore, all of GCHQ’s work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate.” Other claims say the CIA: was trying to find ways to infect vehicles’ computer control systems. Wikileaks claims these might have been used for undetectable assassinations had found ways to infect “air-gapped” computers – machines that are not linked up to the internet or other insecure networks. Methods are said to have included hiding data in images or hidden parts of computer storage had developed attacks against popular anti-virus products had built up a library of hacking techniques “stolen” from malware developed in Russia and elsewhere Wikileaks describes its release as the first in a series of planned leaks about the CIA’s cyber-activities, which it refers to as Vault 7. It added that the material had already circulated among hackers who used to work for the US government as well as contractors in an unauthorised manner. Analysis: Mark Ward, Technology reporter Image copyrightREUTERS Wikileaks’s founder Julian Assange said there was a cyber-weapon proliferation risk There is a huge amount of information in the CIA data dump but a lot of it, such as its apparent success in compromising smart TVs, is not that surprising. Lone researchers have managed similar hacks, so smart government agents were always going to be able to go further. Plus, we kind of know that a lot of the modern internet-of-things gear is broken as all kinds of holes have been found in all kinds of gadgets – including cars. What’s more interesting is the work said to have been done on iPhone and Android handsets. That’s because Apple works hard to make sure iOS is secure and Google has made a real effort lately to secure its operating system. For a spy agency, access to those gadgets is key because they travel everywhere with a target. What is likely to hit the CIA the hardest is losing control of all the zero day exploits and malware detailed in the papers. It is more than likely that the agency paid millions to build up an arsenal of tools that are guaranteed to work – largely because they are based on flaws, bugs and vulnerabilities that have never been seen before. Operating systems of all stripes are really big haystacks and the information in some of the leaks looks like a good map to all the needles hiding within. With the zero days now largely burned the CIA may have to re-trench for a while but it will doubtless have other unused attack tools stored and ready to deploy. What’s potentially more worrying is that as information about the bugs gets out then the bad guys will pile in and use them. We saw that with the zero days released in the much smaller Hacking Team data breach, and there is much more useful data to be found in this trove. http://www.bbc.com Tags CIA Gordon Corera Mark Ward WikiLeaks Previous article Anibal sobre el Palco: “el idiota del diario la Nacion” → Next article ‘America’s most hated mom’ breaks silence → Comments Deja un comentario Cancelar respuesta Tu dirección de correo electrónico no será publicada.

Updated: March 16, 2017 @ 7:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell LA RAMS Want a million bucks? Guess the Rams' schedule Associated Press Mar 6, 2017 0 So the Los Angeles Rams are offering a $1 million prize to a fan who can predict their exact schedule for the upcoming season. For a million bucks, we might even go watch the Rams in person — well, maybe not. Some things just aren’t worth the price of admission. Anyway, here’s AP’s try, with reasoning for each of the 16 games. Week 1: With the Rams sharing the LA Coliseum with Southern California, which gets priority on dates — yes, the NFL takes a back seat in this venue — a road game makes sense to get things started. AT MINNESOTA. Week 2: The Trojans are home again, but let’s give the Rams a break and not force a long trip for their second loss, uh, game. AT ARIZONA. Week 3: No college competition this time, and the NFL wants as big a crowd as possible for the home opener. Unfortunately, there are no high-profile opponents heading to Hollywood, so bring on the closest thing on the schedule. WASHINGTON. Week 4: Another Sunday home game, although this will be on Oct. 1, the last day of the baseball season. Rams boss Stan Kroenke should hope the Dodgers aren’t in a pennant race or the Coliseum might be empty. SAN FRANCISCO. Week 5: Time to get that annoying Thursday nighter out of the way, which means ... AT SEATTLE. Week 6: The only back-to-back weekend at the Coliseum for the Trojans and Rams. Wonder who will outdraw whom (go with USC). NEW ORLEANS. Week 7: From hosting the Big Easy team to heading to the Big Apple — and then a lot farther East — the Rams land in the Meadowlands. AT NEW YORK GIANTS. Week 8: Tally ho and all that stuff. A home game at Twickenram, make that Twickenham (England’s national rugby stadium). ARIZONA. Week 9: Every team likes the idea of a mid-schedule bye. After so many thousands of miles traveling, the Rams earn a week off, even if they might not have earned one on the field. BYE. Week 10: Home sweet home. Well, we’ll see what the Colts say about that. INDIANAPOLIS. Week 11: No way the Rams will get to be at the Coliseum on UCLA-USC weekend. AT DALLAS. Week 12: Home for Thanksgiving weekend. Who’s the turkey, Rams or ... HOUSTON? Week 13: Yet another combo trip, this time to Florida, then to Tennessee. Wonder if anyone back in SoCal will notice their absence? AT JACKSONVILLE. Week 14: Can Jared Goff match up with Marcus Mariota? AT TENNESSEE. Week 15: Fly, Eagle, fly, into the Coliseum. PHILADELPHIA. Week 16: Christmas eve in the Bay Area. There are worse places to be, unless the Rams are headed to another season sweep at the hands of the 49ers. AT SAN FRANCISCO. Week 17: There has to be a better way to end the year than by playing the Seahawks. But if it gets us a seven-figure sweepstakes payoff, we’re fine with it. SEATTLE. Oh, yeah, one more question: Is the prize subject to those hefty California taxes? Get the top sports stories sent to your inbox each morning Sign Up!

Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Published:March 8, 2017 8:44 am The lobby of the CIA Headquarters Building is pictured in Langley, Virginia, US. Reuters/Larry Downing/File Photo The CIA finds itself in the midst of a Wikileaks expose, with 8,761 documents showing how the premier US intelligence agency uses tools to breaks into apps, phones and other devices. However, more than CIA, it seems this expose will hit the tech industry hard. Because, some of the details in the leaks seems to suggest there are vulnerabilities in both iOS and Android, the top operating systems for communication devices these days. While CIA hackers tapped into smartphones and computers, even some of the apps thought to be secure, they used programme called Weeping Angel to monitor those using the Samsung F8000 smart television even though they appeared to be power off. Suddenly, all those people who keep a piece of tape to cover their computer cameras don’t appear all that stupid. Also read | Wikileaks claims CIA can see your WhatApp messages: Here is everything you need to know Edward Snowden has a point when he says these leaks actually underline the vulnerabilities in Android and iOS and not in apps in WhatsApp and Signal. How else could the CIA hack into a smartphone television that is not even on. PSA: This incorrectly implies CIA hacked these apps / encryption. But the docs show iOS/Android are what got hacked – a much bigger problem. http://t.co/Bw9AkBpOdt — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 7, 2017 In fact, he suggests the security agencies were paying to keep some software unsafe. If you're writing about the CIA/@Wikileaks story, here's the big deal: first public evidence USG secretly paying to keep US software unsafe. pic.twitter.com/kYi0NC2mOp — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) March 7, 2017 Scarily, WikiLieaks claims that the documents show how CIA’s Mobile Development Branch creates malware to infest iOS and Android devices. It claims the CIA “arsenal” has “numerous local and remote “zero days” developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop”. Though Apple has just 14.5 per cent share of the global smartphone market, the CIA has a disproportionate interest in its devices are they are more popular among the political, diplomatic and business elite. Now, these operating systems are no longer limited to smartphones or tablets, as everything from cars to refrigerators are becoming smart and use Android or iOS for this dose of intelligence. This is where the so-called ‘Fake Off’ mode in these Samsung smart television were apparently developed in collaboration with the British Intelligence agencies could be damaging for the entire smart-this-smart-that industry. In the end, the leaks just suggest that it might not be a really smart thing to keep adding one smart device after the other to your portfolio, especially if you are one of those the security agencies might have any interest in. These days that could mean you are just a student with some outspoken views or a journalist who asks too many uncomfortable questions.

CIA can hack your iPhone or turn your smart TV into a bugging device Chris Keall Wednesday March 8, 2017 34 Share Ian Apperley Ian Apperley on CIA tools being exposed on Wikileaks - and what's even more frightening Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on It seems the CIA has tools for hacking your iPhone or turning your smart TV into a bugging device. But tech commentator Ian Apperley says people should be more worried about the amount of data being collected about their likes and dislikes, and movement, by the likes of Facebook and Google. Earlier today, WikiLeaks released a massive trove of documents and files it calls “Vault 7.” The whistle-blowing group claims the files detail how the CIA has created tools for hacking smartphones, computer operating systems, message services like Skype and WhatsApp and internet-connected TVs. The intelligence agency and the White House have refused to comment on the documents’ authenticity. But ISIS Group director Mr Apperley says he would be surprised if the CIA did not have that capability. Ditto for equivalent agencies in a laundry list of countries that includes Russia, Israel and the "Five Eyes" alliance that includes New Zealand. Consumer companies have taken steps to make their products more secure to protect their customer’s privacy. Apple, for example, now encrypts all iMessage traffic. But according to the Vault 7 files, the CIA has a tool that can lift audio or message traffic before encryption is applied. Other tricks apparently include the ability to take control of a smart TV and turn it into a listening device when the user thinks it's switched off. US Congress House intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes told US media that an investigation into the apparent leak was still in its early stages but potentially “very, very serious.”  The security breach is potentially larger than the Edward Snowden exposé and could halt security operations around the world. Scared for your privacy yet? “In terms of frightening, I would find Facebook more frightening,” Mr Apperley says. “The amount of information that Facebook collects about you is phenomenal, in terms of biometrics and movement. Google are the same. “They know where you are pretty much all of the time. And then they have some pretty sophisticated algorithms that sit over the top and manipulate the amount of data you get back. “So I’d be more worked up about Facebook and Google in the future than intelligence agencies.” Read more from Chris Keall Email Chris: ckeall@nbr.co.nz Follow @@ChrisKeall 34 · Got a question about this story?

Undoubtedly every intelligence agency as well as a marketing corporation collects personal data by using both overt and covert information gathering methods. If the government has tools for hacking into your device then the marketing corporation is buying/seeling your data without your consent or vague privacy policies. Fly Buys for example, shared its data across 23 different countries and the then Australian Privacy Foundation vice-chair David Vaile said ''You are suddenly at the mercy of someone who's done something wrong who doesn't have to answer to you or your country'' Like the saying goes - “Once on the internet, always on the internet.” The question that needs to be asked here is what is the legitimate use of personal data? Is it its use by an intelligence agency to find potential terrorists and threats or the use by private corporations for further exploitation and financial gains? Reply Share Share   2 0 #2 by Anonymous 9 days ago A generation of kids with social anxiety who will stare at their smartphones during any kind of social interaction. Facebook seems to be for insecure people who need to present a fake image of themselves to others, and twitter is for people with severe attention disorders probably from being raised on TV and fast food, and Facebook is so inherently vulnerable that eventually even the people who can't find the power button on their computers will realize the danger of presenting so much personal information in a public arena. It'll take a few getting pwned, but that's Darwinism in action.

Reply Share Share   0 1 by The Horse 8 days ago in reply to Joanna I have nothing to hide either, but I appreciate we need to consider things a little more deeply than that. Every erosion of privacy opens some in society up to potential abuse either through 1) a future government who does not act as gently as today's (notwithstanding some of the deplorable conduct exposed via Dirty Politics, and 2) criminal elements who can exploit the same erosions of privacy that state actors can. At a purely practical level, these vulnerabilities can be exploited by others (e.g. hackers), and could mean pictures of you fresh out of the shower posted online, a capture of you entering your bank password online, or - for those with children - potentially emotionally devastating exposure of innocent but private behaviours. It's only a couple of years ago that exploits of phone image storage platforms resulted in widespread online dissemination of people's private pictures - including nudity and more. It's a wee bit deeper than "Eh, I have nothing to hide, they're welcome to it."

We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.

Reply Share Share   0 0 #9 by GrumpyKiwi 8 days ago "You should be more worried by ... the likes of Facebook and Google". Ah yes of course I should. Because when google misinterpret my browsing habits, they provide me with inappropriate advertising. Unlike say the CIA/GCHQ/NSA who send a drone to fire a Hellfire missile at me. Yes I can see why you'd think that way. Seriously??? Equating a government department(s) with an ability to kill as less of a problem a corporation with an ability to sell data? What kind of world view is that? Governments give themselves the legal right to kill threats and capability to make life incredibly miserable for those who cross the politically connected. You should be VASTLY concerned about the potential for misuse of that. Come back to me once Facebook starts killing their rivals. Reply Share Share   0 0 by mr. ace 8 days ago in reply to GrumpyKiwi you should be worried because google and facebook aggregate data on such a large scale (android tracks everytime you open a app; if gps is turned on it records all your movement; and through their cookies track the websites you visit after google [or facebook]). Facebook supplements the data they receive about you by also purchasing data off third parties. the threat there isn't what they will do with it, it is what someone who infiltrates/leaks/hacks to get the data will do with it. simply leaving yourself logged into google will give someone a diary of your recent life https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb that level of data aggregation is super creepy. it's a blueprint of a lot of people's lifes. Reply Share Share   0 0 by GrumpyKiwi 7 days ago in reply to mr. ace And yet, Google don't claim the right to kill me if they accidentally misinterpret my web behaviour and perhaps apologise afterwards or perhaps call me collateral damage or a suspected terrorist. Google don't claim the right to imprison me or to mount a midnight SWAT team raid on my house. In fact, I can chose to completely opt out of doing anything with google at all. Your comparison is trite. Reply Share Share   0 0 by Anonymous 7 days ago in reply to GrumpyKiwi I am guessing you haven't heard of risks such as Identity theft or Credit Card fraud which is where a lot of these issues lead to - a common problem across most jurisdictions. I agree with your concern for the misuse of political ability in the scheme of things but if you have an issue with the government having the power to raid your house at midnight with a SWAT team like you say, then you might have a problem with the government's right to protect national security. Reply Share Share   0 0 by GrumpyKIwi 7 days ago in reply to Anonymous Let's see. I work in IT security and have done so for over 20 years - 10 years of which were for various government departments (including a 2 year Top Secret clearance role with British MoD). Yep, I have no idea about risks. Reply Share Share   0 0 by mr. ace 7 days ago in reply to GrumpyKiwi it's not trite. it's naive not to think google/facebook is a critical part of the value chain that would be used by govt officials (either by subpoena or by any means of hacking). and that data collection is not opt-out. some of it is opt-out to display to you, but it is still collected. Reply Share Share   0 0 by GrumpyKiwi 7 days ago in reply to mr. ace People who that their will is so weak that any piece of advertising will sway your opinion might be concerned about the targeted advertising that such data results in. Me, I'll just point and laugh at you. I'll repeat, when Google can kill you for thinking of swapping search engine, when Facebook can lock you up for refusing to get a Facebook page, then I'll rate them as threat akin to unlimited government access to my data. Not before. Reply Share Share   0 0 by Anonymous 7 days ago in reply to GrumpyKiwi "Yep, I have no idea about risks." The sarcasm aside, are you suggesting that those threats don’t exist or are of the opinion they are not important enough? Anyway, let's hear about your solution then - You have an issue with almost all governments giving themselves the legal right to kill threats. What are you proposing instead? Reply Share Share   0 0 by GrumpyKiwi 7 days ago in reply to Anonymous Err no. My issue is with government departments inevitably being lazy - hence the bulk collection of data rather than individually targeted intel gathering. Combine that with the well-known levels of incompetency found in government plus an information overload and a bias towards action - any kind of action so long as it shows that you're doing something. My solution would be to cut their budgets until they're forced to become focused instead of bloated. In the US I'd suggest $1 billion of budget cuts per leak per government department. Reply Share Share   0 0 by Ian Apperley  7 days ago in reply to mr. ace Agreed. If you look at services that Google has in beta right now they are real-time collection your location, your speech patterns (it listens all the time for voice commands), how you type, how you move, retinal information, and fingerprints. If you use Gmail it also trawls that content. Notionally that is for them to provide some very sophisticated services however what if rogue government had access to that data and how do we know that Google aren't supplying it? On balance, the abuse of Google data vs what has been released (so far) by Wikileaks is far more dangerous with deeper implications. Reply Share Share   0 0 by Ian Apperley  7 days ago in reply to GrumpyKiwi You raise a good point and I think there are two issues here. If you want to look at drone strikes in a SkyNet like future then do some research on Monster Mind. It is, allegedly, a system that tracks global IP addresses (devices) and can analyse when a co-ordinated attack is underway in cyberspace. So let's say that we have a group in a country that is actively attacking power stations in the U.S. The system then alerts drone operators who can enact a kill on that target. What is more worrying is the allegation that they want to AUTOMATE Monster Mind. So; the system is given rules of engagement and acts autonomously to activate drone attacks. Facebook is insidious for a different reason. They control intelligence on what the user sees (somewhat similar to Google) so you are getting a filtered view of the world rather than an unfiltered one. Again, that can be manipulated (as we saw during the U.S. elections last year) for political or marketing purposes. So yes, one system can be linked to extrajudicial executions and the other can be used to manipulate the world view of billions. Reply Share Share   0 0 by GrumpyKiwi 7 days ago in reply to Ian Apperley  LOL. I can draw you a diagram of the number of people who's viewpoint has been changed by internet arguments (let alone internet advertising). Let me give you a clue, it's a binary number and it's not 1. The "people are mindless drones who can be influenced by the merest suggestion" meme is delusional. If there was any truth to it, the fact that the Hillary campaign massively outspent the Trump one would have led to her inevitable triumph. Reply Share Share   0 0 by Bee 7 days ago in reply to GrumpyKiwi My 2cents. Somewhere in the risk evaluation, you guys are considering likeliness of risk materializing whilst you amplify about the severity of risk materializing. Getting killed without due authority of law, though a very severe outcome will be one in a billion as compared to identity theft, which could be more probable and with many more perp's interested in doing it. Also consider the mess you need to sort out if your identity was stolen vs. if you're dead - then you're dead. In summary - probability vs. severity.

( Jon Shapley / Houston Chronicle ) Photo: Jon Shapley, Staff Image 31 of 31 Texas Medical Center CEO tapped for University of Arizona president job 1 / 31 Back to Gallery Texas Medical Center CEO Robert Robbins was selected Tuesday as the next president of the University of Arizona, a potential blow to the mammoth Houston health care complex. The university's regents voted unanimously to make Robbins the lone finalist to become the university's 22nd president, four and a half years after he came to Houston to head the corporation that governs the medical center. During that time, he pushed the medical center toward a greater focus on commercialization and collaboration. "Dr. Robbins' comprehensive experience as both a visionary leader and highly respected physician, as well as his evident talent for advancing research, innovation, entrepreneurship and economic development will serve the University of Arizona and our state well," Eileen Klein, president of the board of regents, said in a statement. "I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with Dr. Robbins to advance the University of Arizona and achieve aggressive goals for the state of Arizona." Robbins could not be reached for comment after the announcement, which followed a closed session meeting of the regents that went much longer than anticipated. Robbins on Wednesday will be introduced to different groups on the University of Arizona campus, including elected state officials, faculty, students and alumni. Regents are scheduled to vote on his contract on April 6, following a meeting next Monday to finalize his selection and commence contract negotiations. Holcombe Crosswell, chairman of the TMC board, did not respond to requests for comment. Robbins has been a leading agent of change in the medical center since arriving in Houston, converting the TMC from a manager of roads and parking into a facilitator of research innovation. Perhaps most significantly, he convinced the TMC board to change the medical center's covenants and allow nonprofit activities in two locations, a move that's jump-starting biomedical commercialization in Houston. "Dr. Robbins transformed the Texas Medical Center into a collaborative, forward-thinking collective, something few people could accomplish," said Dr. Paul Klotman, president of Baylor College of Medicine. "He brought a vision here that was totally different but unifying for the institutions." Ed Egan, director of Rice University's McNair Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, said it's "still a little early to see the payoff," but praised Robbins for "making the medical center a key component of a needed ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship here, something lacking the past decade." Egan said he's "definitely concerned the next president would not have this level of focus." But Klotman said that one of Robbins' great achievements was to put together a sustainable vision and team. He acknowledged the departure would be a loss, but said the TMC's new emphasis "won't miss a beat going forward." Robbins' biggest development so far has been a center of innovation that has attracted such Fortune 500 companies as Johnson & Johnson, AT&T and Apple and that houses a business incubator that has instructed dozens of entrepreneurs how to successfully put together life-sciences companies. Robbins' medical background will come in handy at Arizona, whose medical schools have had issues with hospital partners. In addition, its senior vice president for health sciences, under fire last year after six members of his leadership team left at once, announced his resignation in December. Robbins will succeed Ann Weaver Hart, who announced her intention not to seek an extension for her contract as president of the University of Arizona in June of last year. He beat out Arizona State University Executive Vice President Sethuraman Panchanathan for the job. The two were announced as finalists last week and interviewed for the job Monday. The medical center's tax records show Robbins made nearly $1.2 million in 2014, the most recent figures available online. Hart's pay package amounts to $670,000. Before coming to the medical center, Robbins was chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Stanford University's School of Medicine.

The long-awaited Civic Type R, slated to go on sale in the U.S. in late spring with an MSRP in the mid-$30k range, is the first ever Type R-badged Honda to be sold on American soil. The Type R will feature a high performance 2.0-liter turbocharged powertrain, substantially upgraded body and chassis, and other track-ready, Nürburgring-tuned and tested performance components. The 2017 Civic Type R will make its U.S. debut at the New York International Auto Show on April 12, 2017. "The fastest, most powerful Honda ever sold in America, the Type R caps off the incredible success story of our 10th generation Civic lineup," said Jeff Conrad, senior vice president & general manager of the Honda Division, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. "We're happy to inform our U.S. enthusiasts that the long wait for the forbidden fruit of Honda Type R performance is nearly over!" 2017 Geneva Motor Show Gallery The new Civic Type R, sharing the body style of the 5-door hatchback variant of the tenth-generation global Honda Civic platform, will be powered by a U.S.-built 2.0-liter DOHC, direct-injected and turbocharged i-VTEC in-line 4-cylinder engine with peak ratings of 306 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 295 lb.-ft. of torque from 2,500 to 4,500 rpm. The engine will be mated exclusively to a short-throw 6-speed manual transmission with rev matching capability – employing automatic throttle blips for smoother shifts and power delivery. A new single-mass flywheel reduces clutch inertia by 25 percent versus the previous (European) Type R and a lower final gear ratio is employed to improve acceleration response. The Civic Type R chassis builds on the major upgrades undertaken for the 10th-generation Civic makeover with model-exclusive spring, damper and bushing settings, a new Dual-Axis front suspension setup with aluminum lower arms and steering knuckles for improved at-the-limit cornering and reduced torque steer; a new four-wheel Adaptive Suspension System with three-chamber dampers; a retuned and adaptive dual-pinion electric power steering system with variable gear ratio; and a helical limited-slip front differential. Mounted to the suspension are 20-inch aluminum alloy wheels shod with 245/30R 20 Continental ContiSportContact 6 performance tires. Decisive stopping power comes from Brembo 4-pot aluminum calipers squeezing 350mm (13.8-inch) cross-drilled rotors at the front. The rear braking system features solid 305mm (12-inch) rotors. The Type R's scalpel-sharp responses are further enhanced by a body more rigid than the substantially improved Civic Hatchback on which it's based – with a 38 percent increase in torsional rigidity and 45 percent gain in bending rigidity versus the previous Civic Type R – enhancing steering response and cornering stability while mitigating body vibration and cabin noise. The improvements are made possible by the application of structural adhesive throughout the body. Ultra-high strength steel is used for 14 percent of the body structure, and the Type R has an aluminum hood, contributing to a 16 kg (35 lb) reduction in body weight versus the previous Type R, and a 7 kg (15 lb) reduction versus the base 2017 Civic Hatchback. The 2017 Civic Type R is designed to reward the driver in all driving conditions, on the track and on the street, and features three driving modes: Comfort, Sport (default) and +R.  The driver selectable modes adjust steering and throttle response, transmission rev-matching, Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) and the Adaptive Damper System. Utilizing new, three-chamber dampers, individual stroke sensors and three vehicle-G sensors, the new damper system offers a wider range of variability for ride comfort and dynamic handling response. The 2017 Civic Type R will launch this spring in a single, premium-contented Touring trim. A 7-inch Display Audio touchscreen interface with embedded Honda Navigation system has both Apple CarPlay™ and Android Auto™ compatibility; and should the driver ever tire of hearing the Type R growl, a 540-watt, 12-speaker audio system with SiriusXM 2.0, HD Radio and Pandora compatibility is also provided as standard. Additional interior Type R features include heavily bolstered sports seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift boot, aluminum shift knob, aluminum sport pedals, red Type R driver's meter and serialized Type R plate on the center console. The Civic Type R will be manufactured by Honda of the U.K. Manufacturing in Swindon, England, with its 2.0-liter turbocharged engine made by Honda of America Mfg. at its Anna, Ohio engine plant using domestic and globally sourced parts. Pricing specifics and additional details on the 2017 Civic Type R will be provided closer to launch.

They are failing miserably in F1 (GP2 Motor - again) and lack the marketing know how to even build a car people want. Please include BMW in this as well, the current M3/4 series is crap. I have never seen a company fall from grace and become so lost. BMW and Honda need to take a hard look at Porsche design (engine/chassis/exterior) as they are still the international halo/racing standard. PS: I would love to see Nissan build a separate chassis for their Halo car(s)...the current GT-R is damn good but the move away from what is essentially the Altima platform would be a massive weight/chassis advantage. I want to see BMW, Honda, and Nissan apply their R&D and racing history correctly, not warm over appropriately turd baseline chassis.

Pharmaceutical stocks came under fire after Mr Trump said he was working on a new system to increase competition in the drugs industry and bring down prices. Trump also backed a draft bill unveiled by Republicans on Monday to repeal and replace the Obamacare healthcare law but said the bill was open to negotiation. The S&P 500 healthcare index dropped 0.54pc, setting it up for its worst day in more than five weeks. Johnson & Johnson was the top drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while Amgen weighed the most on the Nasdaq. However, a 0.4pc advance in the S&P technology sector, led by gains in Apple and Microsoft helped offset the impact of the decline in drug stocks. "What you have going on is a market that is sort of in a quiet period," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. "It's a week away from the Federal Reserve (meeting). The president came out last week and make a very good speech, but that sentiment has quickly dissipated." Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were lower as investors braced for an interest rate hike next week. The chances for a rate hike this month are at 83pc, up from roughly 30pc at the start of last week, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Federal Reserve has been preparing the market for tighter monetary policy, with an unusual number of key officials including Fed Chair Janet Yellen hinting at a rate hike in the central bank's March 14-15 meeting. The Iseq overall index of Irish shares closed down 6,600.86, losing 57.84 points, or 0.87pc.

How to tell what's real and wha... What is fake news? How to tell what's real and what's fake on Facebook Google and Facebook fight misleading by refusing to serve ads By Jim Martin (PC Advisor (UK)) on 08 March, 2017 06:08 0 - - - - print email What is fake news? Well, unlike satirical sites such as The Poke and The Onion, which don't fall into this category, fake news websites intentionally publish fraudulent, hoax or factually inaccurate news stories. They will also plagiarise legitimate news stories from other sites, but change the headlines to something more sensationalist in order to draw in readers. Further to Facebook's testing of new reporting options for fake news (see below), it is now actively marking disputed stories in the U.S. German users were first to get the ability to report posts as fake news, with the update seemingly being prioritised because of the upcoming German elections and the fact that fake news stories about Angela Merkel were circulating. We're yet to see a disputed story in the UK, so if you spot one, let us know. This is what they look like: Where is this fake news? As well as being found in internet searches (including Google News and Google AMP stories), you will also find them on social networks including Facebook (normal posts and Facebook Instant Articles) and Twitter. The links -- either from a search engine or found in a Facebook post or tweet on Twitter -- direct readers to the website in question. Many fake stories focus on politics (and not just U.S. politics) but also on health, well-being and religion. Fake 'news' are also used as propaganda. As long as people are interested and click through to the story, that's all that matters. Why do fake news sites exist? Most fake news sites are based in Macedonia, Romania, and Russia but they are also based in the U.S. and other countries. The reason they exist is to make money. That's true for most websites, but with fake news sites, the money is made on the back of deceit, clickbait, and plagiarism. By writing sensational headlines based on popular current affairs -- most recently the U.S. presidential election -- these sites receive a lot of traffic and therefore earn -- relatively speaking -- a lot of money from the adverts displayed on them. According to BuzzFeed, which researched many of the Macedonian sites, the teenagers running them can earn enough money to buy pretty much whatever they want. One teenager publishing pro-Trump stories was reportedly earning $5,000 per month from his site, and up to $3,000 per day when a story was shared a lot on Facebook. How to tell what's real and what's fake One recent example of fake news was the story which claimed Donald Trump had won the popular vote. It was hosted on a WordPress blog, which looked unprofessional if you viewed it on a desktop PC by browsing directly to the site. The problem was that the article ended up at the top of Google's search results, which meant a lot of people read and shared it. Plus, readers using smartphones wouldn't necessarily have noticed that it wasn't a reputable site, nor that it was - indeed - fake news. Fake news is made harder to discern when stories are picked up and converted into a more easily readable format, which is what Google AMP and Facebook Instant articles do. It's the same with Apple's News app, too. They all take a news story and reformat it to remove all the clutter (and adverts) that you'd find on the original website's page. From the reader's perspective, this is great because the article loads quickly and looks good. But it also lends the same benefits to fake news stories, which means it can be very hard to spot that something is fake. The clues are only in what is being said, and the potential for bad grammar and misspellings. Not everyone will pick up on these, of course. What is being done to stop fake news Google and Facebook have already said that they will stop serving ads on fake news sites. Things came to a head after Facebook and Twitter, in particular, were blamed for influencing the outcome of the US election by allowing fake news to spread on their networks. Fake news sites have to request approval for their site before any ads will appear, but Google has said it is updating its AdSense program to prevent ads being placed on sites distributing fake news. With no ads, and therefore no money, those running the sites will have no incentive to continue. Facebook has moved to ban fake news sites from advertising on the social network. Google is yet to announce that it's doing anything about preventing fake news stories appearing in search results, but Facebook has outlined how it is tackling the problem. Adam Mosseri, VP of Facebook's News Feed said, "It's important to us that the stories you see on Facebook are authentic and meaningful. We're excited about this progress, but we know there's more to be done. We're going to keep working on this problem for as long as it takes to get it right." Facebook is rolling out a couple of new reporting options - as a test - to see how they help. If you see a story you suspect is fake news, you can report is as a suspected fake news article and mark it as fake or send the person who posted it (or shared it) informing them you think it is fake. There's also a new system where Facebook will use feedback from the site's users to send stories to third-party fact-checking organisations. If they say a story is fake, it will be flagged as such in your news feed, and may be shown lower down than other stories. You'll also get a warning if you try to share the story: What is Pizzagate? Fake news is not always harmless. Recently, a man walked into Comet Ping Pong -- a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C. -- and fired a rifle. Dubbed, Pizzagate, the event came about because of fake stories that the pizzeria was a home for a child sex abuse ring that included Hilary Clinton and John Podesta. These fake stories have been circulating on the web and social networks for months, but although they have already been proven baseless and false, the conspiracy theories haven't gone away. The man who fired the rifle and refused to leave the premises until he was satisfied that there were no children being kept captive said he went there to "self-investigate" the stories. 5 Reasons to Move to Cloud ERP Right Now More from MYOB Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

And a 1965 turquoise Olivetti that would have the shine of a sports car after he was done with it.   Now, here came a customer displaying a Facit 1620, a stylish Swedish model, bought at an estate sale. The ribbon was dry as a bone, the keys unwilling to budge. “And you want me to do something about it?” the typewriter mechanic happily asked, adding it to his pile. The typewriter mechanic is always busy. In Philadelphia, Bryan Kravitz is among the last of a dying breed: a repairer of those wonderful machines that go click, clack, ding! “I’m the only one around,” Kravitz said Tuesday afternoon in his Mount Airy showroom. At least the only one listed in Philly who still answers his phone, as he likes to tell people. (It's true. I checked.) I’ve been planning on visiting the typewriter mechanic for a while. Sure, my old Royal needs work, but his window display had drawn me in. The display he keeps set up in a friend’s Queen Village storefront near Fourth and Bainbridge, where he has a pop-up repair shop most Fridays. From the window, it’s evident this is not your average repairman. He talks about the typewriters like they're beloved pets or favored children.   “This little cutie,” begins the description he wrote of a 1930 LC Smith & Corona. “Ingenious,” he said, simply, of a 1939 Remington. And, pfft, the 1924 Remington Portable never had to “resort to tricks” — sacrificing row of keys, for example — like wannabe portables. I was charmed. And even more so when I visited his shop. If the 67-year-old is not the very last typewriter mechanic, he’s surely the most poetic. “They’re specimens from a different era,” he said of the typewriters around him. “They are beautiful.” He sees his job as far more than just wiping away dust and dirt. “It’s making them live again,” he said, “so you see them again as working pieces of art.” Typewriters were not in the typewriter mechanic’s blood, but trade is. He was born into a family of South Philadelphia pioneers — hot dog pioneers. During the Depression, his grandmother Ida Kravitz opened one of the city’s earliest hot dog pushcarts at Fourth and South. When the war ended, his father, Lenny, took over the cart and it eventually grew into the famous Lenny’s Hot Dogs shops. Back then, typewriter repairman was not so unusual a calling. Indeed, Philly was home to the King of the Repairmen, Augustus Bundy, owner of Bundy Typewriter on Chestnut Street. For a time, Bundy’s was the country’s largest typewriter reseller. To drown out his many competitors, Augustus hired a nearly 7-foot giant named Big Mike. A walking advertisement, Big Mike was paid to parade down Chestnut Street in a French Foreign Legion uniform, cradling typewriters under each arm while bellowing out bargains. (Still thriving, Bundy's fixes Apple computers, no typewriters. Big Mike belongs to the ages.) Kravitz didn’t find his way to the profession until he traveled to California after graduating from Northeast High. He went to trade school after working in a printing factory and fell into a typewriter repair class. He was hooked. For a time, he was married and owned his own repair shop in Berkeley. Then he took business jobs. He missed typewriters.  After returning to Philly, the typewriter mechanic went back to his real love. A year and a half ago, he opened his showroom, Philly Typewriter, in a shared artists' space on Carpenter Lane (he’s there on Tuesdays and Saturdays) and decorated the Queen Village storefront (most Fridays from 4 to 6, next on March 17). The typewriter mechanic is a man of meticulousness. For our interview, he typed up notes. “Typewriter Tuesday,” it began. Light the window, he reminded himself, to cast the machines in soft and inviting light. And put out cheese and crackers. (Deep in his work, he forgot the cheese and crackers, for which he profusely apologized.) Also in his notes: “Who Uses Typewriters” (a long list including everyone from hipsters to lawyers filing divorce forms) and “Passing on the Knowledge” (he has two apprentices). Another one said, "Pockets of Interest, my enjoyment." It dealt with why he does what he  does. He plays Barbra Streisand records while he works and has the showroom set up like a classroom. A typewriter on each desk. His work awaiting, the typewriter mechanic smiled. “What could be more wonderful?” he asked. For the typewriter man, nothing much else is.

Roston - Mar 7, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Today Wikileaks released a cache of data codenamed ‘Vault7,’ claiming this is the single largest drop of confidential CIA documents ever. There are a total of 8,761 documents and files within this trove, and they detail a hidden world within the agency, one that operates with a fleet of hackers who work to help turn everyday gadgets like smartphones and smart TVs into covert surveillance devices. Wikileaks stated in its announcement today that, “The CIA has created, in effect, it’s ‘own NSA’ with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.” The CIA is said to have created a massive array of cyberweapons, ones that include software for hacking into smartphones, as well as exploits, malware, trojans, and more. This, of course, raises a very big issue — surveillance aside for a moment — about what happens when the agency loses control of its cyberweapons. “Once a single cyber ‘weapon’ is ‘loose,’” Wikileaks stated today, ‘it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.” The collective says that while it has released a lot of data, it has been careful not to distribute the ‘armed cyberweapons’ at this time, instead waiting for debate and discussion among experts about how to proceed with analyzing and disarming the software. Wikileaks also goes on to say that it has redacted ‘tens of thousands’ of ‘attack machines’ and targets located in the U.S, Latin America, and Europe. Among the disturbing analysis is the revelation that the CIA has developed tools that can transform smart TVs into covert surveillance tools. Samsung smart TVs are targeted in particular, with the targeting software having been a joint creation between the CIA and the UK’s MI5. The software is dubbed ‘Weeping Angel’ and works by putting the TV into a fake ‘Off’ mode, leading the owner to believe the TV is shut down. When in this mode, the software can then use the television’s microphone to record conversations and transmit those recordings to a CIA server via the target’s own Internet connection. The documents also reveal CIA interest in compromising in-vehicle systems for turning cars into remote assassination machines. Smartphone hacks enable the CIA to gather data on targets such as geolocation, text messages, audio recordings, and more. The agency paid particular attention to Apple’s mobile devices, creating software that is able to infiltrate and control iPhones and iPads, sending data back to the CIA. Some software was developed by other agencies, including ones in the UK, and by contractors. Android has likewise been targeted, as has Microsoft’s mobile OS. The documents also reveal extensive focus on messaging apps, and the CIA’s ability to get around the encryption used by WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Wiebo, Cloackman, and Confide. This is achieved by hacking the phones themselves and getting the messages directly from the handsets, entirely skipping the encryption aspect. Mobile devices aren’t the only target, of course; the documents also reveal the CIA’s ability to target WiFi routers and computers running major operating systems, including Linux. Windows users are subjected to CIA-sourced malware, which can be transmitted via air gap jumping, infected USB drives, image files, and more. The documents also reveal that the CIA has failed to uphold a deal that should have it disclosing vulnerabilities to affected companies, enabling them to fix the holes before rivals and hackers can exploit them. Instead, the CIA has kept secret various vulnerabilities and exploits it has discovered, allowing them to fester for other rival intelligence agencies and private collectives to find and abuse. These vulnerabilities are said to affect many entities and individuals, including ones as major as Congress and U.S. Cabinet members, among others. These hacking efforts aren’t limited to just the US, either; the documents also reveal that the Frankfurt US Consulate is a secret CIA base with massive hacking operations taking place. All of this, of course, is just a sliver of the information revealed by the mass of documents. If you’re feeling brave and have enough time on your hands, you can browse the documents here.

Bacon's Rebellion Reinventing Virginia for the 21st Century Skip to content Home About James A. Bacon Groveton The Blog Articles [email protected] Resources Energy ← Fostering the TNC Revolution Vehicle Miles Traveled: Where the Action Is → Tracking California’s Grand Experiment with Solar Posted on March 6, 2017 by James A. Bacon | 14 Comments California solar farm California is leading the nation’s transition from fossil fuels and nukes to renewable fuels, mostly solar power. The Golden State’s aggressive investment in solar energy has created such a glut of daytime electricity that solar wholesale prices literally drops to zero and such a shortage during the night that real-time prices surge as high as $1,000 per megawatt hour. Regulators and utilities are learning how to cope with these problems through battery storage, grid modernization and energy conservation. Hopefully, Virginia utilities and regulators are paying close attention as the Old Dominion defines its own approach to renewable energy. On the one hand, by going slowly, Virginia can learn from California’s mistakes and work-arounds. On the other, Virginia’s cautious approach to solar risks allowing other states crack the code first on how to generate reliable, lower-cost and green power, thus converting the price and quality of electricity from a competitive advantage to a disadvantage. In 2016 the average cost of electricity in Virginia was 8.88 cents per kilowatt hour, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In California, the cost was 14.88 cents per kilowatt hour, 40% higher. California is spending billions of dollars in giant test project in which the entire state economy is the subject. The great challenge with solar, as oft alluded to in Bacon’s Rebellion, is coping with intermittent nature of generation. Last month, notes the Wall Street Journal, Sempra Energy flipped the switch on a bank of 400,000 lithium-ion batteries installed by Virginia-based AES Corp. The batteries will smooth out power flows in San Diego’s solar-intensive electric grid. Meanwhile, Tesla, Inc., is supplying batteries to a Los Angeles-area network tied together in a microgrid of 100 office buildings and industrial properties. Reports the Journal: When [Edison International] needs more electricity on its system, the batteries would be able to deliver 360 megawatt hours of extra power to the buildings and the grid, enough to power 20,000 homes for a day, on short notice. At other times, the batteries would help firms hosting the arrays to cut their utility bills. Clearly, strategies exist for overcoming the variable and daylight-only production of solar panels. The big question is how much the batteries cost. And that tends to be a ticklish subject. As the WSJ noted regarding the Tesla/Edison International project in Los Angeles, “The companies declined to say how much the project would cost.” Broadly speaking, battery storage has two different uses. One is fine-tuning the electric grid, a function that exploits the ability of batteries to respond instantaneously to micro-fluctuations in voltage and frequency. The other is storing electric power until it is needed at a different time. In this second use, batteries compete with natural-gas peaker plants, which are essentially jet turbines that sit idle until needed. Unlike conventional power plants that ramp up and down slowly, gas peakers and batteries can respond quickly to changes in demand. Stored power from lithium-ion batteries can do the work of a natural-gas peaker plant at an average cost of between $284 and $581 a megawatt-hour, according to a December report by Lazard Ltd. In contrast, electricity from a new gas peaker plant costs between $155 and $227 a megawatt-hour, according to Lazard. (By comparison, the average retail price of electricity in Virginia is about $89 per megawatt hour.) Clearly, lithium-ion batteries are far too expensive at present to use on a large scale in Virginia as a peaking resource. But solar advocates hold out the hope that battery storage will decline in cost. Is that realistic? The lithium-ion battery chemistry may be reaching the limits of its potential, reports Fortune magazine in an article published yesterday. “The biggest proof may be in the spate of explosions now plaguing smartphone makers from Samsung to Apple, in part thanks to li-ons’ tendency to grow dendrites, metal strands that can cause short circuits.” John Goodenough, a co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery, claims to have developed a solid-state battery that replaces lithium with sodium, which, in theory, can hold three times more energy, charge quickly, and never explode. Commercialization of the technology is years away, however, warns Fortune. By way of comparison, Lithium ion batteries took a decade to move from the laboratory to the marketplace. When it comes to reducing CO2 emissions, Californians seem willing to pay any price. That approach will not sell politically in Virginia. But California is more than a Land of Fruits and Nuts. It has some of the most brilliant scientists, engineers and technologists in the world. If green power can be made economically competitive with fossil fuels and nuclear, California will figure it out. We Virginians should not necessarily emulate its example, but we should be paying attention.

You cite their cost of electricity at 14.88 cents per KWH and imply that’s because they’re using solar .. and then having to pay for non-solar at other times… but in the EIA reference you use -you’ll find this also: New England 18.44 Connecticut 19.02 Maine 15.68 Massachusetts 18.87 1 New Hampshire 18.68 Rhode Island 18.39 Vermont Graph 17.22 do you think those states are also “fruit and nuts” doing a “giant test” ? to what would you attribute the very similar high prices in the East? those high prices actually result in much higher adoption of energy efficient strategies.. which actually results in lower electricity usage – and less pollution and less coal ash piles.. In terms of storage – I agree.. it may be a while in coming and may take a long time to be price competitive with gas turbines.. but here’s the big kicker.. if storage ever gets cost-effective – what would keep widespread adoption of it in concert with solar – at the individual home or business level which in turn would forever change the current utility model of electricity generation. There is no question – right now -there would be massive adoption of solar in Virginia – even without cost-effective storage – if it were not for what boils down to the State protecting Dominion from market forces.. at the same time it supports opening up the taxi and health care industry … to the market. I think we ought to be honest that solar is not something that won’t succeed…in Virginia , it will.. where it is allowed to … How long can we point fingers at California as our excuse for our own refusal to let solar compete in Virginia. I think when our economy can challenge California – we could then point out their “flaws” … but as long as we base our own economy on the Federal Deficit and protecting Dominion’s monopoly – I think we’re more blathering blowhards than righteous market-force guys… James A. Bacon | March 6, 2017 at 1:42 pm | Log in to Reply Larry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to imply that solar was the reason for California’s high electricity rates. I’m sure there are many reasons. But that’s not the main point. The point is that when solar reaches a certain level of penetration, as it has in California, it causes major reliability problems, which in turn require expensive fixes. The lesson isn’t that California is doing things wrong — they may well be doing what’s right for them — but that Virginia can learn a lot by watching very closely what works and what doesn’t work in California. CleanAir&Water | March 6, 2017 at 1:50 pm | Log in to Reply CA has been trying, and is lowering cost from the Enron days … and those New England numbers are saving money for the state members of RGGI, that group VA declined to participate in. Here is another point of view about ‘waiting’. http://breakingenergy.com/2017/03/03/what-the-us-electricity-sector-can-learn-from-the-telecom-revolution/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=43854891&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8saGvWBzEGSn0yvJh4ciaHFBnUOKjSQUh3szhjVetlG30trArfSJ6-OVGcgUsGftQZI9f4FewsRu1_OFgp3bovetuNXQ&_hsmi=43854891 The American telecommunications story of grid defection and bypass can enlighten today’s utility system operators and regulators as they stand at the crossroads of choosing between using regulatory processes to cling to the past, or innovating in tandem with new technologies and new companies to deliver value to customers. In addition to delivering new value and markets, the new ways are cheaper and cleaner, too. I posted this for Senator Warner on his site. It is a comparison he should understand. As long as the ACP remains in VA’s future plans … VA’s choice is for “clinging to the past.” LarrytheG | March 6, 2017 at 2:01 pm | Log in to Reply Even on the reliability issue – I have my doubts that the problem is as big as it is said to be – because it’s the 6th biggest economy in the world (just behind Germany and the UK) and four times bigger than Virginia AND it has major military bases, and hundreds of large energy intensive companies that must have reliable power. They’d likely leave, in droves, if there were major reliability problems. take a look at this EIA map of California and it’s source of electricity, http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=CA What I do agree with – is that trying to incorporate more solar DOES present reliability issues.. that do have to be dealt with – and they are struggling with the gap between baseload and peak… covered by solar when soar is available and filling that gap when solar is not available. I suspect this is one of the reasons: CleanAir&Water | March 6, 2017 at 6:06 pm | Log in to Reply And Larry’s map looks at another way CA is thinking about how to deal with their grid … and use less. http://e360.yale.edu/features/in-the-face-of-trump-environmental-rollback-california-stands-in-defiance “Spurred by the nation’s strongest and most innovative building code, new buildings in California now use about 75 percent less energy than pre-code buildings, and have saved enough energy to head off construction of the equivalent of seven 500-megawatt natural gas-fired power plants. … “The state is also expanding its grid to neighboring states to increase the grid’s flexibility during times of production overcapacity. For example, daily electricity demand increases in Arizona when people get home from work, a time when California may have an overabundance of renewable energy that it could sell to Arizona. Because the sun sets in the two states at different times, peak electricity demand in Arizona (near the end of the day) may overlap with peak solar production in California (near the middle of the day).” And a man who owns a lot of Wyoming land wants to build wind to ship to CA .. Wyoming is difficult though Acbar | March 7, 2017 at 10:56 pm | Log in to Reply Wind power from Wyoming is something they COULD use out there in CA — IF that man can connect readily to a transmission line that’s on the western grid side of the Continental Divide. But building a new transmission line across the Rockies would require a huge, probably impossibly large, investment. Most of the wind power out west these days (and there’s a lot of it) is generated east of the Rockies and transmitted east into Texas or the Plains States. LarrytheG | March 7, 2017 at 6:20 am | Log in to Reply to add to the discussion here – lest anyone thinks California is lacking in electric power generation: Note also, besides the large number of gas plants – the abundance of hydro sites… of which only 4 are currently pump-storage. I do not see California as “experimenting” as much as I see them as a leader like they are in many areas and Virginia basically mired in protecting the Dominion monopoly and clinging stubbornly to old thinking and obsolescence that actually encourage wasteful consumption of energy – that’s ultimately harmful to ratepayers and taxpayers. Other states use for less electricity per capita. Our increased use of it – coal based – increases mercury deposition and coal ash issues. More gas use is already possible without adding as much pipeline capacity as proposed – yet this is where we are instead of where we should be. California is a state that economically vibrant – and p spending – and suppressing economic activity that would develop solar and wind … by essentially reserving it for Dominion – and putting obstacles in the way of others who would do it. I’ll take the California path and continue to regret having to live in a state that operates like Virginia.. who is really not looking ahead but rather trying to hold on to the past… to it’s own detriment. TooManyTaxes | March 7, 2017 at 3:25 pm | Log in to Reply California’s economy goes through wild swings – from enviable growth to dismal stagnation (sort of what has happened in Virginia after consulting cutbacks and sequestration). I also believe that the state and local treasuries are highly dependent on a very small number of taxpayers, most especially those with massive capital gains. The state is in good shape for now, but is burdened with enormous public pension debts and a crumbling infrastructure. Sometimes, California has some excellent ideas, but it also follows some foolish paths. What other state is making such a massive effort to bring in poor people, most with little or no education, from around the world. There is a difference between being merciful to people who have lived here without authorization for a long time and not caused trouble and fighting against any border control whatsoever. Whether renewables at any cost makes sense in the long run is an open question. All and all, but for the weather, I’d rather live in Virginia than California. Our government is much more thoughtful and less ideological, probably due in significant part to the Dillon Rule. Not to say there’s no room for improvement. TBill | March 7, 2017 at 12:20 pm | Log in to Reply Don’t forget CA imports a lot of power, including relatively low cost hydro from Oregon/Wash, and from other sources from other states. LarrytheG | March 7, 2017 at 2:35 pm | Log in to Reply check the map Tbill .. and check out this list of power plants in California: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_California It looks like California has a LOT of power plants including more than 40 of them producing more than 600 MW alone might be interesting to actually know how much they “import” but I’m not sure that should be viewed any differently than we might looking at Virginia “importing” from PJM. the bigger point is – is California having reliability problems by trying to incorporate more solar than they can or should? Acbar | March 7, 2017 at 10:51 pm | Log in to Reply TBill, you are correct: when the sun isn’t shining, CA has more load than it can serve efficiently by non-solar means; the high cost of electricity in CA reflects the high cost (old cycling and peaker units) generation they have to run to serve all that load (because they don’t have enough hydro or nuclear or even coal and gas to supply it at lower cost). The western grid has enough capacity but the wrong kinds — including, at this time, too much solar capacity in CA (so much so that they have to dump power in the daytime, yet of course they don’t have any solar after sunset) — this is what happens when you let politicians, not the market, prescribe what’s to be built. Yes there is a lot of hydro out there but those are mostly old, small dams and the lake levels are depleted quickly if used steadily. There is geothermal also; again, small units and not nearly enough in the aggregate. There is natural gas, but the gas supplies are mainly in the south around San Diego and there is not enough gas fired generation (or the pipeline capacity to serve more) in the urban load center from LA to SF/Sacramento to carry that amount of load. Acbar | March 7, 2017 at 8:28 pm | Log in to Reply I am not as sanguine about CA. CA is a classic product of government interference in the market — in three ways: 1 – Land use. Cheap government water has led to land use and population distribution patterns that are unsustainable for the California climate (and will get worse with GW). 2 – Electricity generation Part I. Cheap government hydroelectric power (much of it in the Pacific NW but still part of the California/West Coast grid) got people used to cheap electricity for farming as well as urban life, then they tried to fill in with peakers and nukes. The explosion in gas-fired generation is a relatively recent phenomenon. 3 – Electricity generation Part II. California tried to set up its own wholesale bulk power marketplace. California, for all its size and economic strength, is not an isolated grid, and you cannot operate an effective wholesale energy market when people within the same grid don’t have to participate. In this case, the market, the western grid, is defined by the weak connections that cross the Rockies; the CA market was ripe for market scams and manipulations, which is exactly what happened when Enron and others began playing big-dollar games there in the 90s. They fixed the worst of that but they still have problems controlling the flows north-south, from the gas fields of southern CA and the hydro power of Oregon/Washington and the urban corridor from LA to SF. 4 – Electricity generation Part III. Now, on top of all that, you’ve got the big political push for renewables. I have nothing against renewable power where the wholesale marketplace supports it, which is the case in large portions of the country including Virginia. But, CA went out there in the 80s and pushed “cogeneration” with extremely high calculations of “avoided cost based” payments to developers, and then, when the new trend towards solar and wind took off, got 100%+ behind renewables, and what you have today is the result of that “+.” The market did not ask for all that solar; the CA government did, demanding that the utilities subsidize it and buy its output even in hours when it cannot be resold to the market. This totally predictable (and predicted years ago) solar glut was entirely self inflicted. Thanks to the PJM wholesale markets (and similar ones in NY and New England and the Midwest), which function efficiently, we have avoided the worst of that mess in the urban East. California is simply a mess. Again, it’s a perfect demonstration of why the government should not interfere with a functioning energy marketplace. You ask about reliability. One thing CA does have is access to the hydro power of the Pacific NW. Hydro is by its nature extremely quick-start, and can be matched well with solar fluctuations. But there isn’t nearly enough hydro power to sustain the West Coast load after dark, hour after hour. The water behind those dams is a precious resource for quick-start uses and, except during the rainy season, needs to be rationed for when it’s really needed. So, ramping power is not lacking, but cycling power from the likes of gas-fired plants is in desperately short supply. Thus, the high night-time prices! TooManyTaxes | March 8, 2017 at 11:05 am | Log in to Reply Both legislators and regulators make poor decisions about the market. Adopting laws or regulations to protect competition (not competitors) and protect consumers in the areas of health, safety and fair dealing and disclosure certainly has a place. But picking technology or mandating market share is likely to wind up screwing the public and trampling the public interest. A good example is cellular. Europe picked GSM. The U.S. and some other countries allowed the market to work. We had GSM, TDMA and CDMA. Over time, TDMA faded out. Now we have LTE, picked not by the FCC or Congress, but by the market. The U.S. approach is better as it relies on market forces. The same logic should occur for electricity. Forcing fossil fuel plants to compete against renewables and requiring different types of renewables to compete against each other will provide better results and better prices than if the VSCC or the GA make selections. What may be needed in Virginia is an active intervenor to challenge both Dominion and the staff’s positions. Virginia Chamber of Commerce? LarrytheG | March 8, 2017 at 7:49 am | Log in to Reply re: ” CA is a classic product of government interference in the market ” I’m a little amused here… do you mean as opposed to the “govt interference” in Virginia’s energy “market”? Au Contraire! your 1. – while perhaps correct expands this discussion in huge ways! 2. – electricity for farming? percent of total? more than 1 or 2 %? 3. – that’s a pretty complex conundrum.. not too sure if it can be viewed so simply 4. re: ” But there isn’t nearly enough hydro power to sustain the West Coast load after dark, hour after hour.” there is a LOT of hydro in the west – way, way more than in the east … those mountains trap west to east weather and in winter build 10-20 feet of snow. it’s true that the drought harmed that but it’s also true that there are more than 40 dams in California alone – 5 are pump-storage and others may well be retrofittable. but the big thing is that California – like the Northeast States do – can affect usage by price.. California is NOT the highest-priced electricity in the US and higher price incentivizes demand side conservation… which depending on your point of view is not necessarily a bad thing since pollution results from usage and the higher the usage the more pollution – something that California cannot have west of it’s mountains that create inversion layers. Finally, California is the 7th largest economy in the world – and has hundreds of businesses and govt installation that MUST have RELIABLE power – and apparently DO GET IT… I just have more faith in California than I do Virginia in moving forward and finding solutions to the solar/nightime issue… and I favor California’s involvement in the market over Virginia’s complicit discouragement of a market if Dominion does not want or like it. I see that as far more harmful than California’s approach and am amazed that we don’t view Virginia’s protection of a mega-monopoly as also “harmful interference” in the “market” as it clearly is… with solar in Virginia. Perhaps there is some middle ground between California’s approach and Virginia’s approach.. but Virginia’s approach right now is not in the best interests of Virginians into the future.. in my opinion. Dominion is basically staking the future in fossil fuels .. and California in renewables.. Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakluma, File) By Marisa Kendall | mkendall@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 7, 2017 at 5:01 pm | UPDATED: March 8, 2017 at 3:49 am SAN FRANCISCO — With Uber in the midst of an intense public backlash over allegations of sexual harassment, outrageous leadership behavior and a pattern of flouting the rules at all costs, CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Tuesday he is looking for a second in command. A week after Kalanick acknowledged he needs to “fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” the company founder said he will hire a chief operating officer — effectively surrendering to an outsider a portion of the power he holds over his $68 billion empire. But some industry experts wonder whether a new executive will be able to change the offensive aspects of Uber’s aggressive culture without sacrificing the spirit that drove the company to become the world’s most valuable startup. “Hopefully that’s done with a velvet glove and not a sledgehammer,” said Michael Greeley, co-founder of Boston-based Flare Capital Partners and former board member for the National Venture Capital Association. “You’d hate to see the essence of that creativity get crushed.” It’s a classic Silicon Valley struggle that many companies have faced — when to give a founder freedom to realize his or her innovative dream, and when to hire “adult supervision” to lay down ground rules. Related Articles Report: Uber used secret program to evade law enforcement Exclusive: Uber to apply for state permit to test self-driving cars Uber CEO Travis Kalanick ‘ashamed’ after video shows him yelling at driver In Uber’s case, the San Francisco-based ride-hailing company’s hand was forced by a series of embarrassing scandals over the past two weeks. Now the success of the startup as it gears up for a future initial public offering, and Kalanick’s continued place at its helm, depend on how it handles this pivotal move. Kalanick revealed his plans to hire a COO in a one-sentence blog post Tuesday: “This morning I told the Uber team that we’re actively looking for a Chief Operating Officer: a peer who can partner with me to write the next chapter in our journey.” Last week the CEO promised to get “leadership help” after a video of his argument with an Uber driver over fares went viral. That video followed a blog post by a former Uber engineer accusing the company of protecting a manager who sexually harassed her, a report by The New York Times that found managers had harassed and threatened employees, and the forced resignation of a senior executive who had not disclosed he was accused of sexual harassment while working for Google. “There’s an enormous amount of risk here,” said Steve Blank, an expert on startup companies and an adjunct professor at Stanford University. “The question is: How many billions of dollars of valuation is lost for every one of these stories?” Whoever Uber hires to work with Kalanick likely will start by laying down new guidelines such as codes of conduct, hiring policies, travel policies and procedures for green-lighting new projects, Greeley said. That may mean Uber’s most off-the-wall ideas, such as its “flying cars,” will be reined in. Ben Narasin, a partner at Portola Valley-based venture capital firm Canvas Ventures, suggested a strong female leader such as Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer or former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao could help Uber re-shape its male-dominated company culture. It’s not uncommon for Silicon Valley companies to hire professional executives to replace or guide struggling founders who may have had little prior leadership experience. But experts agree the role makes for a challenging and delicate hire. Uber’s future COO can succeed only if he or she gets along with Kalanick, and if Kalanick gives the new executive enough power and autonomy to instill change. Google in 2001 brought in Eric Schmidt — who had experience in top executive roles at Sun Microsystems and Novell — to  help founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Page, who had been CEO, and Schmidt reportedly became close friends and successful business partners, and 10 years later, Schmidt handed the reins back to Page. Facebook has had similar success with Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who was tapped in 2008 to provide guidance to young CEO Mark Zuckerberg. That plan didn’t go so well for Apple, which in 1983 tried to bring order to the company by hiring former Pepsi President John Sculley as CEO. A disagreement between Sculley and founder Steve Jobs ultimately forced Jobs out of his own company in 1985. It was more than 10 years before he came back. At this point, it’s unlikely Uber’s investors would try to replace Kalanick, Blank said, because the tech industry tends to associate success with abrasive personality traits reminiscent of leaders like Jobs.

Even if Uber’s investors wanted to kick Kalanick out, they may not be able to. Uber’s board has three insider members — Kalanick, co-founder Garrett Camp and senior vice president of global operations Ryan Graves, according to a person familiar with the board’s structure. The remaining four seats are occupied by Arianna Huffington, Bill Gurley of Benchmark, David Bonderman of TPG Capital, and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund, the person said. While it’s unclear exactly how much voting power Kalanick, Camp and Graves have — as a private company, Uber can keep those types of details close to the vest — the person said it’s unlikely investors could replace Kalanick unless at least one of the other insiders agreed to the shake-up. Some investors argue replacing a founder can starve a startup of its ability to innovate. A study by PitchBook Data last year determined founding CEOs lead their companies to initial public offerings or acquisitions faster than hired CEOs, and secure higher valuations with less funding. “Founders build phenomenal, outsized companies,” Narasin said, speaking for himself, and not on behalf of his firm. “Hired guns seldom do.” Tags:  Startups Transportation Travis Kalanick Uber Marisa Kendall Marisa Kendall is a technology reporter for The Mercury News, where she covers venture capital and startups.

The 8,771 documents, which were published by WikiLeaks Tuesday and dubbed "Year Zero" by the organization, encompass "the entire hacking capacity of the CIA." A spokesman for the CIA Jonathan Liu said the agency does not comment "on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents." In a statement, WikiLeaks said the CIA "lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal." The group said the cyber tools were disseminated among some former U.S. government hackers, one of whom gave the material to Wikileaks. ""Year Zero" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of "zero day" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones," WikiLeaks said. WikiLeaks also claims the CIA possesses a library of hacking malware employed by other states, including Russia, that it can use to leave behind false "fingerprints" to cover up its exploits and mislead investigators. The actual cyber weapons themselves weren't included in the document dump, though WikiLeaks said it may release them at a later time, when "a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published." A scheduled press conference to announce the release was postponed after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange came under attack on social media, the group said on Twitter. WikiLeaks said the source of the documents handed them over because they think a national conversation needs to be had about "whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers."

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Sun-Times Editorial Board Follow @csteditorials The revised travel ban President Donald Trump signed Monday might be somewhat easier to defend in court than its predecessor, but it is unwisely rooted in fear and undermines American foreign policy in the Mideast. The executive order, a trimmed-back version of an earlier one that brought chaos at airports, numerous lawsuits and international furor, will put on hold new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and temporarily slam the door on America’s refugee program. EDITORIAL Follow @csteditorials Although it is in a different form, Trump’s new order shares the same unfortunate conceptual underpinning as its more-egregious predecessor, which Trump signed on Jan. 27 only to blocked by a federal appeals court: Even people who in no way are linked to criminal activity are suspect simply because of their religion and nation of origin. That is not a message America should send to the rest of the world. It is wholly at odds with the very spirit of an open and widely admired nation. The corner Trump has painted himself into is clear from the one nation that was dropped from the original travel ban: Iraq. The United States needs Iraq to be a strong ally in the war against the Islamic State. Had Iraq remained on the list, it would have severely undercut officials in that country who are helping to fight ISIS. Public sentiment would have turned against them. Similarly, the travel ban will win no friends — now or in the future — in the nations that remain on the list: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Nor will the ban help America enlist support from its Muslim-majority allies in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt. If Trump wants Arab nations to enthusiastically rally around his plans to stand up to Iranian influence, help fight the Islamic State, help negotiate an Israeli-Palestinian peace and create safe zones in Syria, he can’t afford to embarrass and insult them with executive orders. Even Nigeria, which is not included in the ban but has a large Muslim population, is criticizing the travel ban. The new ban, like its predecessor, also is opposed by American technology companies that draw talent from around the world. More than 100 of those companies joined a court brief against the first version of the ban, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Airbnb and Uber have gone on record against the updated version as well. Trump simply doesn’t acknowledge that strict screening measures already are in place for refugees fleeing a horrible war and that no one from the nations involved in the travel ban has been involved in terrorist attacks or mass shootings in America. According to the Associated Press, a draft assessment by the Department of Homeland Security found that citizenship is an “unlikely indicator” of a threat to America. To understand where the executive order came from, look no farther than the campaign trail. Trump and his surrogates promised a Muslim ban, and there is little even in the revised executive order to indicate that no longer is their goal. Instead, every indication is that Trump is motivated by domestic politics rather than a concern for national security. Senior aides acknowledged the latest travel ban’s signing was delayed to avoid a busy news cycle and give it more attention. If the order was really about national security — remember Trump himself earlier said America was at risk every day a ban was not in place — would it have been put on hold so that it could get better news coverage? No, Trump signed the order to appeal to his base, which is why it is not a carefully crafted policy designed to promote national security. Mayor Rahm Emanuel was correct to call it “different packaging intended to achieve the same result.” It’s no surprise that the boisterous fanfare surrounding the signing of the first executive order was nowhere to be found for its shamefaced successor. Trump inked the order quietly and was out of sight when it was announced. And no wonder. Even now, the Trump administration has no plausible justification other than to suggest Muslims are inherently dangerous and can never be fully trustworthy American visitors or citizens. America can — and must — do better than that. Send letters to letters@suntimes.com. Tweets by @csteditorials # Donald Trump tweets donald trump Washington D.C.

 Why I quit Uber: A response to Susan Fowler's story Sean Cervera, LinkedIn Mar. 7, 2017, 7:51 PM 23,618 facebook linkedin twitter email print Glassdoor/Uber Sean Cervera is a former Uber employee who worked on its diversity and inclusion team. He's now at LinkedIn where he posted his reflections on his time at Uber. They are republished here with permission. Over the past week, countless people and esteemed publications have reached out to me, to see if I would validate Susan’s horrific story and experience at Uber, make a public statement about Diversity at Uber or explain why I left Uber after 5-6 short months. While I have no intentions of reiterating Susan’s experience or sharing private details about my experience at Uber, I thought I would do my best to shed some light on a few topics. Yes, you are correct. I supported Diversity Initiatives at Uber. I was recruited to Uber through a series of weekend meet and greets, case study exercises and interviews. I fell in love with their mission to revolutionize transportation and create access for ALL people. My role at Uber changed 4-5 times over my 5 months or so. I was shifted from Tech Recruiting to R4R (Recruiting Recruiters) to Leadership Recruiting back to Leading R4R as Uber tried to double the size of its tech recruiting team. When interviewing, I was told that they would love to leverage my background in Diversity and make that a big portion of my job. How could I say no to the Silicon Valley Billion Dollar Unicorn/Darling? After being told to remove diversity from my title and description on my LinkedIn Profile by HR, I realized that Diversity Recruiting and my scope may not overlap as much as I had expected. Understanding that the only thing that is constant is change, I expected this. #startuplife After meeting with the Diversity Lead and sharing my frustrations, I was given a 10% allocation to Diversity & appointed on a “board” of 4-5 people, who were filled with passionate, diversity champions and equality architects. After a month or so, I realized that Uber’s commitment to Diversity was easier said than done. They had hired one of the most talented, vocal, inspiring and dedicated D&I professionals but his role was in constant flux as well. A commitment to Diversity comes in countless forms, where hiring the Head of D&I is the first step followed by a series of actions like building out a team, defining diversity, ERG management but more importantly, executive buy-in and support. Diversity should be a strategic investment and priority for all businesses, as companies do not succeed without people from ALL backgrounds. And this has to come from the top down. Uber lacked this commitment from executives. A head of D&I can only be as effective as the leadership staff allows them to be. Upon my departure, I wrote a two page email to some of the E-staff members explaining why I was leaving and the issues we were facing as a recruiting organization (I CC’ed myself), with diversity being at the forefront. I called out specific issues, verbiage, unprofessional behavior and so on. I did not receive a single response. This was me trying one last time. While I am not here to validate Fowler’s story, I can somewhat confirm that Diversity & Inclusion remains a crucial area of opportunity for Uber, from my personal experience. We all perceive things differently. I applaud Uber for taking the right steps and taking immediate action on this, hopefully all authentic. I hope they live up to their word and I understand the issues with Huffington leading the audit. It’s at least a step in the right direction. We all make mistakes. What defines us is how we react, tackle and overcome. Let me reiterate, there are countless Uber employees who care about diversity and equality. I saw Uber attending the Lesbians Who Tech summit, and was so incredibly proud. Imagine the questions and concerns. They stood firm and personified a commitment to diversity. Uber has hired incredible people, which is a majority of their employee base. So please, don't assume that all Uber employee's share the mentality or view points as those depicted in articles. If you take anything from Susan’s story, I hope that it’s the fact that we live in a world that is far less equal and inclusive than we would like to think. That Susan is not alone. I applaud Susan for her courage, as sharing this story is far from easy. What happened to her is horrific and unjustifiable. More importantly, it’s illegal. I want to ensure you that Susan’s experience does not represent the environments of all tech companies. By any means. The Google’s, LinkedIn’s, Facebook’s, Airbnb’s and Apple’s of the world have dedicated countless resources, funds and have vocal leaders who have taken a stance on what is right and just. But we have all struggled. LinkedIn is incredibly blessed to have leaders like Kathy Goss & Sandy Hoffman who consistently stand up for what is right and challenge the status quo. Startups like Stripe, Asana, Atlassian, Hired and Earnest are in the process of building out their teams and initiatives even though their employee size is far from Uber’s. Companies like Slack just organically built it in their process from the get go. People care. Companies care. Silicon Valley has struggled, don’t get me wrong, but Diversity will not be fixed overnight. It is a strategic commitment for the lifetime of any organization. Diversity matters to so many people and is an integral part of tech companies cultures, missions and visions. People don’t realize how difficult diversity truly is. We’ve been fighting for equality since the inception of this nation and are still far from truly achieving it. We talk about diversity. We advocate for equality. We are fighting to create environments where you can be your authentic self. Don’t get me wrong, no company has nailed down Diversity and Inclusion. We all struggle. But more importantly, we all keep fighting and we take ownership when we fall. Diversity is hard. Diversity is difficult. But it is about creating access, opportunity and empowerment. And this is worth the battle. I have chosen a career in Diversity because I have seen ignorance flourish. I have experienced discrimination. People’s worth and the calibration of their talent should be determined by their drive, their passion, their effort, their resilience, their ability and their potential, not by the color of their skin, who they dare to love, their gender or gender identity, their age or military service, their disability or where they grew up. Diversity is powerful and the moment we embrace and celebrate it, we make steps toward creating workplaces that resemble our users and our members. If you have gone through life without fear of being judged for your DNA, have been asked to leave a restaurant because you hold hands with someone of the same sex, sexually harassed or if you have been told to be silent because you are misinterpreting the actions of top performers, then consider yourself #blessed. Because countless people face these struggles, every single day. People are consistently being limited because of the box they check on a Self-Id form. This is reality. Our reality. Susan’s experience is reality. So stand up. Be an Ally. Fight for the Equality of All People. I challenge Uber to do the following: Take ownership and apologize Complete an HR Audit with an external, non-board member, unbiased entity Survey ALL employees - Seek to Understand External communications that are not forced or requested to be sent out Conduct Diversity All Hands. Give employees a channel to speak their mind, channel their thoughts and ask questions. We did a #BlackLivesMatter all hands at LinkedIn, and it was one of the powerful 2 hours of my career. Listen Develop & Invest in your D&I team Invest in external partners Define Diversity and Inclusion for Uber View this as a massive learning opportunity for all of Uber’s E Staff Talk about this OPENLY Reach out and speak to D&I leaders Again, thank you Susan for sharing your story. I hope that everyone finds their voice, and stands up for what is right. It takes a single person to change the entire game. It takes a single person to shed light on the social injustices of our systems and processes. Speak up. Be proud. And know that being Diverse should never isolate you. Be who you are. The world is a better place because of it. And always remember, no matter what others say, you Belong. As MLK once said, never lose hope.

A new unconfirmed rumor is now claiming as much, and it's apparently based on "an internal Google document". The nature of that documentation hasn't been shared because it would put the source of this leak at risk, allegedly. While we don't get a picture of said document, we are told that "the language used presents the removal of the jack as a matter of fact" - so this isn't something that Google is just considering at the moment, instead the decision has already been made. That said, all of this comes from only one single source, and the information hasn't been verified by others, keep that in mind. Google Pixel XL So it's possible that this will happen, but there's also a small chance that it won't - maybe this document is old and the strategy has changed since. If the jack goes, it will be pretty ironic since Google took a stab at Apple's removal of the port at the Pixels' unveiling event. Also, this will be sure to alienate spec-chasers even more from the Pixel line, following quite a few outrages regarding the two devices that are now out (think bezels, lack of stereo speakers and water-resistance). According to past rumors, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL should 'stay premium' and come with a focus on photography just like their predecessors, probably the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, and maybe even water and dust resistance - that was still 'on the table' last we checked.

Twitter Facebook Optus teams with Cisco for managed business communications services Optus, Cisco reveal new collaboration Stuart Corner (Computerworld) 08 March, 2017 09:48 - - - - print email Comments Optus has announced a range of Cisco-based business services covering contact centre, collaboration, managed Wi-Fi and video-conferencing to be provided under what the two companies say is a new intensive collaboration to deliver the workplace of the future. They announced the new offerings and their new relationship at Cisco Live in Melbourne for which Optus is the diamond sponsor and communications provider. The managing director of Optus Business, John Paitaridis, said that Optus’ involvement in the event was replacing its own annual Vision events. “We found the convergence of our capabilities so symbiotic with what Cisco has been building that we decided to go all in with Cisco Live and not do Vision this year,” he said, adding: “I think Vision will be back in the future, probably in a refreshed format.” The new partnership follows the two companies announcing in March 2016 that they would jointly invest $12 million over three years in the local development of capabilities focused on cyber security, cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the network of the future. They said the aim was “to accelerate the development of new technological capabilities to support Australian business and government to become more agile in the innovation economy.” Paitaridis said the partnership with Cisco was the largest single technology partnership in the company’s 25 year history. “We have over 1000 people certified in Cisco technologies,” he said. “On average three to five certifications per individual, We have a deep domain Cisco capability.” Cisco VP for Australia and New Zealand, Ken Boal, explained the rationale for the partnership’s focus on the workplace saying: “The workplace experience is still the number one challenge limiting workplace productivity. Customers are not enjoying the promise of greater productivity to the extent that they could, so Optus and Cisco saw an enormous opportunity to take the latest and greatest technology capabilities and deliver those as a service.” While digital transformation has been a hot issue for some time, Boal said there had been a change in focus by businesses. “We have seen the conversation move from the ‘why should I drive digital business transformation’ to ‘what should I actually transform in my organisation and how do I go about it’. “I am also seeing a shift in the marketplace to make sure they have the right digital foundations in place across networks, security capabilities to ensure they are digitising on a solid foundation.” Read more Government commits to funding ACCAN He said customers were starting to ask Cisco if it could provide these platforms as services through partners. “That has been a consistent ask and something we have been working comprehensively on with Optus over the past few years but it has really gone from simmer to boil in terms of the overall partnership.” Paitaridis said Optus and Cisco were focussed on “creating network-enabled ICT and services that equip Australian organisations with the connectivity and collaboration they need to succeed in today’s fast changing marketplace, which includes the workplaces and workspaces their employees use.” He added: “The new services and technologies we have launched with Cisco are designed for the workplace of the future, enabling organisations to re-imagine the way they work, empower users to be more productive, engage with customers in new ways, increase teamwork and efficiencies, and reduce cost and complexity.” Optus announced four new or upgraded services: Read more Telstra bets big on LTE-Broadcast Optus Business Contact-Centre-as-a-Service This has been upgraded with “interactive voice response for call steering, self-service and precision routing to connect callers with the most appropriately skilled agent.” It also integrates digital-enabled channels, including web chat, social media engagement and email to enhance customer interactions. Cisco Spark managed by Optus Business The Cisco Spark, business collaboration service is integrated with Optus Unified-Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) and with Optus’ mobile, data and voice networks, and “leverages the Cisco-Apple collaboration through Optus’ strengths in mobile, Wi-Fi and collaboration [so] customers receive a heightened collaboration experience.” Read more Telstra outlines plans for its ‘network of the future’ Paitaridis said also “You will soon see some announcements from Apple, Cisco and Optus around mobility and machine to communications around the Jasper platform.” (Jasper is a company, acquired by Cisco, that provides a service for the global management of SIMs embedded in M2M devices.) Cisco Meraki fully managed by Optus Business Optus Business will manage the initial deployment and provide ongoing assurance, change and configuration to enterprise Wi-Fi networks based on Cisco’s Meraki managed Wi-Fi technology. Optus Video-Conferencing-as-a-Service Optus VCaaS will be developed “in the near future” to provide customers with a hosted video conferencing bridge service that will extend UCaaS to allow customers to perform multi-party video conferences both within their organisation and externally with other organisations using meeting room video units as well as software clients like Cisco Jabber. • Optus provides ‘Workplace of the Future’ to South West TAFE Optus also announced that it had equipped 15 “intelligent tailored smart platforms” for almost 5000 students across the Warrnambool, Hamilton and Portland campuses of Victoria’s South West TAFE. Each classroom has been fitted with audience response and video conferencing technology that includes Cisco WebEx and Jabber. Campus servers have also been moved onto the Cisco Meraki Wi-Fi network.

Nikki Kahn / The Washington Post via Getty Images Dozens of major U.S. companies have joined a "friend of the court" brief supporting transgender student Gavin Grimm in the Supreme Court case G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, the LGBTQ-rights group Human Rights Campaign (HRC) announced Thursday morning. Grimm, a transgender boy, filed a suit against the Virginia school board alleging it violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 by denying him to use the bathroom that corresponds with his gender identity. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in his case on March 28. "Diversity and inclusion are essential features of amici's businesses, and recruiting and retaining the best employees—including those in or allied with the transgender community—is a critical component of their diversity missions," the amicus brief states. The 53 companies that signed on to the brief, which HRC plans to submit Thursday, include Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Gap, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Spotify and Twitter. "These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America's leading businesses have their backs," HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement. "Across the country, corporate leaders are speaking out because they know attacking transgender youth isn't just shameful—it also puts the families of their employees and customers at risk."

Ahead of the court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 landmark case that made same-sex marriage the law of the land, 379 U.S. companies signed a brief in support of same-sex marriage.

"There were a number of canards spread and attempts were made to create an impression that there would be an apocalypse...the economy would collapse and GDP would plummet. Some people were sure to bear the brunt of his decision. But nothing of this sort happened and India is on a path of fast-paced development," Modi said in Dahej after inaugurating ONGC Petroadditions Ltd's (OPaL) Rs 27,000 crore plant. The latest GDP data released by the Central Statistical Organization revealed that India had achieved 7% GDP growth in the October-December quarter. Modi cited a galaxy of global corporate giants like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bangladesh Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and others who have lauded demonetization decision. "Today, the entire world is seeing this decision with respect," Modi said to a thunderous applause. The PM said that all sectors—be it financial or social- would ultimately benefit when black money is squeezed out of the economy.

Seemingly legitimate, the release of almost 9000 documents will be viewed through political as much as national security prisms. WikiLeaks, increasingly denounced as a tool of Moscow, is a key player in the months-long dispute in which Trump has mocked and ridiculed the agencies. Related Content WikiLeaks releases thousands of 'Vault 7' documents it says come from the CIA Obama administration rushed to preserve intelligence of Russian election hacking But as commander-in-chief Trump is required to address the document dump as the most embarrassing breach of national security since Edward Snowden leaked a mountain of classified documents in 2013 and, before that, Chelsea Manning leaked about three-quarters of a million classified and other sensitive documents in 2010 . The White House, the Pentagon and the CIA were caught off guard by a WikiLeaks statement that it was about to upload the documents, which it has codenamed Vault 7. Advertisement Acutely embarrassed, the only response from the CIA was a terse: "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents." Apparently the first in a series, WikiLeaks said that the 8761 documents, which were dated from 2013 to 2016, came from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Centre for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link On the campaign trail and in office Donald Trump has been repeatedly wrong-footed by leaks on his Russian connections and those of his associates. Photo: AP Describing their contents as "malware, viruses, Trojans and weaponised 'zero day' exploits", WikiLeaks said the files developed by a CIA unit known as the Engineering Development Group, were designed to harness vulnerabilities in Apple's iPhone, Google's Android software and Samsung TV sets. WikiLeaks said the exploits were capable of bypassing popular encryption-enabled applications like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram.  "At first glance [the files are] probably legitimate or contains a lot of legitimate stuff, which means somebody managed to extract a lot of data from a classified CIA system and is willing to let the world know that," Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, told The Washington Post. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have stoked the fires of hatred and distrust. Photo: AP Trump has been infuriated by a torrent of leaks from across government, but especially from within the intelligence agencies on investigations into links between himself and his election campaign team with Russia. In July 2016 WikiLeaks became a controversial player in the US presidential election when it released 20,000 embarrassing emails that had been hacked from Democratic Party computers, creating uproar on the campaign trail. Speaking at the time from Ecuador's embassy in London, where he has taken refuge for years, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange denied early suspicion that the Russian government or its agents were responsible for the DNC (Democratic National Committee) hacking – but the combined US intelligence agencies concluded that the hacking was part of a multi-pronged Kremlin plot to help Trump win the election and to discredit US democracy. Trump celebrated the leaks, declaring "I love WikiLeaks" as he read from a sheaf of the Democratic emails at a rally in the last weeks of the campaign. For months he refused to accept that Russia was involved – even as he jokingly urged Moscow to mount a search for thousands of Hillary Clinton emails that had been processed through her controversial private email server when she was US secretary of state. On the campaign trail and in office Trump has been repeatedly wrong-footed by leaks on his Russian connections and those of his associates.  He was forced to sack campaign manager Paul Manafort after allegations that he had received millions of dollars from pro-Moscow politicians in Ukraine.  In February he sacked his national security adviser Michael Flynn after he was revealed to have lied about his dealings with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. And last week Attorney-General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from any Justice Department deliberations on intelligence agency and congressional investigations of the Russian links because Sessions had failed to disclose that he too had met the ambassador. During a candidates' debate in October, just days after the intelligence agencies' declaration that the Democratic hack was the work of Moscow, Trump pushed back: "They like to say the Russians did it. They think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia." As the scope of a multi-agency investigation into aspects of Trump's Russia connections became known, president-elect Trump became sharply critical of the agencies – mocking their failures in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and dismissing the need for himself to have a daily intelligence briefing on the grounds that he was "a smart person". The leaks have continued, including indications that the FBI is increasingly confident about the veracity of aspects of a dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent, which alleges that Russia had been "assisting Trump for at least five years" and that the Kremlin had recorded a so-called sex tape during Trump's 2013 visit to Moscow which it would use to compromise him as president of the US.  Within days of Trump's inauguration there were reports that the agencies were withholding sensitive information because Trump was not to be trusted and might disclose it to Moscow – and in what read as a Trump threat to all the agencies, The New York Times reported that he had enlisted a billionaire buddy with no intelligence experience to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the agencies. Trump's war with the agencies became more fraught on the weekend when senior former and current officials rejected his tweeted claim that former president Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower during the election campaign – which apparently was based on reports from Trump-loyal conservative media outlets.  And on Tuesday, after days of blanket denials, the White House seemed to be walking back the President's unequivocal assertion that Obama had issued such an order. When he was asked for the proof that Trump claimed he had of Obama's "order", presidential spokesman Sean Spicer said it wasn't a question of proof as a need for a congressional investigation.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 March 2017 by Military News Mantracourt launches a unique wireless, telemetry sensor system for hazardous areas (1888PressRelease) March 08, 2017 – Mantracourt, a leader in high performance measurement electronics, has launched an intrinsically safe version of its established T24 wireless telemetry sensor system. The new X24 range of products is ATEX and IECEx approved for Zones 1 & 2 and was developed after feedback from existing users of the T24 system, many of whom wanted to extend this versatile system into hazardous areas. In the field, X24 has been found to be particularly suited to the petrochemical and industrial processing industries. Alongside its ATEX / IECEx status, modularity is the key feature. The X24 system comprises 3 products that are certified for use in hazardous areas – the X24-HD handheld display unit, X24-ACMI-SA cased transmitter and X24-SAe OEM transmitter. These new products currently operate with strain bridge inputs and gather and transmit data from force, weight, torque and pressure sensors. Being fully compatible with Mantracourt’s T24 system, the data is transmitted to T24 receivers within the safe zone. This compatibility also means that the X24 system can be retrofitted, so companies can extend its existing T24 wireless network into hazardous areas, reducing installation costs and providing quick setup. All three units display many of the notable features seen in equivalent products in the T24 system including high resolution/low noise electronics, long battery life of up to 5 years, proprietary license-free 2.4 GHz radio and a system range of up to 800m. However, new X24 products are manufactured with intrinsically safe electronics and are approved for use in explosive atmospheres Zone 1 and Zone 2, with the X24-SAe extending to dust Zones 21 and 22. The transmitter module, X24-ACMi-SA measures strain bridge input and delivers it to the T24 receivers in the safe zone, or X24-HD in the hazardous area. It is housed in an environmentally sealed IP67 enclosure with battery holder for two Lithium Energiser L91 AA batteries. The X24-HD is a lightweight, portable design and certified to IP67. With simple and intuitive button control it receives data and displays data from the remote transmitter module such as X24-ACMi-SA as well as any T24 transmitter. The product can display data from any transmitter detected or the operator can define up to 24 specific transmitters. The functionality is complemented by the ability to rename each channel to whatever you require. The X24-SAe is a product specifically for OEM sensor manufacturers. This transmitter, comprising a PCB board with antenna measures strain bridge input and transmits data to X24 and T24 receivers. The PCB module provides OEMs and those who supply approved strain bridge sensor products with a quick route to manufacture. Once in the safe zone, users of the system have access to the complete T24 product range. This includes the base stations and T24 Toolkit and visualisation software. The Toolkit can be used to configure both the T24 and X24 systems, The free data logging and visualisation software allows users to log up to 100 channels and build visual displays. Alarms can be set that can indicate under and over range and can alert users to loss in communication, low battery and error reports. In recognition that we now work in an increasingly mobile world, Mantracourt has also included a built in web server that provides a summary view page to other computers, tablets and smart phones, both Apple and Android. „We are very excited about the new opportunities this product provides for our customer base. In the past we were frequently asked for a wireless solution in explosive environments and our design team have worked diligently to develop the X24 product range in response. We have extensively field-tested these new products in a wide variety of applications and customers have been impressed with how seamlessly the new products could be integrated.” says Jonathan Purdue, Sales Manager at Mantracourt. ### CategoriesUncategorized Tagsbase, battery, Companies, explosive, force, Industry, Uncategorized, unit, World Post navigation Previous PostPrevious -Squad Vibes- by Hease is Enroute to Get Commercial Success Next PostNext Pre NAB/Post HPA Tech Retreat Editors’ Lounge To Discuss Latest Trends In Post-Production Search Recent Posts Judge Announces Intention To Confirm Peabody Energy Plan Of Reorganization, Paving Way For Emergence AJC Statement on President Trump’s 2018 Budget Proposal The 8th China (Guangrao) International Rubber Tire & Auto Accessory Exhibition is set to take place Reed Exhibitions Greater China Views 2017 With A Positive Outlook American Hotel Income Properties REIT LP Announces Sale of Hotel Property and March 2017 U.S. Dollar Cash Distribution Proudly powered by WordPress

Users will be receiving a lot of changes brought by the update including a warning for non-secure websites. But the greatest addition to the browser is the technology called WebAssembly. Here are the things you need to know about the tech. It is a known fact that majority of modern 3D video games require a lot of power to run properly and be enjoyed by gamers. This is  the main reason why PC and consoles are so much advanced compared to web-based games. However, Mozilla has changed that and brought WebAssembly to their browser to make high-source apps like games, computer-aided design, and video and image editing run on Firefox. Through WebAssembly, these apps will also run on your local computer almost as fast as they do on other platforms. It is because the tech is a low-level programming language that allows higher-level computer languages run in your browser, as reported by Engadget. Another key thing to take note is that Firefox is the first browser to include this kind of tech. Google and Microsoft browsers are expected to do the same. Mozilla WebAssembly On Your Mobile Aside from bringing great games and computer-aided design to your browser, Mozilla is also planning to bring it to your mobile. This will be very handy to people that are always on the go. If ever the tech lands on your mobile, it will not require plugins and will not need to sacrifice speed for the convenience of the web. Other Features Brought By Mozilla Firefox 52 WebAssembly is not the only feature added to Firefox. Firefox also provided a new warning in the browser that will appear if the user clicks on a username and/or password text field on sites not using HTTPS. According to DigitalTrends, HTTPS indicates that the transmission of data between website and Firefox is “encrypted so that hackers can’t gram the sensitive data as it travels the virtual highways.” In relation, Firefox 52 removed the support for Netscape Plugin API plugins (NPAPI). Silverlight, Java, Acrobat, and similar plugin are disabled as well. It is because plugins are non-secure attack vectors used by hackers. This led Mozilla to shift over to the safer HTML5 technology. There you have it! The latest news and updates about the newest Mozilla WebAssembly and its Firefox 52. Do you think the new tech of the browser will help boost its number of users?

Yes, your smart TV really is spying on you: Leaked docs reveal CIA secretly turned Samsung TVs into microphones that spy on your conversations Tuesday, March 07, 2017 by: JD Heyes Tags: CIA, electronic surveillance, spying, Vault 7 (Natural News) For years Deep State insiders and others familiar with the federal government’s spy agencies have been sounding the alarm about the development of technology that enables constant, real-time electronic surveillance of anyone, anywhere, anytime (President Donald Trump, something to consider as you delve into who ordered it against you and why.) Now, thanks to another whistleblower following in the footsteps for former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, WikiLeaks has provided the proof that these insiders weren’t kooks or conspiracy theorists – they were spot-on. (RELATED: Is Your TV Spying On You? For Millions Of Viewers, The Answer Is YES!) According to a treasure trove of newly released documents known collectively as “Vault 7” in the “Year Zero” series, not only does the CIA conduct improper electronic surveillance, it does through using technology that can tap into smart TVs, iPhones, Android devices, and other wireless handheld technology. Jointly developed CIA+MI5 malware infests Samsung smart TVs to turn them into covert microphones #Vault7 pic.twitter.com/Ki0wRlgjPP — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 7, 2017 “The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell’s 1984, but ‘Weeping Angel,’ developed by the CIA’s Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization,” said a press release from WikiLeaks. “The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom’s MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a ‘Fake-Off’ mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In ‘Fake-Off’ mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server,” it added. So in other words, even if you’ve turned your TV and devices “off,” the CIA’s technology, via wireless connections, can still transform them into listening devices, which records conversations and data and sends them to a remote CIA server for later downloading and analysis. The government’s spy agencies, then, can literally steal any and all data they want, thereby giving them the power to create false narratives, phony email traffic, fake communiques and anything else they want in an effort to blackmail or destroy anyone they choose. A journalist getting too close to Deep State activities? No problem – the CIA has the ability to bug their homes remotely, through smart devices, or steal their data and other information that may incriminate them, forcing them into silence. A politician who opposes expansion of the Deep State’s power? No problem – just a few months’ worth of bugging his or her devices, and the nation’s premier spy agency has all it needs to coerce said problematic politician into playing ball. “The CIA’s Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones,” said the Wikileaks press release. “Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user’s geolocation, audio and text communications, as well as covertly activate the phone’s camera and microphone.” (RELATED: Amazon Echo devices spy on you in your own home… police are now trying to acquire those recordings.) And even though iPhone held a minority share (14.5 percent) of the global market, a specialized CIA unit within the agency’s Mobile Development Branch produced malware that infects, controls and then extracts data from iPhones and other Apple products that are running iOS, like iPads and, presumably, iMacs and Macbook Pro laptops. A similar unit is said to have targeted Google’s Android devices, which runs the vast majority of the world’s smart phones (about 85 percent, roughly). “’Year Zero’ shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 ‘weaponized’ Android ‘zero days’ which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors,” said the press release. “These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the ‘smart’ phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.” Feel violated yet? You should. J.D. Heyes is a senior writer for NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com, as well as editor of The National Sentinel.

In the latest development, Oppo has replaced broadcaster Star India as the team sponsor for the Indian cricket team, in a five-year deal that begins next month. Oppo also signed up all-rounder Yurav Singh as a brand ambassador last year. At the start of this year, rival Gionee snapped up the national team's new captain Virat Kohli as a brand ambassador. Kohli, reported to be the highest paid cricketer in the world, currently endorses a total of 17 brands. Gionee also sponsors Kolkata Knight Riders, two-time winners of the India Premier League (IPL). Vivo, meanwhile, seized the chance to become the tournament sponsor for the IPL in late 2015 when PepsiCo ended its contract two years early. The investment in cricket is part of a marketing approach that includes high-spec product offerings at low prices. CXO Today noted that the latter has been enabled by the R&D and manufacturing facilities these brands have built back in China, along with access to component suppliers; "cost reduction has become a huge advantage for Chinese manufacturers," it said. Recent research from Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research indicated that Chinese brands took more than half (51%) of the Indian smartphone market in November 2016, as the share of Indian brands halved over the course of the year. Observing this volatility, Counterpart research analyst Karn Chauhan expected that Samsung would come under greater pressure from Chinese brands during 2017, as their combined market share reaches 60%. Samsung and Apple are vying for leadership of the premium end of the smartphone market, where Samsung's ambitions took a hit in late 2016, when it was forced to issue a global recall for its Galaxy Note 7 before the product could even be launched in India.
