X Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus – the Android phone you need Review: Samsung shakes off Note 7 disaster with this feature-packed handset   Website: Thu, May 11, 2017, 06:00 First published: Thu, May 11, 2017, 06:00     Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus From €150 (bill pay); €900 (prepay) If there is one thing that you can say about the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, it’s that it has screen to spare. The S8 Plus is the bigger version of Samsung’s latest flagship smartphone, the one that the South Korean firm badly needs to be a success to erase the painful memories of the Note 7 disaster. The good news is that the S8 Plus is not only a solid addition to the Galaxy line, it’s also a well-designed and powerful phone. First, the essentials. The S8 Plus comes with 64GB of storage on board, expandable with a memory card up to 256GB, and 4GB of RAM. Powered by an octa-core chip, the phone is water- and dust-resistant, rated at IP68, so it will take some abuse, but you might not want to risk that, given that it would take some of the shine of your sparkly new toy. Rounded edges The key selling point, though, is the screen. The “infinity display” measures 6.2in – including the rounded edges of the screen – and, as is the norm for Samsung’s high-end phones, is Super Amoled. But despite the raw figures, the S8 Plus doesn’t feel that big. That’s because Samsung, rather than try to add on extra screen, has actually just shrunk the bezel to minute proportions to squeeze more screen space out of the phone. To put it in context, it’s is marginally taller than the iPhone 7 Plus, a few millimetres shy of it in width and slightly thicker. It’s also lighter than its Apple rival, and has a bigger screen. Overall, it’s not a bad trade-off. Say goodbye to the physical home button; like Apple, Samsung has gone for the touch-sensitive button, but, unlike Apple’s button, it is part of the of the display. That’s something we expect to see in the latest version of Apple’s smartphone, which is reportedly set to be announced in September. The good news is that Samsung has opted to keep the headphone jack intact, so you won’t have to start looking for some decent Bluetooth headphones. It is a USB C charger, but then most of the higher-end phones are shifting that way too, so Samsung isn’t alone. Low-light performance The camera on the rear is 12 megapixels, with an 8-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies and the like. The S7 had a great camera, a trend that the S8 continues, supporting 4K video and some decent low-light performance thanks to the wide aperture of f1.7. On the security front, the S8 Plus offers a few options. You can protect your phone with a PIN or pattern, face recognition or iris recognition. Face recognition was a bit of a bust here; although it allowed me to set up the security feature without issue, actually unlocking the device with it was another matter. It never really worked for me, though I had better luck with the iris recognition. The two don’t work at the same time, though, and enabling one will disable the other. Our recommendation? Stick with iris recognition. Fingerprint reader There’s also the option of registering your fingerprint, as the S7 and S6 also offered. The difference with the S8 Plus – and the S8 – is the positioning of the fingerprint reader. It’s beside the camera lens on the rear of the phone, so even registering your fingerprints initially is literally a pain – particularly if you have smaller hands. Because of its location, it’s also easy enough to mistakenly put your finger on the camera lens instead, so prepare for some smudgy moments. Bixby, Samsung’s smart assistant, is a little limited. Although Bixby Vision is up and running, which allows you to do everything from translate text to find out more about products, the voice assistant part isn’t available in English yet. So the dedicated Bixby button on the side is little use right now. The good: Samsung has taken everything that the S7 did well and built on it for the S8 Plus. That extra bit of screen space makes a difference for browsing web pages or reading documents in your email. And if there is one thing that Samsung does well, it’s screens. The screen on the S8 Plus is top quality and, with Gorilla Glass 5 front and back, it’s well protected. The S8 also supports Mobile HDR Premium, future-proofing the device. The not so good: The positioning of the fingerprint sensor makes it more difficult to access, especially if you are more at the stumpy end of the finger scale. You’ll find the same issue with reaching the top of the display, although the one-handed display feature will help. The rest: The S8 Plus is crammed with features, from an excellent camera with optical image stabilisation on the video camera to multiframe image processing that brings up better images in harsher lighting conditions. And if you are a fan of mobile VR, the S8 Plus is the phone for you, thanks to its Quad HD capabilities. Wireless and fast charging is also included in the S8. Verdict: Prepare for phone envy. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.

Reuters/Charles Platiau Apple is dominating the tech industry. The company is now the world’s number one vendor of smartphones, tablets and wearables thanks to the strong numbers of the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple Watch during the first quarter of 2017. The iPhone is still the most popular smartphone in the world thanks to its outstanding performance between January and March. About 21.5 million iPhone 7 units and 17.4 million iPhone 7 Plus handsets were shipped during that period. The Oppo R9 placed third with an approximated 8.9 shipments while Samsung’s Galaxy J3 and J5 followed behind the Chinese smartphone with estimated shipments of 6.1 million and 5 million respectively. The Cupertino, California-based tech giant previously announced that 50.8 million iPhones were sold last quarter, although it didn’t exactly specify the models. According to Strategy Analytics, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus covered approximately 76.5 percent of the Mac maker’s smartphone revenue in Q1. The research firm also estimates a 55/45 percent split in sales for the 4.7-inch model and the 5.5-inch variant respectively. Apple likewise remains as the most popular tablet brand worldwide in spite of the decreasing iPad sales. The Apple tablet reportedly sold 8.92 million units last quarter, down from last year’s Q1 sales of 10.2 million iPads. Worldwide tablets sales plunged 9.3 percent year-over-year, but that didn’t stop the iPad from topping the tablet business. “Apple topped the tablet vendor ranking for the first quarter by holding on to 27.9 percent of the global market with 8.92 million units of iPad devices shipped,” TrendForce reveals. “Against the fourth quarter of 2016, iPad shipments fell by 31.8 percent, while year-on-year comparison also shows a drop of 13 percent.” Samsung plays second fiddle to Apple with Q1 tablet shipments of 6.1 million, covering 19.1 percent of the marketshare. Huawei and Lenovo follow suit, each having shipped 2.1 million units of their respective tablets between January and March. Apple has also become the world’s top wearables seller. The company owned 16 percent of the global marketshare and sailed past Fitbit to take the wearables crown. Apple shipped 3.5 million watch units last quarter, which is an improvement over last year’s Q1 shipments of 2.2 million. Fitbit plunged to third place with its projected 2.9 million shipments from January to March. Xiaomi, meanwhile, came in second with roughly 3.4 million wearables shipped. The Apple Watch has only been in the market for two years, so it’s quite an impressive feat for Apple to take over the wearables business in that amount of time.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on May 11, 2017 02:02 PM At the end of March, Apple was expected to release the much anticipated iPad Pro 2. However, in a sudden turn of events, the Cupertino company released a revised version of the standard iPad tablet instead. Now, there are talks among the market watchers that Apple could launch the said professional tablet sometime in June. According to 9to5Mac, iPad Pro case manufacturer Urban Armor Gear is already preparing a release of the latest cases for the iPad Pro 2. In the said report, the case maker has made three versions of the same case: one for the 12.9- and 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 and another one for the rumored 10.5-inch model. iPad Pro 2 supposed release date According to the same report from 9to5Mac, the said iPad Pro cases are set to be released sometime in June. This led many to believe that the tablet might get launched during the same month. iPad Pro (via apple.com) This supposed release date for the cases coincides with Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California. At the said event, the company is expected to unveil a number of things including the major iOS upgrade, iOS 10.3, as well as iOS 11. Apart from new mobile operating systems, Apple is also rumored to introduce other products like the rumoured Siri Speaker that will compete with the Amazon Echo. iPad Pro 2 specs Right now, reports for the iPad Pro reboot have been mixed. Initially, rumors suggested that Apple is planning on releasing a 10.9-inch version of the iPad Pro 2. Later on, the rumor mill suddenly took a turn and settled on a slightly smaller sized tablet. According to reports, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 will have the same form factor as the 9.7-inch model. This will be achieved by giving the tablet a narrower bezel on both sides of the display. Apart from the display, there is also the question of the processor. Based on Apple’s design rhythm, one should expect an Apple A10X to be used on the iPad Pro. Normally, this is what Apple does on a regular basis for much of its tablets; use an improved version of the previous SoC used on the current flagship iPhone. However, now that the iPhone 8 is also in line to be launched later this year, some are questioning the choice of processor on the iPad Pro 2. iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard (via apple.com) Although it has not been discussed at length on many occasions, the iPad Pro 2 could also sport the rumored Apple A11 chip. On the other hand, if Apple really wants the iPhone 8 to be unique in every way, then it might as well stick with the A10X. Release date and price Users should not expect any major changes on the pricing for the iPad Pro 2, especially the 12.9-inch version. On the flip side, rumor has it that the 9.7-inch model will get a considerable price reduction as it will be targeted for entry-level users. That said, the 10.5-inch will now pick up the slack and be priced somewhere between the original 9.7-inch model and the 12.9-inch version. As for the release date, it could be anybody’s guess. However, a recent third-party product leak suggests that the launch might happen next month. This supposed unveiling is said to coincide with Apple’s event for June. However, right now, nothing is written in stone. Apple could still turn around and say that it would not be releasing the iPad Pro 2 just yet. Perhaps this will happen sometime in September or October when the company unveils the iPhone 7s, 7s Plus and the iPhone 8. For more updates on the iPad Pro 2, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The iPhone 7s, is said to be unveiled in September along with the iPhone 8. While most leaks for the past month or so revolved around the iPhone 8, a new leak now focuses on the iPhone 7s. A certain iPhone 7s related photo appeared on Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo that was later taken up by Slashleaks. In the said photo, one can see a piece of document underneath a handful of what appears to be glass backing for an iPhone model. While it is not clear to which iPhone model these glass backing belong to, many pundits believe these could either be for the iPhone 7s or iPhone SE. Another interesting bit of information in the said image is the part where the document shows the words “Ion-X Glass.” This led many to believe that Apple is using the said strengthened glass for the iPhone in question. Also, if one would scrutinize the top-left part of one glass backing, it is quite clear that there is not a single hole on the sheet itself. Alleged iPhone 7s or iPhone SE glass backing (via slashleaks.com) However, the two clear circular sections could be for the camera and flash of the target device. The absence of a hole cutout for the camera means that the iPhones in question will have no camera bumps at the back. It is still too soon to confirm that these glass backings are for the iPhone 7s, much less for the iPhone SE. Although, it should be noted that early this year, famous KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that Apple might release an iPhone SE in the second half of 2017. Of course, like the leak mentioned, there are now ways of verifying the veracity if these information. Readers are urged to take these bits of news with a healthy dose of common sense.

Photographer: John Taggart/Bloomberg Shares of AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. sank in Hong Kong after short seller Gotham City Research questioned the Apple Inc. supplier’s accounting. The stock dropped 10 percent to HK$99.65 at 2:35 p.m. local time, heading for its biggest retreat since March 2015. Gotham, founded by New York-based Daniel Yu, questioned AAC’s profit margins and alleged that the company engaged in undisclosed transactions with related parties that aren’t listed in Apple’s supplier list. "We’re intrigued by it because its margins are higher, smoother than some of the best companies in the world,” Yu said in a phone interview. “In my experience, that usually means that the company is a truly world-changing, excellent, high-competitive company -- or something else. And based on our investigation, we think the facts support the latter possibility." AAC denied the allegations in the report, calling it “inaccurate and misleading.” The company is seeking legal advice and reserves the right to take action, it said in a statement filed to Hong Kong’s stock exchange. Shenzhen-based AAC is scheduled to report results for the three months ended March on Friday. Before today, the stock was this year’s best performer on Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index with a 58 percent gain. Apple couldn’t immediately comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Some analysts questioned Gotham’s conclusions. BOC International Holdings Ltd.’s Tony Zhang, who has a buy rating on the stock, called the report “groundless” and said many Apple suppliers enjoy high profit margins. His critique was echoed by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.’s David Dai. “I read the report,” said Dai, who has a market perform recommendation on AAC. “There is no hard evidence there, only speculation.” This is Gotham’s first target in Asia. Named after the city where comic-book hero Batman fights crime, Gotham began publicly betting against companies after Yu got burned by an investment in mortgage lender Freddie Mac in 2008. The firm’s report on Quindell Plc triggered a 39 percent one-day drop in the U.K. technology firm in April 2014, while its July 2014 report on Let’s Gowex SA preceded the Spanish Wi-Fi provider’s filing for insolvency and its CEO resigning after admitting he reported false financial results for at least four years. Earnings Uncertainty Shares in Gotham’s most recent target, Aurelius Equity Opportunities SE, have fallen about 28 percent in Frankfurt since Gotham published a 68-page note in March questioning the company’s accounting. The German firm, which provides loans to distressed companies, has said that Gotham’s allegations were unfounded, and that Gotham’s report primarily consists of “manipulation of facts known and already published.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Short sellers based in the U.S. are increasingly turning their attention to companies listed in Asia. Carson Block’s Muddy Waters said in December it was betting against its first Japanese target, the precision motor maker Nidec Corp. Muddy Waters published a report on China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co. later that month. Huishan Dairy’s shares have been frozen since they tumbled 85 percent on March 24, and Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission on Monday took the rare step of saying the stock can’t resume trading without its approval. The outlook for AAC’s shares will depend on the company’s response to Gotham’s allegations, said Ben Kwong, executive director at KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Some investors are skeptical of their earnings after the report, while some are finding excuse to sell after share price has gone up a lot,” Kwong said. “No one likes uncertainty.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

As Fitbit talks up its big plans for smartwatches, Fossil has already found out that the market is tough to crack. By Emily Bary May 10, 2017 5:24 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Pixabay Folks in the fashion and tech worlds alike are trying pretty hard to crack wearables, but it seems like no one quite knows what’s working. Just a few months ago, the sentiment was that smartwatches were out and basic fitness trackers were the future. “Simplicity is a driving factor,” one market research firm argued. Nowadays, everyone’s saying it’s a smartwatch world. Apple, which sells watches, overtook Fitbit, which mainly sells trackers, in terms of shipments during the first quarter, recent third-party data showed. And Fitbit is in the midst of a “transition year,” in which it plans to put a renewed focus on watches. More from Barron’s Next How Apple Is Trying to Fix This Weak Link Breaking Down the Apple Watch’s ‘Best Quarter Ever’ Have Wearables Peaked in the U.S? Another company in transition is Fossil, a traditional watchmaker that’s also trying to change focus and emphasize smartwatches. The company just posted a disastrous earnings report in which traditional watch sales continued to decline. Fossil also said that wearable sales (comprised mainly of smartwatches) fell short of the company’s own projections, though the category “helped to mitigate the decline in traditional watches.” So Fossil finds itself in a painful middle ground. The company’s stock fell 20.4% Wednesday. Investors might be more worried about the company’s projection for future earnings, though. Fossil’s profit forecast for the current quarter and the current year came in well below Wall Street’s expectations. “We’re determining that wearables are a bit more of a seasonal business than traditional watches,” CFO Dennis Secor said. Fossil, like Fitbit, hopes that transitioning to the latest supposedly trendy thing will fix a struggling business. Recent results from both companies suggest that hopping aboard on the latest tech trend takes some time, and investors rarely like to wait. In the last 12 months, shares of both Fitbit and Fossil are down 55%. Big Picture: Fossil and Fitbit both hope that smartwatches can fix their ailing businesses. The transition has been painful.

Specific terms of the acquisition remain unclear, but here’s how Apple can take advantage of Beddit.  ( Beddit ) Advertisement Apple has officially bought sleep-tracking company Beddit, signaling Apple's desire to evolve its Health-focused efforts beyond tracking steps and fitness levels into analyzing sleep behavior and patterns. Apple Acquires Beddit Beddit, for the uninitiated, makes sleep tracking hardware and software. On Monday, May 8, it updated its policy to inform users that their data will now be "collected, used, and disclosed" in compliance with Apple's own Privacy Policy, now that the Cupertino, California-based tech company has purchased the Finland-based company. "You can use Apple HealthKit to connect the Health app to the Beddit mobile app. Connecting the Health and Beddit apps is optional, and you control what data flows between the apps," the updated privacy policy adds. How much Apple bought Beddit for remains undisclosed and Apple is, as usual, laconic about the exact terms of the acquisition. But it appears Beddit's apps for Apple Watch have been taken down. What Apple intends to do with Beddit is unclear, but the best guess at present is that the purchase is bound for the company's biomedical engineering unit. Founded in 2007, Beddit launched its products in Apple Stores late 2015. Carrying third-party products in its own brick-and-mortar stores is a way for Apple to know which ones click, and to whom. Beddit 3 is the sleep-tracking company's latest product, a slim sensor strip that's laid on a bed to analyze its owner's heart rate, respiration, sleep time and efficiency, movement, snoring, and much more. The device, still up for sale on Apple's online store, costs around $150. What Is Apple Going To Use Beddit For? Apple-branded mattresses are not going to happen anytime soon, so let's get that out of the way. Rather with its recent purchase, Apple is further cementing its seriousness in the health-tracking business. For a number of years, Apple has been working on sleep-tracking for its smartwatches, notes Bloomberg. With its sleep-tracking knowhow, Beddit could expedite that process and, in turn, help Apple herald its smartwatch line as full-fledged health tracking devices, a notion Tim Cook seemingly supports already. Apple could announce more health-tracking features soon, add to that its much taller ambitions of turning the HealthKit platform into a full-on diagnosis tool. Partnered with Apple's Night Shift feature on the latest versions of iOS, which adds a red filter to help people get better sleep, Beddit can help Apple take sleep features to the next level, possibly by providing iPhone owners with sleeping activity, data, the whole nine yards. Beddit says its customers can use HealthKit to connect the app to Apple's own Health app. The purchase button on its site now reroutes customers to Apple's online store, and its product is no longer listed on Amazon. What's more, Beddit was previously working on an app for Android, but that detail is no longer on its site. Thoughts on Beddit? Do you think Apple should expand its biomedical engineering efforts to include tracking users' sleep activity? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!

By: Shilpa Published: Thursday, May 11, 2017, 9:00 [IST] iPhone 5s, the branded smartphone by Apple has been ranked as the top premium smartphone in India by CyberMedia Research. Though it is four years old handset, it did not find any difficulty in climbing the top. According to CyberMedia Research, "Apple iPhone 5s is the top premium smartphone in India across all the states on the cumulative installations basis as of March 2017." If you are wondering, what are the positions of other iPhones and other popular brands, then here is the list. The iPhone 7 has been ranked as fourth in the states, whereas the Android devices such as Samsung and OnePlus secured the fifth position. Also Read: Four year old iPhone 5s may cost just Rs. 15,000 in India The other iPhone handsets such as 4S and 5C have failed to make some space in the listing. Another interesting thing to be noted is, the top premium phone, iPhone 5s will soon be made available in India for the cheapest price. According to the recent news, they will be priced at Rs.15,000 and will be the cheapest iPhone one can buy in an Indian market. That is, the company is trying to focus on mid-range handsets to deepen its root in India. Also Read: iPhone SE (2017) leaks flaunting glass back; Apple WWDC launch possible Not just this, they are also looking forward to locally manufacture iPhone SE in India sometime soon. Regarding this, CyberMedia says, "Various versions of iPhone fill up the top 5 premium category smartphones in the states of Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, indicating that iPhone is not a metro affair only in India." This drop in iPhone prices will surely gain some more attention of Indian smartphone buyers. When it comes to Android, we already know that South Korean giant, Samsung and Oneplus are playing a top role here. The popular brands such as Oppo and Vivo are also trying to toughen this competition.

Apple plans $1 billion expansion at data center in Nevada Associated Press | RENO, Nev. (AP) — Apple announced plans Wednesday for a $1 billion expansion of its massive data center east of Reno, doubling its investment and roughly tripling its workforce at the technology campus where company officials expect to hire 100 additional workers. The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple's plans to build a $4 million shipping and receiving warehouse on a vacant lot in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. "We're excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data center and supporting facilities," Apple spokesman John Rosenstock said in an email to The Associated Press. "As part of our growth, we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs." Last week, Apple announced a new $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, but provided few details. As part of a strategy emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, it also released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work — more than half in California's Silicon Valley. Apple currently has more than 700 workers in Nevada, which Rosentock said is home to the company's largest solar investment, "powering our data center with clean energy." The 5-year-old $1 billion data center is located in the Reno Technology Center near the Tracy generating station along U.S. Interstate 80. It's between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla's giant battery factory is based about 15 miles (24 km) east of Reno-Sparks. Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data center in 2012. Gov. Brian Sandoval said it was "the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map." "Apple's decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home," he said in a statement Wednesday. The Reno Gazette-Journal reported City Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the downtown land deal Wednesday, calling for an end to unfair tax deals for "some powerful, well-connected corporations and not the rest of us." Mayor Hillary Schieve and Councilman Paul McKenzie said the whole city will benefit from the developments. "Apple doesn't just pay, they offer a living wage," McKenzie said.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Companies Apple tops $800 billion market cap for first time Apple Inc became the first US company to top the $800 billion mark in market capitalisation, and the iPhone maker's shares have gained 33 percent this year and almost 50 percent since the US election. Reuters May 11, 2017 08:46 IST Reuters Apple Inc (AAPL.O) became the first US company to top the $800 billion mark in market capitalisation on Tuesday, slightly more than two years after it crossed the $700 billion threshold. The iPhone maker's shares have gained 33 percent this year and almost 50 percent since the US election in November. The company represents about 4 percent of the $21.7 trillion that makes up the entire S&P 500 .SPX index. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 percent of the S&P 500 in September 2012 but is a smaller percentage now as the index as a whole has rallied more than 7 percent this year. "It's just reflective of how powerful a franchise it is. It may be the most powerful franchise in the country today," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, whose firm does not own the stock. "Considering that it has a limited number of products, it has really dominated that market in a way that few companies have, and it's been able to retain margins despite lots of competitors." If Apple continues on its growth path, the company will top the $1 trillion market cap level later this year. Stock buybacks have also bolstered Apple shares, with the company reducing its actual share count by 20.9 percent and the average diluted shares outstanding by 20.5 percent over the past four years, according to Standard & Poor's data. The median price target on Apple is $160, up from the $140 median three months ago. Shares closed at $153.99 on Tuesday. The closing market cap of $802.8 billion was larger than the economies of 45 of the 50 US states, topped only by Illinois, Florida, New York, Texas and California. Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) has disclosed a stake of roughly $20 billion in Apple, said on Monday he had grown more fond of the company because he could "very easily determine" the iPhone maker's competitive position "and who is trying to chase them."

Ian Horne, who lives with his wife Mel and three children, Sienna three, Riley, 10, and Lacey, 15, in Laburnum Avenue, east Hull, claims their home could have "gone up in flames" when the iPad charger started smoldering. He said he only realised the charger had burnt when he went to upstairs to bed and saw the plastic around the charger port on the cable had melted and burned black and the wire had been charred. Mr Horne says he was lucky the charger, which had been plugged into the wall socket but not into any electronic device, was not near fabric or anything flammable. "I saw it and was shocked," he said. "We were downstairs and didn't know anything about it at all. We were lucky because another day it might have touched the curtains and the whole place would have gone up in flames. "The charger was in our bedroom, turned on at the plug. It wasn't plugged in to anything. If it had been touching anything, my kids were all in the house, it could have been so much worse." Read more: 'My step-mum forced hammer down my throat and held my head under bathwater' - Hull trial Mr Horne says although Apple has since offered him a replacement charger and a £100 refund, he is still looking for an explanation for why it set alight. "When I first contacted Apple it took me an age," he said. "They told me to go to the nearest Apple store which is all the way in Leeds," he said. "When we finally got back in touch with them they said it would be sent to Ireland and then it was eventually sent to California. "They offered me a new one and a £100 refund but I still want answers as to why it happened. "You worry there will be a few with the same issue. We've got another charger the same age and I don't want to worry that it might happen again. "My family have got iPhones, iPads. They're good products but now I'm just worried." A spokeswoman for Apple did not want to comment on the matter but customers should look at their safe charging information for iOS devices. In a statement, they advise: "All Apple products — including our power adapters — undergo rigorous testing for safety and reliability, and are designed to meet government safety standards around the world. "When used as designed, they safely provide power and recharge the batteries in your Apple products. "If your power adapter, AC wall adapter, or AC power cable has been damaged, stop using it. If you're unsure about whether an accessory is damaged, take it to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for evaluation, or contact Apple Support."

It’s a great product, don’t get us wrong, but consumers by and large simply don’t care about tablets anymore. iPad sales continue to decline each quarter, and the global tablet market has been sliding as well. While industry monitors like Gartner insisted time and time again that tablets were “the next big thing,” the truth is that the fill a gap that many people just don’t care about. Add to that the fact that people who do buy tablets don’t upgrade very quickly, and you’re left with a market that doesn’t seem to have much room for growth right now. If recent rumors pan out, however, it looks like Apple will look to rekindle consumers’ love affair with iPads by releasing a brand new tablet with a big redesign. Don't Miss: Add a high-tech Head Up Display to any car for under $50 According to a number of independent reports from several different tech blogs with good track records, Apple’s iPad lineup will soon see a brand new addition. The new iPad Pro rumored to be debuting sometime this year is expected to feature a fresh new design that will serve as something of a preview for Apple’s iPhone 8 design. The tablet is expected to be about the same size as Apple’s current 97.-inch iPad Pro, but it will feature a 10.5-inch display. How will Apple fit a larger display into a tablet that’s the same size as its current iPad Pro model? You guessed it… by shrinking the bezels. Rumor has it the new iPad Pro set to be released this year will feature a nice big 10.5-inch display with much smaller bezels than we’ve ever seen on an iPad. The screen will extend nearly to all four edges of the device, if recent reports hold true. Some also believe the new iPad Pro will do away with the home button and feature a Touch ID scanner embedded in the screen, though it seems unlikely that Apple would release an iPad with a new embedded fingerprint scanner before its new iPhone 8 is unveiled. The timing of the new iPad Pro’s release is still something of a mystery. Rumors had pointed to a March announcement, but March came and went without an announcement. Now, a new leak suggests that Apple could be lining up a June release for the new iPad Pro, which would make sense if the company unveils the new model during its WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th. Apple news blog 9to5Mac on Wednesday posted what it claims is a photo of the inventory screen at an unspecified Apple reseller. In the image, a number of third-party cases from Urban Armor Gear are listed as fitting an “iPad 10.5″.” No other information can be ascertained from the image, but we won’t have long to wait before we find out since WWDC 2017 is now less than a month away.

The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple's plans to build a $4 million shipping and receiving warehouse on a vacant lot in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. "We're excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data centre and supporting facilities," Apple spokesman John Rosenstock said in an email to The Associated Press. "As part of our growth, we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs." Last week, Apple announced a new $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, but provided few details. As part of a strategy emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, it also released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work — more than half in California's Silicon Valley. Apple currently has more than 700 workers in Nevada, which Rosentock said is home to the company's largest solar investment, "powering our data centre with clean energy." The 5-year-old $1 billion data centre is located in the Reno Technology Center near the Tracy generating station along U.S. Interstate 80. It's between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla's giant battery factory is based about 15 miles (24 km) east of Reno-Sparks. Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data centre in 2012. Gov. Brian Sandoval said it was "the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map." "Apple's decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home," he said in a statement Wednesday. The Reno Gazette-Journal reported City Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the downtown land deal Wednesday, calling for an end to unfair tax deals for "some powerful, well-connected corporations and not the rest of us." Mayor Hillary Schieve and Councilman Paul McKenzie said the whole city will benefit from the developments. "Apple doesn't just pay, they offer a living wage," McKenzie said.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business Reno (Nevada) Apple Inc.         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   Hytera to Officially Launch LTE-PMR Convergence Solution at CCW2017 GSMA Urges for Lower Spectrum Prices in Bangladesh for Affordable Mobile Broadband Networks Startups Win $100,000 at Communitech Demo Day Pitch Competition           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple's plans to build a $US4 million shipping and receiving warehouse on a vacant lot in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. "We're excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data centre and supporting facilities," Apple spokesman John Rosenstock said on Wednesday. "As part of our growth, we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs." Last week, Apple announced a new $US1 billion fund aimed at creating more US manufacturing jobs, but provided few details. As part of a strategy emphasising its role in the US economy, it also released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 US employees work - more than half in California's Silicon Valley. Apple currently has more than 700 workers in Nevada, which Rosentock says is home to the company's largest solar investment, "powering our data centre with clean energy." The five-year-old $US1 billion data centre is located in the Reno Technology Centre near the Tracy generating station along US Interstate 80. It's between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla's giant battery factory is based about 25 km east of Reno-Sparks. Apple was awarded $US89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data centre in 2012.

It was admittedly rather confusing for users to try and navigate the app to find the songs they wanted, songs saved offline, as well as accessing some playback controls. Apple made some changes and improvements with iOS 10, but we reckon it could still be improved upon. This is where designer Jason Yuan comes in. Yuan had recently applied for an internship position in Apple but was ultimately rejected. The role he applied for was for a graphic design internship at Apple Music, and it seems that despite being rejected his passion for design continues as he has since published his own concept on the changes he would make to Apple Music. According to Yuan, “At first, I was frustrated — Northwestern University doesn’t offer any sort of undergraduate graphic design program, so whatever growth they were looking for would have to be self taught…but as soon as I came to this realization, I became inspired to embark on what became a three-month long journey to the holy grail — the iOS app that Apple Music deserves.” Now what you see above is Yuan’s take on Apple Music. On the surface it still looks and feels like the Apple Music we know, but there are some subtle differences that Yuan says will help the overall user experience. Whether or not you agree is subjective, but we have to wonder with the attention Yuan is getting, will Apple have a change of heart and give him the internship? Filed in Apple >Audio >Concepts.

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Thursday, May 11, 2017, 7:19 [IST] Apple was rumored to unveil the iPhone SE during the spring event this year but the same was not announced at all. It is known that the company is prepping a successor for the affordable iPhone SE and the new one is likely to go official at the Apple WWDC 2017 to debut on June 5. At this point in time, a new from China shows us how the alleged iPhone SE (2017)'s rear might look like. If this is to be believed, then Apple might switch from metal to glass for the upcoming handset's back panel. Also, it is likely that the smartphone might use Ion-X glass, which is the same material that was used on the Apple Watch Sport. This information is revealed of the sheet of paper that is seen lying below the alleged iPhone SE shells. Also read: 6 features you will miss on iPhone SE Talking about the rear panel, the camera and flash appear to be aligned vertically at the rear and not horizontally as seen in the original iPhone SE. The other details about the upcoming second generation iPhone SE are not revealed by the leaked photo. When it comes to the internal components, it still remains a mystery as to what the iPhone SE (2017) might arrive with. Apple has already sent media invites for the WWDC 2017 event that is to debut on June 5. If the iPhone SE successor is to be launched at this conference, then we will likely come across more such leaks and rumors in the coming days.

The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple’s plans to build a $4 million shipping and receiving warehouse on a vacant lot in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. “We’re excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data center and supporting facilities,” Apple spokesman John Rosenstock said in an email to The Associated Press. “As part of our growth, we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs.” Last week, Apple announced a new $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, but provided few details. As part of a strategy emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, it also released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work — more than half in California’s Silicon Valley. Apple currently has more than 700 workers in Nevada, which Rosentock said is home to the company’s largest solar investment, “powering our data center with clean energy.” The 5-year-old $1 billion data center is located in the Reno Technology Center near the Tracy generating station along U.S. Interstate 80. It’s between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla’s giant battery factory is based about 15 miles east of Reno-Sparks. Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data center in 2012. Gov. Brian Sandoval said it was “the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map.” “Apple’s decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home,” he said in a statement Wednesday. The Reno Gazette-Journal reported City Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the downtown land deal Wednesday, calling for an end to unfair tax deals for “some powerful, well-connected corporations and not the rest of us.” Mayor Hillary Schieve and Councilman Paul McKenzie said the whole city will benefit from the developments. “Apple doesn’t just pay, they offer a living wage,” McKenzie said.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 11, 2:37 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology iPhone 8 USB-C: Apple Reportedly Choosing Lighting Over New Industry Standard By Corazon Victorino On 05/10/17 AT 9:29 PM Close A new report is claiming that Apple is keeping its Lightning port for the upcoming iPhone 8, despite the fact that USB-C has some advantages over the former. The report did state that switching to USB-C is inevitable given the trend in the smartphone industry these days, but it’s not very likely for the Cupertino giant to jump on the bandwagon this year.  This Wednesday, AppleInsider did a story on why Apple will not likely ditch Lightning for USB-C on its highly anticipated 10th anniversary iPhone. The Apple-centric news site enumerated the reasons why Lightning is up to par if not better than the new industry standard.  AppleInsider compared Lightning and USB-C by focusing on three different points: power, speed and strength. When it comes to power, the site recognized USB-C as a technology that indeed delivers power well. However, it also pointed out that Lightning charging is “no slouch.” It went on to say that this is evident in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which charges three times faster using the 29W USB-C power adapter of the 12-inch MacBook. READ: iPhone 8 factory leak confirms edge-to-edge display When it comes to speed, AppleInsider noted that USB-C wins this round in theory. Then, it stated that Lightning is also capable of USB-C’s transfer speeds as long as the technology is used in the right circumstances. The tech site once again used the 12.9-inch iPad as example on how Lightning could be just as fast as USB-C in transferring data. The large tablet is said to have USB 3 transfer speeds when a Lightning to USB 3 camera adapter is used with it. But this capability is only limited to the 12.9-inch iPad as of late. Still, this is a good indication that Apple does not need to switch to USB-C just to secure faster data transfers with the new iPhones.  The tech site compared the tensile strength of USB-C and Lightning connectors. According to the site, the two yielded results that were on the same range. Nonetheless, Lightning was found to be at an advantage when it came down to how the ports were still functional even when the Lighting tip broke off. “When a Lightning tip breaks off, invariably there’s a little metal left in the iPhone or iPad. After fishing the tip out, the port still worked fine. When a USB-C tip broke, 4 out of 7 cases it deformed the port, rendering it useless.” AppleInsider did clarify that there is no telling at this point if this disadvantage would be present if Apple were to really launch an iPhone with USB-C.  In a video report, the publication said that Apple’s drive to shift its consumers to wireless technology is a sign that there isn’t really a need for USB-C migration. The site added that although USB-C is becoming the industry standard, it is still not very likely for Apple to join its competitors this year. Apple’s decision on whether it would be switching to USB-C or not still remains uncertain. Either way, the company would end up in a difficult situation. Switching to USB-C would definitely annoy peripheral owners. Retaining Lightning technology, on the other hand, would antagonize consumers who want the tech giant to join other companies in embracing universality.  READ: EU could limit Apple’s control over App Store PocketNow pointed out early last year that Apple seems to be not getting the credit it deserves for being the first tech company to transition to a smaller connector design with a reversible plug in the industry. Samsung’s biggest rival introduced the Lightning connector five years ago, and it has since implemented the technology in a number of its primary products and a range of accessories. Having said these, do you think it’s a good idea for Apple to ditch Lightning for USB-C on its upcoming iPhones?  The next-generation iPhones are reportedly coming with Lightning ports and not the new industry standard, the USB-C connecting port.

Said to feature an edge-to-edge OLED display, the hype surrounding Apple’s next-gen iPhone seems to get more intense with each passing month. And with good reason: the iPhone 8 will introduce a radical new form factor, a welcome change in light of the fact that the current iPhone design has more or less remained unchanged since Apple rolled out the iPhone 6 in 2014. Don't Miss: Google has a new OS that may one day kill Android, and this is your first look at it Typically, Apple introduces a new iPhone model in September, but rumblings from the rumor mill have suggested that the iPhone 8 will see a delayed launch, with some reports indicating that the iPhone 8 release date will be delayed until November. And though a Digitimes report from earlier in the week claimed that Apple will get a handle on iPhone 8 production by September, a new research note from reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says otherwise. Though iPhone 8 rumors are a dime a dozen these days, it’s always worth paying close attention to Kuo’s research notes. Indeed, no other analyst on the planet has as track record as long and as accurate as Kuo. That said, Kuo’s most recent note, obtained by MacRumors and 9to5Mac, relays that the iPhone 8 will be extremely hard to find due to “severe supply shortages.” So even if the iPhone 8 release goes down in September, it will reportedly take Apple some time to ramp up production. That being the case, Kuo notes that “severe supply shortages may persist for a while after the new models are launched…” Far from a surprise, we have seen other reports claiming that the advanced 3D cameras Apple is planning on incorporating on its upcoming flagship iPhone will be in extremely short supply once mass production begins. Additionally, there have also been rumblings that Apple has experienced extremely poor yields on its advanced 5.8-inch OLED display. With the iPhone 8 said to be in short supply this September, Kuo believes that Apple’s cumulative iPhone shipments will take a significant hit. We are seeing more evidence that the worst-case scenario forecasted in our April 19 report could materialize, where new iPhone shipments in 2H17F are revised down to 80- 90mn units from 100-110mn units (vs. consensus of 100-120mn units). … While we are positive on potential replacement demand triggered by OLED iPhone, it’s too early to determine if demand will shift fully in that direction. We recommend investors keep tabs on the following issues: (1) whether the 3D sensor of OLED iPhone provides an innovative user experience; (2) whether OLED iPhone cancels Touch ID (fingerprint recognition); and (3) whether Apple’s competitors launch more innovative products which could compete with OLED iPhone in 4Q17-2Q18. One question that remains unanswered centers on whether or not Apple will be able to incorporate the Touch ID sensor into the display itself or if it will place it on the back of the device.

Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy. To go alongside its popular iOS and Apple Watch app, Beddit also sells sleep tracking hardware. For instance, the company sells its Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor, which is placed underneath a bed sheet for more accurate sleep tracking. The product is sold via Apple’s online store. Sleep tracking has been one of the most sought after features for the Apple Watch and Apple’s acquisition of Beddit shows that the company is actively looking into the area. Since the release of Apple Watch, users have turned to third-party platforms such as Beddit to track their sleep, but a first-party tool is long overdue. With watchOS 4 likely to be unveiled later this year, it’s possible that sleep tracking in some form might be included. Given how Beddit requires a hardware accessory to monitor sleep, however, it would be interesting to see Apple’s approach. It’s possible that the company will forgo Beddit’s Sleep Monitor hardware in favor of an Apple Watch-centric approach. But we’ll have to wait and see. Have you used Beddit to track your sleep before?

Instead what we got was a refresh of the original 9.7-inch iPad which is basically a slightly more affordable model for those who just want an iPad without all the fuss. So where are the new iPad Pros? For those wondering about that, it seems that maybe June could be when we’ll be hearing more about them. According to the folks at 9to5Mac, they have gotten their hands on a screenshot of a stock system from an Apple Authorized Reseller which shows that Urban Armor Gear has new iPad cases for “iPad 10.5-inch” in three colors and have listed its availability as June. As you might have heard, Apple has a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro in the works and if this listing is accurate, the June availability hints that the tablet could be launched then as well. Also given that WWDC 2017 is also taking place in June, it does provide Apple a good platform to announce the device, although to be fair WWDC over the years has largely been focused on software. An alternate possibility is that maybe UAG are simply guessing its availability as we have seen companies done in the past, but either way we’ll keep our eyes peeled for more info.

(AP) — Apple has announced plans for a $1 billion expansion of its massive data center east of Reno. Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said Wednesday the investment will include the hiring of 100 permanent workers, doubling its workforce at the existing site in the Reno Technology Center. He says they expect new construction will support an additional 300 jobs. The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple's plans Wednesday to build a $4 million shipping and receiving warehouse in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. The data center is located near the Tracey coal plant along U.S. Interstate 80 between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla's giant battery factory is based about 15 miles (24 km) east of Sparks.

These disembodied aides have become a big part of our daily lives. Cupertino’s competitors recognize that fact. This is why we saw Amazon Alexa and then Google’s assistant enter our living rooms. Now Cortana is set to arrive in our homes, courtesy of the Microsoft Invoke. When will Apple provide a full-fledged Siri device that we don’t have to take out of our pockets or raise our wrists to use? A Siri Speaker makes perfect sense in a world where we want to talk to our virtual assistants like we do live people. An Inconvenient Convenience I realize this falls squarely within the category of #FirstWorldProblems. I have two ways to talk to Siri right now – by pulling out my iPhone and saying, “Hey Siri,” or by saying the same thing to my Apple Watch. That’s more than a lot of folks can say. Be that as it may, it’s just not good enough for me and for many others. Right now, Siri is an inconvenient convenience, because we can’t just walk around talking to thin air and getting things done. With Amazon Alexa, we can do just that. Inside our homes, we don’t want to have to pull our iPhones out of our pockets every time we want to ask Siri to do something or answer a question. To be sure, we want an ubiquitous personal assistant waiting to answer our call without any action on our part other than speaking to that disembodied aide. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all recognize this. Despite my colleague John Martellaro’s disagreement, I think Apple does, too. The Case for Apple HomeBase Responding to Amazon Alexa First of all, no, I didn’t come up with that name In fact, almost none of the rumors I’ve been privy to about the Siri speaker call it that. The name was penned by Brian Roemmele, editor and founder of Read Multiplex, among many other hats the man wears. Mr. Roemmele wrote about a “Voice First” revolution, in which the devices themselves aren’t nearly as relevant to our lives as is the voice-based artificial intelligence that gets to know our needs. Why do we need a Siri speaker? Mr. Roemmele describes one important aspect of this reason, to replace the mechanical aspects of everything we have been acclimated to perform with computers, including typing and gesturing on glass. We will gain back our time as our contextually aware systems “know” what we are looking for and allow us to move to other things. True, it doesn’t take much time to remove my iPhone from my pocket and speak to it. It takes even less time to raise my Apple Watch to my wrist. However, think about what you do when you ask your spouse, significant other, child, or some other member of your household a question. Do you physically rise up from where you’re sitting, walk over to that person, and then ask them your question? Of course not. Similarly, you don’t walk to your Echo to ask Amazon Alexa a question, because the personal assistant is akin to a member of your family. As our personal assistants become more a part of our household, we need (want?) to be able to ask things of them without any other action. Our Lives As Foretold by Star Trek I’m not sure when the idea of a disembodied personal assistant like Siri or Amazon Alexa first entered our awareness. However, my first recollection of such technology came from the science fiction television series Star Trek. I, and many others, have memories of wishing we could call on something like the Enterprise’s computer just by speaking our commands or queries. That’s what Star Trek promised us, and it’s what many of us are waiting for. We’ve already seen a number of Star Trek predictions come to fruition. Tablet computers, flip communicators, Bluetooth headsets (Uhura had one), transparent aluminum, and automatic doors are just a few of them. And, of course, Siri was the first successful attempt at a voice control computer, complete with a female voice like the ship’s computer on board the Enterprise. Apple Will Develop a Speaker for Siri, Hopefully Soon I have no doubt that Cupertino is actually working on this project. Engineers at Apple are probably working on that project as I type this missive. When it’s ready, the Apple HomeBase will arrive. That’s just Apple’s way. Perhaps Cupertino will announce the product in June at WWDC, but only if Apple has the product as ready as it thinks the Siri speaker needs to be. My hope is that Cupertino gets it right sooner rather than later. I resisted, at first, moving control of my smart home devices from Alexa to HomeKit. In some ways, a few of the bugs in HomeKit make me occasionally wish I hadn’t made that move. Echo Show and Microsoft’s Invoke are entering our homes to allow us voice control without physical action. Apple may be slowly losing the home, but I don’t think the battle is over just yet. I believe that a product, perhaps called the Apple HomeBase, will be announced in the near future. With it, I presume, will come dramatic improvements to Siri. Those improvements will allow Cupertino’s virtual personal assistant to become a part of the family. Siri will learn with us and help improve our daily lives. All that’ll be missing then is my jetpack.

First is that you’d need one in every room. My wife and I are already becoming that couple. You know, she’s in the office and shouts “Can you bring me a coke?” Me in the kitchen either doesn’t heart her or shouts back “A joke? What do you mean a joke?” And on it goes. So I figure we’d need about five of these devices to cover our house. At the current price of the Amazon thing, I think ~$200, we’d need about a thousand dollars to make this truly useful. I’ll put up with a lot of inconvenience for a grand. I’ll pull my phone out for the next decade if the alternative costs me a grand. The second issue is Siri itself. It has gotten better. Actually it has gotten much better. But it’s still like talking to a robot. It’s very literal and very limited. You ask it a specific thing and it answers, usually. “Siri, what time is it.” “Siri when do the Twins play today.” “Siri will I need a coat.” “Siri, set a timer to go off in ten minutes.” Really, these AI assistants won’t really take off until I can say, “Siri, I’m board” and it will come back with “The Twins game is on channel 12” or “Do you want me to play some music?” or “Your cousin Mike’s band is playing at the pub.” or even “Want to talk about it?” And I’ve seen demos of AIs that were just about that good. Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and the rest have to get to that point. The point where you feel like you’re talking to someone, not just barking orders to a machine. May 10, 2017 at 5:07 EDT PM Jeff Butts May 10, 2017 @geoduck: Agreed that Siri needs to get quite a bit better. However, consider this for your household coverage. I’ll even round up 😉 * Amazon Echo Show in your living room ($230) * Amazon Echo in your kitchen ($150) * Amazon Echo Dot in your other three rooms ($150, minus $20 for the current deal Amazon is offering) You’re at $510 for full coverage of your house. After all, you won’t really need the touch screen everywhere. You might not even need the full Echo in your kitchen, so you might be able to shave off another $100. I think Apple needs to follow a similar paradigm. A display-enabled device for the main room, and “satellites” that are much less expensive for other rooms of the house. May 10, 2017 at 5:13 EDT PM John Martellaro May 10, 2017 …we don’t want to have to pull our iPhones out of our pockets every time we want to ask Siri to do something or answer a question. Sure, because that would strain our arm muscles. May 10, 2017 at 6:22 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

There’s not much more to be done. But user hunger for computational power never ceases. While Apple has traditionally focused on design, it may be time for Apple to, instead, dwell on sheer computational power, an enduring addiction for everyone. Designs change. The need for speed endures. Every practical design for PCs and Macs has been tried. Towers are towers. Cool LED lights have been tried, but Apple treats that as unnecessary glitz. Thermal and planar motherboard geometry pretty much dictates how a tower or pizza box PC or Mac can look. That is, except for the 2013 Mac Pro. On April 4th, Apple executives told select members of the press: We designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner…. We were boxed by a circle. In terms of the MacBook/Air/Pro line, Apple has reached the pinnacle of industrial design. Years ago, the keyboard moved from the front of the base to the back—so there’d be room to rest one’s wrists. Everyone copied that. The base and lid have gotten thinner and thinner to the point where even battery power was sacrificed. The 2016 MacBok Pro has a lid that’s so thin, it proved necessary to give up the lighted Apple logo. Sigh. Also, the 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro is 14.9 mm thin. The new Microsoft Surface Laptop is 14.5 mm thin. Many readers have told me that that’s far enough. Too much capability is given away by an unhealthy obsession for a thin notebook computer. Pondering the Next Pro Macs On May 8th, Jean-Louis Gassée, in his Monday Note, pondered “Mac Pro: Failure and Future.” It’s a good recap on what went wrong with the 2013 Mac Pro, part of which I quoted above. I thought about this article for a long time because an essential turning point in PC and Mac technology seems to be upon us. With designs fairly mature, Apple can no longer dazzle us with design improvements. For example, the MacBook Pro, with minor changes, looks essentially the way it did in 2012. If taken back in a time machine to that era, users would nod with appreciation at the strides in minimizing the thickness, but would likely admit there’s nothing new happening.   2016 MacBook Pro, 13 and 15. Image credit: Apple. Where to go from here? Where Apple went wrong, in my estimation, was in the notion that the Touch Bar would offer a design and thereby functional leap forward. The competition, instead started thinking about how to provide more performance. In terms of the Mac Pro, I will argue that computational and graphics power are paramount, even if that means Apple can’t set the world on fire with a novel industrial design. After all, form follows function. I’d hope to see caution and prudence. Some readers tell me they’d be happy with a return to the classic cheese grater design, but with 2018 internals.  Smaller and fewer fans. The need for speed isn’t restricted to jet pilots. People who make a living with their Macs, whether they’re developers or creative and technical pros, or scientists have had their appetites whetted by ordinary looking desktop PCs with 64, 128, 256 GB of RAM, terabytes of storage, modern busses, and some very practical approaches to ports and connections. Meanwhile, Apple hung its hat on OpenCL as a way of extracting great computational power from the GPU in a massively parallel way. But my take is that OpenCL didn’t catch on the way Apple thought it would. For a long time, I am told by a scientist, a serious bug in OpenCL made it useless for users, and Apple took its time patching it. That tells you the priority Apple placed on it. Speed is the New Design Apple has always felt that its designs made its computers so desirable that a moderately conservative internal design approach would be overlooked. By the time a Mac of any kind started to look old, annual incremental advances would accumulate, over four or five years, to make the newest Mac seem snappier. A happy illusion. Today, with a new emphasis on raw power needed to fuel CAD, AR and VR, Apple may have to look at less dramatic advances in industrial design and, instead, develop an uncharacteristic obsession for performance, without gimmicks, that we’ve seldom seen before. It would be most welcome. _________________________ Performance meter via Shutterstock.

In fact, I bought the my latest MBA because the MacBook was, in fact, too thin with too few connectors and paltry battery life. On the other end, my current development machine is a beefy 2012 MacBook Pro. It _is_ too thin. I would’ve replaced it with the 2016 model but they went the wrong direction from my perspective. Thank you, John, for pointing this out. May 10, 2017 at 7:20 EDT PM macjeffff May 10, 2017 I love my 2016 MacBook Pro, but having to use dongles on a pro machine is embarrassing. Also, the touch bar is crazy thin, so not as useful as it might be. Strange, too, as there’s a lot of available space for a thicker bar. I hope they can speed up the process for a new pro tower. I don’t need it myself, but I want to see Apple assert itself as a leader in computing again. May 10, 2017 at 10:36 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Apple gets iTunes-like Indian patent for media programme Apple gets iTunes-like Indian patent for media programme Apple has been granted an Indian patent for a media management program, akin to its own iTunes, which will help viewers enjoy graphical interface while browsing through multiple browsers. By: Sajan C Kumar | Chennai | Published: May 11, 2017 5:50 AM Apple filed the patent application, titled ‘A method for browsing data items with respect to a display screen associated with a computing device and an electronic device’, in 2009 at the Kolkata patent office. (Reuters) Apple has been granted an Indian patent for a media management program, akin to its own iTunes, which will help viewers enjoy graphical interface while browsing through multiple browsers. The invention for which a patent protection has been provided relates to browsing media content with multiple browsers that allows the user to play, sort, modify, store and catalogue their media. According to a patent document filed by Apple, the graphical user interface typically includes a text-based browse window that allows a user to browse through and select a particular media track on electronic devices, including cell phones. The media-management program could also be linked with an online media store so that new media can be bought and transferred to the devices, the company said, citing the example of iTunes manufactured by Apple. Apple filed the patent application, titled ‘A method for browsing data items with respect to a display screen associated with a computing device and an electronic device’, in 2009 at the Kolkata patent office. Nirmalya Sinha, deputy controller of patents & designs, Kolkata, granted the patent to Apple after being satisfied with the responses provided against the objections raised by the patent office in the first examination report. Outlining the need for a better media-management program, the company said in the application that while a single text-based browse window is sufficient, there is still a desire for improved methods and systems for browsing through media items. For instance, a single browse window may be limiting to users who desire to browse through more than one media group at a given time. Furthermore, in some cases, finding a desired media item can be difficult when browsing through rows and rows of text, it submitted. Apple submitted that the graphical user interface includes an application window generated by the media application programme. The application window concurrently includes a first browse window and a second browse window. The first browse window displays descriptive information regarding a media file, while the second browse window displays images associated with one or more media files. The content shown in the first and second browse windows are automatically synchronised when selections are made. Arguing for the patent further, Apple pointed out that the invention involves methods and systems that improve the way media is played, modified and stored.

See Offers Arts & Entertainment Posted Yesterday at 7:53 PM Updated May 10 increase font size Techno-opera about Steve Jobs gets financial backing The Santa Fe Opera is preparing for the world premiere. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, died in 2011. "The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs" will premiere in July. Reuters/Robert Galbraith SANTA FE, N.M. — A techno-infused opera about the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has earned the financial backing of opera companies in San Francisco and Seattle, ensuring the musical meditation on the iconic entrepreneur will travel to America’s high-tech enclave. The partnerships were announced Tuesday as the Santa Fe Opera prepared for its July world premiere of “The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs” at its open-air summer stage in the foothills of New Mexico’s Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The Seattle Opera and the San Francisco Opera are underwriting both the already completed artistic creation of the opera, led by composer and electronica DJ Mason Bates, and its physical stage production. As co-producers, the companies guarantee their right to performances beyond Santa Fe in California and Washington. The Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University also has signed on as a co-producer. Jobs’ life story, as the relentless technology pioneer who embraced Buddhism and simple vegetarian family dinners, has been the subject of documentaries, books, a feature film and a graphic novel since his death from cancer in 2011. Sponsors of the Jobs opera are counting on Bates and librettist Mark Campbell to deliver a “deeply layered, moving portrayal of a man grappling with the complex priorities of life, family and work,” in the words of San Francisco opera general manager Matthew Shilvock. “He was also a real person and a member of our community,” Shilvock said of Jobs in a written announcement. Charles MacKay, general director of the Santa Fe Opera, said Jobs provides the “sort of heroic, tragic figure” that operas have explored for centuries – who also may lure new and younger audiences to metropolitan opera houses.

By Heather Kelly SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Apple is investing an additional $1 billion in its data center operations in northern Nevada, the company announced at a Reno city council meeting on Wednesday. The original deal, struck five years ago, gave Apple a record-setting tax break for opening up shop in the area. Apple promised to invest $1 billion in the area over 10 years. The various sales and property tax abatements, originally valued at $89 million, will carry over to new investments. "Five years ago, we announced in this very room a billion dollar investment in northern Nevada," said Apple's Mike Foulks at the meeting. "We're excited to announce today that Apple will be increasing our investment in Nevada by $1 billion." The company is also buying a 27,000-square-foot lot in downtown Reno, where it will build a $4 million warehouse for purchasing and receiving. The city council was voting on a small part of the plan that would allow Apple to purchase rather than rent the lot. When completed, the warehouse would only have office space for 15 people, according to Foulks. Though located in a tourism district, it would be closed to the public and highly secured due to the millions of dollars in goods going in and out. However, Foulks said the building would be "beautiful," with signature Apple architecture flourishes and landscaping. He said the company even agreed to add external Apple signage, which is not typical for these types of buildings. "We really want to make sure that this is not an island downtown with things around it that don't fit," said Foulks. Foulks also said Apple would have a continuous stream of construction projects in the area to help avoid the boom and bust of construction jobs. Council members credited Apple with inspiring other tech companies to move parts of their operations to the area, like the Tesla factory outside of Sparks, Nevada. But not everyone was in favor of letting Apple expand its footprint in Reno. "I am not going to support this deal and amendment," said the lone nay vote, councilwoman Jenny Brekhus. She was concerned with the large number of tax incentives offered to the company. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The acquisition is unusual because it appears Apple plans to keep selling the Beddit hardware while collecting sleep-related data from users. For that reason, we took a look at some of the things Apple might be planning to do with this data and how it might impact future products. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple's Beddit purchase came to light because Beddit updated its privacy policy to both highlight the acquisition and implement Apple's privacy rules. "Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy," reads the site. Apple appears to have purchased Beddit for its sleep sensing technology. Beddit uses a $150 sleep monitoring device that's placed under the bottom sheet of a mattress, collecting data on everything from sleep time and efficiency to heart rate and respiration. It also tracks movement, snoring, room temperature, and room humidity to determine factors that might disturb sleep. Beddit's sensor uses ballistocardiography (BCG) to measure the mechanical activity of the heart, lungs, and other body functions, a non-invasive monitoring technology that's similar to the light-based photoplethysmography the Apple Watch uses to monitor heart rate. With BCG, when the heart beats, it measures the mechanical impulse generated by the acceleration of the blood through the circulatory system, providing a wealth of data about the body. Apple is likely interested in the sensor technology used in the Beddit device, and has indeed hired medical experts who have worked with ballistocardiography in the past, but the data collected also seems to be of interest due to the company's decision to keep selling the Beddit sensor. Beddit's technology and data could be used for any number of things, from advancing sleep research for efforts like HealthKit and CareKit to implementing more advanced health-tracking technology and sleep monitoring functionality into the Apple Watch or other future wearable devices. For the immediate future, it appears Apple will continue to sell the Beddit hardware as part of a standalone brand like Beats, but the company's longer-term plans for Beddit are unknown.

Their latest update stopps Beddit 2 support, so last week the company gave everyone who had one a FREE Beddit 3. No paying for shipping, no tricks, just a free new unit. They were VERY aggressive about getting people to upgrade. In-app notifcations, emails, the whole nine. The acquisition was announced like four days later. I wonder if they just did this as a gesture of good faith instead of making a lot of people go "Oh Apple bought them and the old one stopped working! **** that!"

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Small Biotechs May Beat Silicon Valley Tech Titans and Big Pharma in The Bioelectronic Medicine Race Apple looks to have entered into the bioelectronic medicine race following in the footsteps of Google’s parent company Alphabet and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) by hiring a team of biomedical engineers to work on a secret initiative, initially envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop devices and sensors to treat diabetes, according to CNBC reporting. These devices and sensors are part of a rapidly emerging field called bioelectronics, which is the study and application of electronics in medicine and biological processes. It is a tech revolution in medicine and the race to produce “electroceuticals,” which are medical devices that use electrical, electromagnetic, mechanical, or light stimulation to affect electrical signaling in relevant tissue types to treat a multitude of conditions and diseases is in full gear. Despite the large spotlight that has been placed on the field of bioelectronic medicine by the announcement of initiatives and partnerships from Silicon Valley titans and big pharmaceutical companies, like GlaxoSmithKline, the race may be actually be won by smaller and lesser known biotechs. While Apple is working on sensors to monitor blood glucose levels without piercing the skin, big Pharma is looking to take the invasive route with the development of implantable electronic devices. However, the future may be in non-invasive wearable devices that are not implanted, but rather placed on top the skin over organs like the heart or liver, or embedded in clothing to treat diseases using electromagnetic waves that can penetrate deep into tissues to stimulate healing rather than the need to implant electrical nerve stimulators. One biotech that is taking a non-invasive approach to electroceuticals is Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB: ENDV). ENDV is currently building its pipeline of non-invasive therapeutics for the treatment of vascular diseases and inflammatory conditions in vital organs, such as heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and inflammatory diseases of the liver, kidneys, and other vital organs.    Endonovo’s electroceutical platform, which it calls “Immunotronics” harnesses magnetically induced electric fields to directly and more importantly, non-invasively stimulate tissues and organs from outside of the body. While the initiatives and partnerships between tech titans and big Pharma seem like moon shots, ENDV’s technology is much further along in development and dates back to work originally started at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which sought to develop novel treatments for illnesses that astronauts might encounter during long term missions in outer space. The company is currently evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of its non-invasive electroceutical in pre-clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of heart failure following myocardial infarction and for the treatment of critical limb ischemia. Another small biotech company working on electric treatments for diseases is Pulse Biosciences (PLSE), whose Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) technology uses nano second electric pulses to illicit an immune response for the treatment of cancer. PLSE has been on an absolute tear since it was announced that healthcare executives and entrepreneurs Robert Duggan and Dr. Maky Zanganeh had acquired a combined interest of 17.1% in PLSE. PLSE is up over 230% in the last three months. Both ENDV and PLSE seek to uses electrical signals to control or influence the immune response. Whereas, Pulse Biosciences seems to be concentrated on the use of electrical fields to illicit an immune response against cancers, Endonovo Therapeutics is using magnetically induced electrical fields to produce an anti-inflammatory response to treat inflammation in vital organs and tissues. Endonovo Therapeutics seems to be setting its self up for a run to PLSE levels. It recently announced a financing from a strategic healthcare investor to uplist its common stock onto a national stock exchange and is up more than 230% over the last three months from its all time low. ENDV’s management seems to be extremely bullish on the company; having filed 48 SEC Insider Form 4 statements since late February. To quote one of the greatest investors of all time, Peter Lynch, “insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.” With a market cap differential of about $300 million between ENDV and PLSE, savvy investors may want to take a closer look at Endonovo Therapeutics. In Other Biotech News: MannKind (MNKD) announced earlier this month that they’ve reached a Memorandum of Understanding with their inhaled insulin, Afrezza. The inhaled treatment is designed to simplify the complexity of starting and staying on mealtime insulin. Cerulean (CERU) announced in March that they entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement with Daré, under which the equityholders of Daré will become the majority owners of Cerulean. This creates a NASDAQ-listed company focused on the development and commercialization of products for women’s reproductive health. Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PGNX) today announced their financial results for the first quarter of 2017 and highlighted bmajor developments within our clinical pipeline. Be on the lookout for positive topline data from PGNX’s registrational Phase 2b study of AZEDRA which treats pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Immunomedics, Inc. (IMMU) is an oncology stock that is developing a drug called sacituzumab govitecan, or more commonly IMMU-132. It’s a breast cancer asset and its primary indication right now is a type of breast cancer called metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). IMMU pushed the drug through phase II clinical trials, buying back the rights to the drug from Seattle-based company Seattle Genetics (SGEN).   Legal Disclaimer Except for the historical information presented herein, matters discussed in this article contain forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.

Apple’s released two new versions of iOS 10.3. One version, iOS 10.3.2, is an unreleased bug fixer that’s in beta testing ahead of an unknown release date. The other version, iOS 10.3.1, is a small maintenance release for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. iOS 10.3.1 is much smaller than its predecessor (iOS 10.3) but it’s still an important upgrade for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. iOS 10.3.1 comes with an important security patch and bug fixes and there’s a chance it could have a dramatic effect on your device’s overall performance. Its been a little over a month since its release and iOS 10.3.1 continues its reign as the most up-to-date version of iOS 10. With that in mind, we want to walk you through the most important things to know, right now, about iOS 10.3.1’s performance, problems, and what’s coming next for iOS 10 users. iOS 10.3.1 Review The iOS 10.3.1 update is tiny if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.3. On the iPhone 7, you can expect a 30MB download. We were able to finish up the the download in a matter of seconds though the installation process took about 5 minutes to complete on our phone. We recommend putting aside 10 minutes or so to monitor the situation. Our installation went smoothly but there’s no telling what you might encounter. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from something older than iOS 10.3 your iOS 10.3.1 update will be much larger thanks to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3’s features and fixes will be baked into your update so make sure you put aside 30 minutes or so to monitor the download and the installation. In the weeks since iOS 10.3.1’s release we’ve downloaded and installed the update on five versions of the iPhone: iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5. If you want some quick feedback, head to those links. We’ve also installed the software on four versions of the iPad including the iPad Air, iPad mini, and iPad Pro. Right now, iOS 10.3.1 is looking good. And given what’s on board (an important fix for a potential Wi-Fi exploit), it’s definitely worth a look if you own one of these devices. If you need additional feedback about iOS 10.3.1 and its changes, take a look at our reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. iOS 10.3.1 Update: What’s New The iOS 10.3.1 change log states the update comes with bug fixes and security patches meaning it’s a maintenance update. Don’t expect any new features on board. Apple lists the iOS 10.3.1 update as having an single security patch. The update also reportedly fixes unnamed iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c issues. That said, if you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.2.1 or something older, you’ll get a bunch of new features with iOS 10.3.1 due to iOS 10.3. If you’re unfamiliar with iOS 10.3 we recommend taking a look at our walkthrough so that you can get familiar with its features before you install iOS 10.3.1 on your device. It’s also worth noting that Apple’s Clips application is finally out on the App Store for both the iPhone and iPad. Clips is available for select devices running iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1. Clips isn’t available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or iPad 4. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s a small update but the iOS 10.3.1 update is causing problems for many iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. iOS 10.3.1 users are complaining about battery drain, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, various first and third-party apps, lag, random reboots, and more. We expect complaints to pickup as more people find and discover the iOS 10.3.1 update lurking in Settings or on iTunes. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update, take a look at our list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems. You’ll also want to take a look at our tips to improve iOS 10.3.1 performance. You’ll also want to report any issues you see to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix for the issue. Note: You can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to fix performance issues. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 which means you’re stuck on iOS 10.3.1 until the company rolls out a new update. iOS 10.3.1 Jailbreak If you’re jailbroken, skip the iOS 10.3.1 update. For now Jailbreak developers haven’t released a working jailbreak tool for iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 but we could see one get released after Apple releases its next iOS 10 update. Developers have reportedly cracked the iOS 10.3.1 update though it’s unclear if they’ll release it to the public. Rumors suggest we could see a release sometime after Apple releases iOS 10.3.2 but this remains unconfirmed. For now, you must be on iOS 10.2 or something older to jailbreak an iPhone or an iPad. Unfortunately, there’s no way to downgrade to anything older than iOS 10.2.1. For more on the iOS 10 jailbreak, see our roundup. What’s Next With the iOS 10.3.1 release out of the way, Apple’s now focused on iOS 10.3.2, another maintenance update. Apple’s iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta for developers and the general public. We still don’t have a release date (we’re on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 so it could land soon) and we might not get one ahead of time. Apple typically doesn’t confirm iOS release dates. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 update out ahead of its release, early software can and probably will cause problems on your device. So you’ll want to be sure about the beta, especially now that we’re so close to an official release. For more on the merits of the iOS 10.3.2 beta, take a look at our walkthrough. WWDC 2017 is set for early June. It’s also worth noting that we’re just a few short weeks away from Apple’s annual developer conference, WWDC. At WWDC 2017, we expect Apple to debut its next major update, iOS 11. While an iOS 11 release will probably take place alongside the new iPhone this fall, Apple could release an iOS 11 beta for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch soon after the WWDC 2017 keynote in early June. Apple’s WWDC 2017 keynote is scheduled for the morning of June 5th. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 7 Responses 04/05/2017 H. Mitchell Reply I would like to see a fix for the recent calls listed on mutiple devices linked to the same apple id. Apple seems to store your call history ‘somewhere’ and my recent calls are displayed on my husband’s and daughter’s device (and vice versa). Apple has no business with my call history, this is private information and should only be accessible by my service provider and myself. Call history should not be linked via an apple id. 04/10/2017 Sebastian Reply DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE! I have had several problems. I gave an iPhone 6s. 2 factor authentication did not work. When I got a hold of apple support they said to turn it off and wait for the next update. Worst part, my battery gets depleted very rapidly. Within 30 minutes my fully charged phone died! 04/14/2017 Thomas Meredith Reply Ever since I have done the update. My messaging system is saying waiting on activation. I can no longer message anyone. How do I fix this? 04/19/2017 Anand Reply I am unable to do the upgrade. Whenever I try (tried 20times so far) it goes up to “Verifying updates” and thereafter I receive a message “An error occurred while installing 10.3.1” with two options “Retry” and “Remind me later” I have followed all the instructions but unable to resolve this problem 04/25/2017 K Nelson Reply This update has messed up my email. I am not getting alerts and can not send email from my iPad. The email addresses do not appear to be a available to use. I email addresses are incorrect. Now. I use email to get my work assignments and not receiving them on time makes me miss work. And I can’t send emails from my addresses. 05/04/2017 Jamison Reply I cand play music or videos in the background from youtube, is it just me or is it really a problem I’ve tried rebooting my iPad mini but it hasn’t fixed the problem. I’ve also tried messing around with the settings but it still didn’t work. Please help me fix it. 05/04/2017 Jamison Reply I can’t play music or videos in the background from youtube, is it just me or is it really a problem I’ve tried rebooting my iPad mini but it hasn’t fixed the problem.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Features Androids in an Apple Land Features Androids in an Apple Land By Sameer Kotian - May 10, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Ever feel like Androids are the “relative nobody talks about”? Granted, the Google search results are on par with Apple. The reality is the media darling has been and continues to be Apple. Phones are like automobiles. Once someone develops brand loyalty, be it to Apple or Android, they stay. Chances are, your Mom or Dad was a loyal Ford, General Motors, or Chrysler supporter. For decades. For the loyal Android customers, let’s take a short trip down memory lane. Once we have done that, a look will be taken at some of the latest apps that have received positive reviews. We will close with some insight into the creation of these apps. Historical Recap Android began its rise to prominence in 2005, when it was acquired by Google. In 2007, 5 months after Apple launched the iPhone, Android made the move from practical obscurity to national recognition. In those formidable early years, Google, and Android developers had a closet full of close to 100 different style phones, and they were developing software 1 phone at a time. A tedious process that would bear fruit in time. Look at where Android has landed today. The countless models that have been released. Take into consideration the fact that close to 1 billion Android devices have been sold. If that is not convincing enough, how about 1.5 million Android devices are activated daily. A Sampling of the Latest Android Apps Now, let’s fast-forward to 2017. Android apps come out on a daily basis. The market is flooded with them. Sorting through the sea of apps is a time-consuming process, better left to those with experience and knowledge. Joe Hindy is the “Android Authority app guy”, and he reviewed some of the best Android apps to be launched for April of 2017. Here is a sampling of them: – Microsoft To Do Need some help staying organized and tired of carrying around sheets of paper with your daily to-do list? To Do is the latest app offered up by Microsoft, and it’s simple in design and use. Even better, it syncs up between your PC and Android device – Podcast Go If you enjoy listening to a podcast from time to time, Podcast Go is a simple app to download and use. You will find a collection of over 300,000 podcasts available from various genres. The only potential drawback that one may experience is the presence of advertisements Creation of Apps The effort necessary to create and launch a new app is often taken for granted. What many fail to realize is the collaboration necessary between developers and operations personnel to make for a smooth process. The term DevOps is misunderstood by some. The purpose behind this “design” is to enable the development team to become self-sufficient, thereby improving the app creation process. What is certain is that industry leaders utilize popular DevOps tools to eliminate needless backtracking. It will be interesting to follow the competition between Apple and Android. As the Android apps flow out daily, remember the necessary effort put forth by the development teams to make our lives easier.

Abstract Global apple production amounted to 87,338 thousand tonnes in 2015, rising by +3.2% against the previous year level. Overall, the global apple output pursued a pronounced growth from 2007 to 2015. The trend pattern, however, indicated some noticable fluctuations throughout the analyzed period. The total output figures increased at an average annual rate of +3.7%. The growth pace was the most rapid in 2011, when the output figure increased by +8% from the previous year level. Over the period under review, the global apple production reached its maximum volume in 2015, and is likely to continue its growth in the immediate term. Over the analyzed period, an increase in global apple production was primarily driven by growth of population. Furthermore, these key drivers are expected to continue promoting the apple output in the immediate term. The world apple harvested area amounted to 5,103 thousand ha in 2015, which was 1.0% more than the previous year figure. The harvested area indicated a slight increase over the period under review, representing a compound annual growth rate of +0.8% from 2007 to 2015. This trend pattern was relatively stable throughout the analyzed period. Over the period under review, the total harvested area of apple peaked in 2013, falling back in the following year. The global average yield of apple amounted to 173 thousand hg/ha in 2015, rising by 3.4% from the previous year figure. The yield figures recorded an upward trend over the period under review, with a compound annual growth rate standing at +3.1% from 2007 to 2015. However, the yield levels displayed some little fluctuations over the recent years. The highest apple yields were recorded in 2015. Albeit an intensification of modern agricultural technics use, the future yield figures subject to a substantional risk of adverse weather conditions. Table of contetnts 1.

In the dank underground chambers of James Ponsoldt’s The Circle, inside the literal bunkers of a tech conglomerate called The Circle, a fellow named Kalden (John Boyega) pulls Mae Holland (Emily Watson) aside and proclaims, a real act of love in James Ponsoldt’s world, that “you don’t have a cynical bone in your body.” The moment is neither cute nor sweet but just sort of sits in front of us. Watson’s Mae smiles and gives us Hermione’s please-the-professor grin. Is it real? Was it ever? “One of the many problems with The Circle is that it never gets much of a handle on Mae,” wrote Will Leitch in The New Republic. Angie Han, over at Mashable, calls the characters, Mae included, “empty vessels made to parrot diatribes.” This is jarring, as Ponsoldt’s last two movies were able to find rich and believable human expression in deadbeat dads and deadbeat novelists alike. Where many have seen this as the movie’s crushing failure (as testified by its 16% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), I see it as evidence of Ponsoldt’s stunning accomplishment as a narrative filmmaker. Have any of you actually been inside an Apple Store? Like the proverbial gingers, these people have no souls. Great Movie or Greatest Movie? People who like to talk about directors like to talk about careers. The move from low-budget to big, the space in between Whiplash and La La Land. Ponsoldt has been somewhat hard to exactly pin down, following his official ‘breakout’ hit (The Spectacular Now) with a deep nosedive into the preoccupations of the literary and David Foster Wallace-worshipping class (End of the Tour). His decision to take on Dave Eggers’ The Circle was both odd, because the man is box-office poison, and sort of reassuring: Eggers may be a poor man’s Foster Wallace but the contents could be sold as the big league Black Mirror the market is clamoring for. To note, it starred a baker’s dozen of bankable talent; in addition to billion-dollar franchise movie stars Watson and Boyega there was one indie breakout (Ellar Coltrane, of Boyhood fame) and one big wheel to draw in the publicity (Tom Hanks). There was even one dude who Twitter really likes (Patton Oswalt). It was all very much and most critics came in expecting something huge, the kind of middle-range hit the people like to say doesn’t exist anymore. By this note, people will say The Circle has failed, under-performing nearly everything at the box office and surely proving why small movies made in New York by contemplative men and large franchises made in LA by men with smart haircuts are what the world really needs. Get Out. Logan. Whatever. But The Circle also fucking rules. In Ponsoldt’s hands, the mildly large budget Hollywood production (made for $18 mil, which is more than La La Land but less than, you know, Moonlight) relaxes into a visual cornucopia of expensive-looking 21st century imagery, that many reviewers have spent time quibbling about whether it looks more like  Google or Apple. Whatever. The Circle mercifully returns us to the old science-fiction, manufactured not out of cleverness and knowing winks about things that can’t be paid for but one built out of the old brick and mortar that made us the worlds of Blade Runner and Total Recall, thick temples that we yearn to enter. For this reason, Ponsoldt whisks us inside the machinery without wasting too much of our time, on the whole, getting us there. Her family is great (played by Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton, in a small role that Ponsoldt makes heartbreakingly moving) but there is no reason to waste the kind of time with them that the writers over at, say, Doctor Who like to do. There’s also a lot of cool stuff inside this here Circle and Ponsoldt’s choices glimmer: unlike most tech satires, these are jabs aimed at tech consumers (most of us) instead of at the more successful tech overlords (almost none of us). We spot the Dalai Lama on the grounds and indie festival-headliner Beck is summoned to celebrate the latest project of Eamon Bailey, the folksy boss man that Hanks plays: SeeChange. (Here is where the only meaningful criticism of The Circle lies: to celebrate SeeChange Beck plays “Dreams,” one of his more mediocre late-career singles. Winkingly disappointing, like most new technology.) An oozing techno score from Danny Elfman (of “The Simpsons Theme”-fame) keeps things shiny and bouncing, like what a leprechaun DJ would spin between acts at Coachella. I’d work here even if Soylent Green were secretly being manufactured down in the pits. But that’s part of the genius of the set-up: there is no secret. Smashing together all the boring nuance of everyone’s little pet startup-turned-conglomerate into one big mega fortress of tech, the world of The Circle works because it evokes a world that may not be real to anyone who has had a drink with someone who likes to talk about their super-niche start up but is real enough to anyone who’s ever bought an iPhone. All Kalden, a sorta-defecting former co-founder of The Circle, shows Mae deep in the caverns is that The Circle happens to be storing all that info it processes. Big whoop and Ponsoldt doesn’t waste too much time here or with Kalden (pity for Boyega, who has really perfected the art of betraying evil empires, but good for the movie; in Eggers’ novel, Mae and Kalden have lots of horribly-written sex). His interests are, instead, with the ordinary people and their relationship with their ordinary jobs inside a tech conglomerate. How does it make them feel and so forth? The argument has also been made, say, by Christina Warren at Gizmodo, that Ponsoldt’s world is too familiar and, thusly, doesn’t go far enough. “The Circle’s supposed dystopian universe doesn’t feel far off enough to be effective,” she wrote, making the comparisons to products like GoPro and whatever talking camera Amazon is currently cooking up. Aside from holographic screens, there isn’t very much in The Circle that most rich people don’t already use regularly. But most tech dramas, Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror is referenced religiously as is some ’90s tech thriller starring Sandra Bullock, don’t have very much interesting to say about technology. That rating interactions via social media would be awkward? That trolls persecuting perverts is a moral conundrum? Who cares? These are all great dramas that keep people on the edge of their seats, but have nothing to say about the people inside of them besides some tidy Orwell-esque cynicism about human behavior? Ponsoldt, however, uses the pace and hum of the thriller to do what old school thrillers do: rapidly create a visually complex world and, then, immediately reducing it to the elements that he is interested in. Some kind of spy mission, normally. Many have claimed that Ponsoldt’s interests in The Circle can be boiled down to privacy. David Edelstein, writing for Vulture, elucidates it thusly: “The theme of The Circle is transparency versus privacy.” While this might be said of Eggers’ paranoid novel, I don’t buy that Ponsoldt’s interest in the slow erosion of privacy is anything more than superficial. Privacy is long gone and Ponsoldt knows that. What interests him, instead, is how people relate to each other in a perpetually public sphere, i.e. a sphere that is constantly being capitalized. The movie’s aesthetic language speaks to this: by concentrating on the world of one brand, Ponsoldt is able to emphasize its presence everywhere. The little ‘C’ of the movie posters pops up everywhere, from the back of computers and phones à la Apple products to Dad’s t-shirt after Mae signs him up for the company health plan because he’s dying (surveillance state or nah, America hasn’t changed that much). The bright red color scheme, meant to evoke Apple’s love of translucent grey-white or Facebook’s many shades of blue, gives contemporary American technological iconography the feel of Soviet-era Moscow. And SeeChange, the system of cameras spread throughout the world in the style of Google Earth that Bailey introduces, is not some cheesy harbinger of surveillance state doom fresh out of 1984, as many have read it. It’s a harbinger of the commodification of everyday life, all those sponsored Instagram posts brought to three-dimensional life. When Mae is made the star of a live-streamed feed that follows her every move, it’s not because of anyone in The Circle, least of all Bailey, actually cares about what she is doing. Many have compared this plot point, this reality-TV of the every day, to the conceit of Peter Weir’s one-note The Truman Show but it’s a comparison that falls flat. Weir’s interests were in mocking everyday post-suburban ordinariness, jumping onto a crowded bandwagon that included everything from to Magnolia to American Beauty. We are given love interests and we are diligently ensured that Jim Carrey’s Truman is a real dude who just wants a real life. The cold apathetic remove of The Circle, however, prevents us from making these same asinine conclusions. The Circle’s interest in Mae is far more compelling: they want to use her to chance a brand to millions of people around the world, to put an Emma Watson-face on a multi-billion dollar conglomerate that’s under investigation by the Feds. And, in order to sell the product, as many social media managers know, Mae has to be on! She has to be on when she is invited to sit in on a big meeting, which thrills her millions of followers but doesn’t get her out of her entry-level position. She has to be on when she accidentally walks in, digitally, on her parents having sex. When the best friend character, Annie (Karen Gillan), wants to talk about her real feelings or whatnot, those real painful things which we often tune into the interweb precisely to hear from others, she begs Mae to not record her, to not force her to package those feelings into something that’s similarly and performatively on. It’s this self-conscious alienation, between our actual real lives and the version that everyone in media is compelled to be selling, that Ponsoldt masterfully captures. It’s also a space, in both Ponsoldt’s movie and our own, that is, often carefully gendered. The Instagram star, taking photos of their ordinary life, is, most popularly, a woman. The world of tech executives, who make most of the actual money off of this, remains, more often than not, male-dominated. The Circle reproduces this dichotomy perfectly. Mae, after all, becomes a viral sensation not because of any slavish and Silicon Valley celebrated genius-like attribute — Watson plays it perfectly with an ear for all the notes of false-modesty befitting today’s Jennifer Lawrence-era celebrity — but because she is an object of a vaguely-defined lifestyle lust. Ponsoldt depicts the moans of her followers with little tweets (called zings) that surround Watson whenever she’s online. The zings yearn. The zings are a pleading voice that wants to inhabit her life and she, in order to keep her job, must let them and must look like she loves it. Does she secretly hate it, does she yearn for anything else herself? We don’t know because we are, as viewers, just another follower. We realize, as anyone that follows a single blog must, that it is only participating in this walking advertisement that allows her to rise in a male-dominated tech company, where a chummy Oswalt joins the rebellious Boyega and the bearded Hanks as the company’s dick trifecta. Annie, while an executive, is slowly driven crazy in her attempt to compete with her male peers in the boardroom of the company they founded. All Mae has to do is give them, The Circle, her body. Ponsoldt’s twist, which differs significantly from the ending of Eggers’ novel, is that Mae uses that power to turn that objectifying, commoditizing gaze back onto its creators. Earlier in the movie, The Circle leaks the private email correspondence of a senator, coincidentally also a woman, who is forced to resign in controversy — evoking a neat real-world parallel to our own almost-first female president. Mae, exploiting her relationship with Kalden and her newfound audience of millions, trains that arrow on Bailey and his masculine ilk. Their private lives, their private and super-private email correspondences (Watson reading out all this is joyful) are released like doves in the wind. Ponsoldt plays all this like the explosions and blast of the Pixies that greets us at the end of Fight Club, a delightfully absurd euphoria enjoyed by the powerless. Watson’s performance as Mae is nothing short of a work of genius: always buzzy, always excited, always ambitious, she feels like a DJ Khaled of the tech world, both juicily inscrutable because the language they speak is purposeful without meaning. When she comes to the conclusion that the ideology of The Circle must, self-destructively, be turned inward, it is because it is not unlike the patriarchy of Silicon Valley, a holdover of an old social order. Ponsoldt deliberately, as he did in End of the Tour, does not mitigate this performance with useless and tedious characterization. Unlike, say, Spike Jonze’s Her — a movie that also looked at the effects new technology might have on an amiable protagonist played by one of Hollywood’s coolest talents — there is no meaningless love story, there is no personal arc for us to watch characters climb like children at a climbing wall. Where Her reduced the conceit of AI to Scarlett Johansson’s voice in order to show how it related to a writer getting laid, The Circle uses a contemporary surveillance scheme to show how it alters the way people interact with their own lives and each other, evoking an incapacity to create sincere engagement when all engagement is branded. The risk that Ponsoldt takes — unlike even Eggers, who provides a more definitive answer in his ending — is that he does not let us on: the movie’s token anti-technology character, the staple holding together every episode of Black Mirror, is Coltrane’s horrendously boring folk artist who self-consciously martyrs himself, signifying nothing. The deliberate limpness of his performance is yet another genius stroke; a smart parody of off-the-grid subculture, Ponsoldt’s uses him to point to its impotence. Yet, for a movie that spends a considerable amount of its time streaming the personal details of its protagonist’s life to an audience of millions, many have complained that The Circle feels thin. But this merely restates the movie’s ultimate point: as content consumers, we are perpetually alienated from getting ‘a handle’ on anyone. Does Kylie Jenner genuinely enjoy Pepsi? What about the clothes she wears? What about absolutely anything about her as a person? In a world where technology has, as they say, taken over everything, the space for sincere bones, hidden and shown in private light is nonexistent. It’s all gloss and it’s all great. Much like The Circle. The Circle is great. MoviesOpinionsScience Fiction Previous ArticleHear Us Out: What If ‘World War Z 2’ Is Great?

 5 companies are carrying the S&P 500 Wolf Richter, Wolf Street May 10, 2017, 4:37 PM 2,225 facebook linkedin twitter email print Over the past 10 weeks – so since March 1, 2017 – five stocks in the S&P 500 index have gained a total of $260 billion in market value, the infamous FAANG stocks: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet). By any measure, $260 billion is a massive surge in valuation for just five stocks, or 1% of the S&P 500, in just 10 weeks. And the rest of the S&P 500? On March 1, the index closed at 2,394. Today it closed at 2,397. In those 10 weeks, it went absolutely nowhere. Which means this: the remaining 495 stocks in the index lost as much in total market capitalization as the FAANG stocks gained. This chart shows the impact of “the new 1%,” as John Alexander at MacroCharting calls them, versus the 99%: Wolf Street Facebook has been edging lower from its high of May 2 and today closed at $150.48, which still gives it a market capitalization of $436 billion. Apple, which closed at a high of $153.99 today, hit a market cap of $802 billion, after the Warren Buffett surge. Via a quarterly SEC filing, his investment vehicle disclosed that its holdings of Apple shares had jumped to $19.2 billion as of March 31, from $7.1 billion on December 31. It now owns 133.65 million shares. The filing was immediately mediatized. Buffett’s avuncular face appeared on CNBC yesterday. Everyone talked about it. And after already rising due to this enormous buying pressure, Apple shares surged some more. He has a powerful megaphone. He can even move the shares of a giant like Apple and benefit handsomely from his megaphone. If Apple moves 10%, $80 billion move along with it, up or down. Amazon rose to a high of $952.82 today. Everyone is itching to short this stock. A lot of people followed their itch to short it at $100 a share, and then at $200 a share, and so on, getting their heads handed to them all along the way in this crazy market. The stock now sports a market value of $455 billion and a PE ratio of about 180. Netflix is the dwarf in this bunch with a market cap of $68 billion. But it gained 10% in those 10 weeks. Its PE ratio is 203. But unlike Tesla, moving closer with its market cap of $52 billion, Netflix at least has a positive PE ratio. Alphabet – the old G in FAANG – has surged 11.6% over the past 10 weeks to $932.17 a share, giving it a market cap of $651 billion. The five FAANG stocks combined have a market value of $2.4 trillion. That’s the size of the GDP of France. And just forget the rest of Corporate America and its struggles. On the other hand, a decline of 30% – not unheard of with these stocks – wipes out $720 billion. But we’ve been reassured: that’ll never ever happen again. So clearly, it’s not all careening downhill, at least not for everyone. But when it comes to internet advertising, which is surging, only Alphabet and Facebook matter.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Tablets Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Leak points to June release for Apple’s completely redesigned iPad Pro Zach Epstein @zacharye May 10th, 2017 at 3:27 PM Share Tweet At this point, it’s quite possible that the iPad is the most unsexy product Apple sells. It’s a great product, don’t get us wrong, but consumers by and large simply don’t care about tablets anymore. iPad sales continue to decline each quarter, and the global tablet market has been sliding as well. While industry monitors like Gartner insisted time and time again that tablets were “the next big thing,” the truth is that the fill a gap that many people just don’t care about. Add to that the fact that people who do buy tablets don’t upgrade very quickly, and you’re left with a market that doesn’t seem to have much room for growth right now. If recent rumors pan out, however, it looks like Apple will look to rekindle consumers’ love affair with iPads by releasing a brand new tablet with a big redesign. Don't Miss: Add a high-tech Head Up Display to any car for under $50 According to a number of independent reports from several different tech blogs with good track records, Apple’s iPad lineup will soon see a brand new addition. The new iPad Pro rumored to be debuting sometime this year is expected to feature a fresh new design that will serve as something of a preview for Apple’s iPhone 8 design. The tablet is expected to be about the same size as Apple’s current 97.-inch iPad Pro, but it will feature a 10.5-inch display. How will Apple fit a larger display into a tablet that’s the same size as its current iPad Pro model? You guessed it… by shrinking the bezels. Rumor has it the new iPad Pro set to be released this year will feature a nice big 10.5-inch display with much smaller bezels than we’ve ever seen on an iPad. The screen will extend nearly to all four edges of the device, if recent reports hold true. Some also believe the new iPad Pro will do away with the home button and feature a Touch ID scanner embedded in the screen, though it seems unlikely that Apple would release an iPad with a new embedded fingerprint scanner before its new iPhone 8 is unveiled. The timing of the new iPad Pro’s release is still something of a mystery. Rumors had pointed to a March announcement, but March came and went without an announcement. Now, a new leak suggests that Apple could be lining up a June release for the new iPad Pro, which would make sense if the company unveils the new model during its WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th. Apple news blog 9to5Mac on Wednesday posted what it claims is a photo of the inventory screen at an unspecified Apple reseller. In the image, a number of third-party cases from Urban Armor Gear are listed as fitting an “iPad 10.5″.” No other information can be ascertained from the image, but we won’t have long to wait before we find out since WWDC 2017 is now less than a month away.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 11, 2:57 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology iPhone 7S Rumors: New Leaked Photo Shows iPhone 7S or iPhone SE Could Feature Ion-X Glass Display By Denisse Moreno On 05/10/17 AT 4:21 PM Close The next iPhone SE or iPhone 7S could come with a strengthened Ion-X glass display, a leaked photo submitted to Slashleaks and found by MacRumors shows. The image shows the back of a black iPhone with a sheet under it that suggests the device will come with an Ion-X glass display, like the material found on some Apple Watch devices. The paperwork could belong to Apple manufacturers Foxconn, Pegatron or Wistron. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date: Apple Could Launch Device In October, According To Supply Chain Reports The leaked photo, which was found on Chinese social platform Sina Weibo, shows the device under the codename “N79.” The image shows two vertical cutouts, one for a single-lens camera and another for what could be an LED flash. The device’s back camera system is different from what is rumored for the iPhone 8. The 10th anniversary device is expected to come with a vertical dual-camera system. Here’s the leaked photo of the iPhone SE or iPhone 7S: It’s unclear whether the leaked image is legitimate, and it’s unknown whether the Ion-X glass display will be featured on the iPhone SE or iPhone 7S. It could be the iPhone 7S, since Apple already released its latest iPhone SE in March. For the most recent iPhone SE version, Apple doubled the capacity of the previous 4-inch iPhone SE models, which came with 16GB and 64GB. The iPhone SE now has capacities of 32GB and 128GB, priced at $399 and $499, respectively. iPhone 7S Rumors Apple is expected to release three models this year, the iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. A previous report said the rumored iPhone 7S, which is expected to measure 4.7 inches, will continue using an aluminum-alloy chassis supplied by Catcher Technology. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the iPhone 7S could pack as much battery capacity as the iPhone 7 Plus. Meanwhile, Barclays analysts said in March Apple will include True Tone displays on all three models to be released this year. Read: iPhone 8 Rumors, Release Date, Delays: Every Leak, Feature We Know About Apple’s 10th Anniversary Phone Other rumors have suggested Apple will not release the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus this year, and that the company has dropped “S” upgrades. Apple reportedly will focus on launching the iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus. iPhone 8 Leaked Images Meanwhile, new renders of the upcoming iPhone 8 apparently were leaked Tuesday. The images, released by MySmartPrice and @OnLeaks, are believed to have come from a factory working on the much-anticipated device. The photos suggest the iPhone 8 will sport an edge-to-edge OLED display and an all-glass back panel as previous rumors have indicated. The images also show a vertical dual camera system and no home button, which indicates Apple could embed the phone’s Touch ID in the display. Other rumors suggest the iPhone 8 will come with a 3D-sensing front camera and wireless charging. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

With a release on the horizon, we want to help first timers prepare for the iOS 11 beta release. On June 5th, Apple executives will take the stage at the company’s annual developer conference. And it’s there we expect the company to outline the future of macOS and the iOS software that powers its mobile devices. An iOS 11 update isn’t confirmed for WWDC 2017 but it will almost certainly be one of the stars of the show. And if Apple follows its standard release protocol, we should see an early version of iOS 11 emerge shortly after the keynote concludes. We expect Apple to release an iOS 11 beta in early June giving select iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users a chance to try the software’s changes ahead of an official release date in the fall alongside new iPhone models. Thanks to Apple’s Beta Software Program, anyone can try iOS software early, for free. And with an official release probably months away, we expect the iOS 11 beta to draw a bunch of first-time beta testers. If you’re thinking about trying the iOS 11 beta, make sure you’re ready, particularly if this beta will be your first excursion into the world of early iOS software. While it might seem early, we recommend doing some prep work ahead of WWDC 2017 and the inevitable iOS 11 beta release. Read the Rules Before the iOS 11 arrives you’ll want to get familiar with Apple’s rules and regulations. If you think you might want to register as a developer, you’ll want to take a look at Apple’s beta website for developers. If you think you’ll opt for the free Beta Software Program, you’ll want to read Apple’s official FAQ for the Beta Software Program. Make sure you understand what you’re signing up for before the iOS 11 beta arrives. Decide How to Download the iOS 11 Beta There will almost certainly be two versions of the iOS 11 beta, a developer version and a public version. You’ll want to decide which is right for you, ahead WWDC. Here are a few things to consider before June 5th. An iOS developer account is $99 USD per year. Last year, developers got the iOS 10 beta first. Apple released the iOS 10 beta to developers shortly after the WWDC 2016 keynote in mid-June. Public beta testers got access to the iOS 10 beta in July. Incremental beta releases typically roll out to developers first. The public beta is free. In our experience, we’ve found public iOS betas less buggy than the developer versions. You’ll also want to get familiar with the download process itself. It can be a little confusing for first-time beta users. We’ve put together a walkthrough that will take you step-by-step through the iOS beta download and installation process. Make sure you feel comfortable with it before the WWDC 2017. How to Signup for the iOS 11 Beta Right Now If you’re determined to try the iOS 11 update ahead of its release date it might be a good idea to get the signup process out-of-the-way. If you want to go the developer route, you can pay your $99 entry fee right now and sit back wait for WWDC to arrive. If you don’t want to pay for access, you can use a valid Apple ID and signup via the Beta Software Program. The developer signup is normally down for a while after the announcement at WWDC so signing up now will ensure that you’ll be among the first to try the early version of iOS 11. Prepare for iOS 11 Beta Problems Testing iOS software months ahead of release might sound like a dream but it can quickly turn into a nightmare. The main purpose of the iOS 11 beta will be to stress test unfinished software for bugs ahead of its public release date. If you can’t handle dealing with major problems (battery drain, apps not working, etc), you’ll want to avoid the iOS 11 beta. The first versions of the iOS 11 beta will probably be the buggiest so it’s a good idea to get familiar with fixes for common iOS beta issues. Our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems and our fixes for common iOS 10.3.2 beta problems are good places to start. There, we outline potential fixes for battery drain, app issues, installation problems, AirPod problems, and more. Bookmark the pages, commit some of these fixes to memory and you’ll be in better position when you do run into an issue with iOS 11 beta. Get Familiar with the Downgrade Process If you get tired of testing early software you’ll always be able to downgrade to the most up-to-date version of iOS 10. If you aren’t familiar with the downgrade process now would be a great time to get familiar with the steps you’ll need to take in order to get off the iOS 11 beta. Our downgrade guide will walk you through the most important things you need to know ahead of the iOS 11 beta release. If you don’t feel comfortable with these steps, you might want to avoid the iOS 11 beta. Find Another Device if You Only Have One If you only own one iOS device we recommend finding another “test device” before Apple releases iOS 11 beta. In its FAQ for the public Beta Software Program, Apple makes two recommendations that we strongly agree with. Install only on non-production devices that are not business critical. We strongly recommend installing on a secondary system or device, or on a secondary partition on your Mac. Installing early software like iOS 11 beta on your primary device has the potential to drive you mad and it could also interfere with your job or schoolwork. If you really want to test iOS 11 you’ll want to dig up, borrow, or buy an old iOS device. This way, if you run into a performance problem or an issue with one of your apps or services, your productivity won’t take a hit. Find Another Device If You Own an iPhone 5 or iPhone 5c All signs point to Apple dropping support for 32-bit devices with the release of iOS 11 beta. At this point, we aren’t expecting an iOS 11 beta release for popular 32-bit devices like the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. If you own one of these devices, and you really want to try iOS 11 and the beta, you’ll want to investigate an upgrade ahead WWDC. You probably don’t want to commit real cash until we know for sure (and we’ll know for sure on June 5th) but you’ll certainly want to get the wheels in motion now. Start Backing Up Your Data If you don’t regularly back up the data stored on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, now would be a good time to make it a habit. Installing a piece of beta software on your device can be unpredictable so you’ll want to make sure all of your important data s safe up before you make the move. If you don’t know where to start, allow us totake you through the backup process via iTunes. If you don’t want to make a backup through iTunes, you can also make a backup via Apple’s iCloud service. Backing up your device’s data is extremely important and you’ll want to do it on a regular basis throughout the year. Clean Up Your Device We expect iOS 11 beta should be a pretty sizable update. A couple hundred MBs at least, maybe even 1GB or so depending on the device. If you’re running out of space on your device’s hard drive, and you plan to test iOS 11, now would be a good time to do some spring cleaning. Head into your Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage and start deleting apps and other files you no longer need or use. Freeing up a few GB of space will ensure that your device is ready for the iOS 11 beta download and it could also have a positive impact on your device’s performance. Know the Limitations You should also get familiar with the limitations that often come with early software. Here are a few items to keep in mind as we push toward WWDC. If you have to downgrade from iOS 11 beta you won’t be able to downgrade to older versions of iOS. Apple isn’t signing off on old iOS 10 updates, iOS 9 or iOS 8. Once you download the beta, you’re stuck with iOS 10 and its recent versions. There probably won’t be an iOS 11 beta jailbreak available on day one. If you download the iOS 11 beta and there’s no jailbreak available, you’ll lose your jailbreak. If Apple releases a watchOS beta for Apple Watch and you want to test it, you’ll need to download the iOS 11 beta to a device. You can’t downgrade the Apple Watch, so if you do that you might not be able to downgrade your iPhone and use both. If Apple’s iOS 11 update comes with cross-platform functionality for macOS or tvOS, you’ll need to download one or both of those betas to get access to those features. iOS 11 Beta: 5 Things to Expect & 6 Things Not To Expect an iOS 11 Beta Announcement on June 5   1 / 11 If Apple decides to release an iOS 11 beta, and we're very confident it will, you can expect the company to confirm the release during its WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th.  WWDC 2017 kicks off in early June though it will do so from a new location. Apple's taking its annual developer conference to San Jose this year. On June 5th, we expect Tim Cook and other Apple executives to address developers in attendance and the thousands of Apple enthusiasts and consumers watching from home.  The company hasn't said what it will be announcing but that keynote will probably be the launch pad for the iOS 11 update and its beta.  If Apple sticks to its protocol, you can expect an iOS 11 beta release shortly after the conclusion of the WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th.    1 / 11 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed but Beddit confirmed the acquisition in a short post on its website, while also giving notice to customers that their data will now be collected in accordance with Apple's privacy policy. Apple sells the Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor for $150 in its store. The device is a sensor-equipped strip that slides under a bed sheet and uses a technique called ballistocardiography (BCG) to measure the mechanical activity of the heart, lungs, and other body functions. It can also track data like sleep time and efficiency, respiration, movement, snoring, room temperature, and room humidity. Since this is not a ‘wearable’ sleep tracker the main advantage is that you don’t need to remember to use it or charge it — Apple Watch users normally need to charge their devices at night. All the gathered data is presented in a companion app which reportedly provides "personalized insights" and "customizable sleep coaching" to help users improve their sleep habits. It’s not immediately clear if Apple has plans to continue selling the device, integrate some of its technology into future products or is mainly looking to hire the talent behind the company. TechCrunch’s sources say that current customers will be able to access its products and services support for the foreseeable future.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: Fitbit All of Fitbit’s best devices, including the Blaze and Charge 2, are still on sale on Amazon Maren Estrada May 10th, 2017 at 1:22 PM Share Tweet After all these years, Fitbit is still completely dominating the wearables market. In fact, Apple is probably the only company that can even really touch Fitbit right now thanks to the Apple Watch. But not everyone wants an Apple Watch, and of course the device is completely useless to anyone who has an Android phone instead of an iPhone. If you’re not into Apple, then Fitbit is clearly the way to go — and right now is the perfect time to buy yourself (or your mother, since it’s almost Mother’s Day) a new Fitbit.

So, if you’re looking for a decent-sounding, comfortable wireless headsets to use primarily with a single Apple device—an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac—I’ve tried many models that will serve your needs and cost you less than AirPods. AirPods Alternatives Here’s the deal: If you’re going to use your headphones with a single (Apple) device, you pair the headphones with the device and the device and headphones remember each other evermore (or until they forget each other). This is good—it means the headphones connect to the device automatically when you power up the headphones. Now, if you want to use those same headphones with another (Apple) device, you usually have to first unpair (disconnect) them from the first device, and then pair them with the second. And that’s the issue. Switching from one Apple device to the other requires a trip to either the Settings app (iOS) or the Bluetooth menu bar item (macOS) to disconnect from the one and connect to the other. It’s not totally odious but it does take a few extra seconds every time. AirPods don’t require a disconnect/connect sequence to use them with another Apple device. Instead, just select them as the sound source in either Control Center (on iOS), or the Bluetooth menu bar item (on macOS). The best part is, you don’t ever have to pair the AirPods with your other Apple devices—as soon as you pair them with one device, they’re paired automatically with all your other compatible Apple devices. Some Less Expensive (than AirPods) Wireless Headphone Options That’s cool. But, if you’re only going to use your earphones with a single device, you can probably find comfortable, decent-sounding wireless headphones for less than $159. If that describes you, here are a few wireless headsets I’ve tested that may better suit your needs and cost you less: Decibullz Custom Fit Bluetooth Wireless Earphones ($119) are ideal for anyone with comfort issues with other in-ear buds. They’re the only ones I know that include custom-molded earpieces you heat with warm water and shape to fit your ears precisely. They’re very comfortable and sound better and block out ambient sound better than some other similarly priced options. Decibullz Custom Fit Bluetooth Wireless Earphones are great for otherwise hard-to-fit ears. Elux ($99.95) are handsome, comfortable, nice-sounding over-the-ear headphones from a new company (at least to me) on the scene called Specter Wireless. I also liked their Efitz ($95.95), an in-ear model with ear hooks for those with a more athletic lifestyle. ELUX by Specter Wireless look good; sound good; and are quite comfortable. EFITZ by Specter Wireless stay put; sound good; and are comfortable as well. For those on even tighter budgets I recommend Kinivo’s BTH240 ($24.95) and the discontinued BlueAnt Pump 2 HD ($19.99), which I’ve mentioned before. The BlueAnt Pump HD (now discontinued) are a steal at $19.99. Kinivo BTH240 are comfortable, sound pretty good, and are a steal at $24.99, The Kinivo is a decent set of over-the-ear headphones with remote controls at a remarkably low price; the discontinued (but still available) BlueAnt Pump HD are still my go-to headphones for any strenuous activity. And that’s all he wrote… Resources: AirPods. Apple, Inc. $159. Apple Decibullz Custom Fit Bluetooth Wireless Earphones. Decibullz. $119.  (Amazon $119) Elux. Specter Wireless. $99.95. Efitz.

These are good headsets, but every one of them has a wire (or a headband) that runs between the two ears. Any good alternatives to the AirPods that are completely wireless?

The proposal could limit Apple’s control over its App Store. The European Commission said in its midterm review of its digital strategy that the EU needs to take action to “promote the online platforms as responsible players of a fair internet ecosystem.” Read: Spotify CEO, Others Say Companies Like Google, Apple 'Abuse' Size In European Smartphone Market The commission said it will prepare an initiative to tackle “unfair contractual clauses and trading practices identified in platform-to-business relationships” by the end of the year. The move comes after chief executives from European firms, including Spotify, Deezer and Rocket Internet, sent a letter to the EU, accusing mobile giants, like Google and Apple, of abusing their power within the smartphone market. Apple’s iOS and Google Android hold more than 90 percent of the global smartphone market, IDC numbers show. The companies did not mention Google and Apple by name in their letter, but they specifically highlighted mobile operating ecosystems, app stores and search engines. The letter claimed the companies exhibited anti-competitive behaviors. The letter also criticized companies with online platforms that allow them to become “gatekeepers.” “Our collective experience is that where online platforms have a strong incentive to turn into gatekeepers because of their dual role, instead of maximizing consumer welfare, they can and do abuse their privileged position and adopt B2B [business-to-business] practices with adverse consequences for innovation and competition,” the letter said. “These practices range from restricting access to data or interaction with consumers, biased ranking and search results to lack of clarity, imbalanced terms and conditions and preference of their own vertically integrated services.” The EU said Wednesday its investigation, which began a year ago, found some online platforms were conducting trading practices that are a “potential detriment [to] their professional users.” The commission found platforms were delisting products or services without due notice or without any possibility to contest the move. The EU said the platform’s actions contribute to lack of transparency. “There is widespread concern that some platforms may favor their own products or services, otherwise discriminate between different suppliers and sellers and restrict access to, and the use of, personal and nonpersonal data, including that which is directly generated by a company's activities on the platforms,” the commission said.

The device is a thin and flexible sensor designed to be placed under the sheet on the top of a mattress.  Beddit has retained a customer support contact on its website, suggesting that the customer experience will not change, CNBC reported on Tuesday.  The updated privacy policy on the Beddit website also states that it has been acquired by Apple.  "Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy," the updated policy reads.  The related data like heart rate and respiratory data collected by Beddit can be shared with Apple's health app.  "Sleep-tracking is an intriguing potential health application for the Apple Watch, as it explores new use-cases in the health and wellness market. An estimated 50 to 70 million US adults have sleep or wakefulness disorders," according to US-based public health institute Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Finland-based Beddit was founded in 2007 and has received about $3.5 million in funding.  Earlier this year, Apple acquired "Workflow", a popular iOS tool that allows users combine the functionalities of various apps together to automate normally complex processes.  Related news Best soundbars 2017: 10 soundbars that kick bass The best noise-cancelling headphones available today The best wireless headphones available today You could one day soon buy a Toyota with Nvidia autonomous driving smarts See more Applications news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Illustration: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Well, Apple has made an acquisition, though it isn’t one of the big names analysts have been writing thinkpieces on lately. Instead, the company appears to have heard consumers’ concerns about a key missing feature in the Apple Watch. It just bought Beddit, a sleep-tracking company that sells a $150 sensor customers can put under their mattresses. It links up with a companion app to provide sleep analytics. More from Barron’s Next Two Years with the Apple Watch: A Love/Hate Relationship Here’s One Less Reason to Pay for Apple Music Here Comes The iPhone ‘Supercycle’ As it stands, there’s no real way to track sleep via built-in features on Apple products. People who want to wear their Apple Watch to bed (or even sleep with their iPhone) have to use outside apps and services like Beddit if they want any sort of sleep data. The acquisition, which Beddit confirmed Monday, means built-in sleep-tracking features could be coming to your favorite iProducts soon, but it’s not clear how Apple will play things. Perhaps it’ll try to sell you a physical under-bed tracker to use alongside your Apple Watch, but it’s perhaps more realistic that the company will try to integrate Beddit’s technology into the watch and phone themselves. Products from Fitbit and Garmin have sleep tracking built into their watches. The key difference there is that those products have batteries that last days, rather than hours. Apple will need to do some serious rejiggering if it hopes customers will wear the watch to sleep. Battery life is an engineering issue that money alone might not be able to solve.

Thanks in part to Samsung’s Note 7 misfortune, Chinese company Oppo is ranked #3 globally with its R9s smartphone. Strategy Analytics shows that Apple’s iPhone 7 was the top-selling smartphone during the first quarter of 2017 despite a slight year-over-year drop in sales. While Apple doesn’t release iPhone sales by model, Strategy Analytics estimates that the iPhone 7 accounted for 6.1% of total smartphones shipped while the iPhone 7 Plus captured 4.9% of shipments. According to the research, Apple shipped 21.5 million iPhone 7 models during the first quarter of the year while the pricier iPhone 7 Plus made up 17.4 million units. In total, Strategy Analytics says 353.3 million smartphones were sold during Q1 2017 which is slightly up from 333.1 million in the same quarter a year ago. In total, Apple said it sold 50.7 million iPhones during the previous quarter which leaves just over 10 million units to older models. What may be surprising to western countries including the United States is which company came in third place: Oppo. The Chinese brand is ranked between Apple and Samsung with its R9s smartphone capturing 2.5% of shipments during the first quarter of the year. Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “OPPO R9s shipped 8.9 million units for third place and 3 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. OPPO is largely unknown in the Western world, but its brand is wildly popular in China and growing rapidly across India. The R9s is OPPO’s flagship 4G device with key features such as dual-SIM connectivity and fingerprint security.” Oppo may have been boosted by Samsung’s misfortune, too, as the Korean company ranked fourth and fifth place which its Galaxy J3 and J5 smartphones following the Galaxy Note 7 recall. Samsung’s current flagship, the Galaxy S8, launched in the current quarter.

His Opportunity Trust fund this year is up nearly 14 percent, about doubling the S&P 500. One of the big plays was a call option on Apple before the stock began its surge this year. Jeff Cox | @JeffCoxCNBCcom 13 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Bill Miller: Apple's cheap but this 'arctic apple' stock is the one to watch    Thursday, 2 Feb 2017 | 7:53 AM ET | 03:20 Bill Miller is back with a vengeance, thrashing the market again though he's taking some pretty big risks in doing so. The legendary portfolio manager's Miller Opportunity Trust mutual fund is up a gaudy 13.9 percent this year, easily beating the S&P 500's return of 7.8 percent including dividends, according to Morningstar. That puts the $1.4 billion security in the rating firm's top 1 percentile in its category. The big play: Options on Apple that gave the fund the chance to buy and turn a profit if the stock passed $100 a share and were purchased when the shares were just short of that target, or "strike" as it is known. Of course, the stock was trading around $153 a share Wednesday afternoon and is up 32 percent in 2017 alone, making the options play a strong move. Miller is best known for his record-setting feat of topping the market benchmark for 15 years straight between 1991 and 2005. By contrast, only about 1 in 5 managers surpassed index returns just in 2016. However, in the ensuing years his record was spotty, particularly through the financial crisis and again in 2010-11. He has since ended his long-term relationship with Legg Mason and gone out on his own with the Opportunity fund. The recent performance of the fund shows that anyone who thought Miller's best days were behind him were mistaken, though analysts worry that the fund has little protection should the market turn south. 'Bill is back and he's doing great' "Obviously we went through a period of challenging performance. That's typical for the investment management business," Samantha McLemore, the fund's portfolio manager, said in a phone interview. "Now we're back in a period of strong performance. Certainly, some people have said Bill is back and he's doing great, given the changes in our organization over the past decade." As the financial crisis began to unfold, Miller's $20 billion Legg Mason Value Trust fund stumbled due to overexposure to bank stocks and some illiquid investments, and investors began to pile out. The fund, now called ClearBridge Value and no longer run by Miller, is down to $2.4 billion and has returned just 4.3 percent this year, below the market gain. The secret sauce for Miller isn't much of a secret at all: He's still a value investor, looking for underpriced stocks and piling up on them. Even if that stock is as widely held and commonly known as Apple. David A. Grogan | CNBC Bill Miller at Delivering Alpha 2015 in New York. "The philosophy hasn't changed. We've always been long-term value investors," McLemore said. "We've actually owned Apple for many years, cut it back and added to it at different times. ... We've been big believers in the power of that brand." As for the Miller brand itself, some luster certainly came off in the years of underperformance and during an increasingly rocky relationship with Legg Mason. The divorce between the two became final in late February of this year, though he stopped managing the Value fund in 2011. Since then, he has quietly built a portfolio that is highly concentrated in U.S. stocks — a 94.3 percent weighting, to be specific, according to Morningstar. That, too, is not new. Miller always has preferred domestic companies, and he holds that view even at a time when the big sexy play of 2017 has been to rebalance toward European and global stocks. International funds have pulled in $45.8 billion of investor cash this year and European funds have seen $7.7 billion of inflows, compared with $18.8 billion for the much larger U.S. market. Other significant holdings include Amazon, RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) and a slew of banks, builders and airlines. Miller isn't looking to chase returns overseas. "We've always been U.S.-centric. That's where we think we have the best competitive advantage, that's the market we know the most," McLemore said. "We're not trying to migrate the portfolio around geographically." A strategy that comes with 'significant risks'  That approach may have made his investors money but it hasn't exactly endeared him to analysts. The fund's full-throated commitment to U.S. stocks with little to hedge in the case of a market downturn inspires worries that more underperformance along the lines of what happened around the financial crisis years is always a danger. "Our research tries to spot investment strategies that can outperform on a risk-adjusted basis over a full market cycle, and not just through periods when the market is up a lot," said Morningstar analyst Andrew Daniels. "Due to the significant risks that are taken here ... we don't have confidence in the ability to outperform" over a longer term. Indeed, over the past three years the fund has annual returns of just 7.9 percent, lagging the S&P 500 and around the middle of the pack compared with its peers. However, the five-year performance is stellar at 19.5 percent compared with the 14.5 percent for the large-cap benchmark. Still, Morningstar gives the fund just two stars, which equates to "neutral." (A note: Daniels said Miller's fund looks more like a mid-cap. So compared with the three-year performance of the Russell 2000 at 7.9 percent, the fund is about equal to the market, and the five-year run easily dwarfs the index's 12 percent.) "With the market up pretty much the last several years, it's not surprising that Bill Miller has done well," Daniels said. A little hindsight also may be helping Miller. McLemore said the firm brought in outside help to analyze the years of underperformance and found a few trends that pulled down returns: the focus on investments that could not easily be sold, and the tendency to hang onto losing positions too long. Though the fund likes to hold for three to five years, adherence to any strategy can hurt a fund. However, Miller continues to be a believer in embattled pharmaceutical company Valeant, which has tumbled 54 percent over the past year and comprises 3 percent of weighting in the fund. McLemore, however, believes the fund is positioned well for the future. "It's sort of a back-to-basics approach. We're all having a good time doing it," she said. "One thing I admire so much about Bill is an adherence to stay true to your knitting even after significant periods of underperformance. I think he did that."

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Tech investors reportedly aren’t looking forward to the one bright spot that you’d think all investors await: economic growth. Investor have been flocking to the tech companies that sport big profit growth as the economy lumbers along. “From here, the biggest risk for tech investors might be the long-promised upswing for the economy. A pickup in economic activity likely would lift cyclical corners of the stock market and prompt profit-taking in tech, something investors got a brief taste of last year,” The Wall Street Journal reported. “Right now that looks like a distant threat. Apple Tuesday notched its 19th record close this year and a market capitalization north of $800 billion — a first for any U.S. company. Apple’s advance this year comes as the U.S. economy grew in the first quarter at its meekest pace in three years,” WSJ.com reported. Other fast-growing tech stocks are soaring: Facebook has climbed 31% this year and Google parent Alphabet has added 21%. Online retailer Amazon.com is up 27% and Microsoft has climbed more than 10%, the Journal explained. To be sure, entrepreneur, stock trader, television personality and author Adam Mesh told Newsmax TV that not every section of the stock market is a safe bet just because investors have enjoyed a bull run since Donald Trump’s presidential victory. “Tech has remained strong, it had a good first quarter that it's finishing up right now and with innovation and growth, tech seems a nice place to be not only for stability but also for upside,” said Mesh, who starred in the 2003 NBC show “Average Joe.” Mesh starred in the spin-off "The Average Joe: Adam Returns." “The sector I'd stay away from is the retail sector,” he told “The Income Generation Show.” “It's hard to explain how it got here. All of last year seemed surreal in how we went up and then the expectation was going into the election if Trump became president that we'd go down, but then we just continued higher and now it seems that everybody is bullish,” he said.  (Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Facts To Know About Apple's Acquisition Of Beddit Posted: May 10 2017, 9:24am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Apple   Apple Inc. acquires Sleep-Monitoring Application possessing the Funky Name “Beddit”   Apple Inc. has acquired the Finnish sleep-monitoring application possessing the funky and offbeat name of “Beddit”. Apple Inc. has gotten hold of an app and sleep-monitoring device known as Beddit. The website of this sleep tracker on the Internet recently gave out the details regarding the deal whereby it has been acquired by Apple.  Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in Stock Online According to CNBC, information regarding Beddit’s Apple Watch applications has been removed from the website though. However, a customer support section still exists on the site. All personal data will be collated, processed and revealed in accordance with stringent measures dealt with by the Apple Privacy Policy.  The heartbeat tempo and rate of respiration will be fed into an Apple health application. Sleep-monitoring has a very crucial role in the health industry. From 50 to 70 million Americans have sleep issues.  According to The Verge, Beddit is a Finnish company. Its products work in synch with apps for iOS and Apple Watch. A Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor costs about $149. Sold in the Apple Store, the sensor-loaded strip goes beneath the bed sheets and follows the movements a sleeping body makes throughout the night. The Beddit acquisition could prove salubrious for the coffers of Apple Inc.  According to MacRumors, the thin, flexible sensor collects a ton of data. This may include: the time it takes to doze off, efficiency in sleeping, activity during sleep, snoring rate, the temperature of the bedroom and its humidity. This app allows for a personal sleep schedule that is custom-made for the individual. The insights it offers regarding sleep hygiene are valuable indeed since covering the sleep debt is the #1 priority in America right now. Sleep deprivation has been held to be responsible for everything from obesity to diabetes and fatal accidents due to drowsiness while driving down the road.  This story may contain affiliate links.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     AirPods In Stock At Best Buy's Online Store With A Catch Posted: May 10 2017, 9:28am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Credit: Best Buy   The Apple AirPods are in short supply. Best Buy offers the $159.99 AirPods with a catch in the fine print. Apple is not able to catch up with the demand for the AirPods. The little white wireless earbuds are hard to come by right from the start. Unveiled in September of 2016, Apple had to postpone the release from October to December. The first AirPods went on sale on December 13, 2016. Don't Miss: This is How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Customers who order the AirPods now at the Apple online shop face a 6 week shipping timeframe. Best Buy just posted a Tweet about the AirPods point to the AirPods product page on bestbuy.com. Best Buy offers the AirPods for purchase, but a closer look reveals that the shipping timeframe is 4 weeks. "Order today to secure yours. ships by 6/10/2017." That's a bit misleading, but still two weeks better than ordering at Apple. AirPods look strange, but are a big technological achievement with automatic connection, noise cancelling and a 24-hour battery life. One big drawback though is that the AirPods are not sweat-proof. They are not usable for workout or running. The alternative from Apple are the PowerBeats3 wireless earbuds that are water resistant, currently on sale for $129.99. To find AirPods in stock online, shoppers can use our The Tracker app, but pay close attention to the shipping timeframes. The market prices for the AirPods on amazon.com are above $215.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish iPhone 7 Was Best Selling Smartphone In Q1 2017 By Adnan Farooqui on 05/10/2017 10:31 PDT There’s no denying the fact that iPhones sell really well. They’ve been a cash cow for Apple for almost a decade now and a new report released today suggests that Apple’s smartphones continue to bring in record-breaking numbers. The report says that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the number one and two best-selling smartphones in the first quarter of this year. Strategy Analytics mentions in its report that global smartphone shipments touched 353.3 million units in the first quarter of this year. Of the total number of units shipped, 21.5 million were accounted for by the iPhone 7 and 17.4 million by the iPhone 7 Plus. Going by these figures, the iPhone 7 accounted for 6.1 percent of all smartphone sales in the world this past quarter and the iPhone 7 Plus accounted for 4.9 percent. Its handsets thus held the first and second positions with Oppo’s R9s coming in at third while Samsung’s mid-range Galaxy J3 and Galaxy J5 (2016) handsets took fourth and fifth place, respectively. It won’t be surprising at all if these figures are true. Apple sells tens of millions of iPhones every quarter. In its official earnings release for the first quarter, Apple revealed that it sold 50.8 million iPhones in the first quarter of this year. However, keeping with its tradition, the company didn’t break down sales by model. The iPhone’s performance in the market may only improve in the coming quarters as Apple’s 10th Anniversary iPhone is due later this year. The iPhone 8 is reportedly going to be a revolutionary smartphone so it’s definitely going to be something that many Apple fans will be anxiously waiting for. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | May 10, 2017 0 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               Apple Music launched not too long ago now, entering a pretty crowded streaming music market already. Pandora has been around for what feels like forever already, touting its Music Genome Project as a means to really drill down your favorite tastes and build radio stations around that taste to offer you only what you want to listen to. We've seen the giant Spotify rise to the top of the crop, and we've seen competitors like Rdio get swallowed whole by other entities. (I'll miss Rdio.) And we've also watched as services like SoundCloud, and Pandora, have launched their own premium options, blocking content and features behind paywalls. And let's not forget Tidal. There are others out there to choose from, and we'll likely see even more pop up in the future. Ever since Apple Music debuted, though, there's been a lot more focus put on exclusive content. In most cases it's just an exclusive launch of some artist's or band's upcoming single, or whole album. It usually means other services, like Spotify, can't access it for a week or longer. But, eventually, it'll become available. Of course, people could always buy the album to gain access and listen to it how ever they want. But if you prefer to just use a streaming service, where that $9.99 per month is applied, then you'll just have to wait. Unless you subscribe to Apple Music, then it's nothing you have to worry about. Some labels have raised concerns with exclusive launches or windows of any kind, but it doesn't look like it's a practice that's going away anytime soon. Especially not for Apple Music. The company seems to announce a new exclusive of some kind, whether it's an album, or music video, or a whole documentary, on a regular basis. And Apple's executives that are on overwatch with Apple Music see it as a bonus. A benefit and gift to those who subscribe to the service. The aforementioned Tidal has had its fair share of exclusives, too, thanks in part to being owned by so many artists like Kanye West. So while Apple Music has a lot of exclusives under its belt already, it's certainly not the only platform partaking in the strategy. My question to all of you is: Does it work? Do exclusives convince you to switch platforms? And honestly, this doesn't even have to just be about streaming music services, either. Have you switched from Xbox or PlayStation because of an exclusive game launch? Switched carriers because the one you were on didn't have the phone you wanted, but another did? Does a new album's exclusive availability make you switch to Apple Music or Tidal, instead of sticking with whatever you're already using? Let me know!

(AFP) Shares gain 33% this year, almost 50% since US election in November Apple became the first US company to top the $800 billion mark in market capitalisation on Tuesday, slightly more than two years after it crossed the $700 billion threshold. The iPhone maker's shares have gained 33 per cent this year and almost 50 per cent since the US election in November. The company represents about four per cent of the $21.7 trillion that makes up the entire S&P 500 index. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 per cent of the S&P 500 in September 2012 but is a smaller percentage now as the index as a whole has rallied more than seven per cent this year. "It's just reflective of how powerful a franchise it is. It may be the most powerful franchise in the country today," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, whose firm does not own the stock. "Considering that it has a limited number of products, it has really dominated that market in a way that few companies have, and it's been able to retain margins despite lots of competitors." If Apple continues on its growth path, the company will top the $1 trillion market cap level later this year. Stock buybacks have also bolstered Apple shares, with the company reducing its actual share count by 20.9 per cent and the average diluted shares outstanding by 20.5 per cent over the past four years, according to Standard & Poor's data. The median price target on Apple is $160, up from the $140 median three months ago. Shares closed at $153.99 on Tuesday. The closing market cap of $802.8 billion was larger than the economies of 45 of the 50 US states, topped only by Illinois, Florida, New York, Texas and California.  Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a stake of roughly $20 billion in Apple, said on Monday he had grown more fond of the company because he could "very easily determine" the iPhone maker's competitive position "and who is trying to chase them."

Instead, the two vendors are locked in an open battle, and Imagination is threatening legal action against Apple, which is developing a homegrown GPU. The last few months haven't been smooth for Imagination Technologies, which this month said it was planning to sell its MIPS and Ensigma processor businesses. Apple likely won't be a customer for the new Series8XT GPU, which is based on the Furian architecture. But the company's PowerVR GPUs are used in many low-cost and mid-range phones. The GT8525 is targeted at high-end smartphones, automotive computers, set-top boxes, and smart devices. It is the first new GPU design in the Series8XT line, succeeding the Series7XT, which powers graphics in Apple's iPhone 7.  [ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ] Imagination is now building a business around PowerVR graphics processor designs, and that makes the GT8525 critical to the company's future. It represents the company's top-performing GPU design at a time when high-end GPUs are becoming more important in computing devices. GPUs are handling applications like computer vision, gaming, and artificial intelligence. As GT8525 GPU design is built for high-end mobile gaming and virtual reality. It supports 4K video, so the mobile headset experience is improved. It also includes tweaks to bring machine learning on board mobile devices. For cars, it is aimed primarily at infotainment systems but will also help assist autonomous driving when a driver remains at the wheel. Companies like Nvidia are boasting their GPUs can help build completely autonomous cars, but Imagination is keeping its expectations modest. PowerVR cores, based on the Furian architecture, deliver up to a 35 percent improvement in performance from older GPUs. Gaming performance improvements could measure from 70 to 90 percent, though the performance may vary based on core designs. The GPU has a shader processing unit and system level blocks surrounding it. The GPU design has a new instruction set architecture, a faster pipeline, and processing optimizations that make it faster. The GPU supports Vulcan, OpenCL, and other key APIs for gaming and application development. Device makers can license the GT8525 now, meaning it may appear in smartphones soon. However, Apple's decision to step away from PowerVR is a loss for Imagination, and it raises questions about how many companies will adopt GT8525. Apple was the anchor of Imagination's PowerVR. Other GPUs, like ARM's Mali and Qualcomm's Adreno, are emerging as challengers in mobile devices. Imagination no longer has "the lead in mobile graphics that they had a few years ago," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Imagination has gained some business with mobile chipmaker MediaTek. In the end, if PowerVR GPUs are cheaper than rivals, Imagination has a chance to succeed.

With Xcode and Apple Swift, app development on iPhone and iPad has been simplified. Here's our recommendation of the right Mac to get. by Lucy Hattersley | 10 May 17 If you're an app developer, or are considering trying your hand at creating your own app in the future, you've come to the right place. Here, we look at which Mac is best for developers. Apple's Swift programming language means that creating and building an app for MacOS or iOS is more accessible than ever, and it's easy to get them onto the App Store in order to sell them too. If you're keen on learning app development, this article will also give you some pointers about what you'll need to get started with app development once you've got the right Mac. How much power does your Mac need? Choosing the right Mac for development can be a challenge. Apple creates a whole range of Mac laptops and desktop computers. All Apple Macs are great computers but some are better suited to app development than others. Software development scales up depending on the size and complexity of the program you are making. Macs vary in power from the entry-level MacBook right up to the Mac Pro. If all you want to do is start to learn development and get a regular app onto the app store then any of Apple's current Mac line-up, including its laptops, should be powerful enough to do the job. Unlike creating video or music; creating code doesn't use up huge amounts of hard drive space, and if you're creating iOS apps you don't need a lightning-fast processor or a high-end graphics card. Obviously, this doesn't narrow the choice down much (or at all, for that matter). It now becomes a question of how much money you want to spend, and which will provide the best coding environment. What screen size is best for app development? What is useful for software development is screen estate. Coding is a complex task that sometimes requires intense focus, but more often it requires research and tracking. Coders often need to have several programs and windows open at once: the Xcode developer environment, web browser, and perhaps a separate text editor, SQL Database editor, and much more. Development seems to be one of a task that requires everything MacOS has to offer. So you need a Mac with a big screen, or you need to attach a big screen to your Mac. With this in mind we're actually going to rule out all of Apple's MacBook range. Let’s be clear: if you value a notebook and portability is important to you, then a MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro will do just fine for app development, and you can attach a monitor to these models for larger screen estate. (Find out more in our complete guide to buying a MacBook). But with a MacBook you pay a lot extra for a small screen that will feel cramped when programming, so if portability is important we'd look to Apple's Mac range instead. What's the best value Mac for app development? The Mac Pro is overkill for most developers so the choice is between an iMac or Mac mini with a display. At £479 the Mac mini is the best value Mac, and it offers more than enough power and storage for app development. What it doesn't come with is a display, so you'll need to source one separately. (View the Mac mini in the Apple Store here). Normally the idea with the Mac mini is that you attach an old display, keyboard and mouse and it represents top-flight Apple computing at a fraction of the cost. However, for app development we suggest that you get a large display. There is now a huge range of sub-£200 monitors that offer 27-inch displays. Some developers prefer picking up two 24-inch displays and placing them side-by-side. If you are looking for a more powerful Mac with a big display then Apple has you covered in the form of the iMac. (View the iMac in the Apple Store here) You should get a model with a 27inch display, which starts at £1,749. It's not as cheap as the Mac mini but you do get a lot of extra for your money. The 27-inch iMac is a veritable powerhouse: a 3.2Ghz Intel i5 processor, 1TB hard drive, discrete AMD graphics card with 2GB video memory, and of course that massive 27-inch display. If you’re looking for a large-screen Mac that also has enough power for gaming then this is the one to go for. We'd advise most new developers to go for the Mac mini with the AOC display. The Mac mini is a cheaper option than the iMac and the extra cash can be put towards software or training courses. The 27-inch iMac is a better Apple Mac and you get a lot of extra features: such as the fast processor, large 1TB hard drive and AMD graphics card. They're nice features, for sure, but they offer little towards developing apps. Mind you, if you’re also planning to use a Mac for gaming and general all purpose computing you might appreciate the extra power. How do you create a program on a Mac? Apple goes to great lengths to make it easy to develop apps (or small programs) for both MacOS and iOS. The development environment used to create apps for both is called Xcode, and this is a free download from the Mac App Store. With Xcode you can build apps using two programming languages, the old Objective-C language, and the newer Swift programming language. Uploading and selling Apps via iTunes requires a yearly subscription to the Apple Developer connection, but it's good value at $99 per year (approx £77). You only need this to upload and distribute apps via the Mac and iOS App Stores however, you don't need to pay this fee just to test and create apps. If you're interested in getting started in iOS app development, the following articles will help: How to get started in iOS app development How to get started with Apple Swift Best way to learn Swift: books, courses, guides Take a look at Udemy's online Swift courses, too. Apple Mac accessories and software for developers Developers don't need as many accessories as other Mac users. A good Mac, a decent sized display and a good reference library and you're good to go. The only exception we'd make is to invest in a good backup system in case there are any problems. Apple's own Time Capsule is a great solution. Alternatively, invest in a good USB external hard drive and use Apple's Time Machine software to perform regular backups. There is also wealth of software that's good for developers. Here are some recommendations: Acorn: A powerful image editor that's a fraction of the cost of Photoshop BBEdit: Industry favourite text editor CodeRunner: Great alternative to Xcode for light programming tasks. Dev Color Picker: Makes getting colours out of programs and into your apps a breeze. Dropbox: Great for syncing files for remote access. Evernote: Perfect place to store programming notes.

But in addition to better battery life and standalone LTE capabilities, future “iWatch” generations should offer far more advanced health-monitoring features. This year’s Series 3, of course, may not be ready to integrate game-changing technology for the accurate supervision of blood sugar levels, nonetheless taking a baby step in the right direction with built-in sleep quality tracking. That’s still speculation, although it’s based on fairly pertinent information. Namely, it seems Apple has just acquired Beddit, a small yet respected Finnish company behind relatively popular sleep analysis hardware and software. The $149.95 Beddit 3 sleep monitor is already sold through the new parent company’s official website, pairing with an easy to use proprietary iPhone and iPad data, as well as Apple’s own Health service. You don’t have to wear or charge this thing, but simply place it under your sheet on top of the mattress, where it will automatically sense and oversee your rest times, “efficiency”, heart rate, respiration, temperature, movement, snoring, room temperature and humidity without ever standing out. It’s possible Apple will continue to upgrade and refine the device, though it definitely makes far more sense to capitalize on Beddit’s software expertise and transfer some of its magic to the next-gen Apple Watch by way of a new built-in sensor. As for the acquisition’s terms and details, we have nothing to report, official or even rumored. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Let me tell you why. In case you missed it, 2017 happens to be the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. The first model was introduced in January, 2007 at the old MacWorld conference, and then first sold in June of 2017. Remember how people were camped out for days in order to be first on the block to buy a device that then cost over $500? Fast forward ten years and the iPhone 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and other models, and we’re looking at a company that loves to promote big-time. Expectations are that Apple has a major re-design in the works and tons of cool new features for the new iPhone X, as some are calling it, or the iPhone 8. Some of those features are said to include: --A bigger 5.8 inch screen (the current 7 Plus is 5.5 inches), no bezels (the frame around the phone), a cooler than ever camera and wireless charging. (Apple is also said to have upgrades for the 7 and 7 Plus, for three phones in total.) Some analysts and publications have speculated that Apple is having a hard time pulling in all the parts it needs for these new devices, and won’t be able to make the introduction date in September. That’s when Apple has historically introduced the new models, shortly after Labor Day, with release date at the end of the month. This gives Apple a week or so to goose the third quarter sales, and have a blow-out fourth quarter--these are important benchmarks for public companies. Apple has had years to plan for the 10th anniversary edition, so no, I don’t think there’s anything that’s going to throw Apple off schedule. I think the company would rather scratch a new feature than miss the release date. I could be wrong, and if so, I’ll be happy to report on that later in the year. In the meantime, Apple recently announced its latest quarterly results, and said it sold some 50 million iPhones in the most recent quarter. That’s flat with the year-ago results, and some Wall Street analysts bemoaned the lack of growth. 50 million iPhones! That’s worth $33 billion. What company wouldn’t kill to have a sliver of that? What are your thoughts? A new, redesigned iPhone on time, or delayed? Let's talk about it on Twitter, where I'm @jeffersongraham.

Apple has given some of its employees prototypes of its upcoming, Siri-powered smart home hub to test at home, the news service is reporting, citing people who claim to have knowledge of the tests. Apple's employees have been trying out the device at their homes for "several months," Bloomberg's sources say. Rumors have been swirling that Apple (aapl) is working on a new smart home hub that could be powered by its virtual personal assistant Siri. While information on possible features has been slow to leak, last week, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that it could come with seven built-in speakers and one subwoofer. It would also be as powerful as the iPhone 6s and could come with a hefty, but unidentified, price. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter One of the big questions surrounding the device is whether it would come with a touchscreen. Earlier this week, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said in an interview that smart home hubs that can control smart home devices, play music, and perform other functions, need a touchscreen. His comments criticized the Amazon Echo and Google Home, two smart home hubs that he didn't mention by name but don't come with touchscreens. On Tuesday, however, Amazon announced the Echo Show, a smart home hub it plans to release in June, which comes with a touchscreen. It costs $230. Despite Schiller's comments and Amazon's (amzn) new device, Bloomberg's sources didn't confirm the prototype the Apple employees are testing will come with a touchscreen. Although employees have reportedly been testing the Siri-powered device for months, there's no telling exactly when Apple might release it. However, Kuo told investors last week that there's a greater than 50% chance it'll be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 5.

Ion-X is the type of glass used in the non-sapphire Apple Watch Sport screen, and while the SE hasn’t been specifically mentioned as a candidate for a glass-backed update, there has been no shortage of rumors about Apple going that way for its new iPhones. The case features what appears to be a camera opening that doesn’t protrude from the back and another hole underneath, possibly for the flash. Apple has been mum on its plans for the SE line of iPhones since releasing its first—and so far only—model last March. Instead of updating the SE this March, Apple simply doubled the storage of the device at the same price, which led most to believe that was the only update it would get this year. The photo provides no context for scale, making it impossible to confirm the actual dimensions of the pictured phone, so it’s also possible the image shows an iPhone 7s or iPhone 8, if it’s even real.

By Alistair Charlton May 10, 2017 16:46 BST Apple is set to reveal new software and hardware at its WWDC 2017 eventReuters Apple has begun sending out invitations to the opening keynote of its Worldwide Developer Conference. Better known as WWDC, the annual five-day event attracts thousands of software developers from the world over to learn about the latest updates to Apple's iPhone, iPad, Mac and Watch software. The biggest draw for consumers, however, is the opening keynote. Hosted by company chief executive Tim Cook, this year's presentation takes place at 10am local time (6pm BST) on 5 June at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. Unlike invitations to previous Apple events, the one for this year's WWDC does not seem to give any clues about what new products the company intends to announce. Instead of a tease of new hardware, the invitation shows a top-down view of people working, socialising, collaborating or walking from one place to another. A message on the invitation reads: "Technology alone is not enough. Technology must intersect with the liberal arts and the humanities, to create new ideas and experiences that push society forward. This summer we bring together thousands of brilliant minds representing many diverse perspectives, passions and talents to help us change the world." Apple sent out this invitation to attendees of WWDC 2017Apple New software As has been the case for several years, Apple will use the opening 90-minute keynote to show off new versions of its various operating systems. We will likely see iOS 11, watchOS 4. macOS 10.13 and tvOS 11 for the iPhone, iPad, Watch, Mac and Apple TV respectively. Apple will talk us and the developers in attendance through a range of new features for each software suite, and in all likelihood each will receive small visual enhancements, too. Some features will remain secret until the software becomes available to consumers later in the year, after several months of testing by developers and members of the public who sign up to Apple's beta programme. iOS 11 is claimed to include a new social network created by Apple. It will allegedly have similar features to Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram, with a focus on giving Apple users a way to share video taken on their iPhones and iPads. We are unlikely to learn too much more about the various software updates until Apple shows us on the day, as history shows new hardware leaks far more often (and comprehensively) than software. Apple is expected to give Siri an intelligence boost before taking on Amaxon's AlexaApple New hardware This is where things get more interesting, as a number of new gadgets are expected to be revealed by Apple during the WWDC keynote (or quietly added to the online store later that same day). Chief among which is the so-called 'Siri Speaker', Apple's rumoured rival to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The Siri Speaker is expected to bring Siri into the living room, offering a way to interact with the virtual assistant with voice commands. The speaker is tipped to boast higher sound quality than the Echo and Home, and will act as a way to play iTunes and Beats Radio music via voice commands. It is also claimed to use Siri to control smart home gadgets like internet-connected light bulbs, locks, curtains and thermostats through Apple's HomeKit system. Analysts are expecting big things from Apple's entry into the growing smart speaker market. Imran Choudhary, director of technology at GfK, told IBTimes UK: "With such a large consumer base already familiar with Siri, it's perhaps fair to say it's now a question of when and not if Apple decide to enter this market, or run the risk of falling behind in what looks set to be a growing category. When Apple aren't first to market they usually try to make sure they come in ahead of the existing players, which may prove trickier given how fast this space is evolving." Choudhary went on: "From a consumer's perspective, Apple launching a 'Siri Speaker' can only be a good thing. With many consumers already part of their ecosystem, it will be a natural extension and further add to Apple's appeal. More competition will also help drive innovations and bring this technology to the mass market." The often-accurate KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said he believes there is "an over 50% chance" that Apple will release "its first artificial intelligence product" at WWDC, and all indications point to this being a smart speaker with Siri onboard. What isn't yet clear is whether it will include a display, like the new Amazon Echo Show. Any more hardware to expect at WWDC 2017? The iPad Pro range is due for an upgrade, as the larger 12.2in model remains unchanged (aside from a price cut) since late 2015 and the 9.7in version is now just over a year old. Apple is likely to add the iPhone 7's A10 processor to the iPad Pro lineup, boosting performance, and there are also rumours of a third Pro arriving with a 10.5in display, a first for any iPad lineup. The 12in MacBook has also gone over a year without an update, and with the last two versions launching in the spring of 2015 and 2016 respectively, we wouldn't bet against a third -generation MacBook arriving at WWDC, or very soon after. Our advice would be to hold fire if you are thinking of buying one. The same goes for the iMac and Mac Mini, which are both well overdue an update, but Apple doesn't traditionally launch new desktop Macs at WWDC; they will likely come later in the year. The iPhone SE is the same age as the 9.7in iPad Pro, but a recent increase in storage suggests a 'proper' update won't happen just yet.

As for how long the delay will be? That depends on who you want to believe because so far there has been no official information released. However, now there’s a new report based on a note from trusted Apple Insider, and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. And if true, it could mean a worse case scenario for Apple fans. Image Source: iDrop News iPhone 8 Release Delay In a note sent out to investors, Kuo stands firmly by his belief that the iPhone 8 will be delayed. Why? As previously reported is apparently due to manufacturing problems, which will prevent the ramping up of production. Regarding the note sent by Kuo, he titled it “Rising probability of worst-case scenario for iPhone shipment.” And within it, he goes on to say that the iPhone 8 may be delayed as far back as October, even November. Which, would be a serious blow to Apple’s usual August to September production hopes. Short Supply Fortunately, for those hoping to get their hands on the iPhone 8 as early as possible, it does not mean it won’t be announced in September. It means that the handset will be available in significantly fewer numbers that Apple had wished. Which, means, they will be in short supply the world over, something that has happened before. As for the number of units being talked about here, Kuo thinks that Apple will only be able to ship around 80-million in 2017. Which if it is accurate would mean a shortfall of up to 30-million. That’s a lot of iPhone 8’s not in the hands of customers or sitting on the shelves of retailers. Technical Issues Moving on to what are the route causes for the possible delay, there could be many. Rumors have circled which talk about 3D sensor problems, and even the implementation of Touch ID under the OLED screen seeing issues. Regarding these matters Kuo mentions in his note: “While we are positive on potential replacement demand triggered by OLED iPhone, it’s too early to determine if market demand will shift fully in that direction. We recommend investors keep tabs on the following issues. (1) whether the 3D sensor of OLED iPhone provides an innovative user experience. (2) Whether OLED iPhone cancels Touch ID (fingerprint recognition). (3) If Apple’s competitors launch more innovative products which could compete with OLED iPhone in 4Q17-2Q18.” Touch ID Concerning which rumors/reports may be accurate and others not, that can not be determined right now. However, the increasing amount of trustworthy sources reporting the same or similar problems is concerning. Worryingly reports relating to Touch ID suggest embedding it into the glass screen of the iPhone 8 does not go well. And this is one of the reasons Kuo is now increasing his advice to investors about possible iPhone 8 delays. As for the apparent alternative scenario, which sees’s Apple take Samsung’s approach and place it on the rear. As a solution, this is certainly a likely one, as it could help to ease production delays. However, with fans expecting a truly awesome next iPhone, Apple may choose to hold off. Additionally, it could even be possible for Touch ID to be dropped altogether, in favor of some other sensing technology. Maybe something like Iris scanning as seen on the Galaxy S8. There’s also talk of a problem with the iPhone 8’s display, specifically, the lamination process and the 3D sensing front camera. None, of which Kuo goes into any detail about. Final Thoughts If you’re a regular follower of smartphone releases, then you will know that shortages and delays are commonplace. And as such, Apple is no stranger to production issues and technical difficulties. The difference with the iPhone 8, however, is the sheer amount of reports we see from trusted sources. The problem for Apple should this all be true, is, there could be severe consequences. Why? Only last week Tim Cook, complained about iPhone 8 rumors being responsible for putting the brakes on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales. So, if that means, there are a significant amount of people waiting for the iPhone 8, instead of upgrading now. What will a not so unique 10th-anniversary handset release due to tech problems, coupled with delays mean? We certainly wouldn’t want to be in Apple’s shoes, that’s for sure.

X Apple within touching distance of the $800bn mark Firm now worth more than Walmart, General Electric, Pfizer and Kraft Heinz combined about 15 hours ago Forrest Gump invested in “some kind of fruit company”. It was Apple, and he did not “have to worry about money no more”         In Forrest Gump, the film’s protagonist wades into the stock market and into “some kind of fruit company”. “We don’t have to worry about money no more,” Gump says of his investment. “And I said, ‘That’s good! One less thing’.” The company? Apple. On Tuesday the valuation of the iPad and MacBook maker topped $800 billion (€735.8bn) for the first time, more than the value of Walmart, General Electric, Pfizer and Kraft Heinz combined, and the first time a US publicly-traded company has hit that mark. The company’s stock, up nearly a third so far this year, has enjoyed a meteoric rise since the iPhone began disrupting the mobile phone industry in 2007. It has returned more than 870 per cent to shareholders since then. While much of the gain has been propelled by the popularity of the iPhone, the more recent introduction of debt-funded share buybacks and dividends has attracted a steady stream of value investors. Warren Buffett is a new investor. Apple has not been the only technology company setting records this year. The sector now accounts for five of the most valuable companies within the S&P 500. The list includes three of the four Fang stocks – Facebook, Amazon and Google owner Alphabet (the fourth is Netflix). Together with Microsoft they are worth nearly $3 trillion. “You are seeing the very real effects of disruption in tech,” Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, said of their rising share prices. Top banana Michael Underhill, the chief investment officer of Capital Innovations, adds: “Tech has been leading the way, and Apple has been the top banana in a crowded tech world with over $200 billion in cash, defensible market share and proprietary technology with leading platforms for innovations.” Despite recording earnings growth of more than 10 per cent in the first quarter, Apple trades with a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio below that of the wider S&P 500, according to FactSet. Facebook and Alphabet both command a p/e ratio above 27. Apple, by contrast, trades at less than 16 times its earnings over the next year. As Apple’s valuation marches higher, the sheer size of the company is raising questions for some over its ability to keep growing sales. Other large consumer groups have suffered major missteps, portfolio managers caution. However, analysts expect that the next iPhone will recapture consumer attention and help fan growth at the company. Broker Drexel Hamilton is among the most bullish, and this week put a price target on the group that is equivalent to a $1 trillion valuation. “Because their iPhone sales were a little bit on the poor side, there are expectations that their next product will be more breakthrough,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It may start putting a little pressure on them to deliver a ‘cool’ product going forward.” Advance The company’s advance this year has been vital to the broader S&P 500, of which Apple represents just under 4 per cent of the index. Without Apple and nine other stocks, which together account for roughly 15 per cent of the S&P’s market cap, the benchmark index would be little changed since the start of March. Over the past two months the vast majority of the benchmark US stock index – some 490 stocks – have had little impact on the index, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors. Despite its record valuation, Apple’s sway on the S&P 500 still falls short of the influence some companies have had in the past. IBM, which for several years held a 5 per cent or 6 per cent weighting in the index, ExxonMobil and General Electric have commanded greater influence. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Nicholas Colas Alphabet Amazon Apple Exxon Mobil Facebook General Electric Google Heinz IBM Kraft Microsoft Netflix Pfizer WalMart Read More Europe shares dip and dollar down on Comey sacking Investors toast strong corporate updates as shares rise across Europe US stocks hit fresh highs as fear factor dissipates European shares rise on recovery in resources stocks Akzo sees latest PPG bid inadequate, weighs options Quiet day as Macron’s victory largely priced into the market Aryzta evaluating alternatives for Picard shareholding Euro hits 6-month high and Asian shares gain after French election BlackRock increases stakes in CRH and Bank of Ireland Oil output cuts may be extended, says Saudi energy minister  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat shares plummet on back of first earnings report Technology Samsung’s new Frame TV the picture of style Sport Sonia O’Sullivan: Sub-two-hour marathon now looking like a real runner Economy Fed says slowdown in US growth is temporary Sponsored The Story of Home: A dream of tiny houses The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Funds Tracker Keep up to date with your investments   Latest Business PTSB must deal with non-performing loans before it can pay dividend, CEO says 07:57 Coillte operating profit jumps due to “significant changes” 07:57 KBC Bank Ireland reports after-tax profit of €67m 07:45 Dublin-based fintech firm Corvil sees profits surge 07:00 How smartphones killed off boredom 06:55 Most Read in Business 1 Snapchat shares plummet on back of first earnings report 2 AIB to give cashback on some Visa card purchases 3 Italians turning to Ryanair as Alitalia files for bankruptcy 4 Web Summit lost out when it lost its Irish soul 5 Ireland is world’s fourth-largest shadow banking hub 6 Tabit transforming corporates’ in-house food catering services 7 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus – the Android phone you need 8 Merged Linde and Praxair company to be based in Ireland 9 Dublin-based fintech firm Corvil sees profits surge 10 Builders face insulation ‘headache’ amid key chemical shortage Never miss a story.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Apple It looks like Apple’s forgotten iPhone is getting a big redesign this year Chris Smith @chris_writes May 10th, 2017 at 10:08 AM Share Tweet First released just last year, the iPhone SE became an integral part of Apple’s iPhone lineup, reaffirming the company’s interest in providing a pocketable iPhone with high-end specs to those buyers looking for smaller handsets. Of course, the media has all but forgotten the device, since it’s not quite as appealing or as impressive as Apple’s flagship iPhones. Perhaps the design is one big reason for the lack of attention. The iPhone 5s lookalike that sports iPhone 6s internals and lower pricing still became quite popular with some customers, but Apple decided not to release a new model this past March. However, a new leak from Asia suggests Apple may update the iPhone SE with a big redesign in the near future. Don't Miss: This is how Samsung will stop the Galaxy Note7R from exploding. An image posted over on Weibo shows what appears to be the rear panel of an iPhone SE, according to the person who leaked it. What’s immediately noticeable is that it features cutouts that would fit a vertical camera assembly. However, we’re probably looking at a camera and flash setup, rather than a vertical dual lens camera akin to what we’re expecting on the iPhone 8. Image Source: Weibo A Google Translate translation of the message reveals that the person who posted the image says the iPhone SE component is made of glass, just like what we’re expecting to see from the iPhone 8’s rear shell, and maybe even the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. The new SE could be unveiled at WWDC 2017, the Weibo user also suggests. That said, if the new glass panel is there to enable wireless charging, it’s doubtful that the phone will debut before the iPhone 8 in September. As for the phone’s name, if real, it’s unclear what it’s going to be. Will Apple sell the device as iPhone SE? iPhone SE 2 doesn’t sound right at all. Maybe we’re looking at an iPhone SE Series 2 model, a naming scheme that Apple has adopted for the Apple Watch family.

just-drinks home News & insights News Flavour extensions not part of wider whisk(e)y strategy - Diageo Capital Markets Day 2017 By Olly Wehring | 10 May 2017 Font size Email Print Crown Royal Apple has exceeded Diageo's expectations since its 2014 launch Diageo has confirmed it is not looking to expand the flavour extensions of its Crown Royal Canadian whisky brand beyond the existing three in North America. In late-2012, the group unveiled the first flavoured variant of the whisky brand, Crown Royal Maple Finished, in the brand's domestic market. Two years later, Crown Royal Apple was rolled out across the US, with the apple extension being consistently praised by the company for having exceeded expectations. Apple was followed by Vanilla - again, in Canada - in October last year. Speaking at yesterday's Capital Markets Day presentations in London, CEO Ivan Menezes said the initial results for the new expression have been "very encouraging". However, he distanced the company from the likelihood of pursuing a wider flavour strategy in the whisky segment. "I know some of you are concerned about potentially overplaying flavour extensions in whisky," he told analysts. "So am I. "I want to reassure you that we only use flavour extensions if there is insight showing consumer interest." Menezes praised flavour extensions as being a "low-cost way of delivering new news to the consumer", but added: "While there will be some more flavoured limited seasonal offerings available, we don't have currently any plans for another permanent flavour extension."

Apple Sneaks Into Your Bed With Purchase Of Sleep-Tracking Firm Beddit Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Sneaks Into Your Bed With Purchase Of Sleep-Tracking Firm Beddit May 10, 2017 10:38 am EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Taking Apple To Bed Acquisition deal apple beddit sleep-tracking tracking you while you sleep getting in bed with you Apple wants to get in your bed — but just to track how you sleep: The tech giant acquired Beddit, a Finnish manufacturer of sleep-tracking devices. Beddit confirmed the acquisition this week in an update to the privacy policy page of its website. “Beddit has been acquired by Apple,” the company states, while then noting that customers’ personal data would now be collected, used, and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy. For its part, Apple does not mention the deal — for which terms are unavailable — on its website. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment on the acquisition. Beddit manufactures a $150 sleep-tracking monitor that collects information on customers’ heart rate, breathing, and sleep time. “Unlike activity trackers, Beddit is completely ambient so there’s no need to wear or charge it. The thin, flexible, and soft sensor is unnoticeable when placed under the sheet on top of the mattress,” the device’s product page on Apple notes. Collected data is then transferred to the Beddit app, which analyzes the data, providing users with information on how to “achieve better sleep.” It’s unclear how Apple plans to use Beddit’s sleep-tracking technology, however, CNBC suggests the tracking could be incorporated into the Apple Watch.

Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 8: Your Move, Apple! Vs Michael Grothaus 12:27, 10 May 2017 facebook twitter google+ How do 2017's main flagship rivals compare? We take a look at the Galaxy S8 versus the rumoured iPhone 8 It's that time of year again, Samsung has now launched its new flagship, the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. Meanwhile, Apple won't launch a new iPhone until September, but this year is a special year; it's the iPhone’s 10th birthday and Apple is believed to be introducing a TON of new features, specs and a brand new design language. Samsung is once again the biggest phone maker on the planet, beating Apple and Huawei. TrendForce released a report this week that shows all the movers and shakers in the mobile space for Q1 2017. Samsung is the biggest player, followed by Apple and then Huawei, Oppo and BBK/vivo. LG managed to sneak into the top six, but only just. BlackBerry, HTC, Sony, OnePlus and the rest are once again left to pick up the crumbs. Local news outlets in South Korea are reporting that Samsung Galaxy S8+ sales are now expected to be higher than the regular Galaxy S8 edition. Yuanta Securities, an analysis firm, issued details and predictions of a combined total sales figure of 50.4 million units per year. Of this overall figure, the forecasts suggest the Galaxy S8+ will account for 27.1 million units; a 53.9% split of all S8 series handsets sold. Although there's a ways off for the iPhone launch, the handsets (three are rumoured) have been talked about pretty extensively already, so there's a lot of info out there. Plenty of it is from reliable and reputable sources as well, and a lot of it corroborates, overlaps, or lines up in such a way that we feel reasonably confident in being able to predict roughly how these devices will compare. So that's where this article comes in, a somewhat tentative and speculative look at all the rumoured info. According to a report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo, supply of the iPhone 8's OLED panels may struggle to meet initial demand, the result of which could see the beginning of production pushed back by several months. In a note to investors, Kuo described "severe" OLED shortages having an impact on Apple's production plans. This means Apple may not have sufficient units ready in time for the usual August or September launch, and the firm may have to delay launching the hotly-anticipated 10th Anniversary model flagship back until October or November. Indeed, in a worst case scenario we may not see the iPhone 8 available widely until Q1 2018. So, while the rumour mill has been spinning enough yarn about the iPhone 8 that there's plenty of ammo for a comparison, it's also not a dead certainty that the iPhone 8 will even arrive this year. That could put the iPhone 8 in direct competition with the Galaxy S9 and leave the Galaxy S8 a pretty clear run of 2017! That said, the latest details from DigiTime, which cites local Chinese publications, suggest that the iPhone 8 production schedule is on target and will begin mass production in time for a launch this year. There is still everything to play for, it seems. Right. Let’s delve into what’s currently known about these two, very special handsets. iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Major Specs Rumored iPhone 8 Display: 4.7, 5.5 and 5.8in 1920 x 1310 Curved OLED  Storage: 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB CPU and RAM: A11 processor, 3-4GB RAM Front Camera: 8MP Rear Camera: 12MP dual-lens, dual-OIS, 4K video recording Extras: Iris scanner, wireless charging Samsung Galaxy S8 Display: 5.8 and 6.2in 2960x1440 Super AMOLED Display Storage: 64GB internal, 256GB expandable CPU and RAM: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or Samsung Exynos 8895 Processor, 4GB RAM Front Camera: 8MP with autofocus Rear Camera: 12MP, 4K video recording, optical image stabilization. Extras: Iris scanner As far as specs go you can expect the iPhone 8 to see a new A11 processor and M11 motion-coprocessor. But until those actually ship, there’s no way to tell for sure how they compare against the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or Samsung Exynos 8895 processor found in the Galaxy S8. That said, a new leak, which we'd suggest you approach cautiously, shows benchmarking results for the iPhone 8's A11 chip and they are, quite simply, mind-blowing. A little too good to be true, in fact. The iPhone 8 was allegedy put through Geekbench, according to a screenshot emerging out of China. Thing is, that screenshot is all we have as evidence, and it's not outside the realms of possiblity that it could have been faked. Anyway, the Geekbech 4.0 results show phenomenal scores from the iPhone 8.  In single-core testing it scored 4,537, while multi-core racked up 8,975. These are, quite frankly, rather astounding results, making them all the more fishy. Compared, for example, with the Galaxy S8+'s scores of 1,986 and 6,447 respectively - and that phone currently tops the scoreboard against pretty much everything else. The iPhone 8 is apparently twice as fast on the single-core score alone. Giving them the benefit of the doubt for a moment, these results show a 30% uplift in single-core performance from the iPhone 7 and a 58% improvement on the multi-core. It's also 41% faster on multi-core than the Galaxy S8. Other fishy details included in the benchmark results are an odd display resolution of 2,800x1,242 pixels, which means a display aspect ratio of 20.2:9 or 2.25:1, bigger than the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. The A11 processor specs are also shown as a 2.74 GHz quad-core CPU, and 128KB of L1 cache, which means a 17% increase in CPU clockspeed on the iPhone 7. Apple’s silicon is always impressive. The past two generations of Apple’s A-Series chipsets have been remarkable pieces of technology, improving performance, power consumption and graphical prowess dramatically each and every year. With the advent of higher resolution displays, more display real-estate and the very real possibility of a Pro model iPhone, this year’s A11 CPU could well be the most potent we’ve seen released in a good long while. TSMC is reportedly making Apple’s 10-nanometer chipset with production reportedly starting as early as Q2 2017. The transition to 10 nanometers should enable Apple to pack a lot more features and functionality into a given area than it could with the 16-nanometer technology that the A10 Fusion chip is built on,” notes fool.com. “TSMC previously said that its 10-nanometer technology will see a ’20% speed gain and 40% power reduction’ relative to its 16-nanometer technology.” Basically, if you're coming to the iPhone 8 from the iPhone 6, which a lot of people will be, you will definitely notice the difference. The Galaxy S8, meanwhile, currently tops the rankings in benchmarking against every other phone. We've tested the Galaxy S8+ in our full review, which is the international variant with the firm's own 10nm Exynos 8895 processor, which it manufactures itself on the FinFET process. Samsung also produces the Snapdragon 835 for the US model using the same architecture - the performance is said to be comparable. Our time with the S8 showed it to be extremely capable, with amazingly smooth performance in the interface operation, excellent multitasking clout, and a dab hand at high-end gaming too. However, if the above leak regarding the iPhone 8 is to be believed then Samsung is in serious trouble when the A11 arrives. As for RAM, its likely a tie. Entry level iPhone 8’s might have 3GB of RAM with the Plus maxing out at 4GB. But the S8 also includes 4GB of RAM! As for storage options, the iPhone 8 will likely max out at 256GB. It’s the breadth of internal storage that really beats the S8 here. Although, the S8 could actually end up with more storage. While it only offers 64GB internal, it maxes out to over 300GB with its support 256GB SD cards. iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Display At present it's thought there will be three size variants of the iPhone 8 at 4.7in, 5.5in, and 5.8in. However, Apple is rumoured to be adopting curved OLED displays to incorporate a wrap-around, bezeless display in a unique new, slightly iPhone 4S-insipired curved glass bodyshell, but it is strongly claimed that this will only apply to one model which will be priced at a premium, as Apple is unable to source enough of the curved OLED panels for every variant. Also, there are rumours doing the rounds saying Apple has now abandoned the curved OLED in favour of a flat OLED setup. The model with the OLED display is also believed to be the one which will have other high-spec bells and whistles, such as a dual-OIS dual-lens camera. The resolution for the iPhone 8's display will allegedly be 1920 x 1310 pixels and it is said that the Home key and fingerprint scanner will be embedded under the display glass. However, yet more contradictory leaks, some from reliable tipsters, show a fingerprint scanner cut-out on the rear panel. It's not clear whether 3D Touch will make a return, but our guess is that it likely will. According to the newly emerged patent filing, reports the Daily Star, "Apple is woking on a flexing display that is moveable between a folded position and an unfolded position.” It added: "Giving the flexible phone reactive skills, the application has detailed how the future phone will play host to a sensor that detects whether the flexible display is in the folded position or the unfolded position. Using this, it adds it will benefit from processing circuitry that automatically turns on the flexible display when the flexible display moves from the folded position to the unfolded position.” This technology could well be for later models, however.  iphone-8-release-date-specs-prices What’s interesting about all this is that it what we’re seeing now is Apple copying Samsung, a thing Apple has long accused Samsung of in the past. However, in 2017, Apple will borrow more features from Samsung’s existing Galaxy phones than ever before. Not that this is a new trend; the Apple Pencil, for instance, simply took what Samsung was doing with its Note range and brought it to iPad. The addition of curved displays for iPhones, however, is a little closer to the bone, as this design attribute is something Samsung has very much made its own. As for the Galaxy S8 phones, Samsung is doing away with flat displays and both Galaxy S8 variants have curved Super AMOLED screens with a resultion of 2960x1440. The handsets do not feature a physical Home button, a first for Samsung, in order to make room for more display in a similar-sized chassis; instead, there's a capacitive key under the glass and the fingerprint scanner has moved to the rear panel, alongside the camera sensor. The overall look and feel of the Galaxy S8 is stunning, picking up where last year’s model left off, while refining things even further; it's much curvier and more elegant, with a very seamless look and feel. The image quality is superb too, with a stunningly sharp resolution, one of the widest colour gamuts available, and excellent brightness and contrast ratings. DisplayMate gave it an A+ rating, it's highest ever, declaring it the "best" display on the market. However, some customers in South Korea who got their handsets relatively early reported Galaxy S8 units with a red-tinted display. According to The Korea Herald, Samsung has now acknowledged the problem and is working on a fix, the firm issued a statement as follows: "Because there are some complaints about the red-tinted screens, we decided to upgrade the software next week for all Galaxy S8 clients." Samsung also issued instructions to its Service Centres regarding the issue, saying, "There will be an additional update to make color revisions more minutely at the end of April" Samsung has now issued another statement regarding the red tint issue during a conference call reported by Korean source The Investor. Samsung revealed it has carried out inspections of Galaxy S8 units and said it is confident about the handset quality and its quality control. "Due to the nature of Super AMOLED displays, there can be natural differences in color. Users can optimize the color depending on their preferences." Samsung also added that the software update it has promised to fix the issue will allow better colour optimisation and calibration. The update designed to fix the red-tint issue is now rolling out to Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ units. It started in South Korea, but has now progressed to Europe. Galaxy S8 owners will see the update prompt for version G950NKSU1AQDG, while Galaxy S8+ units will have version G955NKSU1AQDG. Handsets in the UK and Germany have now started receiving the software update, which is sized at  426MB. The update adds new features to the Adaptive Display mode menu which give the user finer control of colour calibration and tuning. The Screen mode menu also has a new EDGE colour balance setting as well. iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Camera The front S8 camera is only 8MP, but it does feature autofocus making it very easy to use. Quality wise the images snapped on the selfie cam are much better than you might typically expect, owing to the use of a wide f/1.7 aperture alongside the benefits of autofocus. The front iPhone 8 camera will also likely be 8MP. Of the back lenses the S8 maxes out at a single-lens 12MP with OIS, dual-pixel phase detect autofocus and an f/1.7 aperture, while the iPhone 8 will have a 12MP dual-lens, according to reports. Some very recent reports have said that the model with a dual-lens and curved OLED display will also feature new dual-OIS, an upgrade from the iPhone 7 Plus which had a dual-sensor but only OIS in one of the two lenses. It’s likely Apple could also have improved software that makes it pictures more colorful and richer. However the S8 is likely to take better night shots. Indeed, in our time with the Galaxy S8+ the photography is a standout feature of the phone; it takes breathtaking photos in all lighting conditions and has some of the best low-light and night-time performance we've seen. It's also incredibly easy to use and features a  Pro mode for those who want more fine control. Both Samsung and Apple will push innovation in the imaging department. Apple will refine the dual-lens experience, adding in better sensors, improved image processing and, generally speaking, tighten everything up.  The iPhone 7 Plus’ camera – like the iPhone 6s Plus’ before it – was pretty exceptional anyway, so we don’t see Apple doing too much the overall setup; this just isn’t the company’s style – it likes to increment slowly, refining things over longer periods of time.  iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: AIs Samsung’s having another stab at doing a digital assistant, and this one is called Bixby and it debuted inside the Samsung Galaxy S8. Bixby was developed by the original creators of Siri, who are now working under Samsung. Samsung will bring Bixby to ALL of its products as well; so it won’t just feature inside the Galaxy S8. Expect to see Bixby inside HDTVs, watches, tablets and more. Bixby is basically Samsung’s answer to Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. “The acquisition of Viv Labs would also allow Samsung to reduce its dependence on Google services,” reports The Express. “Samsung has already launched its own contactless payment options – Samsung Pay – which directly competes with Google's Android Pay solution.” Viv Labs CEO Dag Kittlaus said: "Samsung is setting its sights on becoming a major player in software and services, and specifically AI. “Samsung Pay has already proven to be one of the most successful mobile payment platforms in the market and SmartThings is another software acquisition signaling their conviction. And they have installed a new cadre of senior SW-savvy management stretching all the way to the top with a mission.” iPhone 8 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: Verdict Well… 2017 just got A LOT more interesting. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are two of the most impressive handsets we have ever seen. That makes Apple’s job with the iPhone 8 all the more difficult. The bar has been raised across the board by Samsung. The company hit the ball out of the park with the Galaxy S8, leaving no stone unturned. Apple’s iPhone 8 will likely be just as impressive. But where things could get interesting is if Samsung can convert any floating iPhone 7 users in the interim. Given the quality of these phones, the design and the overall level of finish I can see A LOT of current iPhone users switching. I know I’m tempted! What makes things even more interesting, though, is that Samsung still has the Galaxy Note 8 up its sleeve for later on in the year. This means Apple has two potentially massive-selling Android phones to contend with. Expect A LOT of excitement later on this year.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) May 10, 2017 at 11:01AM Earlier this year, The Motley Fool hosted three middle school students from St. Albans to attend our "MBA in a Day" program to gain investing and finance skills. "MBA in a Day" is part of The Motley Fool's commitment both to local education and to charity (the "MBA" was raffled off as part of a fundraiser). Watch the video below to learn about this experience and what the students took away from this educational day. Gaby Lapera: Hello everyone, welcome to "MBA in a Day" at The Motley Fool, a special program we're running with a local school. We're taping today on Friday, Feb. 17th. We're joined by a few young men from from St. Albans. Why don't you guys introduce yourself? Why don't we start with our blue mic? Aram Akhavan: I'm Aram Akhavan. I'm in 8th grade at St. Albans. Ben Shorb: I'm Ben Shorb, I'm also in 8th grade at St. Albans. Grayson Grigorian: I'm Grayson Grigorian, also in 8th grade at St. Albans. Lapera: Thank you guys for joining us, making me feel even older than the last taping with St. Albans boys. [laughs] It's really nice to have you guys here. Who have you talked to today? Who's been most impressive to you? Don't worry, we'll tell them. Akhavan: I think David Gardner was really interesting, when he showed us the numbers on how, even though he had lost up to 90% or 80% on some stocks, he had a lot of loss, but there was a lot of profit as well. So, it's like, you can't really expect these 10 stocks to all do really well. You're going to have some ups and some downs. But in the end, the profit is going to outweigh the loss. Lapera: Yeah, definitely, as long as you get into the gain. Shorb: Yeah, I agree with Aram that David Gardner was really influential, because he knew a lot about what he was talking about. He's obviously been in the business for a long time. He really emphasized the point that you really want to work on investing in the long-term over short-term, and expect to go through some drops and falls. But if you stick with your stocks, then you can hope for eventual profit. Grigorian: Yeah, I think David Gardner was very helpful, with how he showed us how his most profitable investment outweighed pretty much all of his negative investments, let alone his other close-to-as-profitable investments. Lapera: Definitely. He's definitely a really interesting guy, with a really interesting investing history. I know that you guys are here to talk about Apple. I see an iPhone on the table, even, so clearly there's some personal buy-in as well as academic buy-in. Let's start with softball, what does Apple do? Grigorian: They make electronic products, from computers to iPads, which are their tablets, and iPhones, their phone, and iPods, which are an iPhone without calling capabilities. Lapera: Yeah, absolutely. That's really funny, I remember when iPods were basically the only thing they made besides computers. I know they're also experimenting with some new technology like with driverless cars and stuff like that. A really interesting company. Why did you guys pick Apple? Any one of you. Shorb: Obviously, Apple is an insanely popular company, especially around here cause almost everyone has an iPhone, there's probably only one or two people in our school who don't have an iPhone, if they have a phone at all. Especially after the recent news that Warren Buffett increased his stocks in Apple, especially after he talks so much about being afraid of technology because he doesn't know a lot about it, and seeing that such a powerful investor is now investing in Apple shows promise for it. Besides that, Apple has such a strong following of customers that they really latch onto the customers. Once you buy one iPhone, you're pretty much hooked, and there's huge hype for the iPhone 8 coming out, and news of huge new designs that are eventually going to become very popular. Lapera: Yeah, absolutely. This is definitely a case of invest in what you know, then. Shorb: Yeah. Akhavan: One of the things with Apple that's really huge is how they have such a monopoly over most of the things that they make. Like with their phones, they have the new competitor, the Pixel, but Samsung suffered a big setback with the Note 7 -- Lapera: The Galaxy Note 7. Akhavan: Yeah, with the batteries exploding. Samsung dropped behind, and that increased the lead for Apple. And now that they're venturing into more technologies, like with their smart watches and, as you said, driverless cars, they're kind of just extending their monopoly over more and more technologies. Grigorian: Yeah, and Apple's consumer base is solidified enough that a setback like Samsung had probably wouldn't hurt them enough to take them too far down. They're also probably not a company that would make a mistake like that. Lapera: Yeah. Fun fact, I was actually in China when the whole Galaxy Note 7 thing went down. I was with my best friend, who works for Apple. And all of them were cackling with glee about Samsung and their exploding phones. They were like, "We're going to sell so many phones!" So, you guys have told me a lot of really positive things about Apple. Do you have any concerns about the company? Shorb: I definitely think Samsung is still a huge competitor to Apple. Most of their phones, especially the Google Pixel -- which, obviously, also Google is a big competitor -- they have the same sort of functionality as an iPhone. I feel like there are only a couple things that really limit them, meaning that the Apple community, the iMessage feature of the iPhone, limits Samsung users from contacting people with iPhones, which pretty much separates the consumers into iPhone versus everything else. Lapera: Yeah. Listeners, in case you don't know, iPhones allow you to text other users who have iPhones using the internet, and you'll see the text pop up in blue if it's another iPhone user and green if they're using SMS text, which you would have to use with other non-Apple phones. Shorb: And besides that, iPhones, I think, are generally more expensive. And for most of the middle class, they would prefer something cheaper, and Samsung is usually cheaper, and besides Samsung, there are many other options that could be from $300 instead of a $900 iPhone. Lapera: Absolutely. That's a huge concern internationally, especially in developing countries were cheap and functional is the name of the game. Anyone else have any potential issues with Apple? Akhavan: No, he pretty much stole the show. Lapera: So, it's really important, one of the most important things to do when you are building a case for a stock is to write down all the reasons you think it's great, but also write a bear case. Say, "This is the reason I think it might fail." That way you're sure that you know the company is a good one to invest in, because you've educated yourself on all the potential pitfalls already. Do you guys have anything else you want to say about Apple? Akhavan: I think the stock has another benefit to it, and that's the affordability of it. I think it's $130 per share? Lapera: $135.72. Akhavan: Yeah. That's better for someone in the middle class, or some children whose parents don't want them to spend a lot of money on ... Lapera: On stock. Akhavan: Yeah. Lapera: That's totally fair. Do you guys have jobs yet? Shorb: No. Lapera: No? Not yet? You guys are going to go into 9th grade next year, so, I think, according to child labor laws, you should be able to start working next year. Well, I strongly encourage you to find a job. I know I started working when I was 14, and I opened my first IRA at 18. That's a great time to start investing, just like the other guys we talked to earlier, because that way, power of compounding interest. Grigorian: I think we've learned a lot today about how, in investing, time is the most important factor, and the earlier you start, the better off you're going to be in the end. And starting at the age we are at now is a huge advantage compared to most people, who end up wanting to start around 50 and don't have the time that we do. Lapera: Absolutely. And you guys are getting educated early, which is the other most important part. There's a lot of people -- trust me, you get to be my age, and there's a lot of people who are like, "I have no idea how my 401K works, I don't even know what stocks exist." So, it's really good and cool to see you guys out here learning today. Thank you guys so much for joining us. Grigorian: Thank you. Lapera: Rick, are you convinced? Would you buy Apple? Rick Engdahl: Already own it. Lapera: Well, Rick is convinced already, although I'm sure you guys helped convince him even more.

Steve Hemmerstoffer, known as @onleaks on Twitter, and his track record makes it very likely this is exactly what Apple plans to ship. New image shows the iPhone 8 we’re likely getting this fall Hemmerstoffer based his iPhone 8 rendering on factory CAD files. He shared the design on Twitter saying, “So, this is it… I guess… #iPhone8 renders + 360° video + size (based upon factory CAD) on behalf of @GearIndia.” So, this is it… I guess… #iPhone8 renders + 360° video + size (based upon factory CAD) on behalf of @GearIndia https://t.co/cbggACbCh0 pic.twitter.com/FgNsoQfqRb — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) May 9, 2017 The rendering shows a lot of what we’re already expecting: Curved display edges blending into the phone’s body, near edge-to-edge screen, no physical Home button, and dual vertical camera lenses on the back. Reports also say it’ll sport an OLED display with Touch ID sensors embedded in the glass. The iPhone 8 will most likely debut along side the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus during Apple’s usual September media event. The 7s and 7s Plus will ship shortly after, and the 8 is expected to hit store shelves a few weeks later. Hemmerstoffer also made a video for Gear showing the iPhone 8 from various angles. What you won’t see is Touch ID on the back of the device, which seems to kill an earlier rumor saying that’s where the fingerprint sensor would move. Apple hasn’t said anything about the upcoming iPhone models yet, so it’s possible all of the renders we’ve seen so far are wrong. Considering Hemmerstoffer’s track record, however, odds are this is the iPhone 8 Apple will show off this fall.

Smith Helaine Kang Home Energy Mining Tech Pharma & Biotech Home News Articles NASDAQ:AAPL Apple's shares erase gains after valuation exceeds US$800bn for the first time Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 10:00 10 May 2017 Apple is rumoured to be developing a rival to Amazon Echo in an effort to retain its leading position in the technology industry Apple could hike its dividend or explore acquisitions after its repatriates its overseas profits Apple plc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have shares dipped today, snapping a two-day rise after its market capitalisation surpassed US$800bn for the first time on Monday. Shares fell 0.87% to US$152.63 in early US trading after closing 2.72% higher to US$153.01 on Monday when the iPhone maker cemented its position as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Apple became the first company to see its market capitalisation pass US$800bn after Drexel Hamilton raised its target price to US$202 a share from US$185, giving the company an estimated US$1trn valuation. Its share price was also lifted by news that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that it raised its stake to US$19.2bn at 31 March from US$7.1bn at 31 December. Apple's market capitalisation exceeds that of its biggest competitors, including Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which comes in second place with a valuation of US$653bn as of Monday. Microsoft has a market capitalisation of US$532bn while Amazon.com is valued at US$451bn. Yet, Drexel Hamilton analyst, Brian White, thinks Apple is the most “underappreciated stocks in the world" with a “very, very depressed valuation” at 11 times excluding cash. However, he expects that to change as investors begin to recognise the company’s growth potential. In an interview with Bloomberg about the target price hike, White said there were four things to look forward to at Apple – the release of the iPhone8 in September, valuation growth, new innovations and an increase in capital returns. Apple could hike dividend or explore acquisition… White also believes Apple could hike its dividend or explore possible acquisitions once the US tech giant repatriates its profits held offshore. The company holds more than US$200bn offshore and plans to bring home much of the pile this year. The decision comes after US President Donald Trump vowed to offer US firms a one-off tax holiday if they return offshore cash to American soil. “I think if there is repatriation and 93% of their cash is overseas, which is almost US$240bn, I think you could see something else happen -  it could be a higher dividend, it could be a one-time dividend,” White said. “The dividend yield is 1.7%. Look at the mega tech companies they are well over 3%, I’d like to see that on Apple.” Sizeable debt but strong cash flows... Apple has in recent years turned to debt markets to reward shareholders. Last week the company announced it was increasing the size of its capital return programme to US$300bn by the end of March 2019 instead of the previously announced US$250bn, including US$210bn worth of share buybacks and a dividend of US$13.2bn annually. White noted that Apple had about US$84bn in long-term debt at its last earnings report, but said the company generates about £60bn-£70bn in free cash flow a year. The analyst added that the repatriation would boost cash in the US to allow for merger and acquisition opportunities. He believes an acquisition would be in the US where “a lot of the innovation is coming from, (particularly) these next generation areas". Apple vs Amazon, Google... Apple investor Warren Buffet admitted to shareholders over the weekend that he made a mistake on missing out on investing in Google and Amazon years ago when their stock price was a fraction of what it is today. Buffet, whose Berkshire Hathaway holds the second-biggest equity holding in Apple, said he realised early on the Google was turning significant profits from advertising but didn’t think it could sustain long-term success. On Amazon, he said he was “too dumb to realise” its growth potential as he underestimated  its potential dominance and the ability of  chief executive Jeff Bezos. Separately, analyst Rob Sanderson at MKM Partners has raised his stock price target on Amazon to US$1,095 from US$995 and reiterated a ‘buy’ rating, saying he considers it "the best long-term growth opportunity available to investors today”. He said the growth potential comes from Amazon’s strategy of heavy investment in its Prime video, devices and technology, fulfillment capacity and cloud services businesses. Apple also seems to have recognised the threat Amazon poses, hinting recently about developing a competitor to smart home hub Amazon Echo. In an interview with technology news site Gadgets 360 at the weekend, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, was asked what he thinks of Amazon Echo and Google Home. He said, "my mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all", adding that customers might benefit from having a screen in addition to voice assistance with their smart home hubs. “There is an over 50% chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June," KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note. WWDC is Apple's annual developers’ conference. Apple could lose top position to Saudi Aramco... Saudi Aramco could take over as the world's most valuable publicly traded company when Saudi Arabia floats 5% of the energy giant in an initial public offering to take place next year. The stock market debut could value the company at US$2trn based on sizeable oil reserves and is expected to be the biggest IPO to date, raising tens of billions of dollars. Aramco has reportedly hired investment bank Moelis to work on its stock market flotation, which is seen as an important step in transforming Saudia Arabia's economy to reduce its dependence on oil revenues in coming years.    Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Renae Dyer Register here to be notified of future AAPL Company articles View full AAPL profile Apple Timeline Article May 03 2017 Apple fanatics hold off buying ahead of release of next model of the sacred cash cow Video May 03 2017 'Media hype takes bite out of Apple' - Proactive's John Harrington Article May 02 2017 Apple shares nudging higher ahead of first quarter numbers Article April 12 2017 Apple to benefit from Donald Trump's tax holiday plans Article April 11 2017 Apple accused of threats and lying to regulators in legal dispute with US chipmaker Qualcomm Article April 06 2017 Apple sued by Australian regulators for allegedly refusing to repair devices serviced elsewhere Article March 30 2017 Apple vs. Samsung - will the iPhone8 trump the Galaxy S8?

Join For Free Discover how to focus on operators for Reactive Programming and how they are essential to react to data in your application.  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  This post discusses how to use Couchbase Lite as an embedded database to share data between your iOS App and iOS App Extension. App Extensions implement a specific task or functionality that can be exposed to other apps on the device or to the Operating System. In this post, we will walk through an example of how a Today Extension can be used with a Couchbase Lite embedded database in standalone mode. NOTE:  We will be discussing Couchbase Mobile v1.4 which is the current production release. There is a newer Developer Preview version 2.0 of Couchbase Mobile Background Apple supports many kinds of App Extensions, each of which enables functionality that is relevant to a particular subsystem on the device.  In this post, we will discuss how Couchbase Lite can be used with a Today Extension. This type of extension, also known as a “Widget,” appears in the Today view of the Notification Center and allows users get quick updates. You can learn more about how App Extensions work in the Apple Developer documents. I’ll assume you’re familiar with developing iOS Apps in Swift and have a basic understanding of integrating Couchbase Lite into your iOS App. This Getting Started guide is a great place to begin.  If would like to read up more on Couchbase, refer to the resources at the end of this post. Couchbase Lite Couchbase Lite is an embedded database that runs on devices. It can be used in several deployment modes. It can be used as a standalone embedded database or it can be used in conjunction with a remote Sync Gateway that would allow it to sync data across devices. In this post, we will use Couchbase Lite in standalone deployment mode. In this post, we will not go over the details of integrating with Couchbase Lite. The Getting Started With Couchbase Lite blog is a good place to get started on that. Demo App Download the Demo Xcode project from the Github repo. We will use this app as an example in the rest of the blog. git clone git@github.com:couchbaselabs/couchbase-lite-ios-standalone-sampleapp.git This is a simple Task List app that allows users to add, edit, delete tasks. A user can mark tasks as completed. A Today Extension is bundled with the app that shows the top 2 tasks right in your notification center without the need to open the app. The user can mark tasks as completed right from the notification center. All tasks are stored in a local Couchbase Lite database. This implies that the Container app and the extension will both need access to the database. App Architecture App extensions are not standalone apps. They are bundled within an app, referred to as a “Container App.”  Although app extensions are bundled in the container app, they run independently of the container app in a separate process. App extensions are launched by other apps that need the extension’s functionality. The app that launches the app extension is referred to as the "Host App."  The extension’s UI is displayed in the context of the host app. Although the container app and the corresponding extension are independent processes running in their own sandbox, they can share data through a shared container. The shared container can be set up by registering a unique app group and enabling it for both the container app and the extension. You will learn about setting this up in the next section. Configuring App Groups Refer to the Apple Developer Docs to learn more about configuring App Groups in your iOS app. Open the CBLiteAppExtension.xcworkspace of the demo app project that you downloaded. Open the “Capabilities” tab of CBLiteApp Container App target. You should see the app group group.com.example.CBLiteSharedData enabled. Enabling App Group for App Open the “Capabilities” tab of CBLiteTaskExtension target. You should see the same app group, group.com.example.CBLiteSharedData enabled. Configuring App Group in Extension  Enabling the app group capabilities for a target adds it to the Entitlements files for the container app and its extension. In addition, you will have to add the App Groups feature to your App Id registered in the Apple Developer Portal. Configuring App Group for App in Apple Developer Portal App Walkthrough Build and run the app by choosing the app target “CBLiteAppExtension.” Now switch to the Today view of the Notification Center. Add your new Extension Widget to the Today View as shown below. Switch to the app and add a couple of tasks by tapping on the “+” button. Switch to the corresponding Today widget. You will notice that the tasks that you added are displayed in the widget. Mark a task as “Completed” by tapping on the task. Now switch back to the container app. You will notice the completion status of the tasks is updated to correspond to actions taken from the Today widget. Similarly, edits or delete a task in the Container app by swiping the task entry. Switch to the Today widget. You will see the updated task list. If your device supports 3D Touch, you can do a force touch on the app icon on home screen to reveal the Top Tasks extension right there from the icon and you can interact with it. Pretty cool! Finally, terminate the container app. Switch to the Today widget and update the Completed status of a task. Relaunch the app. The tasks will be listed with the updated status.   Code Walkthrough Tasks are stored in a local Couchbase Lite embedded database. This implies that both the container app and the Today Extension need access to the database. As discussed earlier, the way to share data between the container app and the extension is through the shared container. This implies that the Couchbase Lite database must be located in the shared container. The code to enable this is straightforward. Open the DatabaseManager.swift file. The DatabaseManager is a singleton class that handles basic database management functions. Locate appGroupContainerURL function This function constructs the path to the shared container folder. // 1. Get URL to shared group container
        let fileManager = FileManager.default
        guard let groupURL = fileManager
            .containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: "group.com.example.CBLiteSharedData") else {
                return nil
        }

        let storagePathUrl = groupURL.appendingPathComponent("CBLite")
        let storagePath = storagePathUrl.path

        // 2: Create a folder in the shared container location with name"CBLite"
        if !fileManager.fileExists(atPath: storagePath) {
            do {
                try fileManager.createDirectory(atPath: storagePath,
                                                withIntermediateDirectories: false,
                                                attributes: nil)
            } catch let error {
                print("error creating filepath: \(error)")
                return nil
            }
        }

        return storagePathUrl Return the URL to the shared group container. Group containers are stored in ~/Library/Group Containers/<application-group-id>. Create a folder named CBLite in the shared group container. Locate configureCBManagerForSharedData function. do {
            // 1. Set the file protection mode for the Couchbase Lite database folder
            let options = CBLManagerOptions(readOnly: false, fileProtection: Data.WritingOptions.completeFileProtectionUnlessOpen)
            let cblpoptions = UnsafeMutablePointer<CBLManagerOptions>.allocate(capacity: 1)
            cblpoptions.initialize(to: options)

            if let url = self.appGroupContainerURL() {
                // 2. Initialize the CBLManager with the directory of the shared container
                _cbManager = try CBLManager.init(directory: url.relativePath, options: cblpoptions)
            }

            return true
        }
        catch {
             return false

        } Create CBLManagerOptions options object with the appropriate file protections. A value of completeFileProtectionUnlessOpen implies that read/write access to the file is restricted unless file is open Initialize the CBLManager with the path to the shared container. When the database is created, it will be created in the shared container.That’s it! The Couchbase Lite database is now in the shared container that both the app and the extension can read and write to. What Next? Explore the rest of the demo sample code to understand how documents are added, edited, and deleted. Specifically look at the TaskPresenter.swift file. This is where all the interactions with the Couchbase Lite database are handled. Learn how divergent branches can appear in your repository and how to better understand why they are called “branches".  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  Like This Article?

It just became an $800 billion dollar company for the first time, and the Apple stock price is hovering around all-time highs. UBS equity research circulated a note to clients May 10 after the bank spoke to two Apple experts, Horace Dediu and Neil Cybart, to get an outside opinion from two technology wizards on where Apple stock will go from here. "Mr. Dediu underscored Apple's emphasis on product and customer satisfaction above all else, resulting in a brand that supports premium pricing," the note said. "Both indicated that the recent narrative shift from a hits-driven business to services and more annuity-like consistency has been positive," the note added. "Mr. Cybart argued that now is the time for Apple to milk the iPhone." Both Dediu and Cybart expect the iPhone 8 to be a success, not necessarily as a result of  any new revolutionary upgrades, but rather from the high level of pent-up demand for a new phone.  Dediu said, "every Apple product (outside services) is about $1/day—if the OLED phone is priced at $1,000, the upgrade cycle will be about three years." Cybart thinks that Apple has a tremendous opportunity in wearable technology and wireless headphones as competition fades.    UBS has a "Buy" rating and $165 price target on Apple stock, implying 7.7% of upside.  SHARE THIS POST News for AppleMORE PRESS DIGEST- New York Times business news - May 11 (ANF) Reuters 2h UPDATE 1-Apple supplier AAC Technologies plunges after short-seller report (2018, AAPL, ) Reuters 2h AAC Technologies plunges 13.5 percent after short-seller report (AAPL, 2018, ) Reuters 2h A notorious leaker just posted what could be the best look at the iPhone 8 yet (AAPL) Business Insider 12h LVMH boosts digital profile with multiple brands website (MC, AAPL, 1913, PP) Reuters 15h UPDATE 1-Apple buys Finnish sleep tracking app maker Beddit (AAPL) Reuters 16h APPLE EXPERT: 'Transportation is Apple's future' (AAPL) Business Insider 16h APPLE EXPERT: 'Transportation is Apple's future' (AAPL) Business Insider 16h your MARKET VIEW Your Personalized Market Center Related Stocks AAPL 153.23 -0.67 (-0.44%) 5/10/2017 Disclaimer Get real-time AAPL charts here >> TECH 111.19 0.66 (0.60%) 5/10/2017 Disclaimer Get real-time TECH charts here >> MORE Find News GO Home / Stocks / Apple-Quote / News for Apple Apple / UBS spoke to 2 tech wizards about where Apple stock will go from here (AAPL) Follow us on: Also check out: * Copyright © 2017 Business Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

By Mikah Sargent Tuesday, May 9, 2017 at 11:00 am EDT 4 Comments Mikah Sargent is Senior Editor at Mobile Nations. When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Need help deciding between Amazon Echo and Google Home? If you're an Apple product user trying to choose your in-home voice assistant, this one's for you! You've got a home full of Apple products: an iPhone in your pocket, a Mac on your desk, an Apple Watch on your wrist, and an iPad in your backpack. Lately, however, you've noticed a hole in your life; your home … it's too quiet, too disconnected, too lonely. Suddenly it hits you: You're ready to take the next step in connected home living! What you need is an always-on, voice-controlled assistant to keep you and your home company. Although we may soon see a voice-controlled home hub from Apple, it's still only a rumor for now and that means you're left with two viable options, Google Home or Amazon Echo. So which one's right for you? Read on to find out! A brief introduction Amazon Echo and Google Home are both always-on smart speakers, devices that play media and feature intelligent assistants that respond to voice commands. The Amazon Echo is a tall, cylindrical tube with built-in 360º omni-directional speakers and seven microphones touting "far-field voice recognition" that allow the device to hear you no matter where you are in the room. Google Home is a shorter, squatter device that looks more like home decor than its taller counterpart. It packs in a hi-fi speaker and microphones with "far-field voice recognition" as well as a touch surface on the top of the device for controlling the system with your hands. The Amazon Echo features Amazon's intelligent assistant, Alexa, which gives the device access to an ever-growing list of smart home technology and other integrations. Google Home touts the Google Assistant, an intelligent assistant powered by Google's knowledge graph, AI chops, and integrations with your personal data. The Amazon Echo typically retails for $149.99 and Google Home goes for $129. We're going to take a look at several different factors that might affect your decision to buy an Amazon Echo or Google Home. For each deciding factor, I'll mark a winner based on how well the device holds up in that category. Hopefully you'll be able to walk away with a decision! Amazon Echo - See at Amazon Google Home - See at Best Buy Basic compatibility: It's a draw Because most of your interactions with Google Home and the Amazon Echo should be happening with your voice, compatibility with your iOS and macOS devices shouldn't be too important. That said, you'll need a base level of compatibility in order to set up your smart speaker and perform non-voice interactions. Both smart speakers are compatible with your Apple devices. Amazon and Google both offer third-party iOS apps for setting up and controlling the Amazon Echo and Google Home, respectively. You'll use the apps during the initial setup process to get your smart speaker connected to your home Wi-Fi network and from that point on to add integrations (music, home automation accessories, IFTTT, etc.) and control your device without needing to use your voice. Amazon Alexa - Free - Download Now Google Home - Free - Download Now There's honestly not a lot to say about the smart speakers' basic compatibility with your Apple devices. Setup can be clunky for both the Echo and Home and the speakers' apps can be difficult to navigate at times and finicky at others. If the goal is to get you using your voice to interact with the devices as much as humanly possible, Amazon and Google are doing a good job of discouraging users from using their respective apps. Music listening: Amazon Echo Let me be clear: This piece is meant to help you decide on a smart speaker based on how well it integrates with your Apple products. Given that's the case, this category has a clear winner. While both the Echo and Google Home offer music streaming integrations with Spotify, Pandora, and their own music streaming services (Google Play Music and Amazon Music Unlimited), only the Amazon Echo lets you stream your music over Bluetooth. You can use the Amazon Echo like you would any portable Bluetooth speaker: connect with a device and stream any and all audio content your heart desires! Google Home works a little more like Sonos: If you want to listen to music, you've got to use the services it offers. If you listen to music via an Apple Music subscription, you're definitely going to want to go with the Echo. Smart home: Amazon Echo Smart home integrations aren't strictly about Apple device compatibility, but they're something you should consider before deciding on a smart speaker. Why? Controlling your smart home accessories with your voice is the best reason to have an always-on, always-ready smart speaker. The Amazon Echo wins this category because Alexa's smart home compatibility list is monstrous and it continues to grow. There's also quite the overlap between HomeKit-enabled accessories and Alexa compatibility. These smart home accessories work with Amazon's Alexa and Apple's HomeKit Here's a list of compatible home automation products for Amazon Echo and Google Home: Amazon Echo Switches and Bulbs Philips Hue Bulbs, Lights, and Lightstrips Lutron Caséta Switches & Dimmers LIFX Bulbs and Lightstrips Insteon Lighting TP-Link Switches and Bulbs GE Link Bulbs Haiku Home Select Lighting Stack Bulbs Outlets WeMo Plugs TP-Link Plugs iHome Smart Plug D-Link Smart Plug iDevices Smart Plugs Locks August Smart Lock Schlage Touchscreen Deadbolt Schlage Connected Keypad Lever Yale Assure Lock Yale B1L Lock Yale Key Free Deadbolt Yale Push Button Deadbolt Yale Push Button Lever Lock Yale T1L Lock Yale Touchscreen Deadbolt Yale Touchscreen Lever Kwikset SmartCode Deadbolts Kwikset SmartCode Levers Kwikset SmartCode Touchscreen Deadbolts Note: Most of Amazon Alexa's lock compatibility comes by way of its integration with the Samsung SmartThings Hub and Wink Hub.

First Alert OneLink Safe IFTTT integrations Frigidaire smart appliances Rachio Irrigation and Sprinkler Controllers Other appliances and accessories available to Samsung SmartThings and Wink Hub 2 Automations: It's a draw Thanks to IFTTT integrations, if you want your Apple devices to work more closely with your voice assistant, you can usually make it happen. Both the Amazon Alexa and Google Home have IFTTT integrations that will help you do any number of things using voice commands. I can, for example, say, "Alexa, trigger find my phone," and IFTTT will call my phone. I can also, for example, say, "Ok Google, add a reminder to my iPhone" and IFTTT will add the reminder to Reminders for iOS. Google Assistant on IFTTT Amazon Alexa Overall: Amazon Echo Looking strictly through the lens of Apple device compatibility, Amazon Echo takes home the trophy for Best Smart Speaker for Your Apple Home. Thanks to Amazon's "come one, come all" philosophy for Alexa and Amazon Echo, the device is essentially universally compatible. Google Home, in contrast, works best with Android devices and has limited smart home integrations. It works fine in an Apple home (I have one), but I can't help but notice how much better it works with the Huawei Mate 9 I have sitting near it. Even after all the compatibility considerations, it's important to note one thing: These smart speakers have fancy built-in microphones for a reason and it's not for interacting with 'em via apps. As long as your smart speaker reacts to the sound of your voice and provides your desired features and interactivity, compatibility considerations matter less. Questions?

I don't see support for iDevices, iHome, Leviton, and much more. 0 20 hours ago Reply jacksmith21006 Most of my siblings and myself carry iPhones. Gave our mother a Google Home and Chromecast. She now sits in her family room and just says "hey google how me photos of timmy playing violin" or anything you can think of with her grandkids. This is NOT possible with the Echo. Me and my siblings including my brother with his Android phone simply use Google Photos. That is it. This allows my mother to then without pushing a single button to see photos of her grandkids. We also used Google Photoscan in addition to include all her old photos. Apple integration with Google Home literally required one push which is the shutter button on our iPhones and. nothing else.. BTW, a fantastic mother's day present, IMO. Must be complicated to setup? This is what is incredible is this was all the steps. My wife was already doing this in our home and demonstrated recently to her family when they came over. She simply installed Google Photos on her iPhone and that was it. Is could not be more seamless integration. You click the shutter button and not a single additional button press and she can have any photo she wants display on the TV. This is NOT possible with the Echo. We have had the Echo since it launched and now several Google Homes and, IMO, this article is not accurate. Think about how well existing Google services integrate with Apple products today and simply the Google Home connects those same services. 0 14 hours ago Reply Bounou Outside of having much better microphones I don't know how anyone could come to the conclusion that the echo is better then google home. Alexa is just plain stupid, the difference in AI between the two products are night and day, even Siri is much smarter. A google home with Alexa level microphones is a perfect product 0 18 min ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Cook, coming in at number four was praised for Apple's, and thus his, role in influencing not only technology, but the wider culture. From TIME: As CEO of Apple, one of the world's most valuable brands, Tim Cook has nearly unmatched influence over the technology world. Anything Apple does is bound to be copied by a seemingly endless number of rivals, meaning his choices will reverberate far beyond One Infinite Loop. Today, Apple is rumored to be experimenting with everything from advanced artificial intelligence to augmented reality and self-driving vehicles. Given Apple's role as tastemaker extraordinaire, how Cook decides to move forward with any one of these projects will shape the future of the consumer technology landscape. Meanwhile, Williams made the list for his role in managing Apple's supply chain, as well as his stewardship of the Apple Watch inside the company: CEO Tim Cook may be the public face and chief decision maker at Apple, but Jeff Williams is second in command. An Apple veteran who's been with the company for nearly 20 years, Williams is often referred to as "Tim Cook's Tim Cook." He was named chief operating officer in late 2015, a post previously held by Cook, and has been overseeing Apple's entire supply chain since 2010, no small task given the complexity of the company's hardware operations.

When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Smart home technology can be about more than turning on lights and unlocking doors. When accessibility and inclusivity are a priority, smart home tech can help improve lives. NBC News published an empowering story about an IT consultant named Todd Stabelfeldt who uses Apple's HomeKit framework to live a more independent life. Stabelfeldt is a 38-year-old quadriplegic man who, as the result of an injury when he was eight years old, has had no movement below his shoulders for more than 30 years. Using the HomeKit-enabled accessories in his self-titled, "Quadthedral" smart home, Stabelfeldt is able to leverage both Siri and Apple's Home app to go about his day: Features like Apple's "Home" app allow Stabelfeldt to control a variety of smart accessories in his house — from door locks and window shades, to lights and his garage door. The best part for Stabelfeldt? He can command Apple's intelligent digital assistant Siri to work it all. When he's not using his voice to control his smart home technology, Stabelfeldt makes use of Apple's Switch Control software which allows him to use special hardware for controlling iOS without the use of his hands. It's really incredible seeing how Stabelfeldt has taken this technology and used it to not only increase his independence, but improve the way he works in his home. I encourage you to read the feature over on NBC News — it's a touching example of how tech can improve our lives and a reminder of what we sometimes take for granted. I think that sentiment is captured perfectly in what Apple's Sarah Herrlinger told NBC News: For some people, doing something like turning on your lights or opening a blind or changing your thermostat might be seen as a convenience, but for others, that represents empowerment, and independence, and dignity.

Keep dreaming, Mike. Can you pair your Apple Watch with your Android phone? I mean, a smartwatch is a smartwatch… right? The Apple Watch is one of the best smartwatches on the market. It might even be the best. With some of the poor choices for Android users, folks might start to wonder if an Apple Watch is the way to go, but would that even work? Can Apple Watch pair with Android? No. No it cannot. Apple Watch relies on the content and information on an iPhone and for the connection to work, both ends need to be made by Apple. Apple encrypts much of the information shared between iPhone and Apple Watch, so it ends up being more than just a simple Bluetooth pairing. Android smartwatches have a similar relationship to Android phones in the way that Bluetooth speakers have a relationship with all phones (though, of course, it's not that rudimentary), while Apple Watch and iPhone have a more complex relationship. What are an Android user's smartwatch options? It all depends on what you're looking for. If you're just looking for a fitness tracker and something that notifies you of texts and calls, then you may want to consider a Fitbit. If you're looking for something more robust that lets you respond to emails and texts, perhaps includes Google Assistant, and more, then you'll want an Android Wear or Samsung smartwatch. Best Android Wear smartwatch Everything you need to know about fitness trackers Will Apple Watch ever work with Android? There has been a lot of speculation and commentary, and truthfully, if Apple wants to keep up with the growing popularity of Android, it just might have to make that connection. It's somewhat unlikely, given the whole Apple security thing, but it would be prudent of Apple, since it would likely steal a lot of users away from competition like LG and Samsung. How about you? Are you an Android user longing for a smartwatch experience like watchOS or are you an Apple Watch user wishing an Android phone was on the other end of that connection?

Can you use your Apple Watch with your Android Phone? Nope. Will you ever be able to? Nope. Should you even try? Nope. End. 0 16 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire I think explaining why is worth it. The opinion that the top wearable need Android is preposterous, though. They should have mentioned that it helps to keep people in the Walled Garden: it exists to sell more iPhones. It's working: my wife, sister, aunt and more all recently got one. My Aunt was not an iPhone user before. 0 14 hours ago Reply emeraldayotte Feel like this article wasn't needed. Not sure why someone with an Android phone would purchase an Apple watch in the first place. 0 15 hours ago Reply Velvet G As far as smart watches go, it's easily one of if not the best out there. If it was compatible in any way, I'd happily spend the money for one but I'm not willing to switch phones just to get the watch. Money left on the table for Apple, but truthfully, Apple isn't hurting for money so I doubt they are going to miss it. 0 15 hours ago Reply Hectorius This article was written to bring traffic to the site.

There are some people who left iOS to go try the S8(+). 0 14 hours ago Reply kirnkorner2001 I would personally like to see this happen. I do not have an iPhone, nor do I plan to get one any time soon, I like my Android phone. The smartwatches they offer are crap. I want something that's water resistant (enough to shower and swim with, not just splash resistant); view email, text, and other notifications from the phone; with a decent vibration; and large enough battery to get through at least a couple days. I don't need to respond via my watch, I'll use the phone for that. I currently use a Pebble time, and I am already dreading the day it dies as there's nothing else that meets my specs. 0 14 hours ago Reply Sun Hyung Hong I'm an Android user and I would like to use an Apple watch with my phone. The design is stylish while still looking like a very cool tech device. I would get one even if it only showed me notifications and could control music and podcast apps.

While Apple hasn't addressed this acquisition in any way, Beddit's privacy policy, last revised on May 8, 2017, says that Beddit has been acquired by Apple. From Beddit: Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy. Beddit's most recent product is the Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor, which you place in your bed to track your sleep. The sensor sits under your sheet while you sleep, and connects to the Beddit app to present the data its collected during the night. Does this acquisition mean that Apple is moving into sleep tracking hardware? No, though if such features found their way into future Apple hardware, such as a new Apple Watch, it wouldn't be shocking. But moving into sleep tracking seems to be a logical next step for Apple's health tracking efforts. Reader comments Apple acquires sleep monitoring company Beddit 2 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating mavsguy842 The Health app could certainly be expanded to incorporate sleeping data, such as from more advanced CPAP machines. I could see Apple including O2 saturation measurements along with heartbeat and movement data to make the Apple Watch a very accurate sleep tracker. They could create products to monitor sleeping infants. There's so much Apple could do in the smart-home-health market that I think is ready to explode. 0 9 hours ago Reply lvthunder I have the Beddit device and I think it will be more incorporated by the Health app. I don't think they will move the stuff into the watch. Who wants to wear a watch to bed when you can have a device that lays on the mattress? You need some time to charge the watch so it makes sense to take the watch off while you sleep and the Beddit device can take over. 0 6 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website 5  +   =  ten Last week's Apple stock dividend hike of 10.5% has added another trophy to the company's wall of achievements. With the increase, Apple Inc.'s (Nasdaq: AAPL) total annual dividend payment will rise to $13.22 billion, making it the largest in the world. "They pay out more than U.S. Steel is worth," Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices, pointed out in an email following Apple's earnings report. And naturally, the company Apple knocked out of the No. 1 position was Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), which is expected to pay out $12.77 billion in dividends this year. Over the past decade, Apple has wrested one title after another from Exxon Mobil, symbolizing the changing of the guard from Big Oil to Big Tech… The Apple Stock Dividend Title Completes the Series Apple fired its first warning shot in 2010 when it surpassed Exxon in cash on hand. Falling profits caused Exxon's cash pile to shrink to $36.76 billion, while Apple's cash surged to $51.31 billion. Apple now has the biggest cash pile of any company in the world with $256.8 billion. The first crown Apple took from Exxon was world's most valuable company. Apple first passed Exxon in market capitalization in 2011, but the oil giant didn't surrender without a struggle. The two traded places a few times over the next couple of years, but Apple left Exxon behind for good in 2013. Today, Apple's market cap sits at a record $800 billion, while Exxon Mobil's valuation is less than half of that at $352 billion. (Exxon is in seventh place overall these days.) Apple also moved past Exxon in one other metric in 2013: total number of employees. Apple had grown to 80,300 by 2013, while Exxon Mobil had shrunk to 75,000 from 83,600 in 2010. (But neither has ever come close to the more than 2 million employees of No. 1 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. [NYSE: WMT].) Don't Miss: Five Double-Digit Dividend Plays to Secure Your "Second Salary" The next title fell in 2015 when Apple bested Exxon's record for most profit earned in a year (excluding non-recurring revenue). Apple earned $53.4 billion in its fiscal 2015, easily topping the $45.22 billion Exxon Mobil earned in 2008. Just for some perspective, Apple's record profits in 2015 were so huge they were more than double that of the company with the second-largest profits, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) with $24.4 billion. Now Apple has done it again, eclipsing Exxon's dividend payout. And as we've seen, Apple's lead only figures to get bigger. With a payout ratio – the proportion of earnings paid out in dividends — of just 28.1%, the AAPL stock dividend has a lot of room to grow in the years to come. (Exxon Mobil's payout ratio is 78.4%.) Apple has publicly committed to raising its dividend every year on several occasions, most recently during last week's Q2 earnings conference call. And it continues to rake in the most profits of any company on the planet. So as things stand, the Apple stock dividend will set a new world record every year for the foreseeable future. It will be a long time before Apple is dethroned as the dividend-paying king. Must See: For only the third time in 20 years, a metal more rare and more exotic than gold is about to make stock market history. And it's poised to make early investors a lot of money.

The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook. European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet and Deezer have complained that online platforms - such as search engines and app stores - abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on iOS. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms 'key gatekeepers' deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives - such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies - and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54.4 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a "good Samaritan" principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localization rules hamper technological innovation.

The main reason for this, of course, is that it has far fewer models than other vendors. This does beg the question of how many more Apple could sell if it expanded down the price tier stack, but given how ridiculously profitable the company remains it can’t be faulted for concluding ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.’ “We estimate Apple iPhone 7 shipped 21.5 million units and captured 6 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017,” said SA’s Juha Winter. “The iPhone 7 is by far the world’s most popular smartphone model, due to a compelling blend of user-friendly design, extensive supporting apps, and widespread retail availability for the device. Apple iPhone 7 Plus, with its bigger screen and higher pricing, shipped 17.4 million units for second place and 5 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017.” The secret of Oppo’s success is revealed in the form of the R9, which accounted for a third of all its sales, while Samsung’s ability to maintain growth in spite of Note7-gate thanks to its mid-range J-series devices. “Oppo R9s shipped 8.9 million units for third place and 3 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017,” said SA’s Neil Mawston. “OPPO is largely unknown in the Western world, but its brand is wildly popular in China and growing rapidly across India. The R9s is OPPO’s flagship 4G device with key features such as dual-SIM connectivity and fingerprint security.” “Samsung was still gearing up for the launch of its new Galaxy S8 portfolio, but managed to get two models in the top five during Q1 2017,” said SA’s Linda Sui. “The Galaxy J3 captured 2 percent global smartphone marketshare and fourth place, while Galaxy J5 took 1 percent global share to become the world’s fifth most popular model. Samsung’s J3 and J5 are midrange devices that sell very well across Europe and Asia and they helped to offset Samsung’s troubles with the Note7 battery fiasco in the quarter.” Because we asked really nicely SA was kind enough to share the full year 2016 model shipment numbers with us, which once more reveal Apple dominance. The fact that the iPhone 7 sold almost as many as its predecessor despite only being launched late in the year illustrates how important the last quarter of the year is to the company. In other Apple news, bullish comments from the world’s preeminent investor Warren Buffett have boosted Apple’s shares this week such that it became the first company ever to be worth more than $800 billion in terms of market capitalization, further evidence than it doesn’t need to put too much effort into chasing sales growth.

This is despite the Apple iPhone 7 launch in September 2016, eight months ago. According to the Q1 2017 MOVR, the Apple iPhone 6S became the most used in February 2017 and is now at almost 8% of all global smartphone browsing. In comparison, the iPhone 6 peaked in popularity a year earlier, February 2016, at 14.6%, 488 days after launch. Today, the iPhone 6S usage continues to grow despite the iPhone 7 launch. The iPhone 7 user-base is still on an upward trajectory, ending March at 3.6%, earning third place among iPhones. Given the size of the iPhone 6 user-base, the upgrade potential for the iPhone 7 and 8 is significant if Apple can retain customers. This launch trend history is helpful to e-commerce and advertising websites, who rely on mobile optimization to display their products and services accurately and within seconds to customers across all devices.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Can't Be Happy About Amazon's New Toys The leading online retailer's Alexa-powered Echo lines gets some new product tweaks, and that's bad news for the tech giant eyeing an entry in this niche. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) May 10, 2017 at 9:17AM Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) line of voice-activated digital assistant gadgetry keeps expanding, and that can't sit well with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as rumors grow about the world's most valuable tech company making a splash in this niche.  Amazon introduced Echo Show yesterday, a $229 device that incorporates the Alexa voice-activated platform made popular on Echo and Echo Dot with a seven-inch touchscreen that raises the bar on what a digital assistant can do. We're talking about lyrics scrolling on the screen when your favorite music plays, watching cooking videos from the kitchen, and enhancing your smart home by accessing your security camera feeds.  Oh, and this thing makes video calls to anyone else with an Echo Show or firing up the Alexa app. You can also make voice calls to those with the original Echo or Echo Dot devices. Echo Show is going to be a hit when it begins shipping in late June, and that has to drive Apple executives crazy. Bloomberg is reporting that Apple employees have been testing a digital assistant similar to Echo or Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Home in their homes for several months. At least one analyst -- Ming Chi Kuo at KGI Securities -- expects Apple to unveil it at next month's WWDC developer powwow. If Amazon's trying to steal Apple's thunder before it even gets a chance to roar it's doing a pretty good job. Image source: Amazon.com. Echo chamber  Echo Show is everything that the $199 Echo Look that Amazon unveiled last month is not. Echo Look -- the as yet unreleased digital assistant -- is a vanity project. Budding fashionistas will be able to use Echo Look to take snapshots of donned outfits from all angles to generate lookbooks or to smoke out a second opinion.  The appeal for Echo Look will be limited, but Echo Show is gunning for the masses. Like most Amazon products it's priced aggressively, something that Apple's device -- if it does ever see the light of day -- is not likely to be. Alphabet has the early lead among the three tech giants when it comes to the connected home through its Nest acquisition, but Amazon takes the cake in fleshing out its arsenal of digitial assistants. Starting to take pre-orders for Echo Show and email requests for Echo Look are smart moves by Amazon, locking consumers ahead of WWDC when Apple may throw its hat into the ring.  Amazon's offering $100 off the device if you buy two of them, another brilliant way to hook families with a device that can keep folks connected via video calls. Amazon widening its product line will give Apple fewer spaces to innovate in this niche, and that's going to make the class act of Cupertino too late and likely too profit-driven to stand out in this booming niche later this year.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Although the app was redesigned last year in iOS 10, concerns were then raised around the oversized nature of Apple Music's new typography and artwork. This week visual design student Jason Yuan, who studies at Northwestern University, has shared a new project that he's been working on the past few months, which was sparked when Apple rejected him for a graphic design internship at Apple Music. Yuan decided to take Apple's rejection, which referenced wanting to see "more growth and training," and turn it into a new passion project focused on a visual overhaul of Apple Music (via The Next Web). He said his redesign provides a few "potential solutions" to the service's problems. At first, I was frustrated — Northwestern University doesn’t offer any sort of undergraduate graphic design program, so whatever growth they were looking for would have to be self taught … but as soon as I came to this realization, I became inspired to embark on what became a a three-month long journey to the holy grail — the iOS app that Apple Music deserves. For me, this was an opportunity to really dig my teeth into UX research and design, an excuse to spend way too much time on Sketch and Principle, a reason to bore everyone around me with my notebook of crudely drawn wireframes … My process was guided by qualitative user research, Apple’s official Design Principles, and my own designer intuition. One of Yuan's first ideas is called "The Sampler," which he pitches as a replacement to "My New Music Mix." The Sampler would be for users "reluctant to sit through an entire playlist full of new music," and would present Apple Music subscribers with samples of songs in a Tinder-like UI that they could swipe up to reject or swipe down to add to their library. These samples would last around 15 seconds and present highlights from the songs in question so users would immediately know if they like the music or not. Any music that is swiped down upon is then saved to Yuan's equivalent of the My New Music Mix, taking out the automatic curation of content currently in place and making it more personalized in Yuan's design. Yuan said that The Sampler was inspired by the idea of gamification, which he argued would allow the user to create "an immediate connection to the music they discover," instead of just taking a shot at what Apple Music serves up to them now. The visual designer also came up with more cohesive branding in Apple Music's album and playlist artwork, which he argued is currently "kind of all over the place," with a mix of collages, 3D typography, and more for various radio stations and activity playlists. To fix this, Yuan focused on the circular bubble art that Apple Music subscribers encounter when signing up for the service -- which also references the iPod click wheel and iPhone contacts -- while subtly altering colors and profile shots for the artist and playlist in question. Yuan went on to address the basic UI complaints currently leveled at Apple Music, reducing the font size and white space of the app's launch tab while also introducing a new "Watch" tab for the service's upcoming slate of TV shows. He eliminated what he argued as extraneous UI additions, like the "Downloaded Music" front page menu option, and personalized For You so it introduces music based on location, time, and even recent social media activity. The current Apple Music (left) compared with Yuan's redesign (right) Connect is gone for good in Yuan's design as well. Truth is, I didn’t see any data from my research that would justify keeping the Connect feed in the app as is. Users were more interested in connecting with friends and family through music (a la Spotify) instead of with artists through a watered-down Twitter. I think Apple should focus on integrating existing social media with Apple Music instead of trying to push yet another one on its already overburdened consumers. There are plenty of other highlights from Yuan's list of redesign ideas, including tweaks to Now Playing, Browse, Search, and how users love or dislike a song. Yuan ended his article saying he's happy with the knowledge he gained and progress he made redesigning Apple Music as a personal project, but never intended the tweaks to be taken seriously by Apple. "I don’t expect the good folks at Apple Music to take anything from this case study," Yuan mentioned. "In fact, I might actually have a heart attack if anyone working on Apple Music stumbles upon this article… but if you’re out there, I hope my work was able to give you some ideas and spark some conversations!" Check out the rest of Yuan's Apple Music changes in his Medium post right here.

News Reviews Features Guides App Store Update Raises Pokemon GO Prices By Jasmine Henry | 18 hours ago  An update to the Apple App Store has led to a rise in Pokemon GO prices. The hugely popular free to play game has already made bank from its microtransactions, with Pokemon GO becoming the fastest game to make $1 billion. Apple recently rolled out an update to its mobile marketplace, slightly increasing prices in several countries around the world. The price increase effects Denmark, countries in the Eurozone (European countries that use the Euro), and Mexico, while iOS users in Taiwan are dinged with a 5% VAT rate. Apple explains that the change, which would raise a €0.99 app or microtransaction to €1.09 in France, Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovakia, is a result of “foreign exchange rate changes” and confirms that auto-renewable subscriptions “will not be affected.” The change has already had an effect on Pokemon GO prices, as it’s estimated that microtransactions now cost 10% more for players in the affected countries and it’s also believed that Android prices have been increased to reflect the iOS changes. A €10 coin pack, for example, now costs €10.99, meaning that buying a €10 gift card is less valuable for Pokemon GO players. Understandably, Pokemon GO players are frustrated with the changes and argue that microtransactions in the game are already high as it is. While this price increase isn’t quite as dramatic as the one that affected UK iOS users in January, when Apple increased prices by 25% as a result of Brexit, some say that it’s unfair that they are being punished just for their location and the currency their country has chosen to use. Some will also question what this means for Pokemon GO – and other mobile games – going forward. Pokemon GO‘s daily player numbers have already been declining, despite developer Niantic’s best efforts, but now even dedicated players who have forked out for those microtransactions may feel that the game isn’t worth playing any more. It may also be said that the ball is in Niantic’s court now and that it is up to the developer to respond to the App Store changes. Yes, players have to pay more when they buy microtransactions but if the developer introduces things that make spending extra worth it, such as the much-awaited Pokemon GO Gym update, then things could even out. Pokemon GO is available for iOS and Android.

The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against US tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook. European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet and Deezer have complained that online platforms - such as search engines and app stores - abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on iOS. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms 'key gatekeepers' deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives - such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies - and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54.4 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a "good Samaritan" principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localisation rules hamper technological innovation.   Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous SoftBank logs second-best annual profit, talks up T-Mobile deal potential Next China's factory prices slow further as manufacturing, commodities cool Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The iPhone 7 was the world's best-selling smartphone during the first quarter, Strategy Analytics said Wednesday. The research firm said it estimates Apple shipped 21.5 million iPhone 7 units during the quarter, giving the device a 6 percent share of the entire smartphone market. "The iPhone 7 is by far the world's most popular smartphone model, due to a compelling blend of user-friendly design, extensive supporting apps, and widespread retail availability for the device," senior analyst Juha Winter said. The iPhone 7 Plus was the second most popular phone, with 17.4 million units sold. Following the release of Apple's fiscal Q2 earnings, CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone 7 Plus was in such high demand that Apple had a hard time building enough units. That suggests the phone might have been able to outsell the iPhone 7 had enough units been available. The third most popular smartphone was Chinese firm Oppo's R9s — which sold 8.9 million units — followed by the Samsung Galaxy J3 (6.1 million units) and Samsung's Galaxy J5 (5 million units.) "Samsung was still gearing up for the launch of its new Galaxy S8 portfolio, but managed to get two models in the top five during Q1 2017," Strategy Analytics director Linda Sui said, noting the Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J3 helped "offset Samsung's troubles with the Note 7 battery fiasco."

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Design student imagines simplified navigation and gamified experience for Apple Music Christian Zibreg on May 10, 2017 0 After he got turned down for a dream internship at Apple, Northwestern University design student Jason Yuan took matters into his own hands, deciding to teach Apple a thing or two about good user interface design. The result of his endeavor: beautiful mockups of a completely overhauled user interface for Apple Music. Yuan explains in a post on Medium that the current Apple Music design is not well-suited for people without massive music libraries who prefer to listen to curated playlists. On creating the mockups: At first, I was frustrated — Northwestern University doesn’t offer any sort of undergraduate graphic design program, so whatever growth they were looking for would have to be self taught. But as soon as I came to this realization, I became inspired to embark on what became a a three-month long journey to the holy grail — the iOS app that Apple Music deserves. For me, this was an opportunity to really dig my teeth into UX research and design, an excuse to spend way too much time on Sketch and Principle, a reason to bore everyone around me with my notebook of crudely drawn wireframes. He says his Apple Music redesign effort was informed by qualitative user research, Apple’s official Design Principles and his own designer intuition. He imagined what a video-centric experience on Apple Music could look like. As you know, the Cupertino firm is gearing up to launch its first original shows on the service. According to Yuan, videos would be served via a new Watch tab, with a Daily Stream feature pushing exclusive video content to Apple Music members based on their preferences. Apple is also underestimating the power of gamification, the student said. “I have come to understand that, through a gamified experience, the user is able to establish an immediate connection to the music they discover,” he added. His proposed My Sampler feature would replace the current New Music Mix playlists. Here’s an excerpt from Yuan’s post: It was born out of the understanding that users who are picky about what goes into their library would also be more reluctant to sit through an entire playlist full of new music. A better experience would be presenting snippets—or samples—of curations that gives the user just enough information to decide whether or not to add it into their library and weekly playlist. Upon entering a Sampler section, the user would be presented with a series of artist headshots that corresponded to a curated song. After tapping and holding, the system would play a 15-second preview of each song from the album. The user could swipe up to reject the song or swipe down to add it to their library. Once the user has finished sampling, their selections could be used by the system to create a New Music Mix that the user can listen to. “I chose to use gestural interaction so that users can use the Sampler even if they’re not looking at the screen,” he writes. In Yuan’s view, Apple should focus on integrating existing social media with Apple Music instead of trying to push yet another one on its already overburdened consumers. “Truth is, I didn’t see any data from my research that would justify keeping the Connect feed in the app as is,” he said. “Users were more interested in connecting with friends and family through music (a la Spotify) instead of with artists through a watered-down Twitter.” After making it through the first seed, Yuan was selected for an interview with Apple. Unfortunately, they turned him down. Though his work was OK, Apple told him it preferred candidates with more growth and training. Yuan eventually completed his internship at Sony Music, where he learned that a brand’s visual presence in a streaming service “must be recognizable yet invisible at the same time.” Be sure to check out Yuan’s post on Medium for additional mockups and his thoughts on how Apple Music could be rethought from a user experience standpoint, including an enhanced For You section and more.

By Hadlee Simons on 10 May, 2017 The smartphone industry has seen a ton of high-profile launches already. We’ve had the LG G6, Samsung Galaxy S8, the Huawei P10 and a host of other devices launch globally and/or in South Africa. The year isn’t over yet though, and there are quite a few more announced/unannounced smartphones set to launch as well. We take a look at some of the obvious and not so obvious devices… Apple It’s inevitable that Apple will launch a new iPhone in September or October, having done so for the past four or five years at the very least (the iPhone SE was the most recent exception). The latest rumours claim that Apple is working on three 2017 iPhones, in the form of the standard and plus-sized iPhones and an iPhone with an OLED screen. Expect the OLED screen to offer deeper blacks and vivid colours, obviously. Apparently, the reason for only having one OLED-equipped iPhone is because demand is so high. It makes sense though, given recent reports in the industry… Google We apparently know the codenames for Google’s new smartphones, being called Muskie and Walleye. Expect them to feature Snapdragon 835 chips (following the long tradition of using Qualcomm flagship silicon) and to come in standard and XL-sized variants. However, the latest leak claims that a third Google device is in the works, with the codename Taimen. It’s unclear if this is a smartphone or tablet, but the codename does follow Google’s tradition of naming its phones/tablets after fish. HTC The Taiwanese firm doesn’t have a local presence, with its last few devices being the HTC One M9 and the HTC One A9. But what should you expect for the rest of the year anyway? The HTC U11 has been leaked already, being almost identical to the earlier HTC U Ultra, down to the absent headphone jack, comprehensive audio recording capabilities and 3000mAh battery. However, the biggest change is expected to be the addition of squeezable edges, apparently used for quickly activating functions or navigating through menus. The U11 is also slated to come with a Snapdragon 835 processor, besting the Snapdragon 821 in the U Ultra. Here’s hoping we see an HTC smartphone with an audio jack… Huawei The P10 and P10 Plus launch event takes place today (10 May), but you just know that the Chinese brand is hard at work on the Mate 10. The company’s Mate phablets are usually released in China at the tail-end of the year, as evident by the Mate 8 and Mate 9. And if it follows this schedule, we can expect new silicon in these chips as well. Last year saw Huawei drastically improve matters with the Kirin 960 chip, featuring 4K recording, A73 cores and a heavy-lifting Mali G71 MP8 GPU. We’re not sure what to expect with the Mate 10 then (will it be the Kirin 970 name?), but you can bet your bottom dollar that the P10’s Portrait Mode will be present. If the Mate 10 does indeed get revealed at the end of the year, expect the handset to launch in South Africa in Q1 2018. The Huawei Nova 2 is apparently another device set for release by the firm this year, Android Authority reports, with the first-gen devices launched late last year. Details are unclear at this stage, but the TENAA filing shows a dual-camera setup. LG We really liked the LG G6 (review), being an admirable return to form for the Korean company. But the firm is almost certainly preparing another device in its V-series for the second half of the year. After all, the V10 launched a few months after the G4, and the V20 was revealed a few months after the G5. The phone, which we assume will be called the V30, will apparently pack two front cameras and a secondary ticker display, according to a user on Slash Leaks. Meanwhile, The Investor claims that LG Display will supply curved AMOLED screens to LG Mobile for the next V-series handset. As for tentative specs? We’re expecting a similar dual-camera arrangement (normal and wide) and a move to the Snapdragon 835 chip. Here’s hoping we get it in South Africa. Nokia/HMD We saw the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 being revealed at MWC 2017 (well, the Nokia 6 was originally announced earlier this year), being budget devices with mostly pure Android. Then there was the 3310, effectively being an overpriced feature phone riding on the 3310 name. We know that HMD is planning to launch in South Africa, but we’ve got no idea of a release or pricing window just yet. Nor do we know for sure which devices will be coming to South Africa. Then there’s the heavily rumoured Nokia 8, apparently being the flagship device for 2017. We don’t know much about this, but fan sites are hoping for extremely capable cameras and a Snapdragon 835 processor. HMD will have an uphill battle for the former though, owing to the issue of camera patents. OnePlus The cult favourite Android brand has already confirmed to another website and to us that the OnePlus 5 is coming. But is the phone shaping up to be a hit? Two online retailers have uploaded listings of the phone, but it’s not clear whether the specs are legit or not. In any event, the retailers show the phone as having a 4000mAh battery, Snapdragon 835 chip, a ridiculous 8GB of RAM and a 5.5-inch 1440p display. I would like to see a refreshed OnePlus X though, with the mid-range OnePlus being released back in 2015. Samsung The Galaxy S8 is one of the best smartphones released in 2017 thus far, aside from our annoyance with the fingerprint scanner, but you just know that the Note 8 is set for release later this year. In fact, Samsung confirmed in the wake of the Note 7 scandal that it was indeed working on the Note 8. Expect the S8’s iris-scanner, dual-curved display and Exynos 8895 chip to land in the Note 8. And expect a stylus too, obviously. Xiaomi The Mi 6 will hopefully make its way to South Africa, courtesy of MIA Group, but what else should we expect from the popular Chinese company? Well, the Mi Mix was incredibly innovative, so we wouldn’t be surprised to see a sequel launching, especially with recent reports claiming as such. Otherwise, the firm’s Mi Note phones will be due for an upgrade at the end of the year, so keep an eye on that lineup as well. Then again, the company is also known for constantly refreshing existing phones and slapping an “S” on the end.

Valentina Palladino - May 10, 2017 1:08 pm UTC Enlarge Beddit reader comments 37 Share this story Apple may be looking to integrate own sleep-tracking features to its product lineup sooner rather than later. According to a report by CNBC, Apple acquired the sleep tracking company Beddit. Beddit's website confirms the acquisition on its Privacy Policy page, which was last edited May 8, 2017: "Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy." No financial details of the acquisition have been made public yet. Beddit makes both sleep-tracking hardware and software and already has an existing Apple Watch app that works with its Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor. The device is a flat strip of fabric with sensors inside that sits atop your mattress, and under you, while you sleep. Using a variety of sensors including those for motion, humidity, and temperature, the Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor tracks sleep time and quality, heart rate, breathing patterns, deep and light sleep times, sleep efficiency, and more. Both its iOS and Apple Watch app connect to the monitor, so they currently don't track sleep independently from Beddit's hardware. Beddit's iOS app. Beddit Further ReadingReview: The still optional but pleasantly refined Apple Watch Series 2 Apple stores started carrying Beddit devices in late 2015, and the Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor is still available on Apple's store website. It doesn't appear Beddit will stop making its sleep monitor any time soon, but its fate will likely depend on Apple's sleep-tracking strategy going forward. It's unlikely that Apple would create a sleep-tracking mattress or anything similar to Beddit's sleep monitor, but the company probably wants to experiment with Beddit's sleep-tracking methods to develop its own sleep-tracking features for the Apple Watch. In the Apple Watch's short life, sleep tracking hasn't been on the top of Apple's to-do list. When the Apple Watch Series 2 came out last year, it didn't feature any new, native sleep tracking features as Apple focused on making the device waterproof, adding built-in GPS, and improving its battery life. Users who want to track sleep still have to rely on third-party sleep tracking apps, and those are only truly useful on the Series 2 watch thanks to the extended battery life (the original Apple Watch's battery would struggle to survive all day and all night). Apple will likely add some kind of sleep-tracking feature to the Apple Watch at some point because most other devices offer that as a standard feature.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Kantar Worldpanel: Smartphone Market Growth in India Grabs Worldwide Attention Expanding 4G Services Stimulate Domestic Sales, Global Manufacturers Increase Investments in Local Presence NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwired – May 10, 2017) – New data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech shows that smartphone vendors are reacting to saturated markets in the West by turning more aggressively to developing regions as sources of new revenue. Across the US, China, and EU5, smartphone sales have surpassed 90% of the potential market. Even in Latin America — specifically Brazil and Mexico, smartphone sales also exceed 80%. „With a population of 1.3 billion people and the second-largest mobile market after China, India is the next major focal point for smartphone vendors. In the first quarter of 2017, smartphone penetration in India reached 48%, a growth rate of 16% from the prior year,” said Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. „Rapidly expanding 4G infrastructure and low-cost 4G data services introduced by India telecom leader Reliance Jio have led to increased competition in India and stimulated higher demand for 4G-capable devices. The push towards digital currency, which promotes a potent new use case for smartphones, is also expected to accelerate sales.” Chinese vendors have increased their smartphone sales share in India from 27% in Q1 2016 to 50% in Q1 2017. Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and Lenovo have made significant investments in India in an effort to disrupt the local vendors, and out-maneuver South Korean giant Samsung, which continues to rank as the largest smartphone supplier in India with 27% of smartphone sales in Q1 2017. This is a dip from 30% in the same period a year earlier. Xiaomi and BBK (Vivo) are currently tied for second place in India at 12% of sales each, followed by Lenovo (including Moto) at 11%, and Oppo at 10%. Local brands Micromax, Intex, Lyf, and others have captured 12% of India smartphone sales. Apple accounted for three percent of sales in the most recent period but has made several strategic moves in India, including teaming up with Reliance Jio to offer free 4G service for one year to purchasers of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is also planning to manufacture iPhones in India in the near future to deflect some of the high import taxes that make iPhones inaccessible to many Indian buyers. Over the next 12 months, 51% of current mobile phone owners in India say they intend to upgrade their devices. For current smartphone owners, that number is 52%. Samsung is the top brand preferred in India at 26%, followed by Apple at 15%. Between 7% and 8% of consumers intend to purchase Vivo or Oppo products. „Purchases over $300 remain a small fraction of the market, but this is where Apple and Samsung dominate,” Guenveur added. „For Apple and Samsung, opportunities in India may not be immediate, but over the next few years we believe that consumers will become more engaged in services, 4G infrastructure will be stronger, and by all predictions — people will want more premium phones.” Global OS Data The latest data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech also reveals that in Q1 2017 and despite an Apple earnings report that did not meet Wall Street’s expectations for iPhone sales, the company continued to make year-on-year share gains across most markets except urban China. „The first quarter of 2017 produced the lowest iOS share in China since the second quarter of 2014 with 12.4 percent of smartphone sales. Android continued to make year-on-year gains with 87.2 percent of smartphone sales,” Guenveur explained. „For iOS, this represents a 9.1 percentage point drop from the first quarter of 2016. At the same time, iPhone 7 remained the best-selling device in urban China with 3.8 percent of a market that has become increasingly fragmented.” The greatest increase for Apple came in Great Britain, with 40.4 percent of smartphone sales, an increase of 5.6 percentage points, and in the US, with 38.9 percent of smartphone sales, an increase of 5.2 percentage points year-over-year.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Strategy Analytics: Apple iPhone 7 Was World’s Best-Selling Smartphone Model in Q1 2017 BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–According to the latest research from Strategy Analytics, Apple iPhone 7 was the world’s best-selling smartphone model in the first quarter of 2017. OPPO R9s was the star performer, shipping 9 million units globally and becoming the world’s third most popular smartphone model. Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global smartphone shipments reached a robust 353.3 million units in Q1 2017. The top-five most popular models together accounted for 1 in 6 of all smartphones shipped worldwide during the quarter.” Juha Winter, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics, added, “We estimate Apple iPhone 7 shipped 21.5 million units and captured 6 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. The iPhone 7 is by far the world’s most popular smartphone model, due to a compelling blend of user-friendly design, extensive supporting apps, and widespread retail availability for the device. Apple iPhone 7 Plus, with its bigger screen and higher pricing, shipped 17.4 million units for second place and 5 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. Apple today accounts for two of the world’s top five smartphone models.” Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “OPPO R9s shipped 8.9 million units for third place and 3 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. OPPO is largely unknown in the Western world, but its brand is wildly popular in China and growing rapidly across India. The R9s is OPPO’s flagship 4G device with key features such as dual-SIM connectivity and fingerprint security.” Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Samsung was still gearing up for the launch of its new Galaxy S8 portfolio, but managed to get two models in the top five during Q1 2017. The Galaxy J3 captured 2 percent global smartphone marketshare and fourth place, while Galaxy J5 took 1 percent global share to become the world’s fifth most popular model. Samsung’s J3 and J5 are midrange devices that sell very well across Europe and Asia and they helped to offset Samsung’s troubles with the Note 7 battery fiasco in the quarter.”   Exhibit 1: Global Smartphone Shipments & Marketshare by Model in Q1 2017 1     Global Smartphone Shipments by Model (Millions of Units)       Q1 ’16       Q1 ’17 1.

Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0. In recent days, we’ve been reporting on a series of possible ethical issues concerning administrative patent judges (APJs) serving at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These issues first surfaced in an article published on this site on April 28th, when we noted that one APJ served on multiple panels issuing decisions in cases petitioned by Apple, a company which he had represented as defense counsel in patent infringement proceedings up to December 2012, a few months before being hired as an APJ at PTAB. On May 7th, we reported on another APJ and her prior representation of Apple before serving in review proceedings which were also petitioned by Apple. These reports could lead to reasonable concerns among patent owners — already quite skeptical of the PTAB — that they are not being given a fair shake during PTAB proceedings, especially when those proceedings have been petitioned by Apple or other tech giants. Given that those kinds of professional relationships between judges and former clients would ordinarily lead to recusals in Article III federal courts, patent owners have every reason to question whether PTAB judges should be allowed to decide cases brought by their former clients.   Of particular interest to patent owners facing challenges at PTAB will be the Counsel tab, which is found in the top margin after logging into Lex Machina. Clicking this tab will bring a user to a page with a pair of search query fields, one for law firms and the other for attorneys. The attorney search is what we’ve used to find data on the aforementioned conflicts of interest at PTAB. Patent owners can type the name of each APJ on the PTAB panel to see if any of those judges have previously worked as attorneys in cases at district court going back to the year 2000. At the landing page for each attorney, users can then click ‘District Court Cases’ appearing in the top margin underneath the attorney’s name. Scrolling down the page will bring users to a list of district court cases on which the attorney has worked. The title of each case is clickable, linking to a Parties & Counsel page which will show users each party involved in that specific case. Clicking the arrow appearing prior to each party will create a dropdown box which shows the name of each attorney representing that specific party in that case. Readers should be aware that not every case listed for an attorney will necessarily be a patent case, so we counsel caution rather than jumping to conclusions simply based on the search results. However, any patent owner who feels as though they’ve stumbled upon a potential conflict of interest should contact us and we will give the situation our full consideration.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Strategy Analytics: Apple iPhone 7 Was World’s Best-Selling Smartphone Model in Q1 2017 BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–According to the latest research from Strategy Analytics, Apple iPhone 7 was the world’s best-selling smartphone model in the first quarter of 2017. OPPO R9s was the star performer, shipping 9 million units globally and becoming the world’s third most popular smartphone model. Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global smartphone shipments reached a robust 353.3 million units in Q1 2017. The top-five most popular models together accounted for 1 in 6 of all smartphones shipped worldwide during the quarter.” Juha Winter, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics, added, “We estimate Apple iPhone 7 shipped 21.5 million units and captured 6 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. The iPhone 7 is by far the world’s most popular smartphone model, due to a compelling blend of user-friendly design, extensive supporting apps, and widespread retail availability for the device. Apple iPhone 7 Plus, with its bigger screen and higher pricing, shipped 17.4 million units for second place and 5 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. Apple today accounts for two of the world’s top five smartphone models.” Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “OPPO R9s shipped 8.9 million units for third place and 3 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. OPPO is largely unknown in the Western world, but its brand is wildly popular in China and growing rapidly across India. The R9s is OPPO’s flagship 4G device with key features such as dual-SIM connectivity and fingerprint security.” Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Samsung was still gearing up for the launch of its new Galaxy S8 portfolio, but managed to get two models in the top five during Q1 2017. The Galaxy J3 captured 2 percent global smartphone marketshare and fourth place, while Galaxy J5 took 1 percent global share to become the world’s fifth most popular model. Samsung’s J3 and J5 are midrange devices that sell very well across Europe and Asia and they helped to offset Samsung’s troubles with the Note 7 battery fiasco in the quarter.”   Exhibit 1: Global Smartphone Shipments & Marketshare by Model in Q1 2017 1     Global Smartphone Shipments by Model (Millions of Units)       Q1 ’16       Q1 ’17 1.

The iPhone 7 is, meanwhile, is ranked at number 4 in some of the states. Samsung and OnePlus are the only brands, from the Android stack, that figure in the top 5, adds CyberMedia. Now that the iPhone 4S and 5C are out of the picture, the iPhone 5s is the cheapest iPhone available in the Indian market right now. The iPhone 5s will sell for as little as Rs 15,000 soon, says a report. It's not a value for money though especially when you consider the fact that it's almost 4 years old now. Ideally, one would have hoped that the iPhone SE would be Apple's most favored cheap iPhone, only it isn't. The iPhone SE is expensive. Apple is however looking to start locally manufacturing the iPhone SE in India in the days to come. Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones even as the Cupertino major seeks tax concessions from the Indian government to set up local production in the world's fastest growing major mobile market. The company will initially start by assembling 300,000 to 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India and the initial manufacturing of the model will not be dependent on any tax concession offerings from the government. Starting local assembly will help the company price its products more aggressively, with experts predicting that the price of an iPhone SE could go down by up to 10-12 per cent, should Apple make it in India. Moving on, "various versions of iPhone fill up the top 5 premium category smartphones in the states of Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, indicating that iPhone is not a metro affair only in India," says CyberMedia. Even though, iPhones are an expensive buy, people in India are actually buying a lot of these phones, if the CyberMedia survey is to be gone by. At the same time, while Samsung and OnePlus, remain top contenders in the Android space, "there has been growth in numbers from Oppo and Vivo as well."

The Pontardawe -born star, who shot to fame with 1968 UK number one single Those Were The Days, is auctioning off a collection of clothes she wore at the height of her fame, including designer stage dresses when she sang with the stars - and a rare Beatles poster from the cusp of the Fab Four’s superstardom. Mary Hopkin's green dress The poster is advertising the Beatles’ August 1963 gig at The Pier Pavilion in Llandudno , North Wales, and is expected to auction for £400 to £800.

The small concert in the north Welsh seaside town was priced at 4/6d, 6/6d and 8/6d, and was part of the Beatles’ tour of smaller venues around the UK. Poster advertising early Beatles gig in north Wales Auctioneer Ben Rogers Jones said: “It was right that the poster should be delivered to our auction rooms in Colwyn Bay, only three miles from the venue where The Beatles played that night. “My hope is that it will go to somebody local to the area who was at the gig but there’s sure to be huge interest from elsewhere as the market for Beatles memorabilia is colossal. “Original and rare items like these are collected around the globe. It could go anywhere but my fingers are crossed for a local collector or perhaps a hotel in the area to buy it.” Other items up for auction include a red frock which can be seen worn by Hopkin in a photograph with Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker.

Across the US, China, and EU5, smartphone sales have surpassed 90% of the potential market. Even in Latin America -- specifically Brazil and Mexico, smartphone sales also exceed 80%. "With a population of 1.3 billion people and the second-largest mobile market after China, India is the next major focal point for smartphone vendors. In the first quarter of 2017, smartphone penetration in India reached 48%, a growth rate of 16% from the prior year," said Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. "Rapidly expanding 4G infrastructure and low-cost 4G data services introduced by India telecom leader Reliance Jio have led to increased competition in India and stimulated higher demand for 4G-capable devices. The push towards digital currency, which promotes a potent new use case for smartphones, is also expected to accelerate sales." Chinese vendors have increased their smartphone sales share in India from 27% in Q1 2016 to 50% in Q1 2017. Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and Lenovo have made significant investments in India in an effort to disrupt the local vendors, and out-maneuver South Korean giant Samsung, which continues to rank as the largest smartphone supplier in India with 27% of smartphone sales in Q1 2017. This is a dip from 30% in the same period a year earlier. Xiaomi and BBK (Vivo) are currently tied for second place in India at 12% of sales each, followed by Lenovo (including Moto) at 11%, and Oppo at 10%. Local brands Micromax, Intex, Lyf, and others have captured 12% of India smartphone sales. Apple accounted for three percent of sales in the most recent period but has made several strategic moves in India, including teaming up with Reliance Jio to offer free 4G service for one year to purchasers of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is also planning to manufacture iPhones in India in the near future to deflect some of the high import taxes that make iPhones inaccessible to many Indian buyers. Over the next 12 months, 51% of current mobile phone owners in India say they intend to upgrade their devices. For current smartphone owners, that number is 52%. Samsung is the top brand preferred in India at 26%, followed by Apple at 15%. Between 7% and 8% of consumers intend to purchase Vivo or Oppo products. "Purchases over $300 remain a small fraction of the market, but this is where Apple and Samsung dominate," Guenveur added. "For Apple and Samsung, opportunities in India may not be immediate, but over the next few years we believe that consumers will become more engaged in services, 4G infrastructure will be stronger, and by all predictions -- people will want more premium phones." Global OS Data The latest data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech also reveals that in Q1 2017 and despite an Apple earnings report that did not meet Wall Street's expectations for iPhone sales, the company continued to make year-on-year share gains across most markets except urban China. "The first quarter of 2017 produced the lowest iOS share in China since the second quarter of 2014 with 12.4 percent of smartphone sales. Android continued to make year-on-year gains with 87.2 percent of smartphone sales," Guenveur explained. "For iOS, this represents a 9.1 percentage point drop from the first quarter of 2016. At the same time, iPhone 7 remained the best-selling device in urban China with 3.8 percent of a market that has become increasingly fragmented." The greatest increase for Apple came in Great Britain, with 40.4 percent of smartphone sales, an increase of 5.6 percentage points, and in the US, with 38.9 percent of smartphone sales, an increase of 5.2 percentage points year-over-year.

For current smartphone owners, that number is 52%. Samsung is the top brand preferred in India at 26%, followed by Apple at 15%. Between 7% and 8% of consumers intend to purchase Vivo or Oppo products.   All of this bodes well for Apple, especially if it can begin to manufacture iPhones in India in the coming months.   Purchases over $300 remain a small fraction of the market, but this is where Apple and Samsung dominate, as they do in more developed markets. For Apple and Samsung, growth opportunities in India may not be immediate, but over the next few years we believe that consumers will become more engaged in services, 4G infrastructure will be stronger, and by all predictions – people will want more premium phones."   Apple began their big push into India in 2016 with a major tour by Apple's CEO followed by a series of investments including a new Mac Lab, an App Accelerator facility, and an iPhone SE plant via Wistron. Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller just finished a tour of India. Apple is also in constant contact with the India Government on trying to set up larger plants in India that would require more cooperation to encourage Apple's supply chain from China to open facilities in India.   During Tim Cook's opening statement with financial analyst for Q2 2017 on May 03, he stated the following: "We set a new March quarter record for India where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large young and tech-savy population, fast growing econony and improving 4G infrastructure."   Without a doubt, growing their share in India is now a priority at Apple and we should hear more about their developments in that country over the next few years. It's still unclear if Apple's iPhone SE facility will be enough to gain license for a company owned Apple Store. Every time it looks like Apple's been given the green light, news from the government seems to dash that hope. There is strong opposition to giving Apple any consessions which leaves Apple's retail plans in limbo. The news of an Apple Store opening in India will be a positive development and hopefully we'll get to hear that news within the next year.   Kantar on iOS in China   In a secondary report, Kantar rehashes the news that while Apple's iPhone 7 was the best selling smartphone in China, it wasn't able to stop iOS from falling 8.6%, it's only weak market. Vendors like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and others can't compete with Apple at the high-end of the smartphone market. Apple's iPhone is a status symbol, it's a smartphone with rich software and services. So the Chinese vendors shoot for the mid-market that sells in the $400 to $500 range with specifications that Apple's iPhone SE doesn't offer like a 5 to 5.5" display. Apple is likely to address this weakness later this year.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

How to connect the Apple Cinema Display to the new MacBook Pro CalDigit USB-C Dock review: A full-featured USB-C dock with both DisplayPort... Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac Ross Mclauchlan writes in with a display problem: I recently purchased a MacBook Pro and have an Apple LED Cinema Display, and am perplexed that I can’t get the display to work. Ross is using an Apple Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter, but the trouble is the Apple LED Cinema Display models don’t use Thunderbolt 2. We’ve written about this before but it’s truly non-obvious, even when you’re paying close attention. Apple DisplayPort connector symbol (left); Thunderbolt 2 (right) The LED Cinema Display series relies on DisplayPort for both the physical connection and the logical one—the way in which video is encoded as data and sent across the physical wiring. The Mini-DisplayPort connector is identical to a Thunderbolt 2 in appearance, except for a tiny logo. The Mini-DisplayPort logo that appears on a cable jack and an adapter port looks like a monitor holding its hands up in surrender (a rectangle with a vertical line on either side). Thunderbolt 2 jacks and ports have a lightning bolt. (Ironically, Apple’s Lightning standard doesn’t use a lightning bolt.) Plugging a Mini-DisplayPort monitor’s jack into a Thunderbolt 2 port on a Mac or at the end of a chain of Thunderbolt 2 devices was supported through clever backwards compatibility that fails with Thunderbolt 3, including a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter. Instead, you need one of the adapters or docks I reviewed earlier this year. There are more options now and varied ones, so read product reviews carefully if you purchase one I didn’t test. And just to be more confusing, the Mini-DisplayPort converters I reviewed don’t output Thunderbolt 3. Rather, they send DisplayPort video signals over USB-C in a way that Thunderbolt 3 allows for with backwards compatibility. Those adapters can thus be used with a 12-inch MacBook, which primarily supports USB 3 and DisplayPort over the USB-C connector, as well as with 2016 MacBook Pro models, which support Thunderbolt 3, USB 3, and a host of other standards over USB-C. No, it’s not just you. It’s confusing to have a single connector style (USB-C or Mini-DisplayPort) with incompatible standards that work over it.

Mobile phone leaker @OnLeaks and tech blog @GearIndia posted a series of high-quality renders on Tuesday that claim to be based on leaked factory CAD images of Apple’s upcoming OLED iPhone. The images show Apple somehow imitating Samsung Galaxy S8 with the display. In fact, the images show a redesigned “iPhone 8” with edge-to-edge display. The renders are based on the expectation that the iPhone 8 will be 144mm tall, 71mm wide, and 77mm thick, making it slightly larger than an iPhone 7 but smaller than an iPhone 7 Plus, and slightly thicker than both. The pictures show the smooth front glass of the edge-to-edge OLED display, which is expected to lack any sort of button indentation in favour of an entirely virtual home button. The only visible features appear in a bezeled run-off area housing the microphone hole and a dual-lens front-facing camera, which is rumored to include 3D sensing capabilities, potentially for use in facial/iris recognition or future augmented reality functionality. On the back we can see the widely-rumored vertical orientation of another slightly protruding dual-lens camera, a change from the horizontal arrangement used on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Watch another iPhone 8 concept video here Apple is believed to be testing several prototypes for its redesigned “tenth anniversary” iPhone and rumors have kept consumers and enthusiasts guessing whether production is behind schedule or on course for a September launch, when it is expected to be announced alongside the so-called iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. more from tech Facebook says it found faster way to translate through artificial intelligence May 10, 2017 16:51 IST Apple acquires sleep-tracking hardware and software company Beddit May 10, 2017 16:18 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

But this week, Apple broke all its previous records to become the first company that is valued at $800 billion. Apple market valuation has seen tremendous increase in the past years, and this milestone achieved, the Silicon Valley company has become the first ever public trading company to achieve the $800 billion feat. Apple is certainly the most valuable company in the Silicon Valley, and now it has become even more valuable. The company saw all-time high prices of shares at $153.99, with a rise at 0.6 percent on Tuesday. As a record, this is a first for any giant company of the U.S. to reach this mark. The Cupertino company has almost 5.2 billion shares in market circulation. Interestingly, same time during last year, Apple reported a decline (year-over-year) in its quarterly revenue. This happened for the first time in thirteen years, according to the report on Entrepreneur. Even for its 2017 earnings report, the tech company reported lesser sales of Macs and iPads compared to 2016. The sales of Macs were down by 4 percent. On the other hand, the sales of iPads were down by 12 percent. Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone to the World a Decade Ago Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone exactly a decade ago, and this phone has become the number 1 device to drive majority of sales for the company. Apple’s iPhone 8 is also set to debut in this fall. Apple has seen a decline in sales and it is speculated if the company can top the sales charts with its iPhone again or with a new device all-together. Bloomberg reported that the shares of Apple Inc. have seen a rise at 33 percent since the start of 2017. The buy-back programme started by Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook has also helped his company progress at this rate. Moreover, Bloomberg notices that the rise of the mobile manufacturing companies in the recent years and the decline of oil industry, both aspects show the significance of the emerging mobile technology. Apple Market Valuation may Hit $1 Trillion Apple CEO, Tim Cook Even more, analyst Brian White at Drexel Hamilton estimates Apple’s 12-month price target at $202 per share. This shows a possibility that the Cupertino giant is on its way to hit the $1 trillion valuation mark very soon. Apple market valuation gaining the $1 trillion feat is maybe a few years down the line, but certainly not a small speculation. Even when the sales of iPhone units, iPads, and Macs saw a decline, Apple market valuation has shown signs of growth. CEO, Time Cook also aims to target higher-margin service markets like the iCloud and App Store; along with bringing new products like AirPod wireless headphones and Apple Watches to the market. We think that if Apple can manage touching the $800 billion mark even during a stagnant phase; then it will strongly move towards the $1 trillion mark once it sees the pink phase in sales again.

Across the US, China, and EU5, smartphone sales have surpassed 90% of the potential market. Even in Latin America -- specifically Brazil and Mexico, smartphone sales also exceed 80%. "With a population of 1.3 billion people and the second-largest mobile market after China, India is the next major focal point for smartphone vendors. In the first quarter of 2017, smartphone penetration in India reached 48%, a growth rate of 16% from the prior year," said Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. "Rapidly expanding 4G infrastructure and low-cost 4G data services introduced by India telecom leader Reliance Jio have led to increased competition in India and stimulated higher demand for 4G-capable devices. The push towards digital currency, which promotes a potent new use case for smartphones, is also expected to accelerate sales." Chinese vendors have increased their smartphone sales share in India from 27% in Q1 2016 to 50% in Q1 2017. Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and Lenovo have made significant investments in India in an effort to disrupt the local vendors, and out-maneuver South Korean giant Samsung, which continues to rank as the largest smartphone supplier in India with 27% of smartphone sales in Q1 2017. This is a dip from 30% in the same period a year earlier. Xiaomi and BBK (Vivo) are currently tied for second place in India at 12% of sales each, followed by Lenovo (including Moto) at 11%, and Oppo at 10%. Local brands Micromax, Intex, Lyf, and others have captured 12% of India smartphone sales. Apple accounted for three percent of sales in the most recent period but has made several strategic moves in India, including teaming up with Reliance Jio to offer free 4G service for one year to purchasers of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is also planning to manufacture iPhones in India in the near future to deflect some of the high import taxes that make iPhones inaccessible to many Indian buyers. Over the next 12 months, 51% of current mobile phone owners in India say they intend to upgrade their devices. For current smartphone owners, that number is 52%. Samsung is the top brand preferred in India at 26%, followed by Apple at 15%. Between 7% and 8% of consumers intend to purchase Vivo or Oppo products. "Purchases over $300 remain a small fraction of the market, but this is where Apple and Samsung dominate," Guenveur added. "For Apple and Samsung, opportunities in India may not be immediate, but over the next few years we believe that consumers will become more engaged in services, 4G infrastructure will be stronger, and by all predictions -- people will want more premium phones." Global OS Data The latest data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech also reveals that in Q1 2017 and despite an Apple earnings report that did not meet Wall Street's expectations for iPhone sales, the company continued to make year-on-year share gains across most markets except urban China. "The first quarter of 2017 produced the lowest iOS share in China since the second quarter of 2014 with 12.4 percent of smartphone sales. Android continued to make year-on-year gains with 87.2 percent of smartphone sales," Guenveur explained. "For iOS, this represents a 9.1 percentage point drop from the first quarter of 2016. At the same time, iPhone 7 remained the best-selling device in urban China with 3.8 percent of a market that has become increasingly fragmented." The greatest increase for Apple came in Great Britain, with 40.4 percent of smartphone sales, an increase of 5.6 percentage points, and in the US, with 38.9 percent of smartphone sales, an increase of 5.2 percentage points year-over-year.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Apple is totally serious about tracking your sleep Chris Smith @chris_writes May 10th, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet It’s no secret that Apple wants to improve the sleep-tracking abilities of its devices, with special emphasis on the Apple Watch smartwatch. Various reports and patents suggested in the past that Apple is interested in helping users improve their sleep by offering built-in sleep tracking features into its devices. And Apple finally made a move that further confirms that idea. The company quietly acquired a new company, one that deals in sleep. Don't Miss: This is how Samsung will stop the Galaxy Note7R from exploding. Called Beddit, the company offers a sleep tracking app and a piece of hardware that’s already available for sale in Apple retail stores. The Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor is a sensor strip that can be placed under a bedsheet to track your movements during sleep, and it retails for $149 at Apple. Image Source: Beddit Apple did not announce the purchase, but CNBC found an updated privacy policy on Beddit’s site that confirms Apple purchased the company. “Beddit has been acquired by Apple,” the note, dated May 8th, reads. “Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.” It’s unclear how much Apple paid for Beddit, and whether Apple will continue to make Beddit hardware in the future. The most logical move for Apple would be to integrate Beddit technology into watchOS and eliminate the need of a standalone tracker. On the other hand, the Watch does require frequent charging and many people choose to charge the wearable during the night. That means any sleep-tracking features that would require the user to actually wear the device while sleeping would not work.

Apple iPhone 8 has been in the rumour world for quite some time now and the latest image renders, courtesy of OnLeaks and MySmartPrice, reveals an edge to edge display along with a dual-camera setup at the back. Have a look at these image renders.       The volume rockers are located on the left side along with a fairly long power button on the right side indicating a possibility of fingerprint scanner being embedded on it. Else, there is no Home Button and the famous touch ID is nowhere to be seen on the rear panel as well. However, the rumours suggesting a fingerprint scanner placed inside the display can come out to be true as well.   At the back, we have the Apple logo along with a vertical dual-camera setup with LED flash placed between the two sensors. Apple is likely to include an AMOLED panel this time, but, the displaying being curved doesn’t seem to be an authentic take, right now. That said, none of these renders is meant to be taken as a final draft even though OnLeaks have done a pretty good job of throwing out such renders in the past. Apple have been experimenting a lot with the next iPhone and there is a possibility that this might just be a prototype, so hold your expectations just a bit.   Nevertheless, most of the recent rumours have specifically pointed on two features of the upcoming iPhone 8, one being an edge-to-edge display while the other one being a vertical dual-camera setup at the back.   Meanwhile, the availability can be an issue this time because a recent report from the famous newspaper Nikkei suggested that Apple is facing some issues with the display panels, wireless charging and PCBs which is why the next iPhone 8 launch might be pushed back to November or even December if things doesn’t go according to the plan. While the increment updates i.e. iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will follow the same trend of a possible fall launch.   On completing its 10 years of iPhone, Apple is surely planning something big this year and the upcoming iPhone 8 or whatever it is called, will have to special in every sense if it has to live up to the expectation.

It’s a vital purchase for Apple, which doesn’t have a sleep tracking function on its Watch yet, unlike rivals Fitbit or Jawbone. Beddit’s app already works with iPhones – but the two reviews on the Apple store are far from glowing. One disgruntled customer wrote: “Completely inaccurate and stopped working completely with iPhone 7. “Same problem as others. Inaccurate readings (saying I was getting less than two hours sleep a night), manufacturer never got back to me with my requests for help and refuses to connect to iPhone 7 at all.” Another added: “Worked well for a month, then deteriorated quickly. First it started saying things like it took me eight minutes to fall asleep and immediately after falling asleep I left my bed for an hour and a half. How does Beddit technology work? The technology is based upon a scientific principle known as ballistocardiography (BCG), a non-invasive technique for measuring the mechanical activity of the heart, lungs and other body functions.   Each time the heart beats, the acceleration of blood through the circulatory system generates a mechanical impulse that can be measured and analysed.   Throughout the night, Beddit tracks each individual heartbeat and respiration cycle, or breath.   Beddit’s advanced analysis and machine-learning algorithms adapt differently to each body type and provide detailed sleep data, according to its website. “To put this in perspective, I have a single bed and there isn’t a feasible way for me to sleep on it without being over the sensor! “Then it started saying that id snore 95 percent of the night one night and 0% the next, heart rate graph shows just one point for an entire eight hours of sleep.” Beddit costs £129.95 and already syncs up to the Apple Health app. Apple hasn’t confirmed whether there will be a branded sleep monitor coming to our beds anytime soon. But its known to absorb companies into their own brand, often using their technology to improve products they already have on the market.

In a post on Beddit‘s privacy policy page, the company also confirmed that it has been acquired and furthermore that user information “will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.” Terms of the acquisition are currently unavailable. Beddit had launched its products in Apple stores in late 2015. The Finland-based company was founded in 2007 and has received about $3.5 million in funding. Beddit’s latest product, the Beddit 3, is a thin strip of sensors that goes across a user’s bed, analyzing sleep-related data such as “sleep time and efficiency, heart rate, respiration, temperature, movement, snoring, room temperature, and room humidity,” according to a product description. The device retails for about $150 and is still up for sale on the Apple Store page. However, the customer service experience on Beddit’s site will remain as-is, reports claim. This means that current customers will be able to access its products and services support for the foreseeable future. more from tech Apple iPhone 8 leaked renders show Samsung Galaxy S8-like bezel-less display May 10, 2017 17:19 IST Facebook says it found faster way to translate through artificial intelligence May 10, 2017 16:51 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

Apple regularly keeps tight-lipped when it comes to the companies it snaps up with its vast resources but, every so often, sources within the company reveal some new developments. According to MacRumors, its latest buy is Finnish company Beddit, which sells sleep-monitoring equipment designed to be used with an app on iPhones. The company’s current product – the Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor – places a thin sensor along the top of the user’s mattress and, throughout the night, it will gather information on various patterns, such as your sleep quality and how long it takes you to fall asleep. This includes the ability to read detailed health data such as a person’s heart rate, snoring, movement and the temperature of the room. The following morning, the app will tell the user how their sleep was, offering advice on how to improve their slumber and take up better habits. Founded in 2007, Beddit has received approximately $3.5m in funding. In 2015, it signed a deal with Apple to start selling its monitor directly through Apple stores. Will start using data In a brief statement, Beddit confirmed it had been acquired by Apple, informing customers that their personal data will be “collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple privacy policy”. For Apple, acquiring the sleep-monitoring company will give it greater scope within its ever-expanding plans to gather health data for iPhone users using its Health app. So far – aside from the iPhone itself – the Apple Watch has been one of the largest sources of data for the service, allowing users to access information and check the number of steps they have taken in a day, for example. Apple’s last known acquisition was Israeli start-up RealFace, a biometric facial-recognition security company using technology to allow users sign in to their phone with an image of their face.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Apple Buys Beddit Sleep Tracking Company Posted: May 10 2017, 5:06am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in News | Apple     There is no word on how much Apple spent at this time Apple has spent some of its legendary cash reserves to buy a Finnish company called Beddit. This company first showed up at CES several years back and builds sleep tracking hardware that works with the iPhone and Apple Watch. The Verge reports that the purchase has been confirmed by Beddit posting a note on its website confirming the acquisition and confirming that consumer data recorded by its device is subject to Apple's privacy policy. Don't Miss: This is How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock The Beddit hardware that is available now is a $149 Beddit 3 Sleep monitor that is sold in the Apple Store. It's a strip of material that has sensors inside slide under the sheets of your bed. The tracking strip then tracks your movement at night using something called Ballistocardiography. The big benefit to this tech and the product Beddit designed is that the Beddit 3 Sleep monitor does not require people to wear a device on their wrist to track sleep habits. Rumors have swirled that Apple has plans for adding sleep tracking to the Apple Watch. Since the Apple Watch has to be charged at night it has offered no sleep tracking capability to this point. The mystery that remains with this deal is what exactly Apple plans to do with the acquisition. The sleep tracking hardware Beddit makes might be something of a stop gap to make up for the lack of sleep tracking that Apple has in the Watch. This might also not be at all about the Beddit hardware and only about wiring up some or all of Beddit's engineers. Buying a company is often about nothign other than hiring talent.

Tech Search Search WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: May 11 SnapchatSnapchat CEO Evan Spiegel Trolls Mark Zuckerberg on Snap Earnings Call CompaniesChinese Tech Companies Struggling to Seal Deals in U.S. Find a Warmer Welcome in Israel NAFTAMexico Presses Trump to Uphold NAFTA for the Good of Both Nations Best Companies EU Will Review Trading Practices by Tech Giants Like Apple and Google Reuters May 10, 2017 The European Union executive is planning a law to deal with complaints about unfair trading practices by leading online players such as Apple and Google. The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple, and Facebook. European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet, and Deezer have complained that online platforms—such as search engines and app stores—abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on iOS. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon (amzn), Apple (aapl), Google (googl), and Facebook (fb), said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms ‘key gatekeepers’ deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives—such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies—and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54.4 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a "good Samaritan" principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localization rules hamper technological innovation.

Cloud music storage services can help – and there’s a lot out there. Here are some of the best cloud storage solutions for your songs: Don’t worry, they’re all free to use, too!   1. Google Play Out of the major brands, Google Play offers one of the most versatile free cloud storage for music. With Google Play you can upload up to 50,000 songs from your computer to the Play cloud servers – and that includes music from other sources including iTunes. You do this through the Music Manager app that Google offers, which can successfully save your songs, playlists, and ratings. Then you can access that music through Google Play via any Android platform or the Web itself. You can download Google Play for free here   2. iCloud iCloud on its own is a fair free cloud music storage service for moving your music around. You may not be surprised to learn that it is limited to music that you buy from the iTunes Store, but within that framework iCloud is a solid service for transferring songs between your Apple devices (it also works for the newer Windows devices). The automatic syncing functions mean that you don’t have to worry your new music showing up on your iPhone or iPad once you buy it. However, the true music storage service of Apple’s is iTunes Match, which allows you to store music in the Apple cloud from any source and also ties into ad-free iTunes Radio. Unfortunately, there’s no free options here (yet), you’ll have to pay a couple bucks a month to use it. You can learn how to set up iCloud here   3. Amazon Cloud Player Amazon Cloud Player is a somewhat less useful cloud storage option, not because of its lack of features but because the best features are available when you upgrade to Premium, which of course costs money. However, the basic service still allows you more than a couple hundred free uploads worth of free storage, and is dedicated to music with a focus on Amazon Music services. However, there are Cloud Player apps available across the major platforms with plenty of flexible curation options, so you still retain a lot of control…providing you like Amazon services in the first place, of course. You can download Amazon Cloud Player here   4. Synology Audio Station Synology’s cloud storage offering is a little…different. First, the service and its associated programs are definitely free, and they offer unlimited micromanagement of your songs in what is one of the best cloud music storage options available. The downside is that they are only available through a Synology server device, which you already need to have (or at least have access to). But if the conditions are right, you probably won’t find better customization options around after installing the various DiskStation Manager and Audio station programs. There are options to download music for iTunes, etc., but as the tutorials show Synology is typically used in a Windows environment. You can learn more about downloading Synology Audio Station here   5. StreamNation StreamNation is a relatively recent addition the media storage service world, and it has some of the best cloud storage for music around. The app offers one-click imports of music libraries like iTunes, and allows to stream to any other device you want. It can then use music to recommend new songs in the genres that you like or show you what your friends are listening to. The interface also impresses with its flowing, album covered-based design. There are several different plans to choose from, but the free version gives you 20GB of data, not too shabby at all. You can get started with the StreamNation service here   6. My Music Cloud My Music Cloud is a simpler service than many on the list, but that simplicity is part of its charm. Like StreamNation, the service offers one-click importing from iTunes, Dropbox, etc., but there’s much more of a focus on streaming services (plus some capabilities to listen offline). Like Spotify and other apps, My Music Cloud can learn your preferences by seeing what music you play and suggest similar artists or remind you of uploaded songs that you haven’t listened to in a while yet. Storage, however, is a little limited with the free version offering 250 tracks max. You can download My Music Cloud here Tweet It Like It Google + Linkedin Pin it Stumble Tyler Lacoma When he isn't enjoying the beautiful Northwest outdoors, you can find Tyler on business and tech sites, writing about the latest news, analyzing trends, and generally making the Internet a more interesting place.

I also keep on LOOP all my FLAC music files. Reply Rhiannon on I would not recommend My Music Cloud. I wanted it to play my Itunes playlists through my TV. I paid for it on Saturday – today is Tuesday and it has only downloaded 600 songs never mind my playlists. Complete waste of money, DO NOT be a sucker like me and pay the £29.99 for it Reply Kimberly on Do you have a recommendation for a service that would take my CD collection, rip it, and allow me to stream it? Murphie seems to be the only one I’ve found. Does it have competitors? Reply Yulia on Try Vox music player! Loop for Vox has unlimited cloud storage and Vox plays your music in lossless Reply Evan Glenn Potter on Excellent list- but what about MyMusi.cc?- its a great music storage site with no upload or playback limits. It’s what me and all my friends use Reply Bob Dylan on Tyler, Great list but you should should definitely include myMusi.cc among the top contenders. I have 3tb stored for free and they have great playback interfaces on my laptop and iphone.

However for some customers, this can be a hassle as not everyone stays near an Apple Store. However that will change in the future thanks to an update to the Apple Support app. In the update to the app, Apple will now allow users to schedule repairs with authorized service providers, who are basically third-party repair shops that have been authorized by Apple to make repairs on their devices. Prior to this scheduling with authorized service providers wasn’t possible, but the update to the app will now let users do just that. What this means is that if you stay near to an authorized service provider you can schedule an appointment with them instead of going to an Apple Store. It can also act as an alternative for users who are in a rush to get something repaired by the Apple Stores are too busy to slot you in. This change to the Apple Support app brings it in line with the web version which has already allowed this scheduling feature, but if you use the app more often then no doubt this will come in the handy for the future.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 10, 2017 6:21 pm The annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is set to take place June 5 through 9 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. Apple has sent out press invites for next month’s big event. The annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is set to take place from June 5 through 9 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. Apple will begin the five-day conference, at 10 am local time (10:30 pm IST). The Cupertino-based giant typically holds a keynote on the first day of the annual developers’ conference to introduce where updates to the iOS ecosystem are announced. Apple is widely expected to announce new versions of iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS platforms. While WWDC is traditionally a software-focused event, there’s growing speculation around the debut of Apple’s Siri-powered speaker. Apple could also use the platform to announce the updated version of the iPad Pro 12.9, which was originally launched in September 2015. The official WWDC invite to developers said, “Technology alone is not enough. Technology must intersect with the liberal arts and the humanities, to create new ideas and experiences that push society forward. This summer we bring together thousands of brilliant minds representing many diverse perspectives, passions, and talents to help us change the world“. This year’s conference will take place in San Jose, a location closer to Apple’s campus. Last year, Apple hosted its annual developers’ conference at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Tickets, which were priced at $1,599, were distributed by random selection at the end of March. Apple expects to host over 5,000 developers at this year’s conference. Apple will live stream the event on the company’s official site as well as on the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad and iPad TV. Naturally, we’ll be bringing live coverage on Indianexpress.com of all the announcements.

In March, Apple replaced the iOS 10.3 update with iOS 10.3.1. The iOS 10.3.1 update delivers bug fixes and an important security patch but its also brought some annoying problems to many iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners. iOS 10.3.1 problems emerged on release day and complaints about the update’s performance have grown louder as we’ve moved into May. With those complaints in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about these iOS 10.3.1 problems. This roundup takes a look at the current state of problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It looks at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users are running into a number of frustrating iOS 10.3.1 problems. The list includes the usual suspects. iOS 10.3.1 users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID problems, 3D Touch issues, Hey Siri problems, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. We’re also hearing about UI lag on older devices, random reboots, issues with sound, and various problems with the App Store including broken downloads. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter continue to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 Sensing that iOS 10.3.1 may have introduced a few Bluetooth reliability issues. Anyone else? — Michael Firth (@TechFirth) April 10, 2017 iOS 10.3.1 is reallly bad on battery… — Mathieu L. (@mletourn) April 18, 2017 ios 10.3.1 destroys my battery life — Erzy Pratama F (@erzypratama) April 14, 2017 Is it just me or in iOS 10.3.1 bluetooth audio is flawed? The sound is interrupted briefly but it's ANNOYING! — Claudio Coletta (@ClarkColet) April 16, 2017 thanks for not letting wifi work ios 10.3.1 🙃 @AppleSupport — ✨ s t a r i o s a ✨™ (@dcheungsta) April 21, 2017 @AppleSupport Can't download any apps/updates from AppStore (iOS-Germany) on any device (wifi&cellular). (iOS 10.3.1) Known issues? — Jan Hambsch (@TeachHam) April 23, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. Where to Find Feedback As we push further away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into this ongoing iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also put together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update at the one month milestone. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5, and the iPad. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about the current version of iOS 10. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can’t Downgrade We’ve got some bad news for those of you dealing with iOS 10.3.1 problems. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1 which means you can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to improve your device’s performance. This is a permanent change and it means those of you who are experiencing iOS 10.3.1 problems are on your own. Apple’s next iOS update is probably a few weeks away. Those of you who haven’t made the move to iOS 10.3.1 yet should take note. Once you upgrade, there’s no going back to whatever version of iOS you’re on. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. It’ll help you prepare for next time. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. We’re currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 and we suspect an official release is close. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. You might even try the iOS 10.3.2 beta on your device. You can always drop back down to the iOS 10.3.1 update if you decide to install the beta on your phone. iOS 10.3.2 Release & Time: 5 Things to Expect & 4 Not To iOS 10.3.2 Release Date   1 / 9 Apple rarely announces iOS release dates ahead of time so its silence regarding the iOS 10.3.2 release date hasn't been surprising.  It's difficult to predict an exact release date but the beta and Apple's tendencies can help us narrow it down a bit for you.  Apple is currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 which means the company has released updates to beta testers. That's a lot for a small maintenance update like iOS 10.3.2 and it probably means we're getting close to the official roll out. The last maintenance update to go through a beta, iOS 10.2.1, saw four beta releases before it was released to the public.  Apple also tends to release new iOS software on Monday. This isn't guaranteed but the company's been pretty consistent with its iOS 10 updates.  At this point we'd be shocked if we made it out of May without a release. Look for iOS 10.3.2 to land on one of the remaining Mondays, May 15th or May 22nd. Monday May 29th is a national holiday in the United States and we don't expect Apple to release iOS 10.3.2 on Memorial Day.  We'd be very surprised if the iOS 10.3.2 beta stretched into June and the rumored arrival of iOS 11.   1 / 9 18 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/16/2017 B Reply Me too 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. 04/09/2017 Brooke Reply Updated to 10.3.1 last night and less than 12 hours later my 6 plus has died. Will not turn on and can get no response from it. 04/12/2017 Dot parnell Reply Since I downloaded 10.3 my Facebook does work – anyone know what I can do. 04/13/2017 W Stephen Wilson Reply The update destroyed my IMAP path functionality so I can no longer do email. 04/13/2017 Rosie Reply Ever since I purchase iPhone 7Plus I had nothing but problems. I uploaded the 10.3.1 on 4/11/2017 with the following problems: It’s stuck on the iCloud setup Delete email in Allmail and it creates a duplicate; therefore I have to delete the mail twice. Apple why don’t you hire some computer technology people that know what they’re doing. This will be costing you money and making you look inadequate to the world. 04/14/2017 David Pearcey Reply I tired to update but it messed up my iCloud authentication somehow. It goes into a password authorization loop and disabled my iMessage, FaceTime and Family services functions. The update actually failed during Verifying Update phase of the install. It didn’t install (probably a good thing), and after it failed I got the above mentioned issues. I called apple support and they couldn’t fix it.They upgraded my issue to the engineering department and I haven’t heard from them since. After waiting a couple of days I decided to try doing a full reset and restore on my iPad Air2 and it fixed the issue. I will not be installing 10.3.1 until I hear back from Apple. Very uncharacteristic instability coming from Apple these days :( 04/16/2017 Gourmetdrummer Reply iOS 10.3.1 slows down the search function in contacts if you have a large contact list. I tested this with less than 5,000 contacts and it worked fine, but when I loaded the full 12,000+ contacts it takes 3-4 minutes to pull up a searched contact. I then restored to my backup with the older software version and it worked fine.

The images offer perhaps the clearest idea yet of how Apple's redesigned "iPhone 8" with edge-to-edge display may look with the screen powered off, if the company does indeed choose to sign off on a stainless steel-edged, all-glass design. The renders are based on the expectation that the iPhone 8 will be 144mm tall, 71mm wide, and 7.7mm thick, making it slightly larger than an iPhone 7 but smaller than an iPhone 7 Plus, and slightly thicker than both. The pictures show the smooth front glass of the edge-to-edge OLED display, which is expected to lack any sort of button indentation in favor of an entirely virtual home button. The only visible features appear in a bezeled run-off area housing the microphone hole and a dual-lens front-facing camera, which is rumored to include 3D sensing capabilities, potentially for use in facial/iris recognition or future augmented reality functionality. On the back we can see the widely-rumored vertical orientation of a slightly protruding dual-lens camera, a change from the horizontal arrangement used on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The placement of the Touch ID sensor isn't made explicit on these CAD-based renders and remains the biggest question mark concerning Apple's plans. Sources suggest the company has struggled to embed the Touch ID technology in the OLED display because of production challenges, which may force it to re-locate the fingerprint sensor to the rear of the device, possibly just below the Apple logo. Apple is thought to be testing several prototypes for its redesigned "tenth anniversary" iPhone and rumors have toed and froed over whether production is behind schedule or on course for a September launch, when it is expected to be announced alongside the so-called iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. The last word on the subject comes from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who implied that this year's shortage could be more "severe" than in previous years, suggesting the phone could be hard to come by for several months after launch.

May 10, 2017 6:15am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet From Zacks: Apple (AAPL – Free Report) is the hottest stock of 2017. This is especially true as the technology giant has scaled multiple highs this year that has pushed its market capitalization to over $800 billion for the first time. This is the biggest valuation among U.S. companies. Notably, the stock has rallied nearly 32% in the year-to-date timeframe, easily crushing the Zacks Industry Computer-Mini Market (see: all the Technology ETFs here). The most recent rally came from the bullishness shown by the Oracle of Omaha and the highly optimistic report from analyst Brian White of investment firm Drexel Hamilton. Brian White raised the price target on Apple from $185 to $202, citing that the iPhone maker is “one of the most under-appreciated stocks in the world.” This represents the highest price target ever on Wall Street and gives Apple a valuation of $1.053 trillion for the next 12 months. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, in its recent 10-Q filing, disclosed that it more than doubled its stake in the technology giant to $19.2 billion on March 31, 2017 from $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. Glance at Q2 Earnings Earnings per share came in at $2.10, easily trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.02 and improving 10.5% from year-ago earnings. Revenues increased 4.6% year over year to $52.9 billion and beat our estimate of $52.6 billion. Apple sold fewer 50.8 million iPhones last quarter, down from 51.2 million sold in the year-ago quarter. The slowdown suggests customers’ enthusiasm over iPhone 8, slated to launch in September. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the gadget-maker forecasts revenues in the range of $43.5 billion to $45.5 billion. Solid Growth Prospects The 3D sensor iPhone 8 would be a game changer for the technology giant that will put the company on a solid growth trajectory. Further, Apple is expected to get a boost under the Trump administration’s tax policies on foreign cash repatriation. This is because the iPhone maker is sitting on more than $250 billion in cash piles, the majority of which is held overseas (read: 4 ETFs to Profit Out of Cash Kings). If White House introduces a one-time tax holiday or reduction then Apple could bring this cash back home and could spend billions of dollars on dividend payments and stock buybacks. Additionally, the company could be a big acquirerwith its cash reserve and enter the social media space by acquiring Twitter (TWTR – Free Report) or Snap (SNAP – Free Report) or expand into media and entertainment by buying out Time Warner (TWX – Free Report) . It could also buy a ride-sharing platform and a major self-driving car player Uber, tech giant Sony (SNE – Free Report) , or Airbnb. Solid Fundamentals Apple has seen rising earnings estimate revisions from $8.92 to $8.97 per share for the full fiscal year over the past three months. This represents substantial growth of 7.96% compared with the industry average of 4.49%. Revenue is also expected to grow 5.22%, higher than the industry average growth of 4.63%. The stock is currently trading at a PEG ratio of 1.68, much lower than the industry average of 2.84, suggesting that it is a better value stock in the industry. The lower the PEG ratio, the better the value as investors would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth. According to the analysts polled by Zacks, Apple has an average target price of $148.36 with nearly 77% having a Strong Buy or a Buy rating. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a solid Industry Rank (in the top 41%) at the time of writing, suggesting significant upside for the stock over the coming days. Further, the stock has a solid Value and Momentum Style Score of ‘B’ each (read: 5 Hottest Tech ETFs of 2017).

Shares closed at $153.99 last night.  Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a stake of roughly $20 billion in Apple. The businessman said earlier this week that he had grown more fond of the company because he could "very easily determine" the iPhone maker's competitive position "and who is trying to chase them." Meanwhile, Apple has acquired a sleep tracking app and hardware maker Beddit, the Finnish startup said on its website.  The terms of the deal were not disclosed.  "Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy," the company said.  Beddit manufactures a monitoring device which tracks heart rate, breathing and sleep time when placed on a bed.  The monitor, which sells for $149.95 in Apple's online store, transfers the data to Beddit's iPhone app for analysis.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 10 May 2017 | MYT 6:37 PM EU to tackle complaints over tech giants' unfair trading practices European companies such as Spotify have complained online platforms abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. BRUSSELS: The European Union executive is planning a law to deal with complaints about unfair practices by leading online players such as Apple and Google . The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses. This follows proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook. European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet and Deezer have complained that online platforms - such as search engines and app stores - abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on iOS. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives - such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies - and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54.4 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly.

The invites confirm that the annual event is scheduled from 5 June 2017 to 9 June 2017. The conference will start at 10 AM Pacific Time which means that it will start at 10:30 PM Indian Standard Time. According to a report by MacRumors, Apple holds a keynote event on the first day of WWDC where it launches new software and hardware. We are expecting new versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. The event is not limited to software only, and we may see an updated iMac lineup, or a Siri-powered smart speaker to counter Amazon Alexa-powered smart speakers in the market. Image Credit: Apple The four day event will include in-depth technical sessions to build the next generation of apps. The company also has plans for ‘Hands-On Labs’ where developers can get advice from Apple engineers on how to implement new technologies in their code in addition to consultation sessions with Apple experts. The event will include stand-alone sessions held by Guest speakers from the industry along with get togethers and special events. The registration for the event has already been closed. The tickets priced at $1,599 were distributed using a random selection at the end of March. The company is expecting to host about 5,000 developers along with hundreds of Apple engineers to help the developers in consultations, hands-on and other exclusive help. Apple will live stream the session on the WWDC 2017 website. The keynote and rest of the conference will be held at McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, which is close to the Apple campus, and that means that the engineers will be able to spend more time assisting developers.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad EU to tackle complaints over tech companies' trading practices By Reuters Published: 06:37 EDT, 10 May 2017 | Updated: 09:57 EDT, 10 May 2017 e-mail By Julia Fioretti BRUSSELS, May 10 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive is planning a possible law to deal with complaints about unfair trading practices by leading online players such as Apple and Google. The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy that it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook. European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet and Deezer have complained that online platforms - such as search engines and app stores - abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on Apple's iOS software. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms `key gatekeepers´ deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. James Waterworth, vice president of lobby group CCIA Europe which includes Google, Facebook and eBay, said the Commission should use "flexible tools like competition law to resolve any problems on a case by case basis." However, some in the music industry welcomed the initiative, saying unfair trading practices had become commonplace in the online environment. "There is a `power gap´ that distorts competition - it needs to be addressed and we hope the Commission´s upcoming proposals in this area will be up to the task," said Helen Smith of IMPALA, the Independent Music Companies Association. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives - such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies - and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a "good Samaritan" principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localisation rules hamper technological innovation.

Beddit, which was founded in 2007 and has been selling its sleep tracker in Apple stores since 2015, confirmed the acquisition with an updated privacy policy. The update revised on 8 May said: “Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple privacy policy.” Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Beddit had raised $3.5m (£2.7m) in funding since it was founded. The £130 Beddit sleep tracker consists of a 1.5mm thick strip of sensors that are placed on ttop of the mattress and connected to a wall outlet for power. Combined with an Android or iPhone app, the Beddit 3 sleep sensor tracks sleep time and quality, heart rate, breathing rate and snoring. It also acts as an intelligent alarm clock that wakes you up in the lightest sleep phase. The Espoo-based company partnered with fitness tracking firm Misfit in 2014 to create the co-branded Misfit Beddit, before Misfit and its Shine fitness tracker were acquired by watchmaker Fossil group for $260m in November 2015. Beddit has been described as the “Fitbit of sleep” for its easy to use sensor and comprehensive night-time tracking and analytics, an area that Apple is weak. To date Apple has not featured sleep tracking at all within its iPhone or Apple Watch fitness apps. Third-party sleep tracking apps, including Beddit, have filled the gap using the iPhone, but with its requirement of a nightly charge, sleep has remained the Achilles heel of the Apple Watch’s otherwise fairly comprehensive health-tracking tools. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple has overtaken Fitbit to become the world’s largest wearable device manufacturer with the Apple Watch. Photograph: Issei Kato/Reuters Apple, which has become the first company to top the $800bn mark in market capitalisation, has found itself in a battle with San Francisco-based Fitbit for not only the top smartwatch, but also the top wearable device. Until recently, Fitbit was the market leader in wearable device sales, but according to data from Strategy Analytics, Apple has overtaken Fitbit to become the world’s largest wearable device manufacturer, shipping 3.5m Apple Watches and holding 16% of the global market in the first quarter of 2017, a figure up 59% year-on-year. Apple was closely followed by China’s Xiaomi with 3.4m wearables shipped and 15% of the market, while Fitbit slumped to third with just 2.9m wearable devices and 13% of the market, down 36% year-on-year. With wearable device shipments growing by 21% to 22m units in Quarter 1 2017, it is a market Apple could use to contribute a meaningful sum to its bottom line, which is currently dominated by a single product – the iPhone – that has seen declining sales. While the initial focus for smartwatches, including Google’s Android Wear watches and the Apple Watch, was around apps and notifications, it quickly became apparent that health and fitness was a driving reason that customers bought the items. For Apple and any other smartwatch makers, comprehensive fitness and health tracking is essential. Sleep tracking has remained the domain of fitness trackers such as the Beddit, or wrist-worn devices such as the Fitbit Charge, which do not need charging each night to last through the day. Whether Apple will continue to sell the Beddit sleep sensor remains to be seen. It is likely the technology and sleep analysis behind it will end up in future Apple products, including the Apple Watch.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 11, 3:09 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Apple Watch Series 3 Expected Features Include Food Nutrition Tracking, Sleep Monitoring By Rishabh Jain On 05/10/17 AT 6:15 AM Close Apple is expected to unveil its next-generation of smartwatches, the Apple Watch Series 3 in September. The device could be unveiled along with the company’s 2017 flagship device – iPhone 8.   The upcoming device is not only expected to compete with smartwatches from Samsung and LG, but also with fitness trackers. Read: Apple Watch 3 Release Date: Faster Smartwatch With Cellular Connectivity Launching In Q3 The expected features of the smartwatch include: Food nutrition tracking: This is a feature, which could set the Apple Watch Series 3 from its predecessors. Apple was granted a patent in February for tracking electronic tags to gain nutritional information about food items.  According to the patent, the nutritional variables of food items will be added or subtracted. The information will then be transmitted to the Apple Watch 3 or an iPhone using NFC. But, that would work only for packaged items RFID tags. What about dishes or even simple food items, such as hamburgers? Apple will collaborate with restaurants to have RFID tags placed on bills. The feature will also be customizable, so even if customers have consumed a part of a meal and not a full one, they will still get to know how many calories they consumed. The feature is much enhanced than the smartwatch’s current system, which just provides the estimated nutritional value of generic food items. Sleep monitoring: Apple acquired sleep-tracking platform Beddit Monday as per the announcement on Beddit’s Privacy Policy page.  The acquisition is expected to bring enhanced features such as sleep analysis, heart rate analysis and respiratory rate to the smartwatch to the Health app. Apple Watch owners will be able to access it from the Apple HealthKit app. Display-embedded TouchID: According to a Business Korea report published in April, Apple is expected to use a new display technology, called MicroLED in Apple Watch 3, which will replace the current OLED technology. The new display will be thinner owing to the technology and therefore, the company would be able to include touch sensing infrared diodes into the display, making it possible for Apple to include its TouchID feature on the next-generation smartwatch. This will add a layer of security to the smartwatch, which is necessary as the device has access to important user information, such as contacts, GPS location and even Apple Pay access. LTE connectivity: According to analyst Christopher Rolland, Apple Watch 3 could have an inbuilt SIM slot and LTE connectivity. The device is expected to use a CAT-M1 chipset, which would allow users to make Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls. Read: Apple Watch Series 3 Rumored To Be Released In Fall 2017 Smart Band, Camera: The Apple Watch 3 is expected to have hardware-based features such as a smart band and a built-in camera in addition to an improved display. The device could have a smart fabric wristband, which will show users time, date, weather and other notifications, according to financial news site Market Exclusive. The built-in camera could be used for facial recognition. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

It spotted an privacy policy on the Beddit website, which reads: "Beddit has been acquired by Apple. Your personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy," complete with a link to Apple's privacy hub.  Beddit's updated notice also states that data it collects, including heart rate and respiratory data, can be shared with Apple's Health app. CNBC notes that Beddit has retained a customer support contact on its website, suggesting that the customer experience will not change and that Apple has no plans to shut it down. Apple currently sells Beddit's Indigogo-funded Sleep Monitor device, which is a "thin, flexible and soft sensor" that you place on top of your mattress and pairing with your iPhone or Apple Watch in order to track and analyse your sleep.  "It senses and automatically begins tracking when you lie down on the bed — collecting and analysing sleep-related data such as sleep time and efficiency, heart rate, respiration, temperature, movement, snoring, room temperature and room humidity," Apple's product description reads. Apple has yet to cough on the acqusition, so it's as yet unclear how much it paid for Beddit, nor what it plans are for the company. However, it's probably more likely that we'll be seeing beefed-up sleep tracking tech making its way to the iPhone and Apple Watch than the launch Apple-branded mattress. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Software Apple ios iphone apple watch Beddit Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

 We just got another sign that the iPhone 8 might not be available until months after it's announced Rob Price May 10, 2017, 9:08 AM 6,284 facebook linkedin twitter email print An unofficial render showing how the iPhone 8 might look, based on leaks.Benjamin Geskin for iDropNews We just got another sign that the release of the eagerly anticipated iPhone 8 might be delayed this year following an expected announcement in September. Ming-Chi Kuo, a reliable analyst with sources in Apple's supply chain, says there's increasing potential for a "worst case scenario" that could see the availability of Apple's next flagship smartphone delayed by months, according to AppleInsider. 2017 is the tenth anniversary of the launch of the iPhone, and Apple has big things planned. Alongside the expected release of the iPhone 7s, Apple is believed to be bringing out a high-end "iPhone 8" that will have significant new features including an almost edge-to-edge screen with a fingerprint scanner built in, a new camera with augmented reality capabilities, and wireless charging. But it sounds like production issues might cause delays — a deeply frustrating setback for Apple (and customers). The Cupertino, California, technology giant is notoriously secretive, almost never commenting on upcoming products before their official announcement. So don't expect it to confirm or deny any of this. An alleged dummy model of the iPhone 8.Benjamin Geskin/Twitter The iPhone 8 (or "iPhone Edition" or "iPhone X," depending on rumours) is supposedly selling for more than a traditional iPhone — upwards of $1,000. However, there have been whisperings for a while that problems with producing the phone and its more advanced components could cause headaches for the launch. Ming-Chi Kuo has previously said that "production ramp-up of OLED iPhone could be delayed to as late as October-November compared to the usual ramp-up period of August-September, due to increased production difficulty." Per AppleInsider, he now thinks that "worst case scenario" is more likely. As a result, the iPhone 8 might still be announced in September at Apple's annual launch event alongside the iPhone 7s. But while the 7s will become available immediately, the 8 may not go on sale for months afterwards. And even once it does hit the shelves, it might still be hard to find. "Severe supply shortages may persist for a while after the new models are launched, capping total shipments of new iPhones in 2H17F," the analyst said.

John S. Weinberg, 60, whose surname had been synonymous with the bank for decades, left as co-vice chairman in 2015. A year later he joined Evercore Partners Inc., reaping sign-on awards worth $124 million as of Dec. 31. That placed him third on the Bloomberg Pay Index, a ranking of the best-compensated U.S. executives for 2016. He joins an exclusive club increasingly dominated by bosses at companies that are, at best, just a few decades old. He’s surpassed only by Jet.com Inc. co-founder Marc Lore, whose $236.9 million in awarded compensation last year was largely composed of money Wal-Mart Stores Inc. paid to buy his company, and Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who received $150 million. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, 44, and Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, 45, round out the top five. An old-school corporate adviser whose father and grandfather led Goldman Sachs, Weinberg is an odd fit in that quintet. For Evercore, founded in 1995, it was a rare coup to land a 32-year veteran from one of Wall Street’s most storied firms -- one who brings relationships with some of the biggest U.S. companies. As Evercore’s new executive chairman, he also gives founder Roger Altman more freedom from daily responsibilities. “The concept of nine-figure compensation numbers can be startling,” said Steven Hall, managing director at Steven Hall & Partners, a compensation-consulting firm. “But these are executives whose proven talents make them heavily sought after by other firms.” Weinberg, who was awarded $22.9 million in 2013, the last year Goldman Sachs disclosed his pay, has a “proven track record as a leader of investment-banking businesses,” Evercore said in its annual proxy filing. His pay package for last year included $88.9 million in partnership units and restricted stock, of which about one-third is tied to performance, and the opportunity to collect $35 million in cash if targets are met. Some of it replaced awards from Goldman that were forfeited when he joined Evercore. It puts him ahead of other finance titans, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and KKR & Co. founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts, both 73. Boards often heap big equity grants on executives when they join a company or sign new employment contracts, which can cause compensation to spike in that particular year. Examples include Weinberg and CBS Corp. CEO Les Moonves, 67, who’s ninth on the index and signed a deal that keeps him on the job until 2019. Similarly, executives who leave sometimes get severance and stock awards that vest ahead of schedule, such as Viacom Inc.’s ex-CEO Philippe Dauman, 63, who ranks eighth. As a result, those three are less likely to be near the top of the index next year -- a fate familiar to billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong. He took over as CEO of cancer researcher NantKwest Inc. in 2015 and got stock options that vaulted him to the top of the ranking for that year. A $602,308 salary was his only compensation for 2016. The Bloomberg Pay Index tracks the 200 highest-paid executives who appear in filings from companies that submit compensation details to U.S. regulators. The index adds salaries, bonuses, perks, options, restricted shares and changes in pension values that a person was awarded for the most recent year. All equity awards are valued at each company’s fiscal year-end. The index’s figures can therefore differ from those disclosed in filings, in some cases by a lot, depending on stock-price changes and dividend payouts. Recurring annual grants of stock or options are included in the year they’re bestowed, not when they vest. One-time grants, meant to pay an executive for several years, are allocated over the life of the award as explained in regulatory filings. The top-ranked executives or their representatives declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment. Apple’s Cook, 56, received a mega-grant of restricted stock units when he took over the iPhone-maker in 2011, scheduled to vest over 10 years. In filings, Apple’s board said the CEO wouldn’t receive additional equity compensation in those years. In that instance, the Bloomberg Pay Index annualized the award, which is partly tied to stock performance, over the intended lifetime. Cook’s 2016 payout was bigger than in previous years because of how Apple’s board structured the distribution of shares. Tesla’s Musk got a similar award in 2012 that’s meant to pay him for a decade. See also: The intensely private life of Apple CEO Tim Cook Similarly, Charter Communications Inc. CEO Tom Rutledge, 63, got a 2016 pay package that the company valued at $98.5 million. The bulk came from option grants that are the only equity compensation he’ll get through 2020. The index allocates the options over five years and values his 2016 pay at $62.6 million, placing him 13th. Other pay rankings that don’t annualize one-time awards are unlikely to feature Cook, whose 2016 compensation as reported in Apple’s most recent proxy statement was a comparatively meager $8.75 million. Rutledge, however, would likely end up near the top of any ranking for last year based on reported pay. Certain executives show up on the index perennially, including Gamco Investors Inc.’s Mario Gabelli, 74, who ranks 10th with $76 million for 2016, followed by private-equity leaders Roberts and Kravis at about $64 million each. Those payouts are all cash, putting them on the opposite side of the spectrum from Pichai, whose pay from Google parent Alphabet Inc. is almost entirely in stock that’s granted every other year. Wal-Mart’s Lore, who tops the Bloomberg Pay Index after selling Jet.com to the retail giant for $3.3 billion, makes for a special case. Most of his compensation is tied to the deal and composed of restricted shares that will fully vest by September 2021. While the stock qualifies as compensation for regulatory purposes, Wal-Mart’s board said in a proxy statement that it doesn’t consider it to be part of his pay. Excluding shares from the acquisition, Lore got $1.43 million in salary, bonus and perks for the most recent fiscal year. Lore, who’s 45 and worked in finance before becoming an entrepreneur, might seem like a surprise find at the top of Bloomberg’s pay ranking. In 2015, two years after he left Amazon.com Inc. to start Jet.com, he wrote a LinkedIn post titled “Chasing Money Will Cripple Your Career.” “Over my six years in finance, I learned to approach my career as an individual sport, where I was judged by the size of my bonus,” Lore wrote. “Ultimately, I have realized that success is not a measure of your salary, title or degree, but the impact you have on others and the collective happiness of the people you touch.” Editing: Alicia Ritcey, Peter Eichenbaum and Steven Crabill With assistance from: Jenn Zhao Design & development: Cedric SamCedric Sam Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir 1/2 left right European Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip addresses a news conference on Digital Single Market at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium May 10, 2017. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir 2/2 By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS BRUSSELS The European Union's executive is planning a possible law to deal with complaints about unfair trading practices by leading online players such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O). The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy that it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook (FB.O). European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet (RKET.DE) and Deezer (DZR.PA) have complained that online platforms - such as search engines and app stores - abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on Apple's iOS software. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple, Google and Facebook, said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms ‘key gatekeepers’ deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. James Waterworth, vice president of lobby group CCIA Europe which includes Google, Facebook and eBay (EBAY.O), said the Commission should use "flexible tools like competition law to resolve any problems on a case by case basis." However, some in the music industry welcomed the initiative, saying unfair trading practices had become commonplace in the online environment. "There is a ‘power gap’ that distorts competition – it needs to be addressed and we hope the Commission’s upcoming proposals in this area will be up to the task," said Helen Smith of IMPALA, the Independent Music Companies Association. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives - such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies - and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a "good Samaritan" principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localization rules hamper technological innovation.

The iPhone maker's shares have gained 33% this year and almost 50% since the US election in November. The company represents about 4% of the $21.7 trillion that makes up the entire S&P 500 index. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9% of the S&P 500 in September 2012 but is a smaller percentage now as the index as a whole has rallied more than 7% this year. Apple CEO Tim Cook (Photo: Reuters) Apple boss Tim Cook says iPhone 8 rumours are to blame for lacklustre iPhone sales "It's just reflective of how powerful a franchise it is. It may be the most powerful franchise in the country today," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management. "Considering that it has a limited number of products, it has really dominated that market in a way that few companies have, and it's been able to retain margins despite lots of competitors." If Apple continues on its growth path, the company will top the $1 trillion market cap level later this year.

Apple was traditionally known as a company that mainly cares about profits, well things have changed these past few years. It seems like Apple has been doing its best in order to gain its customer’s trust. However, this shouldn’t surprise anyone when considering that Android devices have such a larger fan base because there are numerous tech companies who are offering Android powered devices. Pleasing Customers If you are left wondering to how is Apple trying to please its customers you don’t need to worry since we are going to shed some light on that. First of all, Apple has slowly but surely lowered its prices in order to fit with the competition. Obviously, iPhones are iPads are still expensive but they come with acceptable prices. For example, Apple recently introduced the first affordable iPad which has been priced at $329. iPad Air 2 According to numerous reports, Apple is getting ready to surprise its fan base with a great deal. Apple fans that have acquired the first iPad which shipped with the innovative Lighting connector should be happy to know that they can get it replaced with an iPad Air 2 for free. However, there’s a catch to this deal as with all deals which sound too good to be true. The only iPad 4 owners who can ask Apple for an iPad Air 2 replacement are the ones who own broken 2012 iPads and have Apple Care. So if the older tablet is working fine, Apple will not want to replace it. Nonetheless, if you are the owner of an old malfunctioning iPad you can trade it in at any Apple authorized store and receive an iPad Air 2. Also worth mentioning is that Apple is offering both the 32GB and 128GB storage variants of iPad Air 2. All in all, this deal is great and the only downside about it is that it requires Apple Care. Specs In order to refresh our memories, we’ll go over the key hardware specs of iPad Air 2. First off, the tablet ships with a 9.7 inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display which offers a high pixel resolution of 1536 x 2048. In terms of hardware power, iPad Air 2 is fueled by the triple-core 1.5GHz Typhoon CPU which has been coupled with 2GB RAM.
