No, really, it‚Äôs a $300 book. With nothing on it but pictures. And a foreword by Jony Ive. Containing 450 photographs of Apple products from 1998 to 2015 that ‚Äúchronicles‚Äù decades of Apple‚Äôs design, the coffee table book titled ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California‚Äù will officially go on sale on Wednesday, November 16. The book, which is being marketed as a tribute to Steve Jobs, does look premium with the images done by photographer Andrew Zuckerman and nicely hard-bound in linen. It costs $199 for the small and $299 for the large variant. ‚ÄúThis archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,‚Äù Jony Ive said. ‚ÄúWe hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.‚Äù While it is undeniably cool to look at the evolution of Apple‚Äôs designs, don‚Äôt bet too much on Ive‚Äôs statements about the book ¬†bringing forth some understanding and being a resource for students since there are no helpful insights or information to do that as it appears to not contain any other text aside from the title and the foreword. Here‚Äôs an excerpt of the foreword: ‚ÄúWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. ‚ÄúWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.‚Äù The complete list of retail locations is on Apple‚Äôs website. For Asian Apple fans, the book can be found at Apple‚Äôs Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea websites. If this becomes a hit, would it be far-fetched to expect a slightly updated version in a few months time?

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple saves iPhone call history to iCloud, but barely mentions it Ian Paul 18 November, 2016 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Security Modern smartphones make it easy to back up all your data to the cloud so you can keep it synced across devices, or download it to a new phone. That can have unfortunate consequences, however ‚Äì especially when phones are syncing sensitive information that users aren‚Äôt explicitly aware of, and then a company famous for developing¬†smartphone cracking software¬†finds out. Moscow-based Elcomsoft¬†recently added a feature to its Phone Breaker software that the company says can retrieve an iPhone user‚Äôs call history data via iCloud. To use its software to crack an iCloud account, an attacker would need your login data or a login token from one of your devices. Apple saves up to four months of a user‚Äôs call history whenever they are using iCloud Drive, according to Elcomsoft. The call history saved to iCloud keeps detailed information including phone numbers, dates, times of day the calls were made or received, and duration of calls, as first reported by the¬†Intercept. Data for missed and ignored calls is also synced. In iOS 10, this synced data includes call data from VoIP apps that use Apple‚Äôs new¬†CallKit framework. In response to Elcomsoft‚Äôs announcement, Apple told¬†iMore¬†that it supports ‚Äúcall history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices‚Äù. Why this matters:¬†The problem isn‚Äôt so much that Apple is syncing call logs. It‚Äôs how it‚Äôs implemented. Call log syncing is a nice convenience for those who want it, which is why Apple did it in the first place. But for those who don‚Äôt want to sync their call logs, or weren‚Äôt expecting to, it‚Äôs a huge problem. What‚Äôs missing? Consent and control For starters, this call history data is the same information the National Security Agency was so interested in obtaining, which the public discovered during the¬†initial Snowden leaks in 2013. As the Intercept points out, four months of data records is twice as long as mobile carriers maintain that same information. Privacy-conscious users would not like this data easily accessible to law enforcement regardless of their proclivity for criminal activity. The second issue is that there‚Äôs no explicit way to turn call syncing on or off. You can stop it by shutting down iCloud Drive, but that means you lose every other convenience of that service. Apple also did a terrible job of disclosing this information. Call log syncing is mentioned in¬†Apple‚Äôs security white paper¬†released in May, a PDF document that few users would ever read. But why isn‚Äôt it in this¬†iCloud security and privacy overview¬†from Apple‚Äôs support pages? It lists all kinds of other sensitive data sent to iCloud and how it is protected, but at this writing mention of call history is absent, as is any mention of SMS and MMS. Or how about¬†this support page, which lists backed-up iCloud data similarly to the white paper, yet call history is absent at this writing. These two pages were last updated in mid-September and at the end of October, respectively. Now, before you go searching for a loophole as to why mention of call history syncing wouldn‚Äôt be on either of these pages, ask yourself this: What‚Äôs more important? To know that your browser bookmarks and ringtones are synced to iCloud, or that your call history is? Exactly. This is a major oversight on Apple‚Äôs part. Elcomsoft says call syncing to iCloud has existed since at least iOS 8.2, released in March 2015. A quick search on¬†various¬†Apple-themed forums¬†shows¬†people starting to complain¬†around that time about call syncing across multiple devices‚Äîespecially when two users shared the same iCloud ID. So what‚Äôs the solution? Simple. Apple should offer granular controls for what is synced to iCloud. Rene Ritchie on iMore rightly observes that this could result in ‚Äúsettings fatigue‚Äù where users are overwhelmed by too many options. Nevertheless, that‚Äôs a risk Apple should be willing to take if it truly cares about user privacy. For now, users have a choice to make. Those who like the convenience of call syncing don‚Äôt need to do anything. Anyone who is bothered by it can shut off iCloud Drive. The extra concerned could also delete their phone calling history on their devices before shutting down iCloud Drive. That change should be reflected on Apple‚Äôs servers fairly quickly; however, there could still be redundant backups of this information kept on Apple‚Äôs systems for a time. Regardless of which camp you fall into, everyone should also enable two-factor authentication. That makes it much harder for a hacker to access your data stored on iCloud. Two-factor authentication won‚Äôt, however, prevent law enforcement from legally obtaining iCloud data directly from Apple. If you‚Äôre using an Android phone, know that Google also stores this data on all devices running Android 6.0 and up when they are signed in to Google Play Services, according to Elcomsoft. In other words, pretty much every Android user with a modern phone. Related Tags:¬† Share: Comments Related Posts Random Posts Do we really need that new smartphone?

According to Apple, some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit Multi-Touch issues after "being dropped multiple times on a hard surface," causing damage to the device. Under its repair program, Apple will fix affected iPhone 6 Plus devices for a service price of $149. Customers who paid more than $149 to have their devices fixed before the repair program was implemented will be able to get their money reimbursed by Apple. Complaints about the iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen issue started in August, after iFixit published a video highlighting the bug and dubbed it "Touch Disease." Touch Disease presents as a gray flickering bar at the top of the screen and a display that becomes unresponsive or less responsive to touch. The problem is believed to be caused by the touchscreen controller chips soldered to the logic board of the phone, making repairs difficult. Third-party repair outlets speculated that the issue could be linked to the same structural design flaw that caused the major "Bendgate" controversy, and Apple's suggestion that it is caused by repeated physical damage seems to confirm that. Customers who have an iPhone 6 Plus with Multi-Touch issues can visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an Apple retail store to see if they qualify for the $149 repair fee. [ 407 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) kevinkyoo 3 days ago at 03:10 pm Except there are plenty of people whose phones weren't physically dropped and had these problems occur because of the manufacturing errors. But sure, Apple, let's make an excuse that points fault at the customers, and not at itself! And the fact that they're charging $150 instead of owning up to its mistakes and conducting these repairs for a lower price (Or free, IMO) is a laughable joke. Tim Cook, you're the best CEO to get that profit. Rating: 129 Votes alex.marton 3 days ago at 03:11 pm Surely it should be free if it's a manufacturing issue... Rating: 75 Votes kevinkyoo 3 days ago at 03:17 pm It isn't because customers drop them. Here's a video: [MEDIA=youtube]zhJW140kLCY[/MEDIA] It's a manufacturing error, and not the customer's fault. To ask people to fork up $150 for their own mistakes is a joke. Stop sucking up to Apple. Rating: 60 Votes robotica 3 days ago at 03:12 pm Wow they admitted it at last!! Pleasantly surprised. Wait a minute $149....:mad: Rating: 36 Votes ip67 3 days ago at 03:13 pm Wow they admitted it at last!! Pleasantly surprised. Admitting it yet while charging $149 doesn't really seem like admitting it. Rating: 34 Votes StarkerMann 3 days ago at 03:21 pm This is worse than "You're holding it wrong." At least Jobs issued free cases to iPhone 4 owners. $149 to fix a defective product has the fingerprints of a tunnel vision CEO all over it. Rating: 27 Votes macjoshua 3 days ago at 03:20 pm This is crap. I had two iPhone 6 Pluses exhibit this issue, and never dropped them. They were both slightly bent though - the first one bent over time, and the replacement was bent right out of the white box and the touch disease symptoms showed up as the genius bar guy was getting it set up. I am always extremely careful with my phones, and they only ever go in my front pocket. So, normal usage (if not better-than-normal) with these phones caused bending issues over time, even if it was ever so slight. Rating: 22 Votes kevinkyoo 3 days ago at 03:27 pm A "disease" that occurs more than a year later... And people are naive enough to pretend they never once dropped their phone or did anything to them to cause parts to loosen up? It's completely on the users, regardless of what click-seeking websites say. [doublepost=1479425058][/doublepost] Wrong and naive. The problem didn't occur for almost every complainer until a year after owning the 6. There's no way in the full year they never once dropped their phone or never did anything that could have damaged the internals. It's complete idiocy to think that the users did nothing to their phones that could cause this. Did you even watch the video? I swear, all the apologists who have responded to me so far didn't. Look at the comparisons in there of the 5s vs. the 6 plus. A metal shield vs. a sticker. If I put the phone in my pocket for 1 year with that change in components, then yes, eventually touch syndrome will arise, even if I didn't drop the phone multiple times. On top of this, people posted of "touch disease" on their phones even before that 1 year occurrence. But it was only after that year because the majority of these people didn't drop their phones. They use them as regular phones, but because of the material (Note that Apple changed it going to the 6s/+) and putting these things in their pockets, that component WILL be affected. Wrong and naive. Rating: 21 Votes Schwyz 3 days ago at 03:13 pm Apple should offer a free repair. Because it's a design defect. And we know it's a defect. Because we're world-class chip designers. EDIT: Not saying whether Apple is or is not in the wrong here, just saying a company renowned for their customer support shouldn't be judged too quickly. Apple probably had multiple engineering teams looking into it, and this is their conclusion. Perhaps Apple is greedy. But perhaps consumers are more clumsy than they choose to admit. Perhaps both. Rating: 19 Votes macjoshua 3 days ago at 03:46 pm Hard to believe how many trolls and/or insane Apple shills there are here. Yes, this was a flawed device. It's ok if a company screws up. It happens. Was it catastrophically flawed like the Galaxy Note? No. But flawed, nonetheless. Because of age and my industry, I've probably owned more Apple products than most of the people on this site (by far most of them have been great, but some had proven design problems). I'm extremely invested in the Apple platform, and I have defended it to Windows and Android fans for years. I will not, however, try to defend clear problems with engineering - and Apple shouldn't try to sweep it under the rug or make even more money out of their customers because of an issue they created.

 Apple just announced it will fix iPhones with Touch Disease for $149 Kif Leswing Nov. 17, 2016, 5:51 PM 41,057 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/Rice Is For Dinner Apple announced on Thursday that it will fix certain issues with iPhone 6 Plus phones for $149, a significant discount from the $329 service charge the company had been offering users. The company wrote in a service document: "Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. "If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149." Although Apple never uses the phrase, this is a fix for "touch disease." The problem occurs when an internal issue in certain iPhone models ‚Äî the iPhone 6 Plus, in particular ‚Äî causes the display to flicker, show a gray bar at the top, and become unresponsive to touch. The issue was fairly widespread, according to our readers, who emailed us frequently after we covered the issue in October. Most people were frustrated that although Apple appeared to be aware of the issue, it would still charge out-of-warranty customers $329 for a fix. Apple says it will reimburse customers the difference if they already paid the $329 to get their iPhone 6 Plus fixed. Frustratingly, Apple is still claiming the issue is not caused by an engineering defect, but rather because the phones were "dropped multiple times on a hard surface." You can get your iPhone 6 Plus fixed at Apple retail stores and authorized service providers.

Samsung‚Äôs $8 billion buy now makes it a market leader in mobile devices, home automation, and connected cars. Should Apple and Google start worrying? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 17, 2016 at 5:06PM Samsung Electronics (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) recently agreed¬†to buy Harman International Industries (NYSE:HAR) for about $8 billion to expand its presence in connected and automotive electronics. Harman, a market leader in connected car solutions, supplies over 30 million vehicles with infotainment, telematics, safety, and security solutions. Image source: Harman. About 65% of Harman's $7 billion in revenues last year came from the automotive market, and its backlog orders hit $24 billion at the end of June. Samsung CEO Oh-Hyun Kwon claimed that the acquisition "perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time." Merging Harman's automotive businesses with Samsung's mobile and smart appliances businesses would make the tech giant a force to be reckoned with in the Internet of Things (IoT) market -- and that could spell trouble for companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Why Samsung needed Harman Samsung is the¬†world's biggest manufacturer of smartphones and consumer electronics. The company's biggest weakness is its dependence on¬†mobile devices, which accounted for 46% of its top line last quarter. That business has been shrinking due to commoditization and its costly Note 7 blunder. To diversify away from that market, Samsung launched new wearable devices and smart appliances to expand its software ecosystem, and¬†acquired smart home company SmartThings two years ago. To reduce its dependence on Google Android, Samsung launched its own OS, Tizen, for wearables and select smartphones. Image source: SmartThings. With those products in place, Samsung carved out a decent moat against rival ecosystems like Apple's HomeKit and Google's Home/Nest. But one area where it lagged behind was the auto market. Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto took over dashboards with their mirroring features, but Samsung users were stuck with MirrorLink, a clumsier protocol which is also used by Sony and HTC devices. But by acquiring Harman, Samsung instantly becomes a Tier 1 auto supplier, and it will generate cost-cutting synergies by vertically integrating its processor and display businesses. Furthermore, Harman's future products will be built with Samsung's ecosystem integration in mind -- which should work more smoothly than products that are merely "compatible" with Apple and Google's mobile and IoT devices. How Samsung counters Apple and Google Simply put, a person who owns a Samsung phone, Samsung/SmartThings smart appliances, and a Harman-equipped car could easily have their personal data synchronized across all three "hubs." This is the kind¬†of "ubiquitous computing" Google has talked about for years, and the kind of game-changing expansion Apple needs to diversify away from its core hardware devices. Neither Google nor Apple can compete against Samsung's dominant position in first-party consumer electronics like smart TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines. Both companies need third-party appliance makers to make their devices compatible with Home or HomeKit for them to sync to their mobile apps. That strategy is a fairly safe one, since Google and Apple merely leverage their leading positions in mobile devices to expand their IoT ecosystems without shouldering the costs of manufacturing new hardware. However, that strategy also relies on those partners making reliable appliances which work correctly with their smart home ecosystems. The same issues could affect cars which don't sync correctly with iOS and Android devices. Why Google and Apple shouldn't worry... yet Samsung's game plan sounds ambitious, but it could be bogged down by technical issues. Samsung's SmartThings platform was¬†plagued with glitches earlier this year, and researchers claimed that the¬†platform was poorly protected from malicious hacks. The recent Mirai botnet attack, which used hijacked IoT devices like routers and IP cameras to knock major websites offline, could also discourage consumers to connect everything to the internet. Samsung's previous attempts to carve out its own non-Google ecosystem -- like Tizen, S Health, Milk Music, and the Galaxy Apps Store -- also haven't been very effective. Instead, each attempt merely revealed that the majority of Samsung owners preferred using Google's services. Samsung might now have the leverage in mobile hardware, consumer electronics, and connected cars to start building a cohesive IoT ecosystem, but Google and Apple's clout in mobile operating systems will likely counter that push by simply convincing hardware makers to tether their products to their Android and iOS-based apps. Therefore, Samsung's purchase of Harman was a smart move which will give it a growing automotive parts business, but it probably won't enable it to topple Google, Apple, and others in the growing smart home/car market just yet. ¬† Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Reportedly Considering Making iPhones in America The Mac maker does some homework. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 17, 2016 at 5:03PM A worker inspects MacBook Pro displays in Shanghai, China. Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be thinking about doing the unthinkable: bringing iPhone production back home. The Nikkei Asian Review is exclusively reporting that the Mac maker asked its two primary iPhone contract manufacturers, Foxconn and Pegatron, to evaluate the possibility of assembling iPhones in the U.S. Foxconn did an evaluation per Apple's request, but Pegatron reportedly didn't want to bother with it because of cost considerations. Apple's move wasn't in response to Donald Trump's election victory, but it's possible that the tech titan was exploring the idea pre-emptively. Apple made the request in June, and Trump's campaign focused heavily on using tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing, while also demonizing Apple for manufacturing products abroad. "How does it help us when they make it in China?" The president-elect posed this question to supporters in March, vowing that he would "get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China." The answer is -- or at least should be -- incredibly obvious. China is the most efficient and cost-effective place for Apple to churn out hundreds of millions of iPhones. The Nikkei report quoted a source saying, "Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double." That is how it benefits U.S. consumers. Lower costs translate into lower retail prices. Apple has its margin target that it needs to hit, so any increases in its underlying cost structure will indubitably be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. This isn't just about labor costs, either The entire electronics supply chain is centralized in Asia, which yields logistics and research and development efficiencies. Having a supplier being physically located close to where the devices are produced makes it easier to address problems that arise and streamline the build-out of manufacturing infrastructure. For instance, here's a map of Apple suppliers: Apple has hundreds of suppliers across Asia. Image source: Apple. Beyond cost, the labor pool in Asia is also much more able to handle this type of work. In an interview with Charlie Rose last December, CEO Tim Cook explained the situation: Let me be clear, China put an enormous focus on manufacturing. In what we would call, you and I would call vocational kind of skills. The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we're currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields. Will it happen? Apple has to do its due diligence in researching the possibility. The company has to take Trump's rhetoric seriously, and evaluating options is completely expected. However, Apple will likely find that it's just not possible or worth it, even if Trump enacts some type of import tariff. It's a very real possibility that the costs to move manufacturing to the U.S. at a meaningful scale would be so prohibitive that it would be better to deal with a potential tariff. The company has moved some manufacturing to the U.S., but those are lower-volume products like the Mac Pro. I don't think there's any realistic way that Apple moves the bulk of iPhone production stateside. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

While the new Touch Bar models first hit retail stores earlier this week, they are now available for pickup in store via Apple‚Äôs website, as well. As noted on Apple‚Äôs website, you can now order a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar from the Apple¬†Online Store and pick it up in store. As is usually the case with new products, pickup times vary wildly depending on your market. In general, the base $1799 Touch Bar model is available for same-day pickup in a decent number¬†of markets, though the $1999 model is slightly harder to find for same-day pickup. As far as the 15-inch models go, the $2399 model is widely not available for same-day pickup, while the $2999 model is even more scarce. As time progresses, though, this should improve and the machines will become readily available in Apple‚Äôs retail stores. In the instances where the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is not available for same-day pickup, Apple lists December 30th as the pickup¬†date, which coincidences with the 4-5 week shipping window it currently lists for all Touch Bar models. Given the widespread availability of the 13-inch Touch Bar model, however, it‚Äôs likely that the 4-5 week shipping window will start to decrease at some point in the near future for that model. Reviews of the new MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar emerged earlier this week and noted of the device‚Äôs power and design improvements. As for the Touch Bar itself, reactions have been mixed thus far. Our own Jeff Benjamin noted in his hands-on that while he strongly disliked the Touch Bar at first, he‚Äôs slowly been growing more fond of it as he continues to use it and grow accustomed.

Apple reported earnings last week. Two Fools examine the major segments' performances, digest the guidance the company offered up, and discuss some issues analysts raised during the conference call. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 17, 2016 at 4:23PM Last month, Apple¬†(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported modest earnings for the third quarter, but the stock dropped 2.5% shortly after the call. On this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, analyst Dylan Lewis and Fool contributor Evan Niu discuss the most important numbers from the call and what they mean for the company in the long term, and why the stock fell on what was a better-than-average quarter for the tech giant. Also, they examine how Apple is growing in China, how much the Samsung Note 7 fiasco might affect Apple's next few quarters, what analysts are most concerned about with the Q3 report, and more.

Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It is Friday,¬†Oct. 28. Happy birthday, mom! We're¬†going to run through the¬†Apple¬†earnings¬†report. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan,¬†how's it going? Evan Niu: Busy week, a lot of tech stuff. Lewis: A lot of earnings coming in. Niu: A lot of product announcement. Lewis: Yeah,¬†a lot coming in from Apple. Let's talk a little bit about what they reported¬†in terms of numbers. Maybe we'll get into¬†some of the product discussion a little bit later on. $46.8 billion in¬†revenue on the top line,¬†more or less in line with expectations, down from $51.5 billion a year ago. But that is to be expected, we knew that was coming, no surprises there. EPS (earnings per share) at $1.67,¬†which was actually slightly above¬†what expectations were. The two¬†big numbers that people immediately¬†focus on,¬†it seems like Apple delivered¬†a pretty solid quarter. Niu: Yeah.¬†I think it was right on target. I don't think there was really any big upsides and downside surprises. The way I look at it,¬†this is the most boring quarter of all the seasons,¬†because it's right before the¬†iPhone launched. You get a couple weeks¬†of the new iPhone sales, but generally speaking, Q3 is just¬†not a super exciting time for consumer electronics companies. Lewis: You¬†mentioned the iPhone. We might as well head in¬†straight into the discussion on that¬†product. The company sold 45.5 million iPhones at an¬†ASP (average selling price) of $619. That amounts to about $28 billion in revenue, good for about 60% of Apple's top line. We've seen that trend down a little bit. I think it's¬†stabilized in the high 50s low 60s. It isn't quite the two-thirds amount it used to be. Niu: Yeah. On a trailing-12-month basis, it's still about 63%. It's still pretty far up there. One thing I did notice that was interesting was Apple did not¬†disclose this whole thing about installed base related purchases¬†that they've been doing for the past three quarters. As we talked about before, there's this effort --¬†in my opinion -- to shift attention away from unit sales. But¬†they didn't do that this time, which is weird,¬†like, are they not trying to do that anymore? Lewis: Yeah, any time you¬†introduce a new metric, especially a non-GAAP metric, you're¬†shifting attention somewhere. And for them to¬†go silent on that makes you wonder¬†exactly what's going on there. Niu: Yeah,¬†it's a weird change of tune. I've been keeping track of this number, and I was¬†expecting to plug it into my sheet,¬†and they just didn't have it. Lewis: One number I think¬†a lot of people have to be pretty optimistic about is the general trend with ASP. I said $619, that's up from the¬†previous quarter, and it seems like there's some more upside there. Niu: Right. The¬†main thing to remember is that the reason why it was down over the summer was¬†because of the iPhone SE launch, which starts at $400, which was the lowest price point that¬†Apple has ever sold an iPhone directly, even if you factor in¬†how they bring these older models down by price point every year. The lowest they'd ever gone before was, a three-year-old iPhone would go for $450. Then they came out with the SE, which starts at $400. It was a¬†pretty aggressive play to get smaller phones and first-time adopters,¬†with a lower entry price. That put a meaningful impact on ASPs, which was $595 last quarter, which was the lowest it's been in about two years. They did say on the phone, they expect ASPs to climb back up to where they were last¬†December quarter, which, for reference, was $691. So,¬†I think we should start to see that number start to push¬†$700 again, particularly if they can meet iPhone 7 Plus demand, which¬†they're having a hard time doing, because the iPhone¬†is¬†so expensive, they can increase that price by $20¬†compared to last year. The 7 Plus will really push ASPs up, I think. Lewis: And¬†part of the justification with that¬†incremental $20 on the price point was the camera. That was the major selling point,¬†and that's how management pointed to that decision. Niu: Yeah. They¬†specifically said it was the camera. They were asked about it, and they were like, "We put a ton of¬†Innovation into the dual-camera system." I do think that is¬†very specifically what's the reason for that $20. Lewis: One of¬†the things I thought was particularly interesting¬†with the commentary from this report was, you look at the services segment,¬†you look at the last couple quarters, you've seen¬†service segment revenue up 20%, and they're really touting this number. Most recently, it was $6.3 billion,¬†which is roughly 13% of revenue. At this point, we're coming up on two full years of them breaking out services as a product segment. Looking backwards, we've seen a huge step change in the fiscal Q1 quarter. In 2015¬†fiscal Q4, we were at $5.1 billion. That hopped up a full billion dollars¬†in the following quarter, fiscal Q1 2016. So,¬†I'm really curious looking forward¬†what that segment might look like. Theoretically, we should be in the step-change quarter. It'll be interesting to see if they can sustain that growth, or if we're going to continue to see them hum along at more or less flat¬†sequential growth. Niu: Yeah,¬†services is becoming huge. Like you said, it's $6.3 billion. And¬†if you look at the past four quarters, this is now basically a $25 billion business. That's bigger than the Mac, bigger than the iPad. It's their second-biggest¬†business at this point,¬†which is kind of crazy to think about, because Apple is typically not that great at¬†services in general. Particularly because the services revenue,¬†most of it is not coming from a subscription service like Apple Music that bills every month. That's¬†certainly part of it. But it comes back to what we were talking about earlier, which is the whole installed base related purchases. A lot of that services revenue comes from them relying on their users buying content and apps on the App Store reliably. That's why that number is important,¬†and I'm surprised they didn't give it. Not a whole lot of it is occurring, monthly subscription¬†fees that you can count on¬†every month. So,¬†it is important,¬†but they're doing a really good job of growing that number. It's a pretty big business now, $25 billion. Lewis: It's huge. I think, you hit on the installed base thing, if there are any issues with them growing that installed base, it stands to reason that the services segment won't continue to grow¬†the way that it has.¬†That's kind of the relationship there, and that's why you always see the step change happen in¬†fiscal Q1, because that's when they sell a ton of iPhones. You're¬†going to see those two things move together. That's certainly something that¬†I'm watching in the coming quarter, because they're¬†pointing to it more and more in their conference calls. I think it's an indication of¬†a lot of other elements of their business. Niu: Absolutely. Lewis: Looking forward¬†and looking at the guidance that they provided,¬†for the first time since physical Q1 of last year, Apple is guiding for year-over-year growth¬†next quarter, which I think is a welcome sign for a lot of investors. The company is¬†expecting revenue to come in somewhere between $76 billion and $78 billion. When we say year-over-year growth, fiscal Q1 last year, they posted revenue of $75.8 billion. So,¬†it's not going to be huge,¬†but it is positive growth. Niu: I'll take it.¬†(laughs)¬† Lewis: Yeah,¬†at this point, looking year-over-year declines for¬†a little while,¬†it's certainly a welcome trend to see. I think some people are maybe a little disappointed in this guidance, given¬†some of the tailwinds that the business has right now at its disposal. This is¬†something we've talked about in previous shows. One of the major competitors, the¬†Samsung¬†Note 7, being off the market,¬†you would think would be a much larger catalyst for Apple than maybe they're letting on. Niu: Yeah. They declined to give¬†any meaningful comment on¬†whether or not they think they'll benefit,¬†but I think pretty clearly that they will. And now there's even reports that¬†the Galaxy S7 Edge is¬†catching on fire.¬†(laughs)¬†I don't know if you've seen it, there's not as many of them. But there were reports starting¬†in September. That was a month ago. Again, it's not as widespread,¬†but there are a handful of cases¬†across the world, like in China¬†and the Philippines with the S7 Edge -- which is¬†one of the phones that Samsung is pushing people toward. And here's the crazy part --¬†one of those phone was a replacement¬†for a Galaxy Note 7. So Samsung gives a¬†customer and S7 Edge to replace his Note 7 that caught on fire, and the S7 Edge catches on fire!¬†(laughs) It's just a mess. Lewis: That's a bad brand experience there. Niu: I think,¬†going back to their guidance,¬†I do think, the one thing that stood out to me¬†as far as not so great in the guidance was¬†the gross margin guide. The revenue guidance was fine because¬†it'll be nice to get a little growth, even if it's not a lot. We had three¬†consecutive quarters of negative growth up top at this point, so I think anything is nice. On the¬†profitability side, I was surprised, too, because in the fourth quarter, Apple¬†always enjoys a lot of operating leverage when their revenue scales up to these really high levels. Usually, you see margins expanding in a pretty meaningful way,¬†usually to the point where you're at 40%. They're guiding to basically upwards of 38.5%. So, 50 basis points shy of what I would expect them to guide to. And,¬†for what it's worth, last year they did 40%. Lewis: In fairness on that 40% figure, that was also a quarter where they realized $550 million or so in a patent dispute¬†agreement with Samsung. I think that added about 40 basis points to that margin number. I think the true margin number was like 39.6% or so. Niu: But¬†if you go back another year, it was still like 39.9%. It's still pretty close to 40%. And¬†I know it doesn't sound like a lot, 50 basis points,¬†but when you're talking about a business this big, every basis point counts. One basis point is like $7.6 million. So, multiply that by 50, and that's gross profit, coming¬†straight down through the income statement. They've been talking a lot about¬†commodity costs and component costs being very favorable. So,¬†I'm wondering why that guidance wasn't stronger. It's also possible that¬†there are some currency effects,¬†because they've been battling the strengthening dollar for a really long time. That's very much hurting them,¬†because about two-thirds of revenue comes from outside the U.S. The¬†strengthening dollar has been hurting them for many quarters. So, that could also be part of it. I think that might have been why the original market reaction was negative. If¬†you're watching after hours, the stock jumped¬†on the iPhone number¬†as soon as it was released,¬†started getting back those gains as people read through the numbers and started digesting them a little bit. Lewis: Yeah, and we're¬†going to hit on that in the second half of the show,¬†also talk about a couple things that analysts are concerned about and whether they're really a cause for concern. But, before we do, I wanted to give a shout-out to our friends at criquetshirts.com. Criquet makes comfortable and¬†sharp-looking polo shirts that perfectly mix old-school style and modern design.

This¬†came up in the conference call from a couple different folks. I've seen some people worried about what's going on with the R&D spend, research and development side of Apple's expenses, and what's going on in China for them. Do you want to hit on that a little bit? Niu: I think there are some questions about, why is R&D expenditure growth growing at this¬†accelerated pace? Apple is really good at¬†efficiently spending on R&D. A few years ago, it used to¬†always be 2% to 3% of revenue range, which is tiny. A lot of other tech companies are like 10% to 15%.¬†Google¬†and¬†Microsoft,¬†that's how much they spend of their revenue on R&D. It's not as if the more you spend, the more innovative. It's not linear. It can be¬†wasteful sometimes, if you're spending on projects¬†that you never actually commercialize,¬†which I think Microsoft has a tendency to do. Apple has always been really good at only really¬†putting this money into things they know they can commercialize later on. But now, in the past few quarters, we're seeing this number rise to this 5% to 6% of sales,¬†at the same time that revenue is slowing down, so there's a lot of questions of, "What's going on here?" The¬†obvious answer is, they're¬†spending money on these things for the pipeline that they won't talk about. Lewis: Which is maddening as an investor. They're like, "Don't worry, we're spending it well, we're allocating resources great, just trust us." Niu: "Just trust us." Yeah. There was this talk of a car, and clearly a car is¬†incredibly expensive to develop. Who knows if they actually do it, there's¬†all these conflicting reports on where¬†Apple is or is not heading with this car idea. But,¬†that is certainly, as far as expenses go,¬†extremely expensive on the R&D front. There's things like augmented reality, virtual reality, AI. There are a lot of things Apple is certainly exploring here, but they can't talk about. So, there's a real question, I think, at this point. Yeah, we know they're spending this money,¬†and we can probably guess on what,¬†based not only on where Apple-specific rumors are coming from,¬†but also where the tech industry is going. We know,¬†everyone is working on these things. So the real question will be, can they do these things, and when they do launch them, will they be compelling, will they be better than everyone else's? Will they actually drive the business even more? And you just have to wait. Lewis: Yeah,¬†unfortunately it's a wait-and-see type of thing¬†for investors. I'm not¬†freaking out about it yet,¬†but I think it's a good thing to monitor. Niu: Definitely. Lewis: What about¬†what's going on in China? Niu: China, there was this big thing, sales were down 30%. Last quarter, they were down 33%. The¬†quarter before that, they were down 26%. If you just look at these year-over-year numbers, it looks really bad. But you have to realize, they're just facing tough comps, because they did so well in 2015. If you zoom out a little bit and look at their business on an annual basis, this is still a $46 billion business in China. Last year, it was a $50-plus billion business. And the year before, it was like $20-something billion. This is still¬†very much headed in the right direction. I used to track their "Greater China" sales¬†before they actually broke it out¬†and exposed it in this lush detail. If you go back to fiscal 2009, I think, they did less than $1 billion in sales that year. You'd have to¬†basically stitch these numbers together from conference call comments, which I used to do. Now they give it to you directly. But I used to dig these numbers up. I think it was $900 million in fiscal 2009. That was seven years ago. Now they're basically $45 [billion] to $50 billion. You can't argue with the long-term trajectory of it. And there's still a lot of room to grow; this is¬†nowhere near the end game. China is still¬†nowhere near saturated, there's still tons of first-time smartphone buyers. The middle class is still booming. There's just a couple of tough comparisons¬†because they did so well last year. I wouldn't worry too much. It's just this noisy, quarterly trends, quarter to quarter, it's tough to call. And yeah, there's certainly some competition coming in from these lower-end Android makers like¬†Xiaomi and all these other local players. At the same time, I don't think there's a lot to worry about. There's still a lot of room to grow in terms of physical geographic footprint. They don't have that many stores, still, they only have about 40 stores or so. I don't think there's anything to worry about, even if these past few quarters look scary on paper. Lewis: Yeah, if you choose to look at their¬†numbers on a two-year comp instead of a year-over-year comp,¬†they look pretty darn impressive, right? Niu: Right. Lewis: So,¬†that's something to keep in mind. In my eyes,¬†pretty solid quarter. They met expectations, they set guidance that¬†put them back on to¬†at least some sort of growth,¬†for at least the next quarter. We had a listener tweet,¬†and I think this is something that probably a lot of people are wondering, you say, "OK,¬†they checked the boxes in a lot of ways. Why are they down¬†2.5%¬†since they reported?" The¬†initial reaction when you saw iPhone units was positive,¬†and pretty much after that they've¬†fallen off and haven't really recovered. Two-and-a-half percent is nothing to go crazy panicked over,¬†but I think it's a valid question,¬†and it's something a lot of people are wondering. What do you think? Niu: I think it was just kind of in line with expectations. It's¬†always hard to know how the market is going to react. It's not always just about with the actual consensus number is, it's also about the whispered number,¬†which is this abstract concept¬†of what people actually think. That's the way that analysts work. Investors talk up this whispered number, "Oh, this is what I have on my official estimates, but I think they'll probably go lower, or higher..." So,¬†it's always hard to gauge what's actually going to happen. 2% is not a killer move in either direction. I think¬†it was more of just a lack of being impressed, if that makes sense. We talked about the¬†gross margin guide wasn't super great. People just have to start accepting that Apple is just not a growth machine anymore, and that's OK. But¬†some people have trouble with that just because¬†it's kind of boring, for it to not be a growth machine. Lewis: Yeah. And, in fairness, this is a company that has, historically,¬†provided relatively¬†conservative guidance. You almost never see them miss their own guidance marks. They typically meet it or are¬†surprised pretty comfortably. So, to show¬†them projecting growth means they¬†must be pretty confident that that's going to happen. They do have some nice tailwinds to support that, like I said, they have one of the biggest¬†competitors off the market, and they also benefit this quarter from a 14-week Q1 instead of a 13-week Q1. So, that should help them out a little bit, a couple extra selling days there. But, by and large, there's¬†nothing in this report from my end, that really changes my thesis on this company. Niu: They do¬†pretty much always get within their guidance. It's not like the old days, when they would put out this laughably low¬†guidance number, a lowball that¬†you could basically ignore. A few years ago, they changed to really be more honest, to¬†actually give a range that they're pretty confident they'll get within. And,¬†for the most part, they have, every quarter, more or less. I definitely¬†take their guidance at face value these days versus the old days,¬†when you could basically just laugh it off because it was a joke. I think¬†maybe that's another reason why¬†they weren't as impressed. Maybe, like you mentioned, there's an extra week in this quarter. If the revenue growth is because you get an extra week, that doesn't really¬†inspire a lot of confidence in the business. Again,¬†it's not like it's a terrible business. But if you're looking skeptically, you could say, "Oh, you're only going to grow because you had more days to sell in the quarter." Maybe that's another thing people were¬†disappointed in. Lewis: Even then, returning to a flat quarter, in my eyes, is great. We've seen this down trend for such a long time that seeing them get back to, whether it's zero or positive growth, it's pretty fantastic. Anything else before I let you go, Evan?

Reuters/Stefan Wermuth One of the best things about the iPhone is its cameras. Apple makes it a point to improve its flagship smartphone‚Äôs shooters on every new model. But what exactly sets the cameras of the latest iPhone 7 cameras apart from those of the iPhone 6s? A number of Apple iPhone users buy the mobile device because of the quality photos it produces. In fact, four out of five cameras used on popular image hosting site Flickr are iPhones. Let‚Äôs break down the camera specs and features of the iPhone 6s and the new iPhone 7. The main shooter of the iPhone 6s is a 12 MP f/2.2 camera with phase detection autofocus and dual-LED flash. The iPhone 7 also sports a 12 MP primary camera, but with an f/1.8 aperture. The wider lens absorbs 60 percent more light. According to Trusted Reviews, this makes the iPhone 7 better at low-light photography. Another major difference is that the iPhone 7 camera has optical image stabilisation and quad-LED flash, both of which the iPhone 6s lacks. Optical image stabilisation works great at coping with shaky hands and jolts to produce steady shots. Both Apple smartphones‚Äô main cameras have support for 4K video and 8 MP image recording, as well as touch focus, face detection and HDR features. The secondary camera of the iPhone 7 is a notch above that of the iPhone 6s. The new iPhone model has a 7 MP f/2.2 front-facing camera while the older variant only equips a 5 MP f/2.2 secondary snapper. This basically means that selfie shots and FaceTime sessions are better with the iPhone 7. Both secondary cameras have face detection, HDR and panorama features. Both are able to produce 1080p videos at 30 frames per second and 720p videos at 240 frames per second as well. The new iPhone 7 is definitely better than the iPhone 6s when it comes to cameras. Apple certainly made sure that its new flagship smartphone is worth the upgrade.

Even if those backups are disabled, he added, the call logs continue making their way to the iCloud, Katalov said,‚Äù Fox-Brewster reports. ‚Äú‚ÄòSyncing call logs happens almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours,‚Äô he added. ‚ÄòBut all you need to have is just iCloud Drive enabled, and there is no way to turn that syncing off, apart from just disabling iCloud Drive completely. In that case many applications will stop working or lose iCloud-related features completely.'‚Äù Fox-Brewster reports, ‚ÄúApple said the syncing did exist, a spokesperson explaining: ‚ÄòWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers‚Äô data. That‚Äôs why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.'‚Äù ‚ÄúJonathan Zdziarski, a noted iOS forensics expert, told FORBES he believed Elcomsoft‚Äôs find was new and of concern, but was likely down to Apple oversight,‚Äù Fox-Brewster reports. ‚ÄúZdziarski said the research should give Apple further encouragement to add proper end-to-end encryption to the iCloud.‚Äù Read more in the full article here.

Loading... Comment Feed 11 Comments Krioni Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 10:40 am ¬∑ Reply Yeah. End-to-end encryption is needed, ASAP. One of the places Democrats and Republicans largely agree is that federal agencies should be allowed to spy on Americans. And, that is NOT one of the areas where ‚Äúrebel‚Äù Trump disagrees with the establishment. From what he‚Äôs said, he‚Äôd push it even harder. Speedplay Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 10:42 am ¬∑ Reply ‚Ä¶And that‚Äôs not all! For anyone who uses Apple mail and does a clean install, guess what they find under ‚ÄúPrevious Recipients‚Äù? Answer: The names and e-mail addresses of everyone with whom they‚Äôve ever exchanged e-mail with, despite the user ‚Äúdeleting‚Äù these names and e-mail addresses. Don‚Äôt let Apple fool you: They are like every company: Gathering information for the government while feigning righteous indignation over privacy rights! Yeah, right! When I think of Apple, I can‚Äôt help but be struck by the irony of its famous Super Bowl commercial about 1984. For anyone who thinks Apple isn‚Äôt collecting data on you, I have some prime swampland for sell. MacObserver Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 11:48 am ¬∑ Reply Cue the Apple apologists who think that Apple cares about your privacy. iCloud is just like any other rented server ‚Äî as soon as you put your data in someone else‚Äôs hands, it will be datamined. Apple claims to secure your data, but iCloud users don‚Äôt actually know how, or when, the many loopholes in the user contract kick in. Predrag Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 12:12 pm ¬∑ Reply I have yet to hear a case where Apple handed over iCloud information to any government entity without a fight (and full public disclosure). I do remember that there were instances where government came with a warrant, and where date wasn‚Äôt encrypted, they complied, and those cases are fully documented. Be that as it may, as suggested above, full, end-to-end encryption, same as in iOS now, should be the only way Apple can stay consistent with their claims of protecting the privacy of the consumers. As for call, contact and other private data in the cloud, So far, Apple has led us to believe that nobody but Apple (and the actual consumer) ever gets to see or use that data, not even in aggregate. Unlike Google, for whom their users are their product which they sell to their paying customers (advertising networks), for Apple, the user is the actual paying customer, so there should be no need to sell any customer information to anyone. So far, nothing suggests that Apple had been doing that. Krioni Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 4:15 pm ¬∑ Reply Predrag, Apple‚Äôs official policy is that, when given a subpoena, they deliver what data they can. That includes entire iCloud backup files, which they can and do decrypt. That‚Äôs why end-to-end encryption is needed. They would then be able to honestly say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt decrypt it for you.‚Äù Furthermore, subpoenas and especially National Security Letters often come with a restriction where the company is forbidden from telling the public that data was collected. Apple‚Äôs hands are tied there, at least until they build in end-to-end encryption. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important. The bad news is that it is possible for a (stupid/evil) government to outlaw end-to-end encryption. That could really throw a wrench into things. Xennex1170 Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 7:52 pm ¬∑ Reply Not sure how end-to-end encryption could work for call logs in the iCloud since those are ‚Äòowned‚Äô by the communications company which can be subpoenaed. pluckytree Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 12:32 pm ¬∑ Reply https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303 See the entry for iCloud Drive. It‚Äôs been there for awhile, at least a year. iGads Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 12:43 pm ¬∑ Reply Like this is news? Every land line phone and cell phone provider has a log of every call you‚Äôve ever made. The difference is Apple will not hand any collected information easily and surely not without a court order. As for the rest of the companies‚Ä¶..whenever anyone asks. Mike Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 4:35 pm ¬∑ Reply You imagine a difference where there is none. It is amazing how much faith is given to Apple when there isn‚Äôt a shred of evidence to indicate that Apple does anything different with your files than any other cloud purveyor or telecommunications company. Go ahead a pull up videos showing the baseless claims that Cook makes about Apple respecting user privacy ‚Äî he talks a great game. But that‚Äôs just show. This is the same dude who has an impressive pipeline that he raves about too. Real trustworthy. What does the user agreement say? It is comprehensive: all that you upload belongs to Apple. Then Apple rents servers from Amazon, Google, and others. You assume it‚Äôs encrypted, but you can‚Äôt actually prove it, and since you didn‚Äôt encrypt it, why would you assume that Apple doesn‚Äôt holds the keys to open anything of yours on the iCloud, and use it to their profit? That is all Apple does these days, maximize profit. Users be damned. Gollum Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 12:57 pm ¬∑ Reply And so people get upity on something that that has been happening for years, elsewhere. I tend to believe this is a part of a service, Apple is providing to me, instead of the government. This is effectively meta data. We all know what happens to meta data. So Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 7:39 pm ¬∑ Reply Ah yes I‚Äôve noticed this. When I travel, I keep my home SIM card in a 4S at home while I take my 6 away with me. If I get a call on my 4S back home, the logs are synchronised across all my devices. I can see the rationale, perhaps the implementation needs to be improved.

Apple reported earnings last week. Two Fools examine the major segments' performances, digest the guidance the company offered up, and discuss some issues analysts raised during the conference call. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 17, 2016 at 4:23PM Last month, Apple¬†(NASDAQ:AAPL) reported modest earnings for the third quarter, but the stock dropped 2.5% shortly after the call. On this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, analyst Dylan Lewis and Fool contributor Evan Niu discuss the most important numbers from the call and what they mean for the company in the long term, and why the stock fell on what was a better-than-average quarter for the tech giant. Also, they examine how Apple is growing in China, how much the Samsung Note 7 fiasco might affect Apple's next few quarters, what analysts are most concerned about with the Q3 report, and more. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 28, 2016. Dylan Lewis: This episode of Industry Focus is brought to you by Criquet.

Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It is Friday,¬†Oct. 28. Happy birthday, mom! We're¬†going to run through the¬†Apple¬†earnings¬†report. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan,¬†how's it going? Evan Niu: Busy week, a lot of tech stuff. Lewis: A lot of earnings coming in. Niu: A lot of product announcement. Lewis: Yeah,¬†a lot coming in from Apple. Let's talk a little bit about what they reported¬†in terms of numbers. Maybe we'll get into¬†some of the product discussion a little bit later on. $46.8 billion in¬†revenue on the top line,¬†more or less in line with expectations, down from $51.5 billion a year ago. But that is to be expected, we knew that was coming, no surprises there. EPS (earnings per share) at $1.67,¬†which was actually slightly above¬†what expectations were. The two¬†big numbers that people immediately¬†focus on,¬†it seems like Apple delivered¬†a pretty solid quarter. Niu: Yeah.¬†I think it was right on target. I don't think there was really any big upsides and downside surprises. The way I look at it,¬†this is the most boring quarter of all the seasons,¬†because it's right before the¬†iPhone launched. You get a couple weeks¬†of the new iPhone sales, but generally speaking, Q3 is just¬†not a super exciting time for consumer electronics companies. Lewis: You¬†mentioned the iPhone. We might as well head in¬†straight into the discussion on that¬†product. The company sold 45.5 million iPhones at an¬†ASP (average selling price) of $619. That amounts to about $28 billion in revenue, good for about 60% of Apple's top line. We've seen that trend down a little bit. I think it's¬†stabilized in the high 50s low 60s. It isn't quite the two-thirds amount it used to be. Niu: Yeah. On a trailing-12-month basis, it's still about 63%. It's still pretty far up there. One thing I did notice that was interesting was Apple did not¬†disclose this whole thing about installed base related purchases¬†that they've been doing for the past three quarters. As we talked about before, there's this effort --¬†in my opinion -- to shift attention away from unit sales. But¬†they didn't do that this time, which is weird,¬†like, are they not trying to do that anymore? Lewis: Yeah, any time you¬†introduce a new metric, especially a non-GAAP metric, you're¬†shifting attention somewhere. And for them to¬†go silent on that makes you wonder¬†exactly what's going on there. Niu: Yeah,¬†it's a weird change of tune. I've been keeping track of this number, and I was¬†expecting to plug it into my sheet,¬†and they just didn't have it. Lewis: One number I think¬†a lot of people have to be pretty optimistic about is the general trend with ASP. I said $619, that's up from the¬†previous quarter, and it seems like there's some more upside there. Niu: Right. The¬†main thing to remember is that the reason why it was down over the summer was¬†because of the iPhone SE launch, which starts at $400, which was the lowest price point that¬†Apple has ever sold an iPhone directly, even if you factor in¬†how they bring these older models down by price point every year. The lowest they'd ever gone before was, a three-year-old iPhone would go for $450. Then they came out with the SE, which starts at $400. It was a¬†pretty aggressive play to get smaller phones and first-time adopters,¬†with a lower entry price. That put a meaningful impact on ASPs, which was $595 last quarter, which was the lowest it's been in about two years. They did say on the phone, they expect ASPs to climb back up to where they were last¬†December quarter, which, for reference, was $691. So,¬†I think we should start to see that number start to push¬†$700 again, particularly if they can meet iPhone 7 Plus demand, which¬†they're having a hard time doing, because the iPhone¬†is¬†so expensive, they can increase that price by $20¬†compared to last year. The 7 Plus will really push ASPs up, I think. Lewis: And¬†part of the justification with that¬†incremental $20 on the price point was the camera. That was the major selling point,¬†and that's how management pointed to that decision. Niu: Yeah. They¬†specifically said it was the camera. They were asked about it, and they were like, "We put a ton of¬†Innovation into the dual-camera system." I do think that is¬†very specifically what's the reason for that $20. Lewis: One of¬†the things I thought was particularly interesting¬†with the commentary from this report was, you look at the services segment,¬†you look at the last couple quarters, you've seen¬†service segment revenue up 20%, and they're really touting this number. Most recently, it was $6.3 billion,¬†which is roughly 13% of revenue. At this point, we're coming up on two full years of them breaking out services as a product segment. Looking backwards, we've seen a huge step change in the fiscal Q1 quarter. In 2015¬†fiscal Q4, we were at $5.1 billion. That hopped up a full billion dollars¬†in the following quarter, fiscal Q1 2016. So,¬†I'm really curious looking forward¬†what that segment might look like. Theoretically, we should be in the step-change quarter. It'll be interesting to see if they can sustain that growth, or if we're going to continue to see them hum along at more or less flat¬†sequential growth. Niu: Yeah,¬†services is becoming huge. Like you said, it's $6.3 billion. And¬†if you look at the past four quarters, this is now basically a $25 billion business. That's bigger than the Mac, bigger than the iPad. It's their second-biggest¬†business at this point,¬†which is kind of crazy to think about, because Apple is typically not that great at¬†services in general. Particularly because the services revenue,¬†most of it is not coming from a subscription service like Apple Music that bills every month. That's¬†certainly part of it. But it comes back to what we were talking about earlier, which is the whole installed base related purchases. A lot of that services revenue comes from them relying on their users buying content and apps on the App Store reliably. That's why that number is important,¬†and I'm surprised they didn't give it. Not a whole lot of it is occurring, monthly subscription¬†fees that you can count on¬†every month. So,¬†it is important,¬†but they're doing a really good job of growing that number. It's a pretty big business now, $25 billion. Lewis: It's huge. I think, you hit on the installed base thing, if there are any issues with them growing that installed base, it stands to reason that the services segment won't continue to grow¬†the way that it has.¬†That's kind of the relationship there, and that's why you always see the step change happen in¬†fiscal Q1, because that's when they sell a ton of iPhones. You're¬†going to see those two things move together. That's certainly something that¬†I'm watching in the coming quarter, because they're¬†pointing to it more and more in their conference calls. I think it's an indication of¬†a lot of other elements of their business. Niu: Absolutely. Lewis: Looking forward¬†and looking at the guidance that they provided,¬†for the first time since physical Q1 of last year, Apple is guiding for year-over-year growth¬†next quarter, which I think is a welcome sign for a lot of investors. The company is¬†expecting revenue to come in somewhere between $76 billion and $78 billion. When we say year-over-year growth, fiscal Q1 last year, they posted revenue of $75.8 billion. So,¬†it's not going to be huge,¬†but it is positive growth. Niu: I'll take it.¬†(laughs)¬† Lewis: Yeah,¬†at this point, looking year-over-year declines for¬†a little while,¬†it's certainly a welcome trend to see. I think some people are maybe a little disappointed in this guidance, given¬†some of the tailwinds that the business has right now at its disposal. This is¬†something we've talked about in previous shows. One of the major competitors, the¬†Samsung¬†Note 7, being off the market,¬†you would think would be a much larger catalyst for Apple than maybe they're letting on. Niu: Yeah. They declined to give¬†any meaningful comment on¬†whether or not they think they'll benefit,¬†but I think pretty clearly that they will. And now there's even reports that¬†the Galaxy S7 Edge is¬†catching on fire.¬†(laughs)¬†I don't know if you've seen it, there's not as many of them. But there were reports starting¬†in September. That was a month ago. Again, it's not as widespread,¬†but there are a handful of cases¬†across the world, like in China¬†and the Philippines with the S7 Edge -- which is¬†one of the phones that Samsung is pushing people toward. And here's the crazy part --¬†one of those phone was a replacement¬†for a Galaxy Note 7. So Samsung gives a¬†customer and S7 Edge to replace his Note 7 that caught on fire, and the S7 Edge catches on fire!¬†(laughs) It's just a mess. Lewis: That's a bad brand experience there. Niu: I think,¬†going back to their guidance,¬†I do think, the one thing that stood out to me¬†as far as not so great in the guidance was¬†the gross margin guide. The revenue guidance was fine because¬†it'll be nice to get a little growth, even if it's not a lot. We had three¬†consecutive quarters of negative growth up top at this point, so I think anything is nice. On the¬†profitability side, I was surprised, too, because in the fourth quarter, Apple¬†always enjoys a lot of operating leverage when their revenue scales up to these really high levels. Usually, you see margins expanding in a pretty meaningful way,¬†usually to the point where you're at 40%. They're guiding to basically upwards of 38.5%. So, 50 basis points shy of what I would expect them to guide to. And,¬†for what it's worth, last year they did 40%. Lewis: In fairness on that 40% figure, that was also a quarter where they realized $550 million or so in a patent dispute¬†agreement with Samsung. I think that added about 40 basis points to that margin number. I think the true margin number was like 39.6% or so. Niu: But¬†if you go back another year, it was still like 39.9%. It's still pretty close to 40%. And¬†I know it doesn't sound like a lot, 50 basis points,¬†but when you're talking about a business this big, every basis point counts. One basis point is like $7.6 million. So, multiply that by 50, and that's gross profit, coming¬†straight down through the income statement. They've been talking a lot about¬†commodity costs and component costs being very favorable. So,¬†I'm wondering why that guidance wasn't stronger. It's also possible that¬†there are some currency effects,¬†because they've been battling the strengthening dollar for a really long time. That's very much hurting them,¬†because about two-thirds of revenue comes from outside the U.S. The¬†strengthening dollar has been hurting them for many quarters. So, that could also be part of it. I think that might have been why the original market reaction was negative. If¬†you're watching after hours, the stock jumped¬†on the iPhone number¬†as soon as it was released,¬†started getting back those gains as people read through the numbers and started digesting them a little bit. Lewis: Yeah, and we're¬†going to hit on that in the second half of the show,¬†also talk about a couple things that analysts are concerned about and whether they're really a cause for concern. But, before we do, I wanted to give a shout-out to our friends at criquetshirts.com. Criquet makes comfortable and¬†sharp-looking polo shirts that perfectly mix old-school style and modern design.

This¬†came up in the conference call from a couple different folks. I've seen some people worried about what's going on with the R&D spend, research and development side of Apple's expenses, and what's going on in China for them. Do you want to hit on that a little bit? Niu: I think there are some questions about, why is R&D expenditure growth growing at this¬†accelerated pace? Apple is really good at¬†efficiently spending on R&D. A few years ago, it used to¬†always be 2% to 3% of revenue range, which is tiny. A lot of other tech companies are like 10% to 15%.¬†Google¬†and¬†Microsoft,¬†that's how much they spend of their revenue on R&D. It's not as if the more you spend, the more innovative. It's not linear. It can be¬†wasteful sometimes, if you're spending on projects¬†that you never actually commercialize,¬†which I think Microsoft has a tendency to do. Apple has always been really good at only really¬†putting this money into things they know they can commercialize later on. But now, in the past few quarters, we're seeing this number rise to this 5% to 6% of sales,¬†at the same time that revenue is slowing down, so there's a lot of questions of, "What's going on here?" The¬†obvious answer is, they're¬†spending money on these things for the pipeline that they won't talk about. Lewis: Which is maddening as an investor. They're like, "Don't worry, we're spending it well, we're allocating resources great, just trust us." Niu: "Just trust us." Yeah. There was this talk of a car, and clearly a car is¬†incredibly expensive to develop. Who knows if they actually do it, there's¬†all these conflicting reports on where¬†Apple is or is not heading with this car idea. But,¬†that is certainly, as far as expenses go,¬†extremely expensive on the R&D front. There's things like augmented reality, virtual reality, AI. There are a lot of things Apple is certainly exploring here, but they can't talk about. So, there's a real question, I think, at this point. Yeah, we know they're spending this money,¬†and we can probably guess on what,¬†based not only on where Apple-specific rumors are coming from,¬†but also where the tech industry is going. We know,¬†everyone is working on these things. So the real question will be, can they do these things, and when they do launch them, will they be compelling, will they be better than everyone else's? Will they actually drive the business even more? And you just have to wait. Lewis: Yeah,¬†unfortunately it's a wait-and-see type of thing¬†for investors. I'm not¬†freaking out about it yet,¬†but I think it's a good thing to monitor. Niu: Definitely. Lewis: What about¬†what's going on in China? Niu: China, there was this big thing, sales were down 30%. Last quarter, they were down 33%. The¬†quarter before that, they were down 26%. If you just look at these year-over-year numbers, it looks really bad. But you have to realize, they're just facing tough comps, because they did so well in 2015. If you zoom out a little bit and look at their business on an annual basis, this is still a $46 billion business in China. Last year, it was a $50-plus billion business. And the year before, it was like $20-something billion. This is still¬†very much headed in the right direction. I used to track their "Greater China" sales¬†before they actually broke it out¬†and exposed it in this lush detail. If you go back to fiscal 2009, I think, they did less than $1 billion in sales that year. You'd have to¬†basically stitch these numbers together from conference call comments, which I used to do. Now they give it to you directly. But I used to dig these numbers up. I think it was $900 million in fiscal 2009. That was seven years ago. Now they're basically $45 [billion] to $50 billion. You can't argue with the long-term trajectory of it. And there's still a lot of room to grow; this is¬†nowhere near the end game. China is still¬†nowhere near saturated, there's still tons of first-time smartphone buyers. The middle class is still booming. There's just a couple of tough comparisons¬†because they did so well last year. I wouldn't worry too much. It's just this noisy, quarterly trends, quarter to quarter, it's tough to call. And yeah, there's certainly some competition coming in from these lower-end Android makers like¬†Xiaomi and all these other local players. At the same time, I don't think there's a lot to worry about. There's still a lot of room to grow in terms of physical geographic footprint. They don't have that many stores, still, they only have about 40 stores or so. I don't think there's anything to worry about, even if these past few quarters look scary on paper. Lewis: Yeah, if you choose to look at their¬†numbers on a two-year comp instead of a year-over-year comp,¬†they look pretty darn impressive, right? Niu: Right. Lewis: So,¬†that's something to keep in mind. In my eyes,¬†pretty solid quarter. They met expectations, they set guidance that¬†put them back on to¬†at least some sort of growth,¬†for at least the next quarter. We had a listener tweet,¬†and I think this is something that probably a lot of people are wondering, you say, "OK,¬†they checked the boxes in a lot of ways. Why are they down¬†2.5%¬†since they reported?" The¬†initial reaction when you saw iPhone units was positive,¬†and pretty much after that they've¬†fallen off and haven't really recovered. Two-and-a-half percent is nothing to go crazy panicked over,¬†but I think it's a valid question,¬†and it's something a lot of people are wondering. What do you think? Niu: I think it was just kind of in line with expectations. It's¬†always hard to know how the market is going to react. It's not always just about with the actual consensus number is, it's also about the whispered number,¬†which is this abstract concept¬†of what people actually think. That's the way that analysts work. Investors talk up this whispered number, "Oh, this is what I have on my official estimates, but I think they'll probably go lower, or higher..." So,¬†it's always hard to gauge what's actually going to happen. 2% is not a killer move in either direction. I think¬†it was more of just a lack of being impressed, if that makes sense. We talked about the¬†gross margin guide wasn't super great. People just have to start accepting that Apple is just not a growth machine anymore, and that's OK. But¬†some people have trouble with that just because¬†it's kind of boring, for it to not be a growth machine. Lewis: Yeah. And, in fairness, this is a company that has, historically,¬†provided relatively¬†conservative guidance. You almost never see them miss their own guidance marks. They typically meet it or are¬†surprised pretty comfortably. So, to show¬†them projecting growth means they¬†must be pretty confident that that's going to happen. They do have some nice tailwinds to support that, like I said, they have one of the biggest¬†competitors off the market, and they also benefit this quarter from a 14-week Q1 instead of a 13-week Q1. So, that should help them out a little bit, a couple extra selling days there. But, by and large, there's¬†nothing in this report from my end, that really changes my thesis on this company. Niu: They do¬†pretty much always get within their guidance. It's not like the old days, when they would put out this laughably low¬†guidance number, a lowball that¬†you could basically ignore. A few years ago, they changed to really be more honest, to¬†actually give a range that they're pretty confident they'll get within. And,¬†for the most part, they have, every quarter, more or less. I definitely¬†take their guidance at face value these days versus the old days,¬†when you could basically just laugh it off because it was a joke. I think¬†maybe that's another reason why¬†they weren't as impressed. Maybe, like you mentioned, there's an extra week in this quarter. If the revenue growth is because you get an extra week, that doesn't really¬†inspire a lot of confidence in the business. Again,¬†it's not like it's a terrible business. But if you're looking skeptically, you could say, "Oh, you're only going to grow because you had more days to sell in the quarter." Maybe that's another thing people were¬†disappointed in. Lewis: Even then, returning to a flat quarter, in my eyes, is great. We've seen this down trend for such a long time that seeing them get back to, whether it's zero or positive growth, it's pretty fantastic. Anything else before I let you go, Evan? Niu: No,¬†I think¬†we covered their earnings pretty well. Lewis: All right.¬†Well, listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.

Disconnect from iCloud 17 Nov 2016 at 21:28, Thomas Claburn Thomas Claburn Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Software Recent Articles Surveillance camera compromised in 98 seconds Windows cmd.exe deposed by PowerShell Microsoft ‚ù§Ô∏è Linux? Microsoft ‚ù§Ô∏è running its Windows' SQL Server software on Linux Apple's effort to avoid becoming an on-demand data dispensary for authorities faces unlikely saboteurs: The company's commitment to convenience and its customers' preference for the same. Russian digital forensics company Elcomsoft on Thursday published a blog post claiming that Apple's iCloud sync service stores phone call logs without user notification or consent. "Using an iPhone and have an active iCloud account?" said Elcomsoft researcher Oleg Afonin. "Your calls will sync with iCloud whether you want it or not." That's not entirely accurate. If you don't want any data sent to iCloud, you can disable iCloud. The problem is that iCloud makes iPhone usage easier, by synchronizing contacts, calendar entries, photos, and the like. Syncing call logs makes call data available to other Apple devices signed in using the same Apple ID. While Apple may not have publicized this consequence of iCloud synchronization, it also hasn't attempted to conceal it. In its May 2016 paper on iOS Security [PDF], the company notes that iCloud sync captures call history, iMessage, text (SMS), MMS messages, and HealthKit data, among other things. In September, The¬†Intercept reported that Apple stores logs of iMessage conversations. Afonin points out that Google and Microsoft perform similar call syncing with Android 6.0+ and Windows 10 Mobile, respectively. And it's worth noting that call logs can also be obtained from communications service providers, many of which have shown far more willingness to cooperate with authorities than Apple. In a statement emailed to The¬†Register, a Apple spokesperson said, "We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data. That's why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends that all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication." Apple has made a point of defending customer privacy, going so far as to embrace ignorance of iOS users' device encryption keys. "For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an encryption key that is tied to the user's passcode, which Apple does not possess," the company explains on its website. Apple's stance has put the company at odds with the FBI, which sought to compel the company to cooperate in the decryption of an iPhone associated with an act of terror, before opting to exploit a vulnerability to gain access to the device. And it has also underscored the narrow confines of privacy in Apple's ecosystem. Apple may refuse to assist authorities in breaking into customers' iOS devices, but it, like any other cloud service provider, says it will comply with lawful demands for information stored on its servers. iCloud, like other cloud services associated with mobile devices and applications, is a backdoor for any transmitted data, for those who haven't disabled it. This might be less of an issue if Apple customers knowingly signed on. Apple's Legal Process Guidelines [PDF] for US law enforcement suggest as much: "iCloud only stores content for the services that the subscriber has elected to maintain in the account while the subscriber's account remains active," the guidelines state. But iCloud activation doesn't involve detailed notice. And judging by the confused customers asking about iCloud synchronization in Apple forums, there's not much informed consent. Apple could provide specific warnings about call log retention and could provide a more granular mechanism to opt out. But Apple customers would have to care enough about privacy to opt-out. Apple is said to be working on stronger data privacy measures for iCloud backups of iOS device data, but it's not yet clear whether other data stored in iCloud will be more secure as a result. ¬Æ Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 25 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Because it's positioned as an art piece, Apple's "Designed by Apple in California" book costs a jaw dropping $200 to $300 depending on size, so we thought we'd take a look inside to see just what you're getting for that price tag. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Aside from a dedication page dedicating the book to former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, a foreword by Apple design chief Jony Ive, and an insert with product descriptions, the book is text-free, filled with large, high-quality images of Apple products. There are 450 images in total, with multiple photographs of each item to highlight its design process. It starts with the 1998 iMac, one of the first products Ive designed at Apple, and ends with the 2015 Apple Pencil. According to Apple, it took eight years to design the linen-bound hardcover book, which features specially milled, custom-dyed paper with "gilded matte silver edges," and low-ghost ink. As can be seen in the video, the book is of the highest quality with gorgeous photographs, but its price limits its appeal to the general public. "Designed by Apple in California" can only be purchased from the online Apple Store and at select Apple retail locations around the world. It's priced at $199 for a 10.2x12.8 inch version, and $299 for a 13x16.3 inch version.

Samsung‚Äôs decline is unsurprising, given the furor over the overheated batteries in its Galaxy Note7s that surfaced in late August, leading to a global recall of millions of the devices. ‚ÄúThe decision to withdraw the Galaxy Note7 was correct, but the damage to Samsung‚Äôs brand will make it harder for the company to increase smartphone sales in the short term,‚Äù said Anshul Gupta, research director for Gartner, which released the smartphone third-quarter sales numbers on Thursday. Gupta said it will be ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù for the expected Galaxy S8 smartphone to launch successfully so that customers and partners can regain trust in the brand. The currently available Galaxy S7 was released in March. Samsung‚Äôs overall 14.2% smartphone decline in the third quarter was its worst performance ever, worse than the Samsung smartphone drop of 12.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014, Gartner said. Apple‚Äôs iPhone decline is another matter, since its smartphone hasn‚Äôt befallen a disaster like Samsung's overheated batteries. Gartner said iPhone sales continued to fall in the third quarter, with a 6.6% decline. That meant Apple accounted for 11.5% of the smartphone market, its lowest share since the first quarter of 2009. iPhones sales showing declines in two of its biggest markets, dropping by 8.5% in the U.S., and by 31% in China. Gartner said the iPhone 7 has struggled to stimulate sales of smartphone replacements as Apple has wanted. The lack of smartphone success in the third quarter by U.S.-based Apple and South Korea-based Samsung is largely due to competition from Chinese vendors. Huawei, Oppo and BBK of China accounted for 21% of the smartphones sold to end users worldwide in the third quarter, Gartner said. They were the only smartphones in the top five to increase their sales and market share. For Oppo, 81% of its smartphone sales for the quarter were in China, as were 89% of BBK's, Gartner said. Both vendors also saw growth in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia. Gartner‚Äôs rank and share for the top five vendors for third quarter put Samsung in first with a 19.2% share; Apple in second with 11.5%; Huawei in third with 8.7% ; Oppo in fourth with 6.7%; and BBK in fifth with 5.3%. Total sales were 373 million units, a 5.4% increase over the third quarter of 2015. Gartner noted that Huawei is closing the gap on Apple, largely due to its feature-packed Honor smartphones. Huawei‚Äôs ongoing expansion into Europe and the U.S. will also help. In late October, IDC reported that global smartphone shipments to retailers were up 1% for the third quarter over a year earlier, reaching 362.9 million. IDC said the long-term impact of the Note7 recall remains to be seen. ‚ÄúThe recall of the Note7 represents an industrywide wake-up call that will undoubtedly lead to a more vigorous testing and certification process moving forward,‚Äù IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella said in a statement.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (37) Post your comment Only one of three 2017 iPhones will have an OLED panel, lack of production capacity to blame 17 November 2016 Next year is the iPhone's tenth anniversary. As such, for many months analysts and rumors left and right have predicted that Apple would do something noteworthy on that occasion. Refreshing the design of its mobile devices is probably a given considering how the iPhone 7 generation skipped on that, for the first time allowing three yearly releases in a row to look similar. Another thing that Apple has been rumored to consider is switching from LCD technology to OLED for its smartphones' screens. As you may know, Samsung is a big proponent of AMOLED panels for its high-end devices, and it also happens to be the world's biggest manufacturer of AMOLED screens for phones. Thus, Apple has apparently already ordered 100 million such panels from Samsung for 2017, for displays larger than 5", and the Korean company is said to be the sole supplier of AMOLED displays for Apple next year. However, those 100 million panels may only be enough for one iPhone model, and Samsung might not even be able to deliver all of them to Apple. This is because OLED panels are more difficult to make than LCDs, and Samsung's current production capacities may not be able to satisfy Apple's demands, especially when you also factor in possible low yields and Apple's notoriously stringent quality control requirements. iPhone 7 Plus, possibly the predecessor of the 2017 model having an OLED screen So a new report says all of this means Apple will only be releasing one iPhone model with an OLED panel in 2017, while two other new iPhones will stay with the LCD tech for their screens. The rumor goes on to claim that the OLED iPhone will have a "new look that extends glass from the display to the device¬ís back and edges", according to "a person familiar with Apple's plans". The all-glass design will "have a virtual Home button embedded in an edge-to-edge screen, rather than a physical button that can be pressed". In trying to translate that into English, let's remember that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus' Home button can't be pressed either, so it's unclear how much of a design change we'll see here. As for the glass that extends from the front to the edges, we're hoping that's just a strange way of describing a dual-curved panel like the ones employed by Samsung's "edge" handsets. Because if this iPhone really will be all-glass, with not even a metal frame, we can't say we'd be surprised if it instantly becomes one of the most fragile phones ever made. In 2018 the OLED situation may change, because Sharp and Japan Display are on track to start production of such panels that year. This means Apple could mitigate Samsung's production capacity issues (assuming they'll extend into 2018) by placing orders from these two companies too.

The data uploaded could include a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, as well as phone numbers, dates and times, and duration, the firm said. Apple retains the cloud-based data for up to four months, according to ElcomSoft's report. It includes calendars, wallet, books, notes and other data synced with iCloud. Even photos may be retained remotely longer than Apple has indicated. Apple currently relies on a two-factor authentication system that requires an iCloud token along with an Apple ID and password, but ElcomSoft's new Phone Breaker 6.20 software can allow law enforcement to bypass those checks. For its part, Apple has defended the fact that the data is backed up on the cloud. "We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices," an Apple spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechNewsWorld by company rep Ryan James. "Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data," the spokesperson added. "That's why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication." Privacy or Security? ElcomSoft made its announcement not so much to call attention to the potential weaknesses in Apple's data storage practices, as to address how easily its own software can obtain the information. It is billed as a tool for law enforcement, but it's not too hard to imagine that hackers could utilize similar tools for nefarious purposes. "It is very concerning, as this can't be something that is a surprise to Apple; it is baked into their design for the product and services," said Jim Purtilo, associate professor of computer science at the University of Maryland. "Only Apple can speak to its motive for orchestrating this behavior, but this is a way to project an image of security to consumers," he told TechNewsWorld. These iPhone users may believe their data are encrypted and secure, "which is mostly true, even if only on their actual device, while [Apple] is still working accommodatingly with the feds, who get tremendous value from the traffic analysis made possible by these saved data," Purtilo added. Standard Practices The fact that Apple is being called out this week is somewhat notable in its own right. "Apple doesn't seem to be walking its talk in the sense of actually doing what it publicly claims to be doing," noted Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. The other part of this is in the lack of transparency customers have into the process, and the fact that there is no easy way to opt out, he told TechNewsWorld. "If you use iCloud, you're in whether you want to be or not," King added. However, "as several reports on Apple's situation mention, the company isn't alone in syncing or saving call data," King explained, adding that it is standard practice for U.S. carriers to retain call data for up to 12 months. "Where Apple could run into problems is in foreign markets that restrict retention of caller data," he said. "The company also risks some egg on its face if ElcomSoft's contention that more data is collected and that some is retained for longer than Apple says is the case." Who Guards the Guards? The fact that this information is being uploaded to the iCloud is noteworthy, given the showdown that Apple had with the FBI over its ability to obtain information from an iPhone belonging to Syed Rizwan Farook, who carried out last December's terrorist attack in San Bernardino. Farook's phone was protected cryptographically. Apple challenged more than 11 orders to assist in providing access to the phone, issued by the United States district courts under the All Writs Act of 1789. The question is whether the FBI showdown was necessary, based on ElcomSoft's findings. Much of the data may have been on the iCloud and hence accessible. "If most users rely on iCloud services, then police largely don't need the actual device in order to investigate someone; the data have already been disclosed for far more convenient access by whoever asks," explained Purtilo. "Consumers should be so lucky that only the police are accessing their data; in this news, we more or less need to presume other less upstanding groups have been accessing the data too," he added. For the vast majority of users, this may be a nonissue, noted Pund-IT's King. "Most criminals and ne'er-do-wells probably know enough not to use their personal phones for conducting illegal business," he suggested. "How threatening the practice may be is hard to say, but with Apple actively trying to pitch its products for enterprise applications and use cases, companies considering deploying iPhones and iPads may want to question how their employees' call data is being collected and secured," King added. "Personal communication is the lifeblood of many businesses, to the point that any threat of injury and hemorrhage should be avoided."

Among the most popular events at the Apple Store, Hour of Code workshops teach the basics of computer science with Code.org‚Äôs programming tutorials. Apple and Code.org share the goal of giving every student the opportunity to learn computer science. ‚ÄúHour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,‚Äù said Angela Ahrendts, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Retail, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince we started Hour of Code in 2013, Apple has each year upped its participation and found ways to introduce more kids to computer science,‚Äù said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org, in a statement. ‚ÄúThe global footprint Apple offers through its stores and talented staff has reached tens of thousands of kids, and with the introduction of Hour of Code in Swift Playgrounds we can introduce coding to even more.‚Äù Swift Playgrounds This year, Hour of Code programs at many Apple locations will include an introduction to Swift Playgrounds, the free new app for iPad that brings coding to life. The interactive interface of Swift Playgrounds encourages beginners to explore working with Swift, the easy-to-learn programming language from Apple, used by professional developers to create world-class apps. ‚ÄúCoding is just like any language, the earlier you‚Äôre exposed the more successful you‚Äôll be,‚Äù said Craig Federighi, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Software Engineering, in a statement. ‚ÄúWhether at an Apple Store, in a classroom, or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity.‚Äù A new Hour of Code challenge in Swift Playgrounds makes it easy for anyone to set up their own one-hour coding event, and for those continuing to build their coding skills on iPad, Swift Playgrounds adds a new Learn to Code 3 set of lessons and a companion Teacher Guide. Hour of Code for Educators In addition to in-store workshops, Apple has developed a series of tools to extend Hour of Code into schools and community centers, including a free facilitator guide offering lesson ideas, group activities and more. Apple Teacher, a free, professional self-paced learning program supporting and celebrating teachers in the US, has added resources, badging and recognition for learning and teaching coding with Swift Playgrounds on iPad. Continuing Apple‚Äôs $100 million commitment and ongoing partnership to provide 114 underserved schools with technology, services and support, Apple will provide materials and resources to assist ConnectED schools around the country to host their own Hour of Code workshops.

The company‚Äôs foreign manufacturing came under fire during Trump‚Äôs campaign, and since taking office, the prospect of a trade war with China has had Apple‚Äôs stock sliding. There‚Äôs a tiny chance that the end result might be entirely what Trump wanted: moving manufacturing back to the US. DON‚ÄôT MISS:¬†The best TV deals to watch for on Black Friday 2016 A report from¬†Nikkei Asian Review¬†suggests that Apple is exploring what it would take to move iPhone production stateside. ‚ÄúApple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,‚Äù a source told Nikkei. ‚ÄúFoxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.‚Äù Apple investigating what it would take to move production does not, under any circumstances, mean that Apple is planning on doing that. Conducting a feasibility study is a sound political move given the circumstances: if Trump is serious about imposing tariffs on imported electronics, Apple will fight the move tooth and nail. Having a thorough study showing that it‚Äôs impossible would be good ammunition for Apple in the fight against lawmakers, but also in the battle for public approval. Given how bitter the fight over iPhone encryption was, you can‚Äôt fault Apple for taking out some insurance measures. However, there‚Äôs also a faint possibility that American production could be economically sustainable in the future. Apple has been steadily mechanizing the assembly line for iPhones, and the fewer workers it takes to make a phone, the easier it will be to assemble in the US. According to¬†Nikkei, that‚Äôs not going to happen. One source apparently claimed that moving production to the US would cause the cost to double, which would unacceptably squeeze Apple‚Äôs famously tremendous margins. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple this afternoon¬†published¬†an updated support document offering specifics on requirements for connecting¬†4K and 5K external displays to its new MacBook Pro models, including supported adapters and cables¬†for Thunderbolt, mini DisplayPort, HDMI, and other connections. Apple notably unveiled LG UltraFine monitors alongside its new MacBook Pros that use USB-C to connect to the new machines. But we‚Äôve been getting a lot of questions from users about specifics on requirements for cables and adapters necessary to drive other¬†displays at 4K and 5K resolutions at 60 Hz refresh rates. Here‚Äôs what you need to know: The new 15-inch MacBook Pros support up to two 5K displays or¬†four 4K displays (half that for the 13-inch model), but you‚Äôll want¬†to know a few things about what‚Äôs supported¬†before you start buying cables and adapters‚Ä¶ HDMI The new MacBook Pros (late-2016) support displays over¬†HDMI 1.4b using the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter¬†at the following resolutions: -3840√ó2160 at 30 Hz refresh rate -*4096√ó2160 at 24 Hz refresh rate (*Apple notes that mirroring is not supported at this resolution) or -60Hz refresh rates over HDMI when used with a supported HDMI 2.0 display, an HDMI Premium Certified cable, and a supported USB-C to HDMI 2.0 adapter. Single-Stream (SST) displays (mini DisplayPort) -most single-stream 4K (4096√ó2160) displays are supported at 60Hz¬† -mini DisplayPort requires a¬†USB-C to mini DisplayPort adapter or cable‚Äì like these.¬†(Note:¬†Apple‚Äôs Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 MacBook Pro adapter doesn‚Äôt support Mini DisplayPort, but most cables/adapters up-to-date with the latest USB specs should work) Multi-Stream Transport (MST) Displays -Most multi-stream transport (MST) displays at 60 Hz are supported Dual-Cable Displays (require two DisplayPort cables) -Late-2016 models support up to one 5K dual cable display using a USB-C to DisplayPort cable or adapter -Apple notes support for the Dell UP2715K 27-inch 5K display and the HP Z27q 5K display Apple‚Äôs Thunderbolt Display -You can use¬†Apple‚Äôs Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2¬†adapter with the Apple Thunderbolt Display. And of course, Apple‚Äôs updated support document note that the new 2016 MacBook Pro models are compatible with the LG UltraFine 5K display that is expected to launch at Apple Stores next month. The 4K version of the LG UltraFine display is also officially supported on the USB-C 12-inch MacBook. Something else to keep in mind: Earlier today we noted that¬†Apple‚Äôs Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 MacBook Pro adapter doesn‚Äôt support your Mini DisplayPort¬†displays, which means you‚Äôll need to opt for another adapter or solution to connect your new MacBook Pro as noted above.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Tablet News / Apple 9.7-inch iPad Pro wins Tablet of the Year at #TrustedReviewsAwards 2016 Apple 9.7-inch iPad Pro wins Tablet of the Year at #TrustedReviewsAwards 2016 by Joe Roberts 17 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments It's awards night at TrustedReviews, and Apple has just been given the top prize in the Tablet of the Year category. The company won for its 9.7-inch iPad Pro, beating the likes of Google's Pixel C and Microsoft's Surface Book, in what was a very closely contested category. Mobile Editor, Max Parker, said: "A tough choice this, but Apple's iPad Pro 9.7-inch is the best tablet for most people. It's much more manageable than the original Pro, but with a load of cool bits that made that slate so good. "The Apple Pencil is great fun, the keyboard handy when you're out and about, and the TrueTone display is easily the best around. "You've also got strong battery life and that classic Apple design. It's a great all-round product that we use every single day." Related: 9.7-inch iPad Pro review Apple released a smaller version of its iPad Pro earlier this year, and we were so impressed we said: "there's no doubt this is the finest tablet Apple has ever made" ‚Äì which is saying a lot considering the company's stellar lineup of tablets. With an improved, and frankly stunning True Tone display, all the power of its larger sibling, and what might be the best camera on a tablet we've ever seen, the smaller iPad Pro really does stand out among Apple's tablets. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro provides all the power you need from your slate in a manageable size that maintains the outstanding design Apple tablets are known for. There's no doubt Google and Microsoft produced some worthy opponents with the Pixel C and Surface Book respectively, but there's also no doubt Apple's win is well deserved. Stay tuned for more from the Awards as they unfold.

Posted on November 17, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Sleep Watch by Bodymatter is the first and only sleep monitoring app for Apple Watch that lets users automatically wake up to sleep stats without having to open apps at bedtime or upon rising. Since the launch of version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store. Irvine, California (PRWEB) November 17, 2016 Automated detection of sleep, a feature previously only available to purchasers of dedicated health and fitness trackers such as Fitbit or Jawbone, is now available to Apple Watch owners. Sleep Watch by Bodymatter is the first and only sleep monitoring app for Apple Watch that lets users collect their sleep statistics without the need to open apps at bedtime or upon rising. The app automatically detects and monitors estimated sleep time, awake time, sleeping heart rate and sleep quality, but allows users to manually adjust their results to more accurately track their patterns. Since the launch of Sleep Watch version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store. Reception from Apple Watch owners continues to be extremely positive: ‚Äú‚Ä¶I purchased the app and have been using nightly for about 10 days. This is one app that really takes advantage of the Watch and the first indispensable app I've found.‚Äù jsamuels, MacRumors.com Forum, Nov 5, 2016 ‚ÄúI was looking for sleep tracking as close to the automatic tracking of the Fitbit as I could find and with SleepWatch my search is over. It works well and allows you to adjust the times if they are not detected correctly, can't really expect much more on that front (certainly beats having to manually start and end‚Ä¶)‚Äù hsafavi, App Store Review, Nov 2, 2016 ‚ÄúAuto-tracking works great with continuous app updates. Best I've used so far, well worth the $." Tiltasauras, App Store Review, Oct 25, 2016 In numerous amounts of research prepared by many renowned institutions, the importance of sleep regularly shows to be part of a healthy lifestyle, associated with the following potential benefits: Improved mood Better immune strength Better cardiovascular health Lower stress levels Improved memory Maintenance of a healthy weight or improved weight loss efforts Elevated energy levels during the day Increased creativity Sleep Watch leverages the state-of-the-art motion and pulse sensors built into the Apple Watch to estimate when users are asleep by continually monitoring the heart rate and motion data provided by the Watch. Once set up, the app requires virtually no user intervention to detect sleep, aside from simply wearing the Watch to bed. Sleep Watch can also send daily sleep briefing notifications to users upon waking up in the morning. Sleep Watch also lets users automatically sync detected sleep times into the Apple Health app. ‚ÄúWe believe that digital health applications and wearables have a bright future in helping users achieve positive health outcomes. We chose to focus on sleep for a first application as it plays a critical role in our overall health including our cardiovascular health. We are thrilled that the feedback from our users has been so positive and we look forward to continuing to improve the functionality of the application and to enhancing the performance of our sleep algorithms.‚Äù said Aaron Giroux, Executive Chairman of Bodymatter, Inc., creator of Sleep Watch.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kif Leswing Nov 17th 2016 2:42PM Apple has asked its primary manufacturing partners, Foxconn and Pegatron, to explore making iPhones in the US, Nikkei reported on Thursday. Foxconn has worked on a plan, according to the report, but Pegatron has not, saying that it would be too expensive. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou is reportedly lukewarm on the plan, too, because of the rise in production costs. Foxconn's second most powerful executive, Sharp President Tai Jeng-Wu, talked about making parts in the United States during a recent public speech. "We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels, a kind of screen] in the US too," he said. "If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the US, is it possible for us not to do so?" One key reason Apple might be considering a made-in-America iPhone is because President-elect Donald Trump has publicly called for the company to build its product in the US, and threatened tariffs on imports from China.

"How does it help us when they make it in China?" Apple sold 232 million iPhones in 2015. A more expensive iPhone There are many reasons a made-in-America iPhone is improbable, starting with cost. "Making iPhones in the US means the cost will more than double," a source told Nikkei. But there are other problems. Most of the parts that go into an iPhone come from companies in Asia, and the just-in-time manufacturing processes that Apple uses mean that shipping components across the Pacific Ocean could become costly. "A large part of the reason electronics moved overseas is because of the entire supply chain over there," Columbia economics professor Amit Khandelwal previously told Business Insider. "It may be a lower cost to produce the final product as compared to the US, but there's also an advantage is that you're close to your other input suppliers who are other parts of the East Asia supply chain." Even if iPhones were made in the US, economists say there's a chance that the factories would use a substantial amount of automation and robots, which means that the production of a made-in-America iPhone might not create as many jobs as Trump supporters may expect. Apple currently makes the Mac Pro in Texas, but that's a low-volume product. It also makes some iMacs in Ireland.

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic¬†Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community¬†Calendar Cybersecurity ¬∑ Privacy Apple Retains Far More iPhone Call Data Than You May¬†Realize November 17, 2016 Joel Harding Apple CEO Tim Cook Andrew Burton‚ÄîGetty Images by¬†Robert Hackett¬†@rhhackett NOVEMBER 17, 2016 Apple iCloud automatically stores logs for as long as four months, a Russian security firm reports. Apple continuously stores customers‚Äô call history on its iCloud servers for as long as four months, cautioned Elcomsoft, a Russian computer forensics firm, on Thursday. Anyone who uses an iPhone or iPad automatically transmits this private information‚Äîincluding phone numbers, dates, and length of calls‚Äîto Apple when iCloud is enabled, the firm said. Privacy buffs will note that Apple can provide law enforcement with the encryption keys that unlock the data because the company holds onto these data-unscrambling cryptographic secrets. ‚ÄúThere is no way to hide your calls from government requests other than disabling iCloud Drive,‚Äù wrote Vlatamir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft, in a company blog post. In addition to logging regular call history, Apple appears to be keeping records of metadata associated with FaceTime calls at least since the introduction of the iOS 8.2 version of its mobile software in March 2015, The Intercept reports. It‚Äôs worth noting that FaceTime employs end-to-end encryption that protects the audio and visual content of messages sent over the service, as Apple‚Äôs security guidelays out. Elcomsoft said that its findings contradicted other statements in the iOS security guide, however. For instance, Apple says that it ‚Äúhas no information as to whether the FaceTime call was successfully established or duration of a FaceTime call‚Äù and that ‚ÄúFaceTime call invitation logs are retained up to 30 days.‚Äù Elcomsoft, on the other hand, said it found that iCloud accounts do indeed retain this information. ‚ÄúSynced data contains full information including call duration and both parties,‚Äù Katalov wrote in his post. He added that ‚Äúwe were able to extract information going back more than 4 months ago.‚Äù Apple also appears to retain the metadata records associated with popular communications apps that rely on Apple CallKit, the company‚Äôs voice integration tool, since its debut of iOS 10, Elcomsoft said. Among the set are Microsoft‚Äôs MSFT 1.77% Skype, Facebook‚Äôs FB 1.11% WhatsApp, and Viber. Elcomsoft further noted that when someone downloads synced call logs, users are not notified, unlike when iCloud backups are downloaded. Katalov said that this ‚Äúeffectively allows spying upon you without you even knowing.‚Äù Elcomsoft gained notoriety in 2014 when a hacker reportedly used the company‚Äôs software to download personal photos of celebrities from their iCloud accounts. Apple did not immediately reply to Fortune‚Äôs request for comment. A company spokesperson provided the following statement, however, to Forbes, which first reported the news, as well as The Intercept: ‚ÄúWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers‚Äô data.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private,‚Äù the note continued. ‚ÄúDevice data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.‚Äù Hackers looking to get their hands on people‚Äôs call histories can be foiled by two-factor authentication, an essential security feature that adds an extra layer of security to online accounts, Elcomsoft said. Those looking to keep their communications logs from the eyes of prying government authorities might have more to worry about, though. Of course, investigators can also obtain call records from telecom providers. Chris Soghoian, chief technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept that he was more worried about other aspects of iCloud‚Äôs data management. ‚ÄúThe fact that iCloud backs up what would otherwise be end-to-end encrypted iMessages is far worse in my mind,‚Äù Soghoian said. ‚ÄúThere are other ways the government can obtain [call logs]. But without the backup of iMessages, there may be no other way for them to get those messages.‚Äù Apple, for its part, won acclaim from privacy buffs for its strong stance in a high-profile legal battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to the encrypted contents of an iPhone used by a terrorist. The company refused to write software that would allow the Feds to extract the phone‚Äôs PIN code and stored data, and it ultimately avoided a protracted legal battle when the FBI found an alternate means of entry via a third-party contractor.

Russian software maker Elcomsoft today announced an update to its Phone Breaker product that downloads your iPhone's call history from your iCloud account, taking advantage of the fact that Apple stores call logs in iCloud whether users want it to or not. Apple's storage of call logs‚Äîboth FaceTime and cellular‚Äîin iCloud might be welcome to those who, say, miss a call on their phone and want to call back later using their iPad or computer. But it's also a boon for law enforcement, Elcomsoft said, since in many cases all they need to download call data is an iCloud user name and password, even if they can't access an encrypted iPhone. The worst part? You can't turn off iCloud call syncing. "Automatic cloud sync of call logs is great if you know about it and have an option to shut it off," Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov said in a statement. "While Apple works hard to improve security of their physical devices, they move more and more data into the cloud where law enforcement can easily obtain it." Elcomsoft has a history of releasing software that exploits loopholes and can be used by law enforcement or other snoopers with more nefarious purposes. Phone Breaker is no exception; it's marketed specifically to "bring synced call logs before the eyes of the law enforcement." For its part, Apple highlighted iCloud's security measures, but it did not say whether or not it plans to offer the ability to disable the storage of call records in the future. //Related Articles How to Back Up an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch Using iCloud "We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices," the company said in a statement. "Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data. Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password." Apple has frequently been in the spotlight this year for its commitment to user privacy, including a high-profile refusal in February to assist the FBI in accessing encrypted data on the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. While iCloud call records may blemish this privacy commitment, Apple is not alone in storing the call records of its customers. Another Elcomsoft product, called Cloud Explorer, extracts the call logs synced by devices running Android 6.0 or later by accessing the user's Google account.

The ad¬†shows a series of lightbulbs exploding around the world,¬†ending with a tag line ‚ÄòIdeas push the world forward‚Äô and a¬†few short¬†shots¬†of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.

The survey by Gartner Inc. showed that in the third quarter, three Chinese vendors -- Huawei, Oppo and BBK Communication Equipment -- together accounted for 21 percent of the smartphones sold worldwide, and were the only vendors in the top five to increase sales. "Sales of smartphones in China grew by 12.4 percent, and the vendors who most successfully exploited the sales opportunities there were Oppo and BBK," said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta. "In Oppo's case, 81 percent of its smartphone sales came from China, while BBK accounted for 89 percent of smartphones sales in China. These two vendors also grew strongly in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia." Gartner's survey confirmed other reports showing Samsung and Apple at the top of the global market but with slipping sales. The research firm said Samsung's market share dropped to 19.2 percent amid the fiasco over its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were recalled and then halted after overheating batteries leading to fires. "The decision to withdraw the Galaxy Note 7 was correct, but the damage to Samsung's brand will make it harder for the company to increase its smartphone sales in the short term," said Gupta. "For Samsung, it's crucial that the Galaxy S8 launches successfully, so that partners and customers regain trust in its brand." Apple's share dropped to 11.5 percent as the iPhone maker failed to get much benefit from Samsung's woes, Gartner said. "The withdrawal of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 may benefit sales of Apple's iPhone 7 Plus only slightly, as Note 7 users are likely to stay with Samsung or at least with Android," said Gartner's Roberta Cozza. "To some extent, other Android vendors could capitalize on this situation in the short term -- for example, Huawei and other Chinese brands present in the premium Android phone segment." Cozza said the Samsung problems could also benefit Google, which recently introduced its Pixel and Pixel XL devices. Gartner said overall smartphone sales in the quarter rose 5.4 percent to 373 million units.

Among the most popular events at the Apple Store, Hour of Code workshops teach the basics of computer science with Code.org‚Äôs programming tutorials. Apple and Code.org share the goal of giving every student the opportunity to learn computer science. ‚ÄúHour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,‚Äù said Angela Ahrendts, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Retail, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince we started Hour of Code in 2013, Apple has each year upped its participation and found ways to introduce more kids to computer science,‚Äù said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org, in a statement. ‚ÄúThe global footprint Apple offers through its stores and talented staff has reached tens of thousands of kids, and with the introduction of Hour of Code in Swift Playgrounds we can introduce coding to even more.‚Äù Swift Playgrounds This year, Hour of Code programs at many Apple locations will include an introduction to Swift Playgrounds, the free new app for iPad that brings coding to life. The interactive interface of Swift Playgrounds encourages beginners to explore working with Swift, the easy-to-learn programming language from Apple, used by professional developers to create world-class apps. ‚ÄúCoding is just like any language, the earlier you‚Äôre exposed the more successful you‚Äôll be,‚Äù said Craig Federighi, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Software Engineering, in a statement. ‚ÄúWhether at an Apple Store, in a classroom, or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity.‚Äù A new Hour of Code challenge in Swift Playgrounds makes it easy for anyone to set up their own one-hour coding event, and for those continuing to build their coding skills on iPad, Swift Playgrounds adds a new Learn to Code 3 set of lessons and a companion Teacher Guide. Hour of Code for Educators In addition to in-store workshops, Apple has developed a series of tools to extend Hour of Code into schools and community centers, including a free facilitator guide offering lesson ideas, group activities and more. Apple Teacher, a free, professional self-paced learning program supporting and celebrating teachers in the US, has added resources, badging and recognition for learning and teaching coding with Swift Playgrounds on iPad. Continuing Apple‚Äôs $100 million commitment and ongoing partnership to provide 114 underserved schools with technology, services and support, Apple will provide materials and resources to assist ConnectED schools around the country to host their own Hour of Code workshops.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile ¬´ Apple Patent Shows Siri being used in an iMessage Thread to Send Funds to a Friend using Apple Pay | Main | Apple Celebrates 'Ideas that Push the World Forward' in their Latest TV Ad ¬ª November 17, 2016 Apple Reportedly Preparing a Responsible U.S. iPhone Plant Back-Up Business Plan ¬† Back in July Patently Apple posted a report titled "The Impossible Dream of a Made-in-America iPhone." I noted in the report that "Some, like Presidential candidate Donald Trump, think that if Apple was given the right tax beaks to bring back their money that's offshore and get Foxconn to open a plant in the US, that it could bring back needed jobs to America. Although Apple's CEO said it wasn't just about cheap labor, it was about tool and die shops and infrastructure, that's something that could be fixed to accommodate Apple and other US companies if there's a plan to resurrect America's one-time leadership in this area. The question is, will Americans and Canadians pay $100 more per iPhone? I think they would if it meant putting America back on track and bring jobs to those without university degrees." The basic reaction found in comments posted and not posted for that report was that it would never, ever happen. Today the Nikkei is reporting that "iPhones might one day soon carry "Made in America" labels." So the impossible still has a chance of happening just like it was reportedly impossible for Trump to win the U.S. election. ¬† After Donald Trump's election victory, the Korean press noted that both Samsung and LG were wondering if they'll have to open smartphone plants in the U.S. considering that 30% of their global profits comes from the U.S. They wouldn't want to lose that. Considering that Samsung is going to invest more than one billion U.S. dollars in an Austin plant for semiconductor production, I don't see them whining about making smartphones in the U.S. if need be. ¬† It would most definitely add $50 to $100 per smartphone to accomplish it, but it's doable and many US and Canadian responsible adult consumers would likely pay that premium if they were assured that their favorite smartphones were creating jobs at home, or at least in the U.S. Of course teenagers will bark, but most who do will continue to buy Android phones. ¬† The Japanese Nikkei report claims in their "exclusive report" that "Key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S., sources told the Nikkei Asian Review. ¬† "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," a source said. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." ¬† Of course costs would go up and Foxconn's chairman made that clear, but I still believe that bringing back jobs to the U.S. will be appreciated by the working class. ¬† The argument that people won't buy a smartphone made in the US because of a higher price is offset by those not buying any smartphone because they don't have a job. Lobbyists and high and mighty silicon valley brats will complain ‚Äì but who really cares what they want? ¬† On November 9th I posted a report titled "Silicon Valley's Mental Breakdown over President-Elect Trump is Seriously Warped." When mentally disturbed left wing executives freak out like five year olds because their side lost an election and rant that Trump is the next Hitler, then perhaps these executives should be using some of their millions on getting some serious help. ¬† While an iPhone plant in the US is far from becoming a reality any time soon, it was still comforting to know that Apple will act rationally and do the right thing if Trump follows through and lowers U.S. business taxes from 35 to 15%. That will also allow Apple to return their tens of billions (if not hundreds of billions) in offshore accounts back home before the EU grabs it all. ¬† Putting Americans back to work isn't the end of the world ‚Äì and I assure you that if Apple refuses to be bold enough to take the plunge, then Samsung will be there to make it happen in a heartbeat. So how this all plays out over the next four years will certainly be interesting to follow indeed. ¬† About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Nikkei sources say Cupertino has asked its manufacturing partners to investigate the possibility of moving the operation to home soil. "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," the source said. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Related: iPhone 7 review - A rare diasppointment According to the resort, Foxconn is willing to comply given Apple makes up 50% of its business, but is concerned about the rise in production costs. "Making iPhones in the US means the cost will more than double," the source said. Apple is likely to come under pressure from President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed to make Tim Cook‚Äôs company build ‚Äútheir damn computers and things‚Äù in the US during the campaign. Trump has pledged to hit US companies with a 45% levy on importing goods manufactured abroad, something Apple that could offset much of the savings Apple makes by producing iPhones in China. The former Apprentice host wants those manufacturing positions to be filled by American workers. There are an estimated 690,000 people currently employed at Foxconn in China, although the company recently replaced 60,000 factory workers with robots. Apple briefly experimented with US manufacturing by building the Mac Pro on a production line in Austin, Texas but there‚Äôs been nothing since 2013. In an interview on 60 Minutes late last year CEO Tim Cook said returning manufacturing to the US would present serious logistical issues for the company. He said: "To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment," the executive said.

Introduction, design and display 2. Specs and performance 3. Interface and apps 4. Battery life and camera 5. Verdict and competition Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 is an upgrade in size and name only. It has a thinner and lighter profile with a new 4:3 aspect ratio, but the specs bump is small and battery life is short. For Thinner, lighter design New 4:3 display microSD card slot Against Small specs upgrade So-so battery life Camera is mediocre When I first wrote about the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, my dad remarked of the news story, "So, I heard Samsung is making a new iPad?" This perfectly sums up how average consumers view tablets as a product category. Apple now makes the Kleenex or, in the UK, Sellotape of tablets, and they're called iPads. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 doesn't do much to differentiate itself, aside from running Android, with two new screen sizes that match the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Prices were also identical, launching at $499 (¬£399, AU$599) for the 9.7-inch tablet, and $399 (¬£319, AU$499) for its 8-inch mini equivalent. However, you can find them on discount in the US starting at $399 and $299, respectively, and Samsung's devices start at 32GB of space, while Apple's entry-level models are still a paltry 16GB. Meanwhile in the UK the Tab S2 models have managed to hold their launch prices pretty well. Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 specs Weight: 389g / 392g (LTE) Dimensions: 237.3 x 169 x 5.6 mm OS: Android 5.0.2 (upgrades to 6.0.1) Screen size: 9.7-inch Resolution: 1536 x 2048 CPU: Snapdragon 652 RAM: 3GB Storage: 32/64GB MicroSD slot: Yes Battery: 5,870mAh Rear camera: 8MP Front camera: 2.1MP Regardless of the price changes, they're still a lot a like. It's really no wonder as to why there's mainstream confusion. Samsung and Apple are making phones that mirror each other more, if you look at the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7. The good news is that, once I got to hold the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 in my hands, I discovered some differences that favor Samsung's new tablets, and a few that do not. Weight, design, and software features make the new Galaxy Tab one of the best tablets to date, even though the slate looks like it's doing its best impression of an iPad, and isn't too different from previous Samsung tablets. Design The Galaxy Tab S2 feels nicer to hold in two hands than the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and its sibling, the Galaxy Tab 8.4. In fact, it's now light enough to comfortably clutch in one hand. Weighing just 389g for the 9.7-inch tablet and 265g for the 8-inch version, it sheds the extra weight of its Samsung tablet predecessors, and it's also noticeably lighter than Apple's entire iPad line. That's a big deal, believe it or not, because holding the larger Tab S2 in its ideal position ‚Äì in bed reading Flipboard while holding the tablet in the air ‚Äì isn't a strain over long periods of time. Similarly, if you throw this tablet in a backpack it feels like no extra weight has been added. It's easy to store and effortless to hold, even with its near-iPad dimensions. The 9.7-inch version measures 237 x 169 x 5.6mm, and the 8-inch model 199 x 135 x 5.6mm, beating Apple's sub-pencil-thin thickness of 6.1mm. The Samsung Tab S2 is lighter in part because it's backed by a soft-touch plastic cover instead of an aluminium shell. Metal edges outline the tablet instead of a plastic frame this time. The entire device may not be metal, but it does feel smooth. It's better than the dimpled plastic of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S, yet remains just as grippy. Two small, springy buttons are embedded into the back of the Tab S2, but they're meant for clipping a cover onto the tablet and aren't releases to pop off the back. It's all sealed shut. There is, however, a microSD card slot on the frame to optionally boost the 32GB and 64GB configurations with an additional 128GB of expandable storage. Alongside this same rail are a solid-feeling power button and volume rocker. Stereo speakers, a headphone jack and an off-center micro USB port line the bottom of the tablet. The Tab S2 has a physical, fingerprint-sensing home button in front with the usual oval shape, and two capacitive buttons on either side. These keys light up by default every time the display is touched. The beams of light are a bit distracting when scrolling and reading text near the bottom of the screen, and turning them off in settings doesn't help orient your fingers in the dark. This wider tablet isn't like a narrower phone, where you know the exact location of these keys. The latest Galaxy Tab comes in three colors: Black, White and Gold. Gone are the fancy names like Dazzling White and Titanium Bronze, reflecting Samsung's minimalist design with this year's ultra-thin tablet. Display Samsung has the best displays among smartphones with its Galaxy S6 and Note 5 handsets, and the same is mostly true of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2. It boasts a bright Super AMOLED screen with vivid colors and a 2,048 x 1,536 resolution that matches the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4. That's good, but not the best from Samsung. The Galaxy Tab S slates had a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600 with more pixels per inch. The Tab S2 is technically a step down, even if you can't notice at first glance. What happened? While the S1 sported a narrow, movie-friendly 16:9 aspect ratio, the new Tab S2 is wider, with a letter paper-sized 4:3 aspect ratio. It's more suited for web browsing. Samsung dialed back the resolution in its rejiggering of the screen, but that the pixel count shouldn't concern you as much as the aspect ratio, especially for widescreen movie watchers. The Galaxy Tab S2 display is still really sharp and vibrant, but has a different objective that's bent on three things: web surfing, Flipboard reading and iPad rivaling.

Throws Video Apps a Massive Bone The iPhone maker may reduce its cut for video services. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 17, 2016 at 2:38PM Apple's new TV app. Image source: Apple. It's actually kind of impressive that it's taken this long for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to give in. The Mac maker has long commanded a 30% cut of anything sold through its App Store, which is a pretty massive toll to collect. The App Store has now been around for eight years, with no meaningful changes to that commission. At WWDC in June, Apple finally started to concede that 30% may be too much to ask, particularly in the context of ongoing subscriptions. Apple introduced a new model where Apple's cut falls to 15% for subscriptions after the first year, providing developers a strong incentive to nurture long-term relationships with customers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is considering taking this a step further, reducing its cut to 15% for video services starting from the get-go without having to wait a year. The report also notes that a handful of video partners have already been paying this reduced 15% fee, without specifying which services may have negotiated better deals. This all comes as Apple is preparing to launch a new TV app that it hopes will unify viewing across devices. Services that integrate with the new TV app will get the lower rate. A huge break for video If Apple indeed goes through with it, the move would be a massive win for video services. Many video services have long complained that Apple was asking too much, but those complaints mostly fell on deaf ears until now. It doesn't help that many smaller video services already struggle to make a profit, and 30% off the top can be prohibitively expensive. Instead, many services simply didn't offer the ability to subscribe directly within apps, subtly nudging customers to sign up outside the confines of Apple's walled garden in order to avoid paying the toll. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the undisputed leader in video streaming, and it only started offering in-app subscriptions last September. At the time, I wondered if Netflix had been able to score a discounted deal with Apple, given all of the reports that Apple was willing to negotiate on a case-by-case basis with the larger players. With Bloomberg mentioning some of these one-off deals already being in place, I think Netflix is very likely one of them. The company's margins are already quite thin -- Netflix's net margin was just 2% last quarter -- as it continues investing in international expansion and original content. A fee reduction is arguably overdue, but now that it's seemingly on the horizon, Apple's catalog of third-party video services offered through the App Store will likely start expanding aggressively. No break for music Note that there's no mention of Apple giving a break to music services, as competition in that sector is starting to intensify. Spotify has been a particularly vocal rival that has spoken out about the potential anti-competitive implications of Apple's model. The dominant music streamer has always passed on that cost to the consumer, selling Spotify Premium for $10 per month normally but $13 per month if purchased in-app. There are several other examples of companies adjusting their pricing to offset Apple's cut. Lawmakers are starting to take notice as well. For now, Apple will cut video services a break, but music services will have to hold out a bit longer. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple and Netflix.

Russian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft, which sells software to extract data from iCloud backups and works with police forces and intelligence agencies, says customers should be told exactly what personal data is being backed up - and be given an easy option to turn it off. It analysed logs to show files uploaded to Apple's iCloud servers contain a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration. Scroll down for video¬† Apple told Dailymail.com it offers call history syncing 'as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices' and said all data was encrypted as part of its iCloud service. WHY IS APPLE DOING IT?¬† As part of Apple's iCloud service, users can answer calls and see messages from any of their devices. This is done using call history syncing to Apple's iCloud servers. It allows a customer to see incoming calls and details on their Mac or iPad, for instance, even if the call is made to their iPhone's ¬†cell number. 'We discovered that yet another piece of data is stored in the cloud for no apparent reason,' ¬†Elcomsoft's Oleg Afonin wrote. 'Using an iPhone and have an active iCloud account? Your calls will sync with iCloud whether you want it or not.' However, Apple said this was simply part of its iCloud service, which allows customers to see calls on all of their devices.¬†¬† 'We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,' Apple told Dailymail.com RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Twitter introduces Snapchat-style QR codes: Users can now...

Share this article Share 33 shares 'Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data.¬† 'That's why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user's¬†passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password.¬† 'Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.'¬† Android phones also sync call logs to the cloud as part of backups, and Windows 10 mobile devices also sync call logs by default with other Windows 10 devices that use the same Microsoft account.¬† The iCloud data also includes missed and bypassed calls.¬† FaceTime also syncs call history to iCloud automatically, the firm said, along with, for users running iOS 10, incoming missed calls that are made through third-party VoIP applications like Skype and WhatsApp.¬† Apple CEO Steve Jobs talks about the music component of iCloud at the firm's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco in 2011. It also syncs call data to allow users to¬†return calls from any of their devices. Elcomsoft said the data gets uploaded in many instances without user choice or notification. 'You only need to have iCloud itself enabled' for the data to be sent, Vladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft told The Intercept.¬† 'I would suggest Apple to add a simple option to disable call log syncing, as they do that for calendars and other things,' Katalov told The Intercept 'They should allow people to disable that if they want to.' Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert and security researcher, said he doesn't think Apple is doing anything nefarious in syncing the call logs. But he said that Apple needs to be clear to users that the data is being collected and stored in the cloud. He told Forbes¬†‚ÄúI suspect that this is probably more of an engineering issue around making handoff work when you are answering calls between your phone and your desktop or if you‚Äôre using FaceTime on your desktop.' 'They need to be able to sync a lot of that call data. I suspect whatever software engineer wrote that part of it probably decided to just go and stick that data in your iCloud Drive because that‚Äôs kind of what it‚Äôs purpose is,‚Äù said Zdziarski. It is believed Apple retains the data in a user's iCloud account for up to four months.

It says that Apple is planning on releasing one new iPhone, dubbed iPhone 8, with a major design change, component upgrades, and will feature an OLED display that is 5.2-inches in size. In addition, the company will make two new iPhones with 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays, which would be a more iterative change and will be the successors to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The OLED models appears to be the one that has the ‚Äònew‚Äô stuff, according to the report. If it holds true, the high-end iPhone will not necessarily be the one with the largest display. The report says that the OLED iPhone will have an ‚Äòactive screen area‚Äô of 5.1 or 5.2-inches, where the panel itself would be up to 5.8-inches and would wrap around the phone. An interesting tidbit is that Apple is putting all of its resources and latest designs into the OLED iPhone, making it the flagship iPhone in 2017, despite not having the largest display. For the past several years, the 5.5-inch ‚ÄòPlus‚Äô iPhone has always been technically superior to its smaller 4.7-inch sibling, with this year‚Äôs difference being the dual camera. KGI believes that screen size will no longer be a determining factor between high-end and low-end iPhone devices. Unfortunately, the 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones will still have iterative updates (processor and such), but will largely resemble the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in terms of industrial design. The purpose of an iterative update to the 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone remains to be unknown. Tags: 2017 iPhone, Display, KGI, OLED About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, a main Apple assembler, has allegedly been looking into the possibility of making iPhones in the United States, sources revealed to Nikkei. "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," a source told Nikkei. Foxconn, which makes more than 200 million iPhones every year overseas, complied with Apple‚Äôs instructions, but Pegatron ‚Äúdeclined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns," the source said. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou expressed his concern on increase in production costs. As of now, it costs an estimated $225 for Apple to make its latest 32GB iPhone 7, while the devices are sold for $649. "Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double," a source told Nikkei. The move to manufacture iPhones in the U.S. comes after Trump was elected President. Trump might push Apple to make a certain number of iPhone component devices in America. Throughout his campaign, Trump has strongly criticized companies for making their products overseas instead of domestically. Bringing back jobs to the U.S. was a strong point in his presidential run. Trump promised to implement a 45 percent tariff on goods made in China, where Apple products are made. "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries," he said in January. "How does it help us when they make it in China?" Trump said in March. Related Stories iPhones Are Reportedly Sending Call Records and FaceTime Logs to Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Come in Different Sizes, LCD And OLED Models Apart from China, Apple‚Äôs key components for making iPhones come from other Asian suppliers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for iPhones; Japan Display and Sharp, which supply panels for Apple's handsets; South Korea's SK Hynix and Toshiba in Japan. Apple CEO Tim Cook previously said the U.S. did not have enough skilled workers for the manufacturing of iPhones. "To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment," he said in a 60 Minutes interview. "Even if Trump imposes a 45% tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the U.S," he added.

Vue came out of beta earlier this year and has been expanding rapidly since, with availability on browsers, iOS, Android, Android TV and Roku as well as PlayStation consoles. Subscribers can watch on five devices simultaneously, while the cloud-based DVR makes it possible to record hundreds of hours of content. ‚ÄúStarting today,‚Äù Sony said in a post on the official PlayStation blog, "PlayStation Vue will be supported on Apple TV (4th generation), leveraging Apple TV‚Äôs latest hardware to create an innovative experience. You will be able to take advantage of Apple TV‚Äôs Siri Remote and easy navigation with touch, while enjoying PlayStation Vue‚Äôs sleek look and feel. PlayStation Vue brings popular programming to Apple TV, from live sports networks like ESPN and NFL Network, to premium channels like AMC, FX, HBO, and Showtime." Plans start at $29.99 for 55 channels, all the way to $74.99 for the Ultra package with HBO, Showtime and local content. The rollout had been smooth sailing for Sony until last week‚Äôs announcement packages would no longer be including content from Viacom networks like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon. The company said it‚Äôs focus was keeping the price low, but the loss of premium channels at a time when they Sony PS4 Pro review 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

If you don‚Äôt have a display that uses a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port‚Äî like the new 4K and 5K LG displays being sold exclusively by Apple for the new MacBook Pros‚Äî then you‚Äôll need an adapter to go from Thunderbolt 3 to whatever I/O your display has (DisplayPort, HDMI, Thunderbolt 2, etc). Something like Apple‚Äôs Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter, for example.¬† But here‚Äôs where some users have been confused and accidentally purchased the wrong adapter: Thunderbolt 2 uses the same physical connector as Mini DisplayPort, but Apple‚Äôs new Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter won‚Äôt work with DisplayPort displays. So, if you bought the new MacBook Pro and were hoping to use it with an Apple Cinema display or other Mini DisplayPort monitor like this guy, you won‚Äôt be able to do so with Apple‚Äôs official adapter. Indeed a couple of Apple support docs for the adapter (here and here) mention the limitation: Note that although it uses a Mini DisplayPort connector, the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn‚Äôt support connections to Mini DisplayPort displays. Also, this adapter supports only one powered Thunderbolt 2 device on a USB-C equipped Mac. The Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn‚Äôt support connections to these devices: -Apple DisplayPort display -DisplayPort devices or accessories, such as Mini DisplayPort to HDMI or Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapters -4K Mini DisplayPort displays that don‚Äôt have Thunderbolt But it‚Äôs not noted directly on the product page, which is confusing for some consumers who assumed DisplayPort compatibility and purchased without realizing. Just a snippet of the reviews on Apple‚Äôs website: So in short, if your monitor doesn‚Äôt specifically have Thunderbolt, Mini DisplayPort aside, then Apple‚Äôs official adapter won‚Äôt work for you. Apple‚Äôs support doc does note that you can ‚Äúconnect a display that uses a Mini DisplayPort to VGA, DVI, or HDMI adapter,‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt specify if that note is related to the new MacBook Pros and Thunderbolt 3. There are mixed reports of people having success with other adapters on the market that offer Thunderbolt 3/USB-C to DisplayPort connections‚Äì like these ones‚Äî but since the MacBook Pros just hit the market this week, the verdict is still out on what does and doesn‚Äôt work. But accessories should soon hit the market that have been tested specifically with the new MacBook Pros.¬† Need more info on how to connect displays to the 2016 MacBook Pros?

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday ¬† ¬† The Official F1 2016 Game For IOS Is Out Posted: Nov 17 2016, 11:50am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple ¬† ¬† The official F1 2016 Game for iOS has been released. It is now available on the App store for your iPhone, iPad and even Apple TV. The official teasers were viewed at the Apple iPhone 7 event and left us mouth watering. Finally the game has arrived and is a treat in itself. Don't Miss:¬†The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals Apple introduced this game at an important event such as the iPhone 7 launch so it is natural the Cupertino based firm knew it had to deliver in every instance. We have to say this time the Code masters have created something which is above the regular mobile racing game. The game is absolutely spectacular in every aspect. The vehicles are stunning and show clarity and depth of detail to the utmost. This is rather difficult for users when they view console graphics on more performing machines. Nevertheless we should not forget this game back dates from the iPhone 5S so the Code masters have actually come a long way and achieved on a large scale. As per the gaming perspective the F1 2016 gives everything you would want from a game with this magnitude. The game has been built on Apple‚Äôs Metal gaming framework. The gamers can drive through the whole F1 circuit roster. That‚Äôs not all. The gamers can race in all the 21 races from around the globe which are taking place in the current 2016 season of F1. You will be able to drive through the iconic Hockenheimring and even in the latest Baku circuit. The game is not just confined to simple racing but gives you a chance to experience the environment as well as the quality of the vehicles. The game also included time limited events which come once a week. Codemasters also allow you to share your results on to social networks directly including Facebook. This game is a state of art facility. It has stunning depth of field effects. It makes use of taptic engine on the iPhone 7. This increases the performance and if you have the latest iPhone you are also lucky to give on-device feedback. The F1 2016 is priced only for $9.99 on the App store. You can download now and enjoy the game.

Apple Secretly Stores Your iPhone Call History, Russian Firm Warns GO Information on pretty much every call is saved, they add Nov 17, 2016 19:05 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Bogdan Popa ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† Russian security firm Elcomsoft claims that Apple secretly logs information on pretty much every single call that you make with your iPhone without offering any option to disable this. It turns out that users who have iCloud enabled on their devices get their call history automatically synced to the cloud and there‚Äôs no way to stop this unless they disable the cloud synchronization completely. According to the security firm, the log that Apple automatically collects includes call history, phone numbers, dates, call duration, missed calls, FaceTime calls, and information collected from other applications that can also initiate calls over the Internet, including here WhatsApp, Skype, or Facebook. Apple stores this information for a total of 4 months, and while everything is encrypted, the company could become an easy target for governments seeking access to user data, with the firm also raising doubts over possible surveillance that could be performed. No reason to worry, Apple says Apple, on the other hand, says there‚Äôs nothing wrong with its feature, and call history is synced only because users want access to their calls from any device that uses an Apple ID. Furthermore, the company guarantees that all data is encrypted and two-factor authentication adds an extra security layer to block any hacking attempts. ‚ÄúWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Device data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication,‚Äù the company said. The Russian company explains that Apple is aware of the fact that call syncing isn‚Äôt quite the most convenient and secure way to make call information on all devices and this is why the company says that it‚Äôs better to use Family Sharing instead of the same ID on all devices. ‚ÄúSome users note that Family Sharing is not an ideal solution since it doesn‚Äôt allow sharing iCloud Photo Library. In our opinion, Apple‚Äôs recommendation actually makes sense as someone‚Äôs Apple ID is personal and should not be used across devices owned by different persons (even within the family),‚Äù it says. Apple hasn‚Äôt revealed whether it plans to provide an update that would give users more control over their synced call history. #Apple#iPhone#Russia#iCloud subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related ¬†¬∑¬† Hot right now ¬†¬∑¬† Latest news The Donald Trump Effect: Apple Considering Moving iPhone Production to the US The OLED iPhone Coming in 2017 Packs a 5.1 or 5.2-Inch Display More Android Users Switching to iOS Thanks to iPhone 7 Apple Will Put OLED Panels in Just One iPhone in 2017 Due to Supply Constraints Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked Kapustkiy Breaks into Indian Regional Council Server, 17,000 Users Exposed Microsoft Launches Windows Defender Hub for Windows 10 Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked ¬†¬† Users can't stop call syncing if they use iCloud new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Purposely Throttles Down Some iPhone 7 Data Speeds in the United States more on: Apple iPhone i softpedia¬Æ ¬† ¬†¬†Like 202K ¬†¬†¬†+1 56K ¬† ¬†¬†Follow 13K ¬© 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The aim is to provide integrated, unified access to TV shows and movies that are offered on a multitude of individual ¬†video apps. ¬† While unity is being sought, the aim will likely be falling short early on, as key OTTs such as Netflix and Amazon aren‚Äôt yet in the mix. It will also be key for Apple to bring as many TV Everywhere apps from both programmers and MVPDs to its new offering. ¬† Bloomberg said the expanded offering of a reduced price, already offered to some video partners, is a ‚Äúmove to appease partners whose movies and TV shows are vital to the technology giant‚Äôs video strategy.‚Äù ¬† It also comes as Apple looks to smooth out its occasionally contentious relationship with the pay TV industry. Apple‚Äôs brash negotiation style did not sit well with some broadcasters and other programmers when Apple was trying to build its own pay TV service, according to The Wall Street Journal. The recent addition of former Time Warner Cable exec Peter Stern to the Apple fold, with a focus on subscription services, may help out in that area. ¬† Apple is also looking to drum up more MVPD support for its new single sign-on initiative for Apple TV. ¬† RELATED: Few MVPDs Part of Apple‚Äôs Single Sign-On Mix TAGS: Apple Apple TV OTT SVOD user interfaces search and discovery Share This Post View the discussion thread.

During its announcement in October, the Surface Studio was revealed to have a 12.5mm thin touch screen, with a 28-inch PixelSense Display that packs in 13.5 million pixels. Microsoft said that there's "no monitor like this on the planet." The first reviews of the Surface Studio are largely positive, with many reviewers enamored with the computer's large screen and slick design, as well as its purpose to fulfill and enhance productivity for creatives. However, in line with the unrest over the price of the new MacBook Pros, most of the people who have been reviewing the Surface Studio for the past week admit the $3,000 price tag is one that prohibits casual users and sets an entry bar for serious power users only. Images via Engadget The Verge began by looking at the 28-inch display, which was described as "truly one of the best desktop monitors I‚Äôve ever used." Everything from plain text to videos were said to look great on the screen, and even the 3:2 aspect ratio for the desktop monitor produced better environments for reading and writing, according to the site. The Verge also had a freelance illustrator test out the Surface Studio, and they came away largely impressed, but hoped future iterations introduced a rotating display, more ergonomic stylus, and new input options for the Surface Dial accessory. Although a slight mention, one of the site's minor annoyances was the way the Surface Dial slipped down the screen slowly when not being cradled by the user's hand, even at the computer's lowest 20-degree angle. The Verge concluded its review comparing the Surface Studio to the current lineup and ecosystem of Apple products. The site said that while Microsoft's device won't be invading the homes of die-hard Apple fans just yet, the fact that the Surface Studio even hints at that possibility "is remarkable." For that reason, the site admitted purchasing a $3,000 computer just for fun doodling tools in your spare time is illogical, but those Apple fans who could gain the most out of Microsoft's hardware "might well be tempted to switch camps." Many creatives I‚Äôve spoken to about the Surface Studio have said the same thing: why isn‚Äôt Apple doing this? Apple seems to be forcing creatives to choose an iPad Pro for touch and pen, but the powerful and professional apps just aren‚Äôt there yet on iOS, and it‚Äôs not clear if companies like Adobe are willing to rewrite their software to be just as useful on an iPad Pro. Microsoft has realized the potential in the market to reach out to creatives who feel abandoned by Apple, and it‚Äôs an influential crowd that could be swayed over by devices like the Surface Studio. The fact that Microsoft is even being considered an alternative to Apple‚Äôs line of machines for creatives is not something anyone, not even Microsoft, was expecting for the Surface devices. The Surface Studio won't take over Mac-focused design houses just yet, but that it‚Äôs even a possibility is remarkable. The Studio is special because it knows exactly what it is and who it‚Äôs for ‚Äî and it‚Äôs largely spot on. If Microsoft keeps developing its strengths here, some of Apple's most loyal customers might well be tempted to switch camps. Engadget called the Surface Studio "the most interesting computer released this year," thanks in part to the fact that its zero gravity hinge gimmick "is actually useful." The site tested the top-of-the-line $4,200 tier, which includes a 2.7GHz Core i7 6820HQ CPU, 32GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and 2TB HDD, and a NVIDIA GTX 980M graphics with 4GB of VRAM, and admitted "it was one of the most powerful PCs I've ever tested." The Surface Studio is also a good-enough gaming alternative, although it isn't entirely up to the task of most high-end gaming PCs, with Engadget noting that the computer scored 20 percent lower than the Radeon RX 480 GPU, as an anecdotal comparison. The computer still managed to run a few games at playable speeds, including Overwatch (60 frames per second in 1080p with high settings) and Gears of War 4 (50 frames per second with medium settings). The Surface Studio is both familiar and new. It empowers us to work the way we always have, while also giving us entirely new modes of productivity. Personally, that's a philosophy I can get behind -- especially when compared with Apple's habit of pushing consumers down new roads that aren't necessarily improvements (hello, dongle life). But the Surface Studio's high price and lack of expandability could make it a tough sell for an already niche market, especially for people already devoted to their Wacom tablets. CNET also asked some creative professionals to try out the Surface Studio and got their opinions on the machine. Creative director Nick Cogan, who's helped to illustrate and design films like Ice Age and Rio, said that the Surface Studio was a "great" drawing tool that could stimulate workflow and ultimately be a nice main device for professional work after the initial learning curve. But, like CNET described in its review, Cogan wasn't sure if the hardware of the Surface Studio was enough of an excuse to get over the Windows-based software. The bigger challenge may be getting creative professionals to invest in such a high-end, high-price piece of gear, as many of them are creatures of habit, tied to familiar tools and hardware. As Cogan told us, "I think the big barrier is going to be that it's Windows-based, and so many people in the creative fields are really already decades down using Macs." But, he adds, "As a drawing tool, this is great, it's a lot of fun." If you can afford it, and your profession aligns with Microsoft's intent to catalyze passion and ingenuity within creatives, the review consensus on the Surface Studio is largely suggesting a purchase. Those who are interested can order the computer from Microsoft's online store, although following initial pre-orders the Surface Studio's shipping estimate has now been pushed back to early 2017. The cheapest model of Surface Studio includes an Intel Core i5 processor, 1TB hybrid drive, 8GB RAM, and a 2GB GPU for $2,999. That jumps up to $3,499 for an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB RAM, with the top-of-the-line model running for $4,199 with a 2TB hybrid drive, i7 processor, 32GB RAM, and 4GB GPU. The Surface Dial comes packaged-in for pre-order customers who order the computer before December 1, but after that date it will cost $99 sold separately.

They all suck in their individual ways, but macOS certainly is in absolutely no way superior to either Linux or Windows anymore. Rather the opposite: macOS didn't age well, it feels out of place in this half of the decade, and even a conservative light-weight Linux distribution like Xubuntu feels more in sync with the present. As for the Surface Studio: That's just an amazing, gorgeous machine. It was not meant for the casual user, it was not meant for the Starbucks crowd. I'm in IT, so this machine was not designed for me either. But you know what? If it were available in Germany and if I were in the market for a new desktop machine, this beauty would be on top of my wish list.

God I wish it had columns view in Explorer... I've tried a few unofficial Explorer alternatives that have a columns view, but they're all broken in other ways. I have an experimental file browser I've written (cross platform) which has something that blows columns view away... but I don't have the time/resources to actually polish it enough to use it on a daily basis.

 Chinese smartphones are catching up to Apple and Samsung Jeff Dunn Nov. 17, 2016, 1:51 PM 1,544 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts ¬† For the past five years, the smartphone market has been dominated by two names: Samsung, and Apple. It‚Äôs hard to overstate just how popular the Galaxy and iPhone products¬†have been. Today, those two remain at the top. But there are some very apparent cracks in the foundation. iPhone sales are on the decline, and Apple appears to be banking on an overhauled 2017 model to pick up the slack. Samsung, meanwhile, is just coming off one of the biggest disasters in the history of consumer tech, and is banking on next year‚Äôs presumed Galaxy S8 to fly where this year‚Äôs Galaxy Note 7 crash and burned. And as this chart from Statista shows, a handful of Chinese companies are starting to gain ground. According to recent data from research firm Gartner, Huawei, Oppo, and BBK Communication Equipment (which sells phones through the brands Vivo and OnePlus) all made significant gains this past quarter, continuing a recent trend. Despite having little foothold in the US, Huawei is now within shouting distance of Apple. As always, there are caveats. For one, while market share is good, it doesn‚Äôt equal success: Apple still takes the vast majority of the smartphone industry‚Äôs profits, because it doesn‚Äôt sell¬†phones for cheap. And with a Trump administration on the horizon, any so-called ‚Äútrade war‚Äù with China would likely kill those brands‚Äô chances of gaining any ground in the States. But as things stand now, the gap is closing. Statista EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

That‚Äôs¬†because¬†panel manufacturers are currently struggling to meet Apple‚Äôs expectedly large order volume and stringent quality requirements.¬†That OLED screens are far more difficult to produce than LCDs isn‚Äôt helping either. Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman and¬†Jungah Lee said today that four main OLED panel suppliers‚ÄîSamsung Display, LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display‚Äîare currently suffering from yield issues, with constraints potentially continuing into 2018. One person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that although¬†Samsung is ‚Äúon track‚Äù to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, it may be unable to make enough OLEDs due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand. Apple and Samsung reportedly have an exclusive OLED supply deal for 2017 even if the Korean company cannot build enough OLEDs for its own Galaxy phones. From the report: Apple‚Äôs initial OLED order from Samsung is for 100 million units over one year, according to people familiar with the agreement. Even so, Samsung will probably only be able to deliver a portion of that for the 2017 holiday period. Apple shipped about 75 million iPhones in the 2015 holiday quarter. Analysts predict iPhone shipments could hit 90 million units in the 2017 holiday quarter. As for other suppliers, Japan Display saw urgency in boosting its OLED capacity so that ‚Äúwe are not caught empty-handed if the technology does end up capturing a majority‚Äù while Sharp expressed pessimism as to whether it can succeed in OLEDs. LG Display was late in OLED investment for mobile devices and is now playing a catch up. ‚ÄúApple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they‚Äôve also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,‚Äù said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit.¬†Because suppliers may not have sufficient OLED¬†production capacity, only the highest-end 2017 iPhone model may have an¬†OLED-based display. This bit is also interesting: The OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device‚Äôs back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple‚Äôs plans. This all-glass design will have a virtual Home button embedded in an edge-to-edge screen, rather than a physical button that can be pressed, the person added. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has been saying that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be refreshed next year with updated hardware and adopt a glass enclosure instead of metal, but retain TFT-LCD panels, with a third iPhone model with an OLED-based screen likely to¬†be added to the family. In his latest report issued to clients this morning, Kuo said the OLED iPhone will have a 5.8-inch wraparound OLED panel with an ‚Äúactive screen area‚Äù measuring between 5.1 and 5.2 inches diagonally. Apple currently utilizes OLED panels for the Apple Watch‚Äôs display and the new MacBook Pro‚Äôs Touch Bar. OLED technology doesn‚Äôt require a backlighting, helping it consume a fraction of the power of the classic TFT-LCD panels found on all iPhones to date. In addition to energy savings, OLED panels render deeper blacks, provide more vibrant colors and better contrast and make possible ultra high resolutions than their LCD-based counterparts.

The Donald Trump Effect: Apple Considering Moving iPhone Production to the US GO Apple discussing with suppliers to move production lines from China in order to be prepared for Trump domestic push Nov 17, 2016 18:36 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Bogdan Popa ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† Apple and some of its partners are reportedly looking into ways to move iPhone production to the United States, as Cupertino is trying to prepare for new laws pushed by President-elect Donald Trump to enforce domestic manufacturing for US companies. According to a report from Japanese newspaper Nikkei, Apple already discussed the matter with its largest suppliers, including Foxconn and Pegatron, asking them to investigate plans that could allow them to transfer production lines from China to the United States. It appears that Pegatron has already said no, most likely because of the costs that would be involved in this transition, so Apple is trying to concentrate specifically on its partnership with Foxconn should Donald Trump indeed force the company to manufacture the iPhone in the United States. What‚Äôs more, Foxconn chairman doesn‚Äôt see moving manufacturing lines to the United States as a good idea, also because of the costs, so it‚Äôs very likely that Apple wouldn‚Äôt receive much support from its partners. Moving just part of iPhone production to the US But Apple is clearly trying to be prepared just in case Donald Trump goes forward with its plan to introduce big import tariffs for Chinese goods and force companies to invest more in domestic operations. Apple was targeted directly during Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign, with the Republican saying that Cupertino will have no other option than to build its computers and phones in the United States. At this point, most Apple products are manufactured and assembled in China. But although Apple clearly wants to be prepared for this scenario, the company is very unlikely to move the entire production to the United States. According to estimates, building an iPhone in the US would double the costs, and Apple is believed to be planning a transfer of only a part of its manufacturing process in the country in order to comply with Trump‚Äôs demands. Additionally, Cupertino is very likely to seek financial incentives to invest in US manufacturing, especially because this would involve higher costs, but for the moment, the company is clearly preparing for the worst and tries to make sure that it won‚Äôt be caught unguarded should Trump really introduce big import taxes. #Apple#Donald Trump#China#US#Foxconn subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related ¬†¬∑¬† Hot right now ¬†¬∑¬† Latest news Apple Asked to Investigate ‚ÄúWidespread‚Äù iPhone Bug Shutting Down Chinese Phones Donald Trump‚Äôs 45% Tariff on China Exports Could Backfire Against the iPhone Trump Edition Gold-Plated iPhone 7 Up for Grabs for $3,000 Apple‚Äôs CEO on Trump Elected President of the US: It‚Äôs OK to Be Disappointed Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked Kapustkiy Breaks into Indian Regional Council Server, 17,000 Users Exposed Microsoft Launches Windows Defender Hub for Windows 10 Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked ¬†¬† Trump wants Apple to move iPhone production to the US New ios.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Huawei is closing the gap on Apple in smartphone sales, largely due to its feature-packed Honor smartphones. Credit: Huawei More like this Samsung's smartphone share hit by Note7 debacle, stiff competition Smartphone sales jump 4% in Q2, Gartner says Meet OPPO, the fastest-growing smartphone brand in the world Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware Third-quarter smartphone sales showed strength by Chinese vendors but declines of 6% for Apple iPhones and 14% for Samsung smartphones over last year. Samsung‚Äôs decline is unsurprising, given the furor over the overheated batteries in its Galaxy Note7s that surfaced in late August, leading to a global recall of millions of the devices. ‚ÄúThe decision to withdraw the Galaxy Note7 was correct, but the damage to Samsung‚Äôs brand will make it harder for the company to increase smartphone sales in the short term,‚Äù said Anshul Gupta, research director for Gartner, which released the smartphone third-quarter sales numbers on Thursday. Gupta said it will be ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù for the expected Galaxy S8 smartphone to launch successfully so that customers and partners can regain trust in the brand. The currently available Galaxy S7 was released in March. Samsung‚Äôs overall 14.2% smartphone decline in the third quarter was its worst performance ever, worse than the Samsung smartphone drop of 12.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014, Gartner said. Apple‚Äôs iPhone decline is another matter, since its smartphone hasn‚Äôt befallen a disaster like Samsung's overheated batteries. Gartner said iPhone sales continued to fall in the third quarter, with a 6.6% decline. That meant Apple accounted for 11.5% of the smartphone market, its lowest share since the first quarter of 2009. iPhones sales showing declines in two of its biggest markets, dropping by 8.5% in the U.S., and by 31% in China. Gartner said the iPhone 7 has struggled to stimulate sales of smartphone replacements as Apple has wanted. The lack of smartphone success in the third quarter by U.S.-based Apple and South Korea-based Samsung is largely due to competition from Chinese vendors. Huawei, Oppo and BBK of China accounted for 21% of the smartphones sold to end users worldwide in the third quarter, Gartner said. They were the only smartphones in the top five to increase their sales and market share. For Oppo, 81% of its smartphone sales for the quarter were in China, as were 89% of BBK's, Gartner said. Both vendors also saw growth in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia. Gartner‚Äôs rank and share for the top five vendors for third quarter put Samsung in first with a 19.2% share; Apple in second with 11.5%; Huawei in third with 8.7% ; Oppo in fourth with 6.7%; and BBK in fifth with 5.3%. Total sales were 373 million units, a 5.4% increase over the third quarter of 2015. Gartner noted that Huawei is closing the gap on Apple, largely due to its feature-packed Honor smartphones. Huawei‚Äôs ongoing expansion into Europe and the U.S. will also help. In late October, IDC reported that global smartphone shipments to retailers were up 1% for the third quarter over a year earlier, reaching 362.9 million. IDC said the long-term impact of the Note7 recall remains to be seen. ‚ÄúThe recall of the Note7 represents an industrywide wake-up call that will undoubtedly lead to a more vigorous testing and certification process moving forward,‚Äù IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella said in a statement.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple to integrate AR into the iPhone‚Äôs camera app Apple Apple to integrate AR into the iPhone‚Äôs camera app By Bindu Nair - Nov 17, 2016 Apple‚Äôs augmented reality (AR) aspirations seems to be gaining momentum day by day, with a brand new report supplying some fresh information about the brand‚Äôs plans for the technology. It‚Äôs apparently looking to integrate AR directly into the iPhone‚Äôs camera app. A source familiar with the matter told Business Insider that Apple is currently developing a system in which a person‚Äôs iPhone would be able to recognize an object in the real world just by pointing at it. Such an endeavor would necessitate creating or licensing a database of all sorts of 3D objects. The report suggests that Apple‚Äôs AR software will also be able to recognize and manipulate an individual‚Äôs face, perhaps taking inspiration from Snapchat. The former‚Äôs already added a dash of facial recognition technology into the default Photos app in iOS 10. Supporting this theory is the fact that it had purchased motion capture firm Faceshift in 2015. Also See: Apple to launch SOS button for iPhone in India Apple‚Äôs bought a number of AR and VR-specializing startups such as Metaio and Flyby Media over the course of the past few years. Employees from both firms are apparently toiling away at the Cupertino-based behemoth‚Äôs camera division. Apple is supposedly going to release the technology behind its AR system as an SDK for app developers after integrating the feature into the iPhone‚Äôs camera application, similar to what it did when it came out with the then-groundbreaking Touch ID fingerprint sensor. A number of leaders in the AR sector predict the brand will introduce AR in the next iteration of iOS. A previous report had hinted that Apple was working on AR-ready smart glasses. The new one corroborates this assertion and adds that the device will be skinny and stylish. Adding fuel to this speculation is the hiring of John Border back in September this year. As per his LinkedIn profile, Border is a senior optics manufacturing exploration engineer who is an expert in the fields of head-worn displays, image sensors, camera systems, and plastic optics manufacturing. Intriguingly, he does have experience in the field of digital glasses since his previous employer was Osterhout Design Group (ODG). ODG is noteworthy for being one of the few firms which has actually managed to demo a fully functional pair of smart glasses. It currently sells a product called R-7 Smartglasses which takes advantage of 3D stereoscopic ultra-transparent see-thru HD displays to place graphics on top of real-world surroundings. You can check out the device in the video below, demonstrated using an iPhone 6.

Designed by Apple in California features exquisite photographs of iconic Apple products, beginning with the iMac in 1998 and culminating with the Apple Pencil. In true Apple fashion the book comes in two sizes: a 10.20 x 12.75-inch copy for $199 and a 13 x 16.25-inch copy for $299. Predictably, I chose the coffee table book Pro edition. The Verge bought the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù version of the book which arrived in the office yesterday afternoon, and I realized that Apple may have been slightly disingenuous with their description: the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù is pretty damn big and weighs a figurative ton. I could probably have saved myself the extra $100 and reduced the potential for injury to my lower back. Nevertheless, I am so glad I ordered this book; it is a thing of great beauty. Like all Apple products, the attention to detail is meticulous: the tightly bound pages are edged in silver; the paper is Apple-specific Heaven 42 Scheufelen from Germany ‚Äî as is the Bamberger Kaliko linen with bespoke dye. The printing is simply astonishing: custom low ghost Epple inks and 8 CMYK color separations (4 is the norm) with 280 line screen printing give the photographs deep, rich blacks and colors so bright as to make a grown design lover weep. As for the photographs themselves, they are of course impeccable. All were shot by Andrew Zuckerman in a typical ‚ÄúAppley‚Äù minimalist style, bathing Apple‚Äôs older hardware in the modern ‚Äúpress shot‚Äù aesthetic. Perhaps the most interesting photographs are the ‚Äúteardown‚Äù shots of MacBooks, iMacs, and the 2007 iPhone. I‚Äôve lingered over one shot of the back of a first-generation Phone which has been scratched and dented through use. It wears a patina of rugged awesomeness with pride. Flipping through the 450 exquisite photographs of Apple favorites such as the 17-inch MacBook Pro, or the 2003 iSight camera ‚Äî not to mention the colored iMacs of the late ‚Äò90s and the original iPods of the early 2000s ‚Äî I confess I was overwhelmed by a nagging reality: this is a tome crafted in honor of nostalgia. As I reached later pages featuring the Apple Watch, the iPad, and even the brand-new MacBook Pro, I felt something lacking. The design of these newer products is certainly beautiful, but Apple‚Äôs look no longer resonates with me in the same way it once did. Perhaps I‚Äôm over exposed to the imagery. We are now very used to seeing photographs of the Apple Watch or iPad on glorious 5k screens; we never saw a blueberry iMac that clearly. But I think that the real reason for this book feeling nostalgic is that although Apple‚Äôs industrial design under Jony Ive has been consistently great, Apple‚Äôs competitors have improved dramatically over the last 18 years. Apple‚Äôs design doesn‚Äôt feel like a message from the future; it feels like one part of the conversation of today. As Steve Jobs famously said: ‚ÄúYou can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.‚Äù Back in 2003 when I bought my first iPod and iSight camera, those products were a beacon on the hill in terms of industrial design. They were astonishing not only because they were beautiful, considered, and almost perfect in every way, but because they were the embodiment of Apple‚Äôs belief that technology didn‚Äôt have to be ugly to be utilitarian. By the early 2000s, Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, and the Apple design team were leading us out of our world of beige boxes and onto an undiscovered country where milled aluminum and candy-colored plastics were the new normal. In 2016, the beige box has been well and truly consigned to the garbage pile of history and is nothing more than distant memory. That‚Äôs not to say that all the tech products of today are designed as well as those by Apple ‚Äî they are most definitely not. But they are undeniably a hell of a lot better. Just look at the Microsoft Surface Pro (and especially the beautiful Surface Studio); just look at the new Google Pixel phones and Daydream VR headset; and just look at the Galaxy Note 7, which despite a proclivity for pyrotechnics is undeniably a beautiful work of industrial design. Good industrial design is no longer an ideal, it‚Äôs a basic requirement Good industrial design is no longer an ideal, it‚Äôs a basic requirement. High-end products simply don‚Äôt succeed without it. And that‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs fundamental problem going forward. Chamfers precisely milled to a thousandth of a millimeter now count far less than seamless usability across a variety of connected devices. We are living in a post-hardware-centric world where the new frontier for design perfection is software ‚Äî and good design is assumed. But that‚Äôs for tomorrow. Without the visionary design sensibilities of Steve Jobs and Sir Jony Ive, I doubt we‚Äôd be where we are today. The book Designed by Apple in California shows us the path they took to get us all here. And the book is like that path: big, bold, beautiful, and unapologetically self-indulgent. It is also really heavy.

In one of the illustrations, one chat participant asks ‚ÄúHow long till you guys get here?‚Äô and Siri is able to check everyone‚Äôs location and answers the question in-line. The feature seems to be an extension of the existing proactivity feature that was introduced with iOS 10. The patent describes how Siri is able to manage all of these tasks. While current systems enable users to communicate and perform tasks, users are required to manually perform the tasks. For example, a group of users attempting to schedule lunch needs to determine an available day and time that works for each member of the group. This can require each user to check their calendar and share available times with other users. Likewise, a group of users attempting to perform a financial transaction needs to determine a payment method for performing the transaction. This can require each user to determine the payment methods available to the individual user and then share this data amongst the other members of the group. Accordingly, improvements are needed. Of course, it also goes in detail talking about potential privacy concerns. Each participant in the chat would have the ability to approve or decline access to data such as location or calendar. This is important because the patent describes peer-to-peer payments. A task can include scheduling a meeting, performing a financial transaction, determining an estimated time of arrival, providing directions, providing weather information, alerting a user of relevant information, etc [‚Ä¶] Alternatively, to assist with performing a financial transaction amongst multiple participant users of a communication session, a virtual assistant can determine the financial applications available and/or utilized by each of the participant users and recommend a financial application to perform the financial transaction. Touch ID would be required in order to authorize the transaction, however. Tags: Apple patent, iMessage, Patent, Siri About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple currently builds its iPhones in China, among other places, but that may¬†change sooner than later. According to a news report in¬†Nikkei,¬†Apple is discussing a move to build iPhones in the United States instead. ‚ÄúApple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,‚Äù Nikkei said, citing a source. ‚ÄúFoxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.‚Äù This revelation comes in the wake of Donald Trump winning the recent U.S. election. Trump previously called on Apple to build its iPhones in the United States. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,‚Äù Trump said in January, long before Apple asked its partners about building phones here and, of course, 10 months before he won the US election. This isn‚Äôt the first time Apple has built anything in the US If you remember, Apple¬†began building¬†the Mac Pro at a Texas plant back in 2013, the same year that Motorola announced it was building Moto X phones in the same state. It‚Äôs unclear how serious Apple‚Äôs most recent request was or if Apple will actually follow through with building any or all of its iPhones in the United States. It may be in Apple‚Äôs best interests to continue to build iPhones in China,¬†perhaps even in the best interests of the United States. In a recent statement to local news, China said it will stop selling iPhones altogether if President-elect Trump starts a trade war. Worse, a source speaking to¬†Nikkei said it would cost Apple ‚Äúmore than double‚Äù to build the iPhones here. So much for those profit margins.

Your Phone Sends All Your Call Records To Apple When iCloud Is Turned¬†On Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Your Phone Sends All Your Call Records To Apple When iCloud Is Turned¬†On Image courtesy of William Hook November 17, 2016 10:54 am EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc every call you take iphone apple ipad ios Mac data icloud privacy big data is watching You‚Äôve got a computer in your pocket that works as a camera, a video recorder, an internet connection, a game console, and everything else. And odds are good there‚Äôs some data on there that you want backed up safely, and that you use a cloud storage service to do just that. But your smartphone is, indeed, a phone ‚Äî and your good old-fashioned calling records may be going places and getting stored in ways you do not intend. The Intercept reports today that a digital security firm has discovered that Apple devices automatically send call history data ‚Äî phone metadata ‚Äî to Apple‚Äôs servers when iCloud is enabled. Phone metadata is basically everything you think of as ‚Äúphone records‚Äù from watching detective procedurals on TV. It‚Äôs a record of what numbers you called (or that called you), when, from where (for mobile phones), and for how long. Mostly, in recent years, it‚Äôs been heard in the context of maybe-legal, maybe-not, wide-scale federal data dragnets and AT&T‚Äôs data sales to law enforcement agencies. It‚Äôs not just traditional voice calling data at stake here either, the security firm adds. Apple‚Äôs also collecting call data on audio and video calls made through FaceTime, going back to March 2015. The firm also reports that iOS 10 added the ability for Apple to log incoming missed calls made through Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, and other apps that use the Apple CallKit backend. There are privacy laws in place regulating when your phone company can use, share, or allow access to that data. But those apply to your wireless carrier, which is the one you would expect to have and retain that information ‚Äî not Apple, the device-maker. ‚ÄúWell, of course iCloud syncs data,‚Äù you may be thinking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for!‚Äù And yes, that is the point. But this particular data is not something Apple discloses it‚Äôs collecting, and it‚Äôs not part of the stated purpose of how iCloud is supposed to work. The data isn‚Äôt being stored securely for you; it‚Äôs being sent to them. In all the product descriptions for iCloud, nowhere does Apple mention your voice calling history among the data it can back up ‚Äî even while particularly stressing privacy and security. Under the header ‚ÄúPrivacy and security,‚Äù Apple writes: Apple takes data security and the privacy of your personal information very seriously, and iCloud features are designed with your privacy in mind. All your iCloud content ‚Äî like photos, documents, and contacts ‚Äî is encrypted when sent over the Internet and, in most cases, when stored on our servers. If we use third-party vendors to store your information, we encrypt it and never give them the keys. And security enhancements like two-factor authentication help to ensure that the important information in your account can only be accessed by you, and only with your devices. And the full list of features Apple mentions on the site includes backup for ‚Äúimportant stuff like photos and videos‚Äù; Notes; iTunes and Apple Music; Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and Reminders; Safari browser history and passwords; Safari password keychain; and Find my [Device]. Nowhere is ‚Äúcall history data‚Äù mentioned. The security firm that did the research says that Apple retains all the call data in your iCloud account for up to four months, meaning it‚Äôs there for anyone else to demand to see. ‚ÄúAbsolutely this is an advantage [for law enforcement],‚Äù a former FBI agent told The Intercept. ‚ÄúFour months is a long time [to retain call logs]. It‚Äôs generally 30 or 60 days for telecom providers, because they don‚Äôt want to keep more [records] than they absolutely have to. So if Apple is holding data for four months, that could be a very interesting data repository and they may have data that the telecom provider might not.‚Äù As The Intercept also notes, any data that is collected isn‚Äôt just available through legal channels, but through illegal ones as well. iCloud accounts have been hacked in the past, and may well be again in the future. That last big hack took place in 2014, before call data was part of the iCloud log. The next time someone worms their way in, they‚Äôll be able to get that much more sensitive information along with all the photos and videos that made a big splash. And yes, The Intercept confirmed: Apple knows they‚Äôre doing it, and it is intentional. ‚ÄúWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,‚Äù a company spokesperson told The Intercept. ‚ÄúDevice data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.‚Äù So what can you do? Well, you can disable many iCloud sync features individually‚Ä¶ but call data‚Äôs not on the list. If you‚Äôre running iCloud, then your call data is beying synced whether or not you want it to be. That means your only option, if you don‚Äôt want Apple collecting and storing all your call data, is to disable your iCloud connection altogether. More: How disable iCloud on your iDevice There are basically two steps to that: 1. Backup, download, or archive anything in your iCloud that you want to keep; here are Apple‚Äôs instructions for how to retrieve and save that content. 2. Disable iCloud on every device where you‚Äôre running it. On an iPhone or iPad, just go to the settings menu and scroll down to iCloud, then go all the way to the bottom and hit ‚ÄúSIGN OUT.‚Äù Here are Apple‚Äôs instructions for that, too, and this is how it looks on an iPad: Was this helpful?

How To Disable iCloud On Your iPhone, iPad, Or Other¬†iDevice Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share How To Disable iCloud On Your iPhone, iPad, Or Other¬†iDevice Image courtesy of Adam Fagen November 17, 2016 12:02 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc the more you know apple icloud iphone ipad iCloud can be a very convenient way to back up, sync, and archive a whole lot of digital data, and it‚Äôs easy to set up. But once you‚Äôve got an account, you may someday want to disable it ‚Äî say if, for example, you don‚Äôt particularly want Apple collecting all your call logs. Luckily, that‚Äôs easy to do in a few simple steps. Step 1: Archive, back-up, or otherwise secure anything in your iCloud storage that you want to be sure to keep. Apple has instructions on its support site for how to do exactly that. But the process isn‚Äôt universal; you‚Äôll need to your Calendar separately from your Photos, your Documents, your Notes, and so on. Apple provides instructions for copying your Documents, Contacts, photos and videos, Mail, Calendars, Reminders, Notes, iTunes Store purchases, and Safari data. You‚Äôll have to save information from each of those nine categories separately, if you want to back it up, and you can do so to basically any device ‚Äî computer, phone, whatever ‚Äî as long as it has enough storage room. Step 2: Go sign out of iCloud. On an iOS portable device, that‚Äôs as easy as opening the settings menu, scrolling down to ‚ÄúiCloud,‚Äù and then scrolling down to ‚Äúsign out.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a screenshot of what that looks like on an iPad: A screenshot of the relevant settings menu on an iPad. It‚Äôs pretty much the same on a Mac: you go to System Preferences, then choose iCloud and look for the ‚Äúsign out‚Äù option there. On a Windows computer using iCloud, you‚Äôll have to open the iCloud interface and then hunt for the ‚Äúsign out‚Äù button there. If you‚Äôve been syncing iCloud to Outlook or non-Safari browsers like Chrome or Firefox Apple Support has a guide to disabling iCloud on all those devices, including some settings on iCloud for Windows that may be different depending what other software you use. If you want to be completely disconnected from iCloud, you‚Äôll have to repeat the process on every device you use it on. Was this helpful? We‚Äôre a non-profit!

Apple and Code.org share the goal of giving every student the opportunity to learn computer science. ‚ÄúHour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,‚Äù said Angela Ahrendts, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Retail. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince we started Hour of Code in 2013, Apple has each year upped its participation and found ways to introduce more kids to computer science,‚Äù said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org. ‚ÄúThe global footprint Apple offers through its stores and talented staff has reached tens of thousands of kids, and with the introduction of Hour of Code in Swift Playgrounds we can introduce coding to even more.‚Äù Swift Playgrounds This year, Hour of Code programs at many Apple locations will include an introduction to Swift Playgrounds‚Ñ¢, the free new app for iPad that brings coding to life. The interactive interface of Swift Playgrounds encourages beginners to explore working with Swift, the easy-to-learn programming language from Apple, used by professional developers to create world-class apps. ‚ÄúCoding is just like any language, the earlier you‚Äôre exposed the more successful you‚Äôll be,‚Äù said Craig Federighi, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Software Engineering. ‚ÄúWhether at an Apple Store, in a classroom, or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity.‚Äù A new Hour of Code challenge in Swift Playgrounds makes it easy for anyone to set up their own one-hour coding event, and for those continuing to build their coding skills on iPad, Swift Playgrounds adds a new Learn to Code 3 set of lessons and a companion Teacher Guide. Hour of Code for Educators In addition to in-store workshops, Apple has developed a series of tools to extend Hour of Code into schools and community centers, including a free facilitator guide offering lesson ideas, group activities and more. Apple Teacher, a free, professional self-paced learning program supporting and celebrating teachers in the US, has added resources, badging and recognition for learning and teaching coding with Swift Playgrounds on iPad. Continuing Apple‚Äôs $100 million commitment and ongoing partnership to provide 114 underserved schools with technology, services and support, Apple will provide materials and resources to assist ConnectED schools around the country to host their own Hour of Code workshops.

LIKE ¬† TWEET ¬† SHARE ¬† PIN ¬† SHARE ¬† POST MAIL MORE Posted November 17, 2016 at 4:33pm by iClarified ¬∑ 3156 views ¬∑ Translate Apple is planning bring optical image stabilization to both lenses on its 2017 dual camera iPhones, reports KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The iPhone 7 Plus only has optical image stabilization on its wide angle lens. Kuo says that the telephoto lens will be redesigned to add support for the feature. We believe Apple will add OIS function to the telephoto CCM in order to enhance the selling points of next year‚Äôs new iPhone. We think photo quality and optical zoom range may both improve as a result. We expect the telephoto lens will be redesigned to support OIS in the telephoto CCM, with challenges likely coming from: (1) the need to increase the image circle of the telephoto lens, which will lead to longer calibration time and a more complex assembly processes; and (2) a redesign of the telephoto lens, as an increased image circle will result in degraded photo quality around the corners. It's believed that Apple will release a dual lens 5.5-inch LCD iPhone and a dual lens 5.7-5.8 inch OLED iPhone with a 5.1-5.2 inch active area in 2017. The 4.7-inch LCD iPhone will have just a single lens camera. Largan Precision is said to remain the exclusive provider of 6P and telephoto lens for next year's new iPhones.

There are, of course, in-house options from Apple, high-end bands from H√©rmes, and sporty picks from Nike. The latest added to that triumvirate is a bit surprising: shoe brand Toms. Yes, the OG one-for-one company is getting into the watch band business, and worked with Apple to create a pair of bands that each come in multiple colors, for people looking to bring a bit of granola flair to their techy wrists. Toms is still finding a way to give back through the bands, but not via a straight one-for-one model. Instead, for every Toms for Apple Watch band purchased, households in need will be given one year of solar light. In total, Toms hopes to provide 10,000 years of solar light. Photo: Toms Photo: Toms The cause is unquestionably great, but Toms getting into this space does inspire a couple queries. When the watch first launched, Apple pushed the product hard to fashion consumers. It had a 12-page spread in Vogue, was on the cover of Vogue China, and special editions were gifted to people like Chanel creative director Karl Lagerfeld. That direction has cooled a bit. In September, our sister site The Verge wrote that ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs luxury watch dream is over.‚Äù Sales are also down; according to CNN, they‚Äôve dropped 55% since the early 2015 launch, despite the fact that Apple released a new, cheaper version. Given all that, it makes sense that now they‚Äôre working with a brand like Toms. Prices are relatively low ‚Äî just $49 and $75 ‚Äî for each band. The new relationship is mutually beneficial: Apple has something new to offer its customers that‚Äôll appeal to a more casual crowd, and Toms gets to benefit from the tech giant‚Äôs authority and fanbase. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to reach Apple‚Äôs wide audience and their loyal fans,‚Äù Toms founder Blake Mycoskie said over email.

By Erik Eckel | November 17, 2016, 8:14 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Apple Inc. iCloud is Apple's cloud file storage and services platform. The service permits users to leverage secure and highly reliable cloud computing features and capabilities to store and share a wide variety of files, locate lost equipment, and synchronize information across multiple devices. Apple's iCloud includes multiple features and components. The features included with iCloud are iCloud Drive, iCloud Storage Plans (additional file storage), iCloud Photo Library (cloud-based photo storage), Family Sharing (account and resource sharing), Safari and iCloud Keychain services, and more. We'll periodically update this resource guide when new information is available about iCloud. SEE: Cloud Computing Policy (Tech Pro Research) Executive summary What it is: The cloud service permits users to store and share files across multiple devices and platforms, including with other authorized users. Using iCloud, users can also locate lost equipment, share web surfing status with other devices, share passwords across multiple authorized devices, and synchronize common personal information management components such as mail, Calendar, and Contacts. Users can leverage iCloud to back up iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches. Why it matters: Cloud services play an increasingly important role fulfilling file sharing, collaboration, and application needs. Apple's iCloud service adds more features, including the ability to locate misplaced devices, calendar and contact synchronization, and cloud-based backup. Who this affects: Apple customers benefit most from iCloud. Mac, iPhone, iPad, and iPod users can all leverage the cloud platform to add functionality and serviceability to such Apple devices. While iCloud components, including bookmark synchronization, web-based file access, creation, editing and sharing, and limited application access are all available to Windows users, Apple users‚Äîfor whom iCloud integration is baked into devices' operating systems‚Äîreceive additional functionality. When it was released: Apple iCloud entered service October 12, 2011 after being announced at the 2011 Apple Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC) on June 6, 2011. The predecessor service MobileMe launched January 5, 2000 and was re-launched as part of Apple's .Mac effort on July 17, 2002. MobileMe was ultimately discontinued June 30, 2012. How to get it: An iCloud setup assistant is built into iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Macs. Apple offers directions for setting iCloud up on iOS devices, Macs, and Windows machines. Apple includes 5 GB of free storage with each iCloud account. In the US, 50 GB additional storage costs $0.99 per month; 200 GB costs $2.99 a month; 1TB costs $9.99 a month; and 2 TB costs $19.99 a month. File storage capacity and pricing options vary by country. SEE: Check out all of TechRepublic's smart person's guides (TechRepublic) What it is The cloud service permits users to store, back up, access, view, edit, and share a variety of files and information, including documents, spreadsheets, presentations, photos, videos, music, email, bookmarks, and more across multiple devices and platforms, including with other authorized users. The devices across which iCloud users can share files include Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Windows PCs and tablets. iCloud System Preferences enable customizing the cloud-computing operation. Using iCloud, users can also locate lost equipment. The Find My iPhone feature permits iCloud users to track iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Users can sign into iCloud or use the Find My iPhone app to determine the location of a missing device for which the feature was previously enabled. If a device is lost, iCloud users can remotely send the device a command placing it in Lost Mode, which helps protect the device's data against unauthorized use and encourages whoever retrieves the device to call the owner. iCloud users can also implement a remote erase operation, if necessary to remove personal data from a lost device. Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy iCloud permits sharing web surfing status with other authorized devices. As a result, users can pick up (such as using a Mac) where he or she left off reading on a mobile device (such as an iPhone), or vice versa. The platform enables sharing Keychain information‚Äîapplication and website passwords‚Äîacross multiple authorized devices. The feature helps eliminate the need for a third-party password management program and makes it easier for Apple users to navigate websites and programs without having to commit multiple passwords for numerous sites to memory. iCloud enables synchronizing email, Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, and Notes. When a compatible Mac or iOS device is configured to share corresponding data using iCloud, the cloud service automatically synchronizes the information across all the authorized devices. Then, contacts can be created on a Mac, viewed on an iPhone, and edited on an iPad, for example. Users choosing to back up iPhones, iPads, and iPods can leverage iCloud for these devices' backups. In addition to backing up all photos and videos using iCloud, regardless of which device the image was initially captured on, iCloud permits users to back up iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch configurations and data, which simplifies the process of configuring a new device. Users can choose to restore the entire old backup when deploying the new device. Alternatively, users can deploy a new device and then selectively recover files stored within iCloud Drive or components backed up to iCloud. Competing cloud storage products include Backblaze, Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Microsoft's cloud version, which is intended primarily for Windows PCs but also works for Mac and iOS users, is OneDrive.

(CNET) iCloud Drive: Apple's appealing recipe for cloud storage (TechRepublic) Apple beefs up iCloud Drive storage capacity to 2TB (CNET) Apple's hybrid cloud plan: Google, AWS, Microsoft Azure like most companies (ZDNet) Why it matters Cloud computing is significantly disrupting corporate and personal technology strategies, as noted within a 2016 CIO article. The trend is well documented. Cloud file storage and synchronization services offer secure and reliable alternatives to backing up information, enabling personal information management (such as email operation and calendar sharing) synchronization, and sharing and distributing files with authorized users. SEE: Power checklist: Managing and troubleshooting cloud storage (Tech Pro Research) Cloud subscriptions simplify license management for numerous applications, from creative suite tools to common office productivity applications. Cloud services also permit organizations to more easily receive updates, install application patches, and deploy upgraded software editions. Apple iCloud extends cloud advantages by enabling users to track, retrieve, better secure, and erase data and information on lost equipment. iCloud synchronizes email, appointments, contacts, notes, and reminders across a user's devices, thereby simplifying the daily task of accessing, editing, and synchronizing critical and commonly used data. It's impractical to manually attempt to back up, synchronize, track, and otherwise manage so many devices and datasets. The iCloud web-based interface provides web access to iCloud-synchronized Mail, Notes, Reminders, Contacts, Calendar, and more. Windows users can also access Pages documents, Keynote presentations, and Numbers spreadsheets stored within iCloud, as well as track lost equipment.

The result is seamless configuration, the ability to customize and set various iCloud options differently on a variety of independent devices, and reliable operation. iCloud Drive enables sharing a variety of files across various devices, including Macs, iPhones, and iPads. Image: Apple Inc. Apple provides PC users with an iCloud application that permits sharing files using iCloud Drive, sharing and backing up photos and videos, synchronizing Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Tasks, and Bookmarks and a cross-platform web-based iCloud interface for sharing files and tracking lost equipment. However, Windows phones and mobile tablets don't natively back up applications, settings, program configurations, and other information the way iOS devices do with iCloud, and Windows devices cannot be restored using iCloud the way in which Apple devices are restored. iCloud provides Apple users with the ability to back up photos and videos and share the files across Macs, iPads, and iPhones.

The predecessor service MobileMe originally launched January 5, 2000. MobileMe was re-launched as part of Apple's .Mac branding effort on July 17, 2002.

Additional resources: Apple's WWDC news: Four things that stand out for business users (TechRepublic) Apple cloud vs. Google cloud: The philosophical differences (TechRepublic) macOS Sierra iCloud features aren't ready yet (ZDNet) How to get it Apple includes an iCloud setup assistant within its iPhones, iPads, iPod touches, and Macs. The assistant simplifies deploying a new device, or a reimaged system (such as occurs when replacing a failed hard drive). Apple also publishes and maintains directions for setting iCloud up on iOS devices, Macs, and Windows machines. 5 GB of free storage are included, by default, with each iCloud account; additional storage is available. And, because Apple reportedly leverages Amazon Web Services and Google Web Platform to power its underlying cloud services, Apple can competitively price its data storage subscriptions. In the US, 50 GB additional storage costs $0.99 per month; 200 GB costs $2.99 a month; 1 TB costs $9.99 a month; and 2 TB costs $19.99 a month.

Apple's MacBook Pro is full of innovation, from the 500-nit Retina display with DCI-P3 color gamut to the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports that are the future of physical connectors for Macs and PCs. But the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar is what really grabs your eye. It replaces the row of function keys with a touch screen that has its own watchOS-based processor and interface. You can't load watchOS apps on the Touch Bar; rather, it displays a rapidly changing set of interface buttons and displays, so you can interact with your apps and data more efficiently. It's mainly active in apps written by Apple, but developers are adding Touch Bar support to their programs as we speak. Apple concentrates touch right above the keyboard, which is a much shorter reach than the main screen from your typing home position. Less wasted movement back and forth adds up over the course of a work day, resulting in minutes or even hours saved over a year. We're excited by the possibilities, so here are 15 cool things you can do now, with one to grow on. Dismiss the Cancel/Don't Save/Save dialog after hitting Command + S When you save, instead of having to lift your hand up and reach over to the trackpad or a mouse, simply choose one of the three buttons that appear. Use the Calculator from the number row Operators like AC (all clear), +/-, percentage, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction, and total (=) show up when you open the calculator. It's not a traditional numeric keypad, but you can solve a quick math problem from the number row at the top of the keyboard. Replace Siri with Lock Screen or Sleep Click on "Customize Control Strip" in the Keyboard system preference, and you can rearrange the default controls on the Touch Bar. On the far right, I replaced the Siri button with Screen Lock, because I use that 1,000 times more than Siri on the MacBook Pro. Skip digging through menus The contextual menus just change, depending on what you clicked on last. The Touch Bar will present you with a range of colors when you're formatting fonts and text, and consequently will present a list of predicted words if you're typing text. Predictive Text, just like on your iPhone When you're in Messages or other text-based apps, predictive text will show up in the Touch Bar, like it does on your iPhone. If you're ham fisted, this can speed up text entry and help your accuracy. Preview and Edit your Photos Double-click a picture in Apple's Photo app, and the Touch Bar turns into a row of thumbnails, so you can easily pick through all the pictures in your library in a few seconds. Once you find the right one, you can use the Touch Bar to edit the photo, adjust the colors, or step through filters. The Touch Bar can preview changes right on its display, making it easier to figure out which edits you need. Create a Tune in GarageBand GarageBand presents audio effects so you can tweak the sound on your tracks. Do you want a little more snare drum in the beats you're layering on your latest masterpiece? The Touch Bar lets you dial them in, so it's just right. Keep your fingers on the keyboard Since the Touch Bar is a few millimeters above the number row, you won't have to shift your hand position, as you'd have to do when using the trackpad or a mouse. A few seconds here and there add up over the course of a work week. Buy stuff with Touch ID Once you set up your MacBook Pro with Apple Pay, it will securely send your credit card info to online merchants, just like on your iPhone. Once set up, it will automatically add billing addresses and other contact info, speeding your transactions by several minutes. Unlock your MacBook Pro Sure, like on your iPhone you'll have to enter your password when you first power up, but every subsequent time you unlock the system from sleep, you can just tap the Touch ID with your finger. Switch between tabs visually in Safari Not sure which of the dozens of tabs you have open in Safari has the recipe for millionaire's shortbread? Swipe along the Touch Bar to find it in seconds. Access F1-F12 quickly The ESC key and F1-F12 aren't physically there anymore, but you can bring them up by holding the Fn key at the bottom of the keyboard. FaceTime and Messaging (I assume Skype too, eventually) Start a FaceTime call, and the program will automatically bring up the Full Screen, End Call, and Mute buttons on the Touch Bar. It will also show the contact you've called and a running timer. Likewise in Messaging, you can bring up a row of emoji that you can scroll through to pick just the right one. Final Cut Pro and its accessory apps Final Cut Pro X's commands are so dense, there's a symbiotic industry for keyboard covers and stickers that let you know the keyboard shortcuts. While it won't totally replace keyboard commands you've already memorized, the Touch Bar adapts to what you're doing at the moment, so it will display a group of logical commands as you move through your project workflow. Neat stuff in Calendar and Contacts When creating a meeting in Calendar, the Touch Bar displays open time blocks, days of the week, and other information. It should ease your pain a bit when finding the right time for that post-mortem on the TPS Report. Play games, someday! None of the game developers have announced concrete support yet, but the possibilities are intriguing. If you're running a shooter in the Call of Duty series, for example, the Touch Bar could graphically show you how much ammo you have left for each weapon, and a touch could switch you from your shotgun to a pistol without having to cycle through our other weapons. Other third-party apps like Adobe Photoshop, OmniFocus, and Microsoft Office are expected to have Touch Bar support in the coming months, so we'll be looking out for the improvements too. Until then, have fun!

The move comes after statements from President Elect Donald Trump revealed that he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. Trump said, "We're going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries." "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," a source said. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Although Foxconn has been working on the request, Chairman Terry Gou isn't enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs. "Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double," said a source. The person added that some in Apple's supply chain believe that Trump will push Apple to make certain iPhone components in America. IHS Markit estimates that it currently costs about $225 for Apple to make a 32GB iPhone 7. Apple, Foxconn and Pegatron declined to comment.

Today, all iPhones (and almost all Apple products) are manufactured and assembled¬†in China. The¬†Nikkei report says Foxconn is actively researching ways to make iPhones in the US although¬†Pegatron apparently refused Apple‚Äôs request over cost concerns. A source is quoted as saying that domestic production of iPhones means increasing costs by ‚Äúmore than double‚Äù. Apple has received some criticism over the years for¬†its dependence on Chinese manufacturing but¬†the issue has come into the limelight recently as¬†Donald Trump, now US President elect, claimed that he will force Apple to build its ‚Äúcomputers and things‚Äù in the United States. Like many Trump policies,¬†to what extent he intends to put that plan into action is¬†unknown although¬†it still raises uncertainty about Apple‚Äôs supply chain.¬†The report says¬†sources in the Apple supply chain believe Trump will push Apple to make some percentage of iPhones in the United States. Whatever the¬†reality, it makes sense for Apple to explore¬†domestic iPhone production and be necessarily¬†prepared for any eventuality. The report does not say that Apple, Foxconn or Pegatron have any current plans to begin US manufacturing.¬†Whilst Foxconn is conducting the research, it is also not known what will the ruling will be on its practicality.¬†The report notes that Foxconn‚Äôs¬†chairman is not very enthusiastic about the idea of moving¬†Apple‚Äôs manufacturing line away from China. From Apple‚Äôs perspective, it seems unlikely that the company would move iPhone production to America without a financial¬†reason to do so. If the Trump administration decides to heavily tax¬†company imports, it may end up being cheaper for Apple to manufacture in the US and absorb the higher production costs. As it stands today, Apple assembles¬†almost everything it sells in China; iPhones, iPads and Macs.¬†The exception is the low-volume specialist (and expensive) Mac Pro which Apple makes in a US factory. In the past, Apple CEO Tim Cook has dismissed¬†the possibility of making iPhones in the US due to a ‚Äòbrain drain‚Äô of vocational talent and knowledge in the American workforce. A supplier report from yesterday¬†reaffirmed this position, saying that Donald Trump‚Äôs insistence to¬†make iPhones in the United States is simply impossible.

 The latest rumors are Apple will launch three iPhones in 2017 ‚Äî and one will have a crazy wraparound screen Kif Leswing Nov. 17, 2016, 10:24 AM 22,448 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Images The latest¬†iPhone 8 rumors suggest Apple is preparing a high-end, 5.2-inch iPhone with a OLED display, a newer kind of display technology that has deeper blacks and better color. This phone will be Apple's flagship. The touchscreen on the high-end smartphone will be 5.1 or 5.2-inches, and¬†the rest of the glass screen will wrap around the edges of the phone, according to a research note by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by Business Insider. "We predict three new iPhone models will be launched in 2017: 5.1-5.2‚Äù OLED, 4.7‚Äù TFT-LCD, and 5.5‚Äù TFT-LCD," Kuo wrote. "Display size will no longer be the key differentiating factor between high-end and mid or low-range iPhone models from 2017 onward," he continued.¬† "In terms of the display size of the OLED iPhone, current information from the upstream points to 5.8‚Äù, while that from the downstream points to 5‚Äù, which does not conflict, in our view," Kuo wrote.¬† This OLED iPhone will have a "new look" with a virtual home button embedded into the screen, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.¬† Kuo expects Apple to sell¬†220 million to 225 million iPhones in 2017, which would be up from 2016. But the key will be the availability and market acceptance of the OLED model.¬† iPhone 7S? Apple will also launch two new iPhones with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, which will be iterative successors to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, says KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in a research note seen by Business Insider¬†and Bloomberg. This lines up with other rumors that Apple will launch three new iPhone models in 2017.¬† The biggest change to the two lower-end iPhones is that they will use glass casing, as previously predicted by Kuo, who says the glossy glass casing is particularly popular in Asia.¬† It's entirely possible that these plans could change, especially if certain parts, like the new OLED screens, become scarce. Apple was reportedly planning to launch three iPhones this past year but killed one model at the last minute.¬† A screen shortage kedarkulkarni95/YouTube Bloomberg separately reports that the major OLED suppliers, including Samsung, LG, Sharp, and Japan Display, are having trouble making enough OLED displays, and also¬†having trouble with yield, which means that they are making a high percentage¬†of units that are not up to standards.¬† In 2017, the OLED screens for the new iPhone will be produced¬†exclusively by¬†Samsung, Bloomberg reported. Apple reportedly has ordered 100 million screens over the course of a year, but Samsung may have trouble delivering¬†enough for the 2017 holiday season.¬† Earlier this month, a top Foxconn and Sharp exec talked about upcoming iPhones and OLED screens in a commencement speech in Taiwan.¬† "We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity," he¬†said.

In 20 years if I can't tell a computer, even something with Siri on it, to do what I want and my expectations for the results without having to spend days, weeks, months, or even years building carefully crafted code logic to achieve the same thing, then Silicon Valley has failed monumentally. My only problem in forcing kids into becoming software developers today is that skill set will become obsolete once real machine learning and natural language paradigms for "programming" a device to do something become prevalent. Sure, maybe today's kids will be the ones building those systems, but we are quickly nearing having a generation of kids that will be the last to have to toil in deep code logic. In the same way we currently have a countries full of laborers without any factory jobs, in 20 years we might end up with a glut of software developers with nothing to develop because the average person can whip up an app by request. Still, the logic, problem solving and critical thinking that you learn from writing code is a good way to make kids ready for real life, but ultimately the idea of thinking that all kids will need to write code for the future is a little shortsighted. Rating: 2 Votes zaaach48 3 days ago at 08:43 am In order to be in this class you probably need to have a newer iPad. This is one way of increasing iPad sales this holiday. You'll probably never learn automation anyway, I'm sure you'll learn more about Apple products. Nope Apple provides the devices for the kids to use. I'm a cynic too.... No doubt Apple benefits from this by getting kids on board with their devices from an early age. But no product is sold or pushed at these events, and I speak from firsthand experience. In fact, the kids usually get some free Apple swag. I don't know why people are talking about Automator, it has nothing to do with Swift Playgrounds app...people just want to complain Rating: 2 Votes SigEp265 3 days ago at 07:34 am They took our jerbs!! Rating: 2 Votes H1Supreme 3 days ago at 08:34 am As for skills that will be useful in the future... once programming is no longer useful, I'm skeptical that any skill will be useful. Once computers are able to program themselves, I expect computers will have surpassed us at everything. Exactly. Programming is still going to be around for a long time. People have been making the argument that technology will make creating applications easier, and thereby removing the need for programmers, for years. But, the need for programmers is currently larger than it's ever been. Something that is hard for non-programmers to understand is: Writing code is often times the easiest way to do something. Not with a nice GUI interface, and buttons, and sliders, and forms, but with code. Things that appear simple to create, usually have very complex sub-systems with hundreds (if not thousands) of decisions made along the way. Simply telling an AI to "create X application" will be met with many choices. Choices that will most likely require informed decisions. But, yeah, if computers are programming themselves, and software devs are out of a job. Everyone's gonna be out of a job. Rating: 2 Votes nutmac 3 days ago at 11:35 am Hi, would this be good for a 9 year old without any coding (or iOS ) experience? There were kids all over the age group, from as little as 5 to early high schoolers. Having said that, I am a software developer so I've taught him some the basics early on. [doublepost=1479411467][/doublepost] They let kids that young go? Interesting. I have a 5 year old niece who said she wanted a robot that allows her to program it for Christmas. And for her 5th birthday, she didn't want barbies or princess stuff; she wanted "science stuff". Sorry, proud uncle here! I'm not sure if she's ready for this kind of programming, but I think this kind of thing helps build their logic & critical thinking skills. I am not sure about Swift since that's new, but Code.org is specifically designed for K to 12, so that would include your 5 year old niece if she's already kindergarten ready or in kindergarten. Check out Code.org. It's free and all you need is a browser.

This is a huge fundamental problem of our future as a species. I've had so many in-depth conversations about this, it's not even funny. Just because I'm a philosophical kind of person. I've often thought, what will really be the last thing to go? First, manufacturing and processing, obviously, but then what? I'm a financial analyst, and I somehow manage to max out the ram on my desktop at work (it only has 8GB) just playing around in Excel sometimes, but my job will definitely be coded for eventually. Then we have machine learning so the damn coding won't need coders lol. I almost think doctors and lawyers will be the last to go, just because I don't think people will trust robots for that stuff. Surgery on the other hand, again, already partially replaced/aided by robots. Trying not to go on too much of a tangent here, but I already did so I'll stop and won't even get to how the hell we're going to distribute goods and services once no one has a job or how AI will probably wipe us off the face of the planet because all we do is use up natural resources and cause species to go extinct lol.

Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov suspects in an interview with Forbes that this is most likely a result of iOS 10‚Äôs expanded scope of call logging due to the new CallKit framework which was designed to¬†make VoIP calls from apps like Viber, WhatsApp and Skype behave like cellular calls and integrate with Phone‚Äôs Recents and Favorites. According to Apple itself, call log syncing through iCloud is a convenient feature that elevates user experience by allowing customers to easily return calls from VoIP apps. In addition to FaceTime call logging, iOS 10 now uploads incoming missed calls from apps like WhatsApp and Skype to its servers. Only metadata (data about data) is being stored temporarily on servers, not the actual recordings of your conversations. Synced metadata contains full information about call duration and both parties. ‚ÄúWe were able to extract information going back more than four months,‚Äù said¬†Katalov. He further¬†explained: Syncing call logs happens almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours. But all you need to have is just iCloud Drive enabled, and there is no way to turn that syncing off, apart from just disabling iCloud Drive completely. The problem is, many apps on your iPhone won‚Äôt work properly if you disable iCloud Drive or will at least lose their iCloud-related features completely. Apple claims in its privacy-related documents¬†that it stores FaceTime call logs on servers for up to 30 days. Katalov points out that the¬†firm¬†doesn‚Äôt make it clear that it keeps call logs even when iCloud backups are switched off. Apple responded to the Forbes report with the following statement: We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers‚Äô data. That‚Äôs why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication. It should be noted that Apple holds the encryption keys that protect iOS device backups in iCloud which allows them to read data in backup files to comply with court orders requesting access to these iOS¬†device backups. The company currently does not utilize end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups because doing so would render backup files and any¬†iOS device data stored in them inaccessible should a user lose the encryption key. iOS security expert Jonathan Zdziarski called iOS 10‚Äôs call log syncing via iCloud more of an engineering issue around ‚Äúmaking Handoff work‚Äù when you are answering calls between your phone and your desktop or if you‚Äôre using FaceTime on your desktop. ‚ÄúThey need to be able to sync a lot of that call data. I suspect whatever software engineer wrote that part of it probably decided to just go and stick that data in your iCloud Drive because that‚Äôs kind of what its purpose is. I‚Äôm convinced it wasn‚Äôt very well thought out if that‚Äôs the case,‚Äù he explained. Apple was also¬†wrongly accused of storing iMessage contact data on its servers for up to 30 days for no apparent reason. In reality, the publication which¬†broke that story didn‚Äôt really have a clue as to how iMessage works because entering a phone number or email address when starting a new iMessage conversation prompts Messages to verify contact information against Apple‚Äôs¬†directory of iMessage-enabled addresses on iCloud.

Apple's smartwatch features a heart rate tracking sensor built into the underside of the device.¬† Scroll down for video¬† Scott Thomas, 51, (pictured right) from Rhos-on-Sea in North Wales claims that the heart rate monitor on his techie timepiece may have lead to life-saving treatment. The alarm was raised when his friend pointed out an unusually low heart rate reading on his watch In June last year, Mr Thomas says that he was showing off the heart rate monitor on his smartwatch, a present from his wife Pat, to a friend who mentioned that his heart rate seemed low (42bpm). Mr Thomas, a lecturer at Llandrillo college, continued to monitor his heart rate, but didn't see any major change during the following two weeks, even during brisk walks or while going up stairs.

Share this article Share 280 shares Following a visit to his GP, Mr Thomas was referred to¬†Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital (LHCH) where he was told that he suffered from a condition called cardiac sarcoidosis.¬† The condition was blocking signals to his heart telling it that it needed to work harder when he was putting pressure it while exercising.¬† Mr Thomas says that his doctor informed him that the condition was serious enough that he should not have been left alone while it was left untreated. Pat Thomas pictured after his operation along with a his post-op heart rate shown on his Apple Watch Pat Thomas after her first half-marathon - she is running another this weekend to raise money for the LHCH In November 2015, Mr Thomas underwent an operation to have an¬†ICD (implantable cardiac defibrillator) fitted.¬† The device acts as a pacemaker and can shock the heart to regain a natural rhythm if it detects any abnormalities.¬†¬† He regularly has check-ups at¬†LHCH with both a lung and cardiac consultant and is still on medication, but has returned to full-time work.¬†¬†¬† 'I have to say that the Apple Watch has to be the best present that I have ever bought for Scott,' said Mr Thomas' wife, Pat. 'Without it he probably would not be here today.¬† 'It saved his life.'¬† Mr Thomas added:¬†¬†'I was so impressed with the Apple Watch, well it told me that there was something wrong with me and I didn't know, I felt fine.¬† 'My GP was so impressed, he went out and bought one, and my wife now has one too'.¬† Mr Thomas' wife Pat, is now running a half marathon on 20 November to raise money for the¬†LHCH that helped with his care.¬† HOW THE APPLE WATCH CALCULATES YOUR HEART RATE The Apple Watch uses photoplethysmography technology to measure heart rate.¬† The system is based on the fact that blood is red - because it reflects red light and absorbs green light. Sensors on the underside of the watch sit against the wearer's wrist. Using green LED lights paired with light‚Äësensitive photodiodes, the amount of blood flowing through the wrist at any one moment can be detected.¬† The systems is based on the fact that Blood is red - because it reflects red light and absorbs green light. This is why green LEDs are used to detect blood flow. When the heart beats, blood flow in the wrist - and green light absorption - is greater and when it's in between beats, blood flow is less. By flashing LED lights hundreds of times every second, the sensors calculate the number of times the heart beats each minute.¬† The heart rate sensor can also use infrared light.¬† This mode is what Apple Watch uses when it measures your heart rate in the background.¬† Source: Apple¬† ¬† Read more: Homepage | Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Share or comment on this article e-mail 280 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Girl won right to be frozen just days before dying Scrapped!

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday ¬† ¬† OLED IPhone 8 To Sit On Top Of IPhone 7S And IPhone 7S Plus Posted: Nov 17 2016, 8:52am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple ¬† ¬† The new iPhone 8 with OLED screen will mark the introduction of a new premium line says analyst. Apple will keep the iPhone 7 design around for 2017. The iPhone 7S will look like the current iPhone 7S, but have the typical performance bump. The rumored OLED iPhone with new design will create a new premium iPhone line sitting on top. This new positioning of the iPhone 8 comes from a new KGI analyst report seen by 9to5Mac. Don't Miss:¬†Top 100 Black Friday 2016 Deals The 5.2-inch iPhone 8 has reportedly no bezel and screen wraps over the edges. The iPhone 8 is rumored to have a complete new design. It makes sense for Apple to not drop the iPhone 7 design. It is successful and it is actually pretty could. It fixes all issues the iPhone 6 design had.¬† The new iPhone 8 could be the rumored iPhone Pro line. Apple needs to find somehow a consistent model scheme to be not confuse customers. So instead of iPhone 8 or 10th anniversary iPhone, Apple might introduce next year a 5.2" iPhone 7S Pro, 5.5" iPhone 7S Plus and 4.8" iPhone 7S. It is though still too early too call. Another new iPhone report claims that Apple is working on augmented reality to be integrated in the iPhone 2017 line-up. According to a report on Business Insider, Apple is working on an iPhone camera app that supports augmented reality functions. The Apple AR team also works on augmented reality smart-glasses says a report on Bloomberg. Apple seems to have an easier time to innovate the iPhone, but fails pushing new grounds in computing. The new MacBook Pro with its fiddly Touch Bar has not impressed most Apple fans. The company has apparently no idea what the next big step is for laptops and desktop computers. Apple execs stated that touch-screens are not an option for Apple. This understandable as OS X is not a touchscreen OS, but then why not just enable the OS to support touch?

Mi Box is an affordable 4K HDR streamer, but dragged down by Android TV Posted Nov 17, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Sprinklr acquires Little Bird, a tool for finding experts on anything via¬†Twitter The¬†Mi Box¬†is¬†Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi‚Äôs¬†play to take on¬†devices like Roku, Apple TV, Android TV and Fire TV. Priced at only $69, and sporting features like integrated Google Cast and voice search, the 4K- and HDR-supporting device seems worth a look. But at the end of the day, Mi Box is still an¬†Android TV player, and subject to limitations of that platform ‚Äî which are many. At a Glance: Quad-core 2GHz ARM processor 2 GB RAM and 8 GB storage (expandable via USB) Bluetooth remote with voice control 4K video support at 60 FPS The Mi Box is quite thin. This roughly 4 x 4-inch matte plastic device is only about a quarter-inch thick. That‚Äôs smaller than the Apple TV, Fire TV and Roku‚Äôs higher-end boxes, though I‚Äôm not convinced that people buy streamers largely for their portability. (Or, when portability is a concern, they probably opt for a stick or dongle like Amazon Fire TV Stick or Chromecast.) On the back of the Mi Box is a power port, USB (which can support adding storage or Ethernet via an adapter), and a 3.5mm headphone jack that also can be used to connect to external speakers. Included with the device is the power cord, HDMI cable and a simple Bluetooth remote. Set-up Getting started with the Mi Box was not the most seamless experience, but, to be fair, set-up tends to be one of the more frustrating aspects to configuring any new device. img_1230 img_1231 ¬†View Slideshow Previous Next Exit An on-screen animation prompts you to press a button on the remote to get going, but some accompanying text would be helpful. (After all, why are they moving¬†both thumbs to press a single button? Is their finger over the circular home button or the volume up? The diagram could be more¬†clear). You then step through a fairly standard series of Android TV configuration questions, like language, Wi-Fi network, location services switched on‚Ä¶ oh, and you‚Äôre cool with giving Google your personal data and letting it download updates as needed? Great. There‚Äôs an option to use your Android phone or tablet to simplify set-up, or you can visit a URL on your phone and enter a code. (The webpage didn‚Äôt work on my iPhone, though. You could enter the code, but not click through.) Alternatively, you can sign in to your Google account directly on-screen. There‚Äôs an extra level¬†of hell for anyone using two-factor authentication that involves typing in your Google account email and password, then having to type it in again after Mi Box realizes you‚Äôll need to go through a different authentication flow. Yay. Thank goodness set-up is a one-time affair. Remote The Mi Box remote isn‚Äôt cluttered with buttons, which mostly is a good thing. As to whether you like the choice to use the directional pad over player controls (play/pause, rewind, fast forward) may come down to personal preference. But the built-in volume controls are great to have. There‚Äôs also a power-off button, which is different. I tend to leave my Roku on all the time for the lovely background images, but you might like having the option to put your box to sleep when not in use. Just be careful ‚Äî when my mind wandered, I once hit the power button out of habit, because Roku‚Äôs home button is also at the top. That was fun. User experience People may be compelled to buy the Mi Box because it delivers 4K/HDR streaming at a lower price point than rivals like Roku‚Äôs 4K-ready Premiere ($80, 4K), Premiere+ ($100, 4K/HDR) and Ultra ($130, 4K/HDr), or the high-end NVIDIA Shield ($200). Meanwhile, Mi Box will support 4K Ultra HD and the HDR10 standard (the latter, enabled from Android N and onwards). But it is user experience that truly makes someone love their device, and being built on top of Android TV has¬†pluses and minuses. On the upside, Google has great voice recognition capabilities and it‚Äôs handy to be able to kick off a voice search with just a press of a button on the remote. You can search for content beyond simply naming a title or actor you want to seek out. For instance, you can ask to see ‚ÄúLeonardo DiCaprio‚Äôs Oscar movie,‚Äù or questions like who played a certain character in a film. With voice commands, you can also launch apps, change channels, search the web, go to some TV shows and movies directly and more. You even ask non-TV related questions, like what‚Äôs the weather, or (as my kid likes to do), basic factual questions, like ‚Äúhow far is the moon?‚Äù (It‚Äôs a trick she picked up from Alexa.) Navigating using the remote, though, is snappy. You can move quickly through selections and by holding down on the directional remote, you can fly across the on-screen items. This is (unfortunately) especially handy, since the rows of apps you install are laid out in long, horizontal rows across the home screen. Apps also load quickly,¬†and games ran smoothly. (Note that Mi Box supports external game controllers, but this was not included with the review unit. ) mi-box_10 mi-box_01 mi-box_05 mi-box_02 mi-box_04 mi-box_08 mi-box_03 mi-box_06 mi-box_09 ¬†View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Unfortunately, Android TV has its downsides. If you‚Äôre fine with being a bit locked into the Google ecosystem, you may not mind the fact that there‚Äôs no way to access Amazon‚Äôs content library or Prime Video, or that the¬†‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù at the top promote everything Google, like YouTube videos or Google Play Movies & TV, alongside a bunch of tips like ‚ÄúHow to cast.‚Äù The Mi Box also ships with an annoying row of ‚ÄúMi Box Recommends‚Äù app links. This includes a bunch of standard fare, like Netflix, Sling TV, Vudu, Pandora, HBO Go, Hulu, CBS All Access, VLC and others. But you can‚Äôt delete this row, and to remove an app from this row you have to first install it, then uninstall it. Meanwhile, though Android TV supports most of the major streaming apps, to install them you have to visit the Google Play store from the device. Apple TV, by comparison, organizes apps into categories as part of its larger user interface design. Then there‚Äôs the problem with navigating in and out of apps. While hitting the ‚Äúback‚Äù button may exit you out of YouTube after some clicks, for instance, doing the same with Netflix takes you to its settings screen. This is a minor issue, perhaps, but one that¬†can have you hesitating when mindlessly mashing your remote control. Another feature that seems great in theory, but fails in practice is Android TV‚Äôs Live Channels. The idea here is to give you an easy way to tune into live television programming served up via apps. However, there are only a few apps that support this right now, like Pluto.tv, but not the major players like Sling TV or PlayStation Vue. And when you start the live channel, then¬†return to the home screen, the video keeps playing. For the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to shut the video¬†off beyond entering, then exiting, another app. Why Mi Box? The market for Mi Box comes down to wanting to cater to tech enthusiasts who are already looking for a 4K or HDR streamer and are intrigued by the lower price point. Apple TV doesn‚Äôt yet support 4K, and Roku‚Äôs options are more expensive. But on that latter front, you get what you pay for. On Mi Box, you‚Äôre on your own to find 4K content across apps that support it, like Netflix, YouTube, Vudu, UltraFlix and Sony‚Äôs Ultra streaming service. Roku‚Äôs software, on the other hand, highlights where to find and watch 4K video. There‚Äôs also the fact that, at the end of the day, this is Android TV. Enthusiasts may see this as an advantage over Apple‚Äôs more closed ecosystem. On Mi Box, you can sideload apps, like Kodi, for instance. But you can do this on Amazon Fire TV, as well, which supports 4K, has Alexa and is getting a refreshed user interface. Android TV has been largely forgotten in the streaming media race, and there‚Äôs a reason for that. It‚Äôs an unfinished ‚Äî and way too Google-y ‚Äî experience. If you‚Äôre going for platform lock-in, it‚Äôs hard to choose¬†Android TV over Apple‚Äôs better-designed Apple TV. Or for those who want to stay in the Android universe, Amazon Fire TV seems a better choice. That said, given its price point for 4K and HDR, and its availability both in¬†Walmart stores and on Walmart.com,¬†Mi Box will likely make its way into a number of U.S. consumers‚Äô homes in the months ahead. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Xiaomi Founded 2010 Overview Xiaomi Inc. manufactures and distributes mobile phones and consumer electronics.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Nov 17, 2016 at 9:35AM ¬† iPhone 7 and 7 Plus come in a variety of colors including a new black model. Image source: Apple. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has set a difficult bar for itself. It can put up numbers that most companies would be thrilled to have and still be considered a failure based on past results. That's what's happening with the release sales for the new iPhone 7. Apple has managed to get a seemingly impressive number of customers to buy its latest phones, according to analysis from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), but the iPhone 7/7 Plus launch still lags behind the company's most-successful release. Since the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launched on Sept. 23, CIRP estimates that 73% of iPhone buyers in the United States purchased one of the two new models. That seems like a very high number, even for a year with a new model number (as opposed to the "s" years which involve a lesser upgrade), but for Apple it's only a middling result. CIRP Partner said Josh Lowitz, in a press release: The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launch falls between the wildly successful iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch in 2014, and the somewhat disappointing launch of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015...The combined share for the 7 and 7 Plus launch is up slightly from the 71% share for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015, and down considerably from the 81% share for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus benefited from a new form factor, a larger screen, and the introduction of the even larger and premium-priced Plus model. Image source: CIRP. There is good news for Apple Even though the amount of people choosing to buy the new models (rather than a still-available older one) has dropped from the 2014 highs, the company has managed to keep the same percentage of users (about one third) buying the bigger, more-expensive Plus model. That's up from around 25% who opted for the larger, pricier phone in 2014. "Average selling price and gross margins suffered with the launch of the iPhone SE earlier this year, which continues to account for a meaningful percentage of sales. We expect the strength of the higher-priced Plus phones will boost average selling prices and margins," Lowitz said. Switching from Android was a factor Oddly enough the percentage of Android users switching to iPhone 7 was sort of the opposite of the overall sales pattern. The number of Android users who switched to the 7 and 7 plus came in at 17%. That's better than the 6 and 6 plus (12%), but worse than the 6s and 6s Plus (26%). "The two more successful iPhone launches in the last three years were driven by existing loyal iPhone owners who upgrade to a new iPhone model, and rely less on Android owners who switch to an iPhone," said CIRP Partner Mike Levin. "When Apple launched the less compelling iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models in 2015, existing iPhone owners essentially sat out the upgrade cycle." It's hard to be upset about any of this 73% of Apple customers upgrading to the newest, most expensive phones is still pretty impressive. Despite numerous internal upgrades, in reality it's hard to think Apple will hit its peaks with any model that does not have a noticeable physical change over earlier iPhones -- such as with the 6 and 6 Plus. In this case, the 7 and 7 Plus have some minor physical differences from the various 6 models, as well as the expected improved processors, cameras, and more storage on the entry-level models, but they just aren't that different from their predecessors. Apple has trained people to upgrade every year, but they have also taught some value-seeking buyers that older models get cheaper when new ones come out. These are good numbers which nearly any other company would be happy to be able to deliver. Apple may not have delivered an unquestioned grand slam, but it has served up something between a home run and a stand-up triple. Daniel Kline owns shares of Apple.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 17, 2016 at 9:00AM Apple isn't giving up on TV yet. Image source: Apple. It's been about nine months since we first heard about Vital Signs, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) rumored foray into original TV content that would be based on hip-hop-artist-turned-Apple-executive Dr. Dre. We haven't heard much about the project since, but there have been various other headlines and rumors that form a mosaic around Apple's interest in original content. There's no doubt that Apple has some interest here, but it's being incredibly noncommittal. Apple acquired the rights to an unscripted TV series based on Carpool Karaoke, months before CEO and Alabama-native Tim Cook serenaded attendees at Apple's September iPhone event with Sweet Home Alabama. That performance came just a couple months after services chief Eddy Cue told The Hollywood Reporter: We're not in the business of trying to create TV shows. If we see it being complementary to the things we're doing at Apple Music or if we see it being something that's innovative on our platform, we may help them and guide them and make suggestions. But we're not trying to compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or compete with Comcast. Cue's comments don't exactly line up with what Cook said last month on the earnings call: I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content, as you point out. We've got a few things going there that we've talked about. And I think it's a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. and so it's is an area that we're focused on. Now The Information is reporting that Apple had expressed interest in a video deal with Chris Rock, which didn't progress much. Netflix ended up scooping up the comedian for a $40 million deal. What in the world is even going on? Make up your mind, Apple If there's a lack of consistency between reported headlines and executive comments, that's probably because Apple doesn't even know how it wants to proceed here. TV has always been a hard nut to crack, and Apple has no easy solutions with modernizing the industry given how entrenched the value chain is. Apple's TV ambitions stem from its long-standing strategy of using exclusive services as a differentiating factor to sell its hardware, and its track record doing so is mixed, with both successes and failures. There have been many reports of Apple trying to put together a slimmed-down TV bundle with just 25 channels, but Apple has never made meaningful progress negotiating with networks and cable operators, since it is essentially asking them all to disrupt themselves by embracing cord-cutting. Apple's new TV app will be released later this year. Image source: Apple. The Mac maker recently announced a new TV app that hopes to unify the viewing experience across all devices, aggregating content from a wide range of providers. The new TV app is just as notable for what it has as for what it lacks -- namely, Netflix and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Omitting Amazon is expected, given the two companies' long-standing rivalry within services and utter unwillingness to collaborating on each other's platforms. But Netflix's exclusion is more peculiar, since it has always had a good relationship with Apple. Of course, Netflix has its own apps for Apple platforms, so it won't really be missing out. If we wanted to really speculate, Apple's new TV app could be seen as a precursor for some type of TV service if and when Apple inks the necessary partnerships. But the secret sauce would always be original content as a differentiator. This is where it gets tricky. Don't do it, Tim Apple absolutely wants to continue growing its services business, which is now a nearly $25 billion business that's primarily built on non-recurring content purchases from iTunes and the App Store, as well as AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Music now has about 17 million subscribers, which annualizes into about $2 billion in revenue. As Apple continues to highlight recurring-revenue sources, a TV subscription service fits right in. But original content is expensive -- Netflix just raised $1 billion in debt to fund its aggressive original content plans for 2017-- especially if you do it right. TV is an inherently fickle and unpredictable industry. No one knows what will be a hit and what will be a flop. At least 15 studios passed on Stranger Things, which proved to be a sleeper hit for Netflix that drove subscriber growth last quarter. Experimenting is a requisite, and that's why Netflix takes a broad approach. It's also why it costs so much. To build a compelling library of original content, you need to buy shows across a wide range of genres as well as localized content for certain geographies, and each risks being a flop. Netflix's subscriber numbers show that the video streamer is executing quite well, but video streaming is Netflix's core business. It makes far less sense for Apple to put any meaningful amount of money toward building a library of original content with the hopes of building a TV service as a side business. Most importantly, can you imagine a customer buying an iPhone so they can subscribe to a hypothetical Apple TV service just so they can see exclusive original content? Me neither.

The latest numbers from Gartner suggest that it is Chinese brands that¬†saw the benefit. The September 2 recall of the Note 7 saw Samsung‚Äôs Q3 market share fall year-on-year from 23.6% to 19.2%, its¬†worst performance ever, creating an opportunity for other brands to pick up the slack ‚Äì but¬†the iPhone¬†didn‚Äôt manage to do so ‚Ä¶ Gartner reports that the iPhone actually saw a year-on-year fall in its own market share, from 13% to 11.5% in the same period, despite the smartphone market as a whole growing by 5.4%. Apple‚Äôs iPhone sales continued to fall in the third quarter of 2016, with a 6.6 percent decline. Apple accounted for 11.5 percent of the global smartphone market, its lowest share since the first quarter of 2009. Apple‚Äôs sales fell by 8.5 percent in the U.S. and by 31 percent in China, two of its biggest markets. The iPhone 7 struggled to stimulate replacement sales. This performance also saw Huawei‚Äôs increasing move into the premium market help it close the gap on Apple,¬†reducing Apple‚Äôs lead from 5.3% last year to 2.8% this year. The real winners were two Chinese brands, Oppo and BKK, each of which came close to doubling their market share. ‚ÄúChina led the growth in the smartphone market in the third quarter of 2016,‚Äù said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. ‚ÄúSales of smartphones in China grew by 12.4 percent, and the vendors who most successfully exploited the sales opportunities there were Oppo and BBK Communication Equipment. In Oppo‚Äôs case, 81 percent of its smartphone sales came from China, while BBK accounted for 89 percent of smartphones sales in China. These two vendors also grew strongly in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia,‚Äù he added. None of this is likely to cause too many sleepless nights in Cupertino, however. While Apple may be losing ground in market share, it still takes home almost all the profits in the industry.

Apple patent shows Siri inside iMessage to help with scheduling, payments and more Posted Nov 17, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Tray.io raises a $5m Series A, led by Mosaic Ventures, to sort out the mess in the¬†Cloud Google‚Äôs smart virtual helper Google Assistant is finding its way into everything from the company‚Äôs chat app Allo to Pixel smartphones and its Amazon Echo rival, Google Home. Now it appears that Apple is considering following suit in at least one of those areas. A newly unearthed Apple patent indicates the company is looking into integrating Siri into its own messaging platform, iMessage. The patent, which was first spotted by the AppleInsider blog, explains how Siri could be used during a chat session to answer questions, schedule meetings, offer directions, provide weather information, check movie times, book dinner reservations, complete financial transactions and more. For example, a user might ask Siri for help in scheduling a meeting that works with everyone‚Äôs schedules in a group chat, and the assistant could then tap into the participants‚Äô calendar information to determine when they‚Äôre free or busy. In this case, the assistant bot would show a selection of times when everyone could meet, and the people in the group chat could vote on the best date through an in-conversation poll. Another example mentioned in the patent application is the ability to use Siri for person-to-person payments. The¬†assistant could look to see which payment methods are installed on each user‚Äôs device, and then pick a selection of options the sender of the payment could choose from. This could help ease the problem of not knowing whether to send someone money through PayPal, Venmo or Square Cash, though it seems it could also be used with Apple Pay, if the company desired. The virtual assistant is described as using semantic analysis to understand when it‚Äôs being called up in the conversation, plus it knows when its help with a task only needs to be seen by a single¬†individual instead of the entire group chat. It will then present itself to the conversation participants accordingly. In typical Apple fashion, consideration is given to how users could maintain control over their personal information when Siri is available in iMessage chats. It sounds like one idea suggested by this patent would be to have some sort of opt in/opt out toggle switch, similar to how Apple allows users to turn off ad tracking in iOS‚Äôs¬†Privacy options. And the patent states that ‚Äúsuch collection [of personal information] should only occur after receiving the informed consent of the users.‚Äù While a patent application isn‚Äôt an indication of a feature that‚Äôs actually in development, this one is notable because the trend toward chats and computing that‚Äôs augmented by bots doesn‚Äôt appear to be going away anytime soon. There are¬†a growing number of ¬†virtual helpers available, like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and Apple‚Äôs Siri, as well as Facebook Messenger bots, and those on other messaging platforms. Apple rival Samsung also just acquired a next-gen Siri-like assistant called Viv,¬†to better compete. And Apple has been buying up machine learning startups itself, though it missed one earlier competitor called Emu, which sold to Google, which¬†could have brought the above capabilities to iMessage given its focus on integrated assistance in chat sessions. If we‚Äôre going to spend more time talking with bots, it makes sense that Apple would want to leverage Siri in its own messaging service ‚Äî especially now that Siri can pull up information from not only Apple‚Äôs own services, like its calendaring app, but those from third-parties, as well. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase iMessage Full profile for iMessage Siri inc Founded 2007 Overview Siri is now a [product](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/siri) of Apple Corp.

For instance, Apple envisions iPhone users being able to point their cameras at any number of objects and have the device itself recognize what‚Äôs in frame. As another example, Apple might want to build in functionality that would allow the iPhone camera to recognize and manipulate faces. While the above functionality isn‚Äôt new in and of itself (a number of third-party apps like MSQRD already boast these¬†features), having it integrated directly into the iPhone 8 camera is intriguing. Notably, Apple‚Äôs vision for augmented reality only begins with the iPhone 8 camera, with much larger plans in store later on down the line. Eventually, the person said, after the AR features are built into the iPhone camera app, Apple will release the technology behind them as an SDK for app developers, like it did with its Touch ID fingerprint sensor. At that point, Apple will become a competitor to companies like Vuforia and Blippar. What‚Äôs more, Business Insider‚Äôs own sources corroborate the aforementioned rumor that points to Apple releasing a pair of smart glasses as early as 2018. Adding more fuel to the fire, it‚Äôs no secret that Apple has made a number of augmented reality acquisitions and hires over the past few months. This past September, for example, Apple hired Zeyu Li, a vision algorithm engineer who previously worked at Magic Leap, an augmented reality-centric startup. Further, Apple a few months back also hired research scientist Yury Petrov who previously spent nearly three years working on the Occulus VR. Also joining the mix at Apple is John Border, the former head of engineering at the Osterhout Design Group. There, Border worked on ‚Äúimaging systems development for head mounted displays.‚Äù As for what he‚Äôs doing at Apple, Border‚Äôs LinkedIn profile indicates that he‚Äôs a ‚ÄúSenior optics manufacturing exploration engineer.‚Äù Interestingly, Business Insider references that the Osterhout Design Group already sells a pair of smart glasses, a demo of which can be viewed below. As for the entirety of Apple‚Äôs AR team, the following Financial Times report from last year is worth highlighting. The secret research unit includes hundreds of staff from a series of carefully targeted acquisitions, as well as employees poached from companies that are working on next-generation headset technologies including Microsoft and camera start-up Lytro, according to people familiar with the initiative. The company‚Äôs latest acquisition in the area is Flyby Media, an augmented reality start-up that uses let mobile devices ‚Äúsee‚Äù the world around them. Fly-by‚Äôs team worked closely with Google in developing software for its 3D positioning technology Project Tango. When there‚Äôs smoke there‚Äôs usually fire, and it‚Äôs increasingly starting to look like Apple‚Äôs plans in the AR space may see the light of day sooner rather than later.

The company‚Äôs latest acquisition in the area is Flyby Media, an augmented reality start-up that uses let mobile devices ‚Äúsee‚Äù the world around them. Fly-by‚Äôs team worked closely with Google in developing software for its 3D positioning technology Project Tango. When there‚Äôs smoke there‚Äôs usually fire, and it‚Äôs increasingly starting to look like Apple‚Äôs plans in the AR space may see the light of day sooner rather than later.

The¬†report¬†says Apple is planning one new iPhone, dubbed iPhone 8, with major chassis redesigns and component upgrades¬†featuring an OLED screen about 5.2-inches in size. It will also make two¬†new iPhones with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays; these will be more iterative¬†successors to the iPhone 7 and¬†iPhone 7 Plus. The OLED iPhone appears to be the most interesting phone that will¬†include the most ‚Äònew‚Äô stuff.¬†If the KGI report comes to pass, in 2017 the high-end iPhone will not be the one with the biggest screen. The report notes that the OLED iPhone will have an ‚Äòactive screen area‚Äô of 5.1- to 5.2-inches¬†but the panel itself may be up to 5.8-inches diagonally. This¬†probably means the user-interactive touchscreen will be about 5.2 inches with the remaining area wrapping around the edge of the phone, as rumored. A detailed description of the OLED iPhone changes was not given but it seems like it will feature a bezel-less front¬†design with¬†the Home Button somehow integrated into the display. The screen panel¬†would extend¬†around the sides of the phone for aesthetics similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge. KGI says the OLED panel for the iPhone will¬†be supplied exclusively by Samsung. The report explains that Apple will put the latest designs and developments into the OLED iPhone, essentially making it the flagship 2017 Apple iPhone despite not having the largest touchscreen.¬†With the current phones, the largest 5.5-inch ‚ÄòPlus‚Äô model is technically superior to the 4.7 inch phone with a dual-camera. According to KGI,¬†display size will no longer be the differentiating factor between high-end and low-end iPhone devices. (KGI also says that the dual-camera component will get upgraded next year to add optical image stabilization to both the telephoto and wide-angle lenses). The aforementioned 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones will still¬†have updates but they will largely resemble the industrial design of the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. KGI says that these devices¬†will likely adopt glass casing instead of¬†metal,¬†in the same general design¬†as current iPhone models. The purpose of the iterative 4.7-inch and iPhone 5.5-inch is unknown. KGI speculates they may be offered at lower price points, attracting more price-conscious customers,¬†allowing Apple to pack advanced technology into the premium (undoubtedly more expensive) OLED flagship¬†iPhone. This report implies the biggest shakeup¬†between iPhone SKUs so far as previously iPhones have been pretty similar apart from screen size. It would mean¬†the new iPhones using two different display technologies, external chassis design and more. Keeping¬†OLED to just one model may be a supply chain limitation; last night, Bloomberg said Apple was struggling to secure OLED displays for iPhones in sufficient quantities.

Stevey's Blog Rants Random whining and stuff. Wednesday, November 16, 2016 The Monkey and the Apple It's been a while! I took a couple of years off blogging because I felt I didn't have much left in the way of interesting things to say. ¬†So I've been just been programming, and studying, and learning this and that. ¬†I've been doing a bit of Cloud development, and I taught myself iOS development, and after years in the Google cocoon I poked my head out and learned how people do things in the real world with open source technologies. And lo at long last, after some five years of tinkering, I finally have something kind of interesting to share. ¬†I wrote a game! ¬†Well, to be more precise, I took an old game that I wrote, which I've perhaps mentioned once or twice before, and I turned it into a mobile game, with a Cloud backend. It has been waaaay more work than I expected. Starting with a more-or-less working game, and tweaking it to work on Cloud and mobile -- I mean, come on, how hard can it be, really? ¬†Turns out, yeah, yep, very hard. Stupidly hard. Especially since out of brand loyalty I chose Google's cloud platform, which 3 or 4 years ago was pretty raw. ¬†And let's face it, iOS APIs have evolved a ton in that timeframe as well. ¬†So even as "recently" as 2013 I was working with some pretty immature technology stacks, all of which have come leaps and bounds since then. And now I have all sorts of stuff to share. ¬†Definitely enough for a series of blog posts. ¬†But I also have less time than before, because it's all happening in my non-copious spare time, all late nights and weekends. ¬†And running an MMORPG is a fearsome task in its own right. Incidentally, I've just opened the game up for beta testing, so if you want to try it out while you read along, visit http://ghosttrack.com to request an invite. ¬†You'll need an iPhone, iPad, or iPod running iOS 10.2¬†(Edit: 9.2!)¬†or later. ¬†I'd love to do Android and PC, but there's only one of me. ¬†For now. So where do I start? ¬†I guess the logical thing to do would be to start at the beginning, but screw all that, I'm starting with the monkey. The Monkey I had the following conversation with my wife the other day. It went something like: Wifey: Baby, I lost all my stuff! (A lot of our conversations have started this way since April, give or take, when she started playing the game.) Me: ¬†What stuff baby? Wifey: (wailing) All the stuff I had in my house!! ¬†I dropped it all there and them boom, it disappeared, right in front of my eyes. ¬†I was watching it and then five seconds later it was gone. ¬†This happened before, and I didn't want to tell you because I wasn't sure, but I just saw it! ¬†It happened! Me: ¬†OK baby I'll come look. Wifey: ¬†See? ¬†It was right there! ¬†I had a lot of good stuff there and it's gone! Me: ¬†(looking around) ¬†I believe you baby. Me: ¬†(looking around some more) ¬†I think... I think the Monkey did it. Wifey: ¬†What monkey? ¬†What!? ¬†That monkey took my stuff? Me: ¬†(checking)¬† Yep. ¬†It picked it all up and it's carrying it now. Sure enough, her pet monkey had picked up all her precious loot and valuables. ¬†But while she stared in disbelief at this unexpected betrayal, I was worrying about how I was going to get her stuff back. ¬†Because there were two problems. First, the monkey wasn't killable via combat, since I had marked pet creatures in your personal home as non-attackable. ¬†I don't know if that was the best decision ever, but it seemed reasonable at the time. ¬†And second, there was a chance that if I pulled out the big guns and killed it myself, for instance by invoking its kill() method directly at runtime, its inventory (her loot) would be replaced with the default monkey inventory of bananas and fur, or whatever I'd given them. I'm pretty sure that in most states, accidentally replacing your wife's hard-earned treasure with bananas and bits of fur is legal grounds for divorce. ¬†So I was in a bit of a pickle. Wifey: How are you going to get it back? ¬†I can't believe that monkey! ¬†Can you just make it drop it? Me: ¬†Well I could, but the AI will just immediately pick everything up again. Wifey: I worked hard for that stuff! ¬†I can't even remember what I had! ¬†An amulet, a sword, a girdle, all kinds of stuff! Me: Don't worry, baby. ¬†Tap on the monkey, you can see it carrying everything. ¬†Just give me a second to figure it out. The picture below shows the predicament. ¬†Wifey is the naga warrior, I'm the old guy in the blue pajamas, just like in real life, and the monkey is barely visible 2 squares below her, by the Japanese shoji screen. Every creature in the game has an event queue and a command processor, and can respond to generally the same set of commands as players. ¬†Normally the AI decides what commands to give a monster, but you can inject your own commands under the right circumstances, or even take control for a while (e.g. with the Charm Monster spell). ¬†So I decided I'd try to command the monkey to give me the items, one at a time. The game is written mostly in Java, but a good portion (maybe 25%) is written in Jython, which is an implementation of the Python language on the Java virtual machine. ¬†And, usefully, Jython has eval and exec functions for interactive code evaluation. ¬†So I opened up my command interpreter and went to work. > exec monsters = me().map.monsterList Ok > eval monsters [monkey] > exec monkey = monsters.iterator().next() Ok > eval monkey Monkey > eval monkey.inventory The MonsterInventory contains: ¬†- bit of fur (0.06 lb) ¬†- bone (1.5 lb) ¬†- Amulet of Acid Resistance (0.12 lb) ¬†- bag (0.5 lb) ¬†... So far, so good. ¬†I had a reference to the monkey in my interpreter, and I was seeing Wifey's stolen valuables, plus the expected monkey inventory. ¬†Now for the coup de grace. > eval monkey.commandNow("give amulet to rhialto") > None > Monkey gives you Amulet of Acid Resistance. Woot! ¬†Success. ¬†I had to keep chasing the monkey around, since offhand I couldn't think of a way to make it stand still. ¬†In retrospect I could have paralyzed it, or set its AI to the stationary AI used for immobile monsters. ¬†But I couldn't be bothered to look up how right then, since I hadn't ever been in a situation quite like this before, and my wife was alternating between indignation, amused disbelief, and near panic over her stolen stuff. I had a mechanism for getting the items back, so I just followed the monkey and issued those commandNow() instructions. Unfortunately, and to my lasting surprise, the monkey started ignoring me after the fourth or fifth item. ¬†It continued about its business, but it would not give me any more items. ¬†I still don't know exactly why, since this was such an edge case scenario. ¬†I have a large toolchest of utilities and commands for manipulating player inventories and map contents. ¬†But it's rare that you need to command a monster to give you stuff. ¬†Normally you get a monster's inventory the old-fashioned way. You pay the iron price. I was irked by the monkey's emergent nonchalance, so I pulled out the hammer: > eval monkey.kill(me()) > Ok > You killed monkey. Where me() in this case is the attacker. As I feared, the corpse's inventory was completely empty, because I clear out the inventory for pet monsters, to prevent abuses where you just create them in builder mode, take their stuff, and make infinite cash. So I busted out the clone() command and manually recreated the rest of the missing items as best I could, and gave them all back to Wifey. ¬†I'm pleased to report that this story had a happy ending. How to Make a Game You look at a game like Wyvern, which is at its heart just a tiles game like the old roguelikes, and maybe a bit of a MUD, and you think, gosh, I could do that. ¬†And you can! Off the top of my head, you will need: ¬† * A cloud computing platform such as AWS, Azure or GCP. ¬† * Xcode and a Mac, or else Android Studio and a whatever-you-want. ¬† * A programming language and a compiler. These days, I would go with Kotlin. ¬† * A service for browsing and licensing music and sound effects. They have those now. ¬† * A service for hiring contractors for artwork and maybe level design. They have those too! ¬† * A hosted datastore, because seriously it's 2016, don't administer your own. ¬† * A source hosting and bug tracking service, such as Bitbucket. ¬† * A good lawyer and a good accountant. ¬† * About twenty years. Ha! ¬†I kid. ¬†I've only put about ten years into it, spread over the past twenty years. ¬†I started in 1996; my character Rhialto will turn 20 on March 1st. ¬†But in terms of total person-years, it's in the hundreds, largely due to area design contributed by dozens of passionate volunteers. It's amazing how much stuff we have access to since I started this project back in 1996. ¬†Back then, I had Java, and we're not talking about Java 8 with fancy lambdas and streams. ¬†We're talking Java 1.0.2, with that O'Reilly book with the referees on the the front. ¬†You had to roll everything yourself back then. ¬†Uphill both ways, in the snow. ¬†(Actually the game started in C++ in 1995, but I migrated to Java and never looked back.) I went through something of a life crisis in 2004, after 8 years of working on the game, because my productivity had tanked as the code base grew, and I wanted it back. ¬†So I stopped working on the game, for the most part, and went on a Grail-like quest to find a good language -- one that was ultimately unsuccessful, although I learned a lot and got some good rants out of it all. Nowadays, though, sheesh. ¬†Between GitHub and its infinite supply of high-quality libraries, cloud providers and their hosted services, Stack Overflow and its infinite supply of answers to just about every question you'll ever encounter, and all the services available for payments and contractors and everything else you could want -- I mean, it's a startup's dream come true. ¬†I am way more productive than I was in 2003. ¬†All I needed was a time machine. Even so, a game like this -- which, despite its simple appearance, is a true MMORPG with surprising depth -- is basically an infinite amount of work. ¬†Lifetimes of work. ¬†So you have to practice triage, time management, and stress management. But really, anyone can do it. ¬†You just gotta _want_ it bad enough. Apple vs. Android I have enough material for lots of blog posts now, and I'd love to spend some time exploring Google's Cloud Platform (GCP) in future articles. ¬†I've learned a thing or two about Android as well. ¬†And Kotlin is absolutely entrancing. ¬†I haven't used it yet for anything serious, but it's one of the best new languages to emerge in a long, long time. ¬†Would love to talk more about Kotlin at some point. For today, though, I thought I'd offer a few musings on Apple, iOS, and their store ecosystem. ¬†I'm still no expert, and I don't do anything iOS-related at work. ¬†This is just some very personal impressions I've collected while making the game. A lot of people have asked me why I did my first mobile client in iOS rather than Android. ¬†The answer is monetization. ¬†iOS is straight-up easier to monetize. ¬†Android has cultivated a frugal audience, through both marketing and hardware choices, and that cultivation has been a success. ¬†Android users tend to be frugal. ¬†That doesn't mean they don't spend money, but it does mean they are more cautious about it. ¬†I have friends who've done simultaneous iOS/Android releases for their apps, and invariably the iOS users outspend the Android users by anywhere from 4:1 to 10:1 -- anecdotally, to be sure, but a little Googling is enough to support just about any confirmation bias you like. ¬†So I picked iOS. When I started, I didn't know Objective-C, and I started just before Swift came out, just a couple of months. ¬†But by then I was far enough into development, and wary enough from prior experiences with new languages, that I opted to continue in Obj-C. ¬†Obviously today I'd do it in Swift, and if I weren't always so time-constrained, I could even start introducing Swift class-by-class. ¬†Swift is cool. ¬†It actually reminds me a lot of Kotlin. ¬†I think language designers must have some sort of clique these days, whether they know it or not. What about iOS? ¬†Well, there's not much to it. ¬†And that's a good thing. ¬†It feels familiar, at least if you've done any sort of UI programming at all in your career. ¬†I've done some Java AWT and Swing, some Microsoft MFC and whatnot, some X-windows work, some web programming, whatever -- rarely anything major, but I've tinkered with UI throughout my career. ¬†Frontend UI is a skill every engineer should have, even if it's just one framework that you know well. Coming from all those frameworks, I had certain expectations, and they were 100% met by iOS. ¬†It has an MVC framework, and you add views and subviews, and you have all the hooks and lifecycle events you'd expect -- after learning Objective-C, I'd say it was only about four days (thanks to the excellent Big Nerd Ranch book) before I was able to start cranking out reams of code by copying it all directly from Stack Overflow, as is tradition. Why am I making such a big deal about iOS's almost boring familiarity? ¬†Because Android is the exact opposite of intuitive and familiar. ¬†I've gotta be a little careful here, since I recently joined the Android tools team at Google, and I don't want to throw anyone under the bus. ¬†They did the best they could with the environment and situation they had when they started back in the early 2000s, which featured phones that didn't even have memory -- they just had "address/contact slots". ¬†It was awful. ¬†They did fine. But now, thanks to Moore's Law, even your wearable Android or iOS watch has gigs of storage and a phat CPU, so all the decisions they made turned out in retrospect to be overly conservative. ¬†And as a result, the Android APIs and frameworks are far, far, FAR from what you would expect if you've come from literally any other UI framework on the planet. ¬†They feel alien. ¬†This reddit thread pretty well sums up my early experiences with Android development. So as much as I'd love to make an Android client for my game, it's not going to happen for a while. ¬†Plus I'm still iterating heavily on the iOS UI, so I might as well wait until it stabilizes a bit. That's enough about Android for today. ¬†I always gauge how edgy my blog posts are by how likely I am to get fired over them, and my little indicator is redlining, so let's move back to Apple and iOS. Apple: ¬†The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Objective C isn't so bad. ¬†They have continued iterating on it, so even though its string handling is comically verbose, and it has no namespacing, and there are tons of other modern features missing, the language is pretty capable overall. ¬†It has generics, literal syntax for sets/dictionaries/arrays, try/catch/finally macros, extremely well-implemented lambdas with proper closure capturing (unlike nearly every other non-functional language out there), properties, and many other modern conveniences. ¬†The syntax is awful, and it can get pretty weird when you're bridging to the C APIs, but on the whole you wind up writing less code than you'd think. In fact, various bloggers have measured it, and if I recall correctly, the consensus is that Android Java is about 30% more verbose than Objective-C. ¬†Which is pretty counterintuitive, because the Java language itself, verbose as it may be, is clearly less verbose than Objective-C. ¬†What's happening here is that iOS has such good APIs, you wind up needing to write a lot less code to get your job done. So Obj-C isn't bad, and Swift looks really good. ¬†The APIs are good, the documentation is solid, and Apple is aggressively deprecating crummy old APIs (like UIAlertView) in favor of better-designed ones. ¬†Everything is still there in the system, and you can see generations of whole layers of API access dating all the way back to the old NeXT computers from the late '80s (heck, everything in iOS starts with NS, for NeXTStep) But you don't have to use most of that stuff, because Apple has been constantly layering on new APIs that modernize it all. ¬†Unlike, you know... some other, uh, people. >.> Xcode is pretty good. It used to be bad, but now it's not bad at all. ¬†Yes, it crashes more than I'd like, and yes, its refactoring support is abysmal. ¬†It's no Visual Studio. ¬†But "pretty good" is good enough. ¬†Because all I'm doing is copying code from Stack Overflow, really I have no shame whatsoever, and Xcode works great for that. ¬†It even formats it for me. ¬†Who am I to complain? ¬†Besides, I use Emacs for any serious editing. So for the Good, we have the languages, the APIs, and the tools. ¬†What about the Bad? Well, Apple's review process is really, really, really long and convoluted. ¬†Sure, I can totally understand why. ¬†They have millions of developers trying to shoehorn crap into their store, and they are trying to make a strong quality stand. ¬†But it means you're in for a wild ride if you're making anything more complicated than a flashlight app. First you have to go through their checklist of roughly seventeen thousand rules, and make sure you have addressed each of them, since all of them can result a veto. ¬†And wouldn't you know it, I checked exactly sixteen thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine of those rules very carefully, so my app was rejected. ¬†Because they don't mess about. ¬†You have to follow all of them. The story of my app's rejection is epic enough for an opera, but in a nutshell, Apple requires that all apps support ipv6-only networks. ¬†But none of the major Cloud providers supported ipv6 at the time of my submission, in late September. ¬†You're pretty well covered if you're just doing HTTP(S), but if you use sockets you're hosed. ¬†My game uses direct TCP/TLS connections to my cloud instances, so it didn't work on an ipv6-only network, and my app was kicked to the curb like so much garbage. ¬†At least they did it quickly. After some technical consideration, I did the only logical thing, and got on my knees and begged them for an exception, because what am I gonna do? ¬†Some cheesy hack with an ipv6 tunnel provider to a fixed IP address on a single instance? ¬†Well, yeah, that's exactly what I was going to do, if push came to shove, just to get through the review. Even though it's completely non-scalable. ¬†Desperate times. Fortunately, after a mere six weeks, and me finally sending them an angry-ish (but still cravenly and begging) note asking WTH, they granted me the exception for 1 year, backdated so it was really only 11 months, but whatevs. ¬†I was approved! The Ugly Just kidding, haha joke's on me, I was NOT approved. ¬†Because when they gave me the exception, they also threw in a major feature request. ¬†Lordy. ¬†It's almost like they're a monopoly or something. ¬†They didn't like that my game required you to sign in via a social network -- Facebook, Google, or Twitter for now, since those are the sign-in SDKs that I've managed to wire up so far. ¬†So they asked me to implement Wyvern Accounts. Sigh. ¬†I was so relieved that I got the exception, I didn't fight it. ¬†I called back to ask if it was OK to require an email address, for account/password recovery functionality (but also because I use the email address to tie your characters together), and they said that was fine. So I went to work, even though my game had already been in Alpha for six weeks too long, and I implemented Wyvern accounts. ¬†New database table, new web service, new API service, new UI screens for registration and account creation and password resetting, new plumbing for passing credentials to the server, blah blah blah. ¬†God dammit, the nerve of them to ask for such a big feature. A week later when it was all finished, I realized FB/Google/Twitter all have minimum age requirements (all 13 years minimum because of COPPA), so I had been protected until Apple threw their curveball at me. ¬†Now I need underage reporting and god knows what else. ¬†Still working through it with the lawyers. I'd go back to Plan B (in iOS-land, B is for Begging), except that I actually sort of agree with Apple that I need this feature. ¬†Not everyone is on a social network. ¬†For example, there is an uncontacted tribe deep in the South American rainforest who are not on Facebook yet, although I believe they are still eligible for Amazon Prime. ¬†And also some of my alpha testers were struggling with it. ¬†I guess there are a lot of people who not only don't have GMail, but they prefer not to sign up for a free account. ¬†I can only assume the NSA is responsible for this phenomenon. ¬†But it means I most likely need Wyvern accounts. Another reason I sort of need Wyvern accounts is that Facebook, Google and Twitter all have very different philosophies about email-verification APIs. Facebook's philosophy is, roughly: "What's a few API calls between friends?" ¬†They have quotas, but they're so high that I won't have to worry about them for years. Google's philosophy is, roughly: "Our APIs should scale with your business." ¬†They have quotas, but they're so high that I won't have to worry about them for years. Twitter's philosophy is, roughly: "Go fuck yourself." ¬†I exhaust their tiny quotas every day, even after adding credential caching so that players only re-validate once every 8 hours or so. ¬†Even though I only have a few dozen, maybe fifty regular players right now, only a handful of which use Twitter. ¬†Their quotas are comically, absurdly low. So I'm probably going to have to yank Twitter out before launch, which would limit people to FB and Google sign-in. ¬†And that seems like... not enough options. ¬†I don't like having to maintain my own accounts, but I think I'm pretty well stuck with it. The takeaway (well, other than "don't use Twitter APIs"), is that Apple can jerk you around pretty much all they want, and you'd better like it. ¬†You should basically prepare for a long review. Back to The Good Despite the bumps in the (long) road so far, some stuff has been great. ¬†TestFlight, which is Apple's beta testing system, is working nicely for me. ¬†It provides me with crash reports which have identified half a dozen real issues so far. ¬†The sign-up is a snap, and they'll let me have up to 2000 testers, which will help me make sure my stuff scales, if I can get that many. And their review turnaround time has been pretty good. ¬†It generally takes about a day, in my experience. ¬†I'm not sure why they require a manual review for my Beta builds, after they've already approved me for the actual store launch. ¬†And every build requires another 1-3 day review. ¬†But I've got a pipeline going, and I'm pleased overall with how straightforward it has been. I'm really worried about In-App Purchases. ¬†I offer them in my game (though it's definitely not pay-to-play), but Apple's testing for IAP leaves a lot to be desired. ¬†You have to sandbox it, and this requires setting up separate accounts. ¬†It's not possible to enable production IAP (with real money) before the actual launch. ¬†But their sandbox environment makes it really easy to screw up a transaction, after which your device will prompt you for a store login every 5 minutes for the rest of your miserable life, and likely into the hereafter. ¬†It's a mess. You can sort of enable IAP in Beta/TestFlight, but it's *free*, which means players would be able to acquire millions of coins for free, and it would require me to perform a full reset of everyone back to level 1 before launch. ¬†I'm trying to avoid that. So I have no idea if my IAP really works. ¬†I got it working in the sandbox at one point, and I'm hoping it works in prod, but until I'm confident that it's working, I'm going to have to charge for my app, to forestall the possibility of a massive meltdown from casual players (tourists, basically) eating up my server resources. ¬†I don't want to get a gigantic bill from Google. ¬†So I need to limit the growth as best I can for a while. Going Forward Building this game has been a lot of fun. ¬†I've learned more from doing this project than from anything I've ever done that was work-related, at any job I've had. ¬†Something about having to do a big project yourself forces you to pay attention to everything in a way that you rarely have to do at a corporation. I don't know if it's going to be a hit. ¬†Statistically, probably not. ¬†But I have some pretty darn loyal players. ¬†The game was down for five years (2011-2016), and when I brought it back up, a hundred or so old timers appeared out of nowhere. ¬†Many of them had to purchase iOS devices just to play, but they splurged. ¬†And they started playing insane hours. ¬†The ratio of 7-day-active to concurrent players has been crazy. ¬†In the old days it was about 100:1, so on a server that could comfortably support 100 concurrent players, I'd typically have about 10k 7-day actives. ¬†It was self-limiting because I only had one server back then. With these alpha testers, the ratio has been about 4:1. ¬†They're playing upwards of 8 hours a day, around the clock. ¬†And they're all over the world -- I have testers in Japan, England, New Zealand, Spain, Nigeria, Toronto, east coast, west coast, I forget where they're all from. ¬†But we're talking about a group of only about 60-70 regulars, so the diversity is quite remarkable. This letter they wrote me back in 2012,¬†when the game went down so I could port it to Cloud, gives a pretty good sense of how much people like it. I'll report back in a few months and let you know how the launch went. ¬†Meantime, if you want to play, visit http://ghosttrack.com. ¬†Hope to see you online!

More Android Users Switching to iOS Thanks to iPhone 7 GO Stats show that more users are moving from Android to iOS Nov 17, 2016 13:30 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Bogdan Popa ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† Apple claims the iPhone 7 is selling like hot cakes, but without specifics that would support this statement, not everyone seems to believe these words. And a report coming from research company Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that Apple‚Äôs statements aren‚Äôt exactly accurate, revealing that the iPhone 7 is indeed selling better than the 6s, but not as well as the iPhone 6. ‚ÄúThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launch falls between the wildly-successful iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch in 2014, and the somewhat disappointing launch of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015,‚Äù said Josh Lowitz, CIRP Partner and Co-Founder. Specifically, iPhone 7 has a combined share for the standard and the Plus models that‚Äôs better than the 71 percent obtained by the 6s generation, but still behind the 81 percent share posted by the 6. And this is mostly because the iPhone 6 was a completely new model as compared to its predecessor, as it had a new design, a bigger screen, and several new features. More Android switchers What‚Äôs equally important is that the number of Android switchers is also growing, although not in a significant way. For example, the percentage of users coming from Android to iOS improved from 12 percent at the time of the iPhone 6s launch to 17 percent for the iPhone 7, which is a welcome growth for Apple, who has already stated that it expects a boost from the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 userbase. Samsung abandoned the Galaxy Note 7 series after incidents of batteries catching fire and Apple was said to be one of the preferred choices for buyers who returned their phones, but accurate figures of how many customers actually bought an iPhone are not yet available. So in the end, it looks like the truth is somewhere in between Apple‚Äôs words and the estimates, as the iPhone 7 is indeed selling better than its predecessor, but it‚Äôs not an overwhelming growth over the iPhone 6, which indeed offered so many reasons to upgrade.

 Apple is failing to dent Android's dominance over iPhone Jim Edwards Nov. 17, 2016, 7:46 AM 4,037 facebook linkedin twitter email print iOS market share has nearly halved over the last two years and is now in danger of declining to under 10% of all phones globally. Gartner / Business Insider Over the last two years, Apple could not have asked for easier market conditions: The iPhone 6 was a huge hit, and eighteen months later Samsung's phone business collapsed after the disastrous Note 7 launch. Yet Apple largely failed to take advantage of Samsung's bad luck. Its iPhone business is in decline, in terms of units sold. And its share of the global smartphone market has almost halved since 2014, according to new statistics from the research firm Gartner Inc. In the last quarter, Apple sold 43 million iPhones compared to 328 million Androids, Gartner says. Android now accounts for 88% of all phones sold. iOS market share is barely above 10% worldwide.¬† iOS global market share: Q4 2014: 20.% Q3 2016: 11.5% Source: Gartner¬† It's not just a story of Apple failing to reach a broader market for its high-end devices. It's also a testament to the resilience and popularity of Android. The operating system, given away free to manufacturers as an open-source product by Google, is often criticised by tech insiders for its fragmentation,¬†the low frequency of software updates for users, and its security holes. And yet the system that tech bloggers love to hate is kicking Apple's butt. At the end of 2014, when Apple launched the iPhone 6, the new large-screen phablet began eating into Android's share of the market almost immediately. By February 2015, sales of Android devices went into decline for the first time ever¬†‚Äî an astonishing defeat for Android, especially given that the product is given away free to manufacturers. Then, in summer 2016, Samsung's flagship Galaxy Note 7 was launched and then immediately aborted after dozens of the devices suddenly exploded. Samsung's unit sales collapsed 14% year on year in Q3 2016, according to Gartner.¬† Apple should have been on the verge of a massive global sea change in its favour.¬† Instead the opposite happened. iPhone collapsed and Android stole the market: Gartner / Business Insider iPhone didn't benefit much from the gap in the market created by Samsung's absence, Gartner's data shows. Instead, Chinese Android manufacturers stepped up their game. China's passion for new Android phones from companies like Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei have¬†cut into Apple's famously high customer retention rates, according to research from UBS. Here is that same data in the form of percentage market share: Gartner / Business Insider From this perspective, the launch of iPhone 6 ‚Äî which looked like a killer blow to rival phones at the time ‚Äî now looks like a brief bump in an otherwise downward historic trend. Of course, Apple has never had a majority market share and it does not want one. Apple sells devices that are among the most expensive, putting them out of reach of most people. Its strategy makes Apple the most profitable smartphone¬†maker on earth. Apple takes 104% of all smartphone profits, globally. (The extra 4 percentage points come from the fact that some rivals sell at a loss.) If Apple were to expand its sales by offering¬†lower prices its profitability ‚Äî and its stock price ‚Äî might fall.¬†So Apple likely isn't¬†too bothered that it is not the most popular kid on the block.¬† Nonetheless, there is a growing chorus of City and Wall Street analysts who want to know what Apple is going to do to either revive the iPhone or launch new products that move the needle the way iPhone did¬†two years ago. The iPhone sales decline is not yet over, they say, because iPhone 7 had lacklustre updates over iPhone 6s. The Apple Watch has proved unpopular with consumers. Rumoured Apple TV and Apple Car devices have failed to materialise. These charts won't help the narrative around Apple ‚Äî they make iPhone look like a¬†problem rather than a solution to Apple's future.

Picked up by AppleInsider, Apple's application for a "Virtual assistant in a communication session" appeared on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's website on Thursday, and details a system in which iMessage users can invoke Siri from within chat threads to get answers to relevant queries, complete scheduling tasks, and more. One scenario describes an instance in which users chatting amongst themselves bring Siri into the conversation simply by including it in the group thread. Using semantic analysis, the AI detects when it may be of help to complete a task and pitches in accordingly - such as finding a place to eat nearby, and telling the user how long it will take for their friends to arrive. Although Siri's responses don't appear to other users, the assistant is able to parse their messages in order to work out whether it can help with a task. For instance, in another example, the user asks "Siri, help us schedule a meeting," in a group chat thread and the AI cross-checks open calendar dates for the present users to suggest a potential meeting date and time. Participants can then vote for a preferred time and place, after which Siri schedules the meeting in everyone's calendar. In another example, chat members are notified that a user is utilizing Siri and are asked if they would like to do the same, and participants can approve or deny AI access to personal data about them during the chat session. Meanwhile other scenarios depict AI interactions during peer-to-peer payments, for example by determining which financial apps are being used by each chat member. Some of the implementations in the patent bear similarities to actions already offered by Google Assistant in Google's Allo app, and by chat bots in Facebook Messenger, while third-party apps like PayPal and Uber currently offer Siri functionality following Apple's release of the Siri SDK to developers. Whether or not Apple decides to integrate Siri in Messages in a future update, the AI is likely to require extensive development before users consider inviting Siri to conversations and extending access to their data.

Rating: 1 Votes Abazigal 3 days ago at 05:54 am Agree. Apple's attempts to charge, for what I receive for free from Amazon and Google, keep me entirely in their ecosystems, and entirely out of Apple's. All I use Apple for is their hardware, for gateways into Google and Amazon. And Apple hardware is starting to fall behind. I wouldn't have believed it two years ago, but I'm starting to see a slight possibility of having a completely Apple free life in a few years. Apple, as I've pointed out in the past, jumped the shark with Beats. They need to go back to making the best hardware there is, charge a lot for it, then have unlimited free services (music, backup) as a side benefit. Otherwise I'll probably eventually be out of here. I've already started buying non-Apple gateways: Echo. Go ahead and leave the Apple ecosystem if you feel it no longer meets your needs, by all means. No need to sound like you have just woken up from the Matrix.

Overheating as Big Annoyances for iOS Users, With Pokemon GO App Highly Prone to Crashes News provided by Blancco Technology Group Nov 17, 2016, 06:00 ET Share this article ATLANTA and LONDON, Nov. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With Apple and Android waged in a perpetual battle for smartphone market share every quarter, device performance can often play a role in shaping the final results. According to the Q3 2016 State of Mobile Device Performance and Health report released today by Blancco Technology Group (LON: BTLG), Apple has once again lost the performance battle to Android with its iPhones and iPads failing at a rate of 62 percent worldwide, compared to the 47 percent failure rate of Android devices. On July 6, 2016, the augmented reality game Pokemon GO was released in North America, Australia and New Zealand. Within days of its launch, the game became an overnight sensation. Data from SensorTower estimates that the average iPhone user spends 33 minutes in¬†Pok√©mon GO, which is more than Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. But users' obsession with the game also caused the app to crash frequently and the server to go down for many users. This is supported by our Q3 2016 mobile diagnostics data, which found that the Pokemon GO app was highly prone to crash on iOS devices (5 percent). "Our data suggests that the problems resulting from playing Pokemon GO were not only limited to iOS users," said Richard Stiennon, Chief Strategy Officer of Blancco Technology Group. "Battery charging ranked in the list of the top five performance issues plaguing Android devices in Q3 2016. Since users must keep both their device screen and GPS on in order to play the virtual reality game, both of these functions are known to drain the device's battery charge." Key highlights from the Q3 2016 trend report include: Newer iPhone and iPad models struggled with higher failure rates, including iPhone 6 (13 percent), iPhone 6S (9 percent), iPhone 5S (9 percent) and iPad Air 2 (2 percent). Apps crashed on 65 percent of iOS devices, which is nearly triple the rate of crashing apps on Android devices (25 percent). Pokemon GO app ranked as one of the most instable iOS apps (5 percent), while the Google Play Services app crashed frequently (10 percent) on Android devices. LeEco's Le 2 had the highest failure rate (13 percent) among the failing Android devices, followed by Xiaomi's Redmi 3S (9 percent), Xiaomi's Redmi Note 3 (9 percent), Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge (5 percent) and Lenovo's Vibe K5 Note (4 percent). Android users worldwide experienced repeated difficulties with their devices' battery charging (7 percent) and screens (6 percent).

(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Share Written by Alexey Semeney November 17, 2016 This post originally appeared at DevTeamSpace Blog. The new MacBook Pro is proof that Apple has stopped making laptops for developers. Here‚Äôs why: 1. No ‚Äúescape‚Äù and ‚Äúfunction‚Äù keys Apple‚Äôs Oct. 27 event confirmed many of the rumors surrounding the long-awaited refresh of the Macbook Pro line. The escape and function keys on the laptops have been abandoned in favor of a touch bar that changes depending on the application that is being used. The last time the Macbook Pro got a major update was a shocking four years ago, and many publications are celebrating the new design. However, the lack of physical escape and function keys is a disaster for one major set of Apple‚Äôs customers‚Äîdevelopers. Let‚Äôs take a look at numbers: There are about 19 million developers in the world. And Apple has managed to sell about 19 million Macs over the past four quarters. What a coincidence! Yes, developers are drawn toward Apple products primarily for software reasons: the Unix-like operating system and the proprietary development ecosystem. But developers use those keys all the time when they‚Äôre programming. Why Tim Cook, why? This isn‚Äôt to say that the touch bar is an inherently bad idea. You could locate it on top of the escape and function keys instead of eliminating them entirely! 2. There‚Äôs almost no improvement for the RAM and processor The 2016 MacBook Pro ships with RAM and processor specs that are nearly identical to the 2010 model. D√©j√† vu? It at least feels like that, because the MacBook Pro has had options of up to 16 gigabytes of RAM since 2010. The only difference now is that you pay for the update. And as for processors, the MacBook Pro had options with 2.4 gigahertz dual-core processors back in 2010. Anything new in 2016? Not really, well‚Ä¶ nope. That feels strange too, especially if you compare the price and the hardware quality to Apple‚Äôs competitors. These days it‚Äôs easy to find a Windows or Linux machine comparable to the Macbook Pro for $1,000 to $1,500. You don‚Äôt need to go far to find them‚Äînotable brands like Lenovo, HP, Asus, Samsung, and Dell all offer them. And for those who aren‚Äôt fans of Windows, Linux is always an option. With more resources poured into Microsoft developers ecosystem and Linux distributions, developers may soon have a wide range of great operating systems that can run on pretty cheap laptops. And to nail it: 3. Here‚Äôs what people are saying about MacBook Pro 2016 With a small investment in desktop Linux, Samsung and Lenovo could so totally own Apple's market share among devs. üíê RIP escape & F keys ‚ö∞ pic.twitter.com/a82wCQcHg5 ‚Äî Quincy Larson (@ossia) October 27, 2016 both the 13‚Ä≥ and the 15‚Ä≥ are capped at 16 GB of RAM. this is unbelievable. ‚Äî Adrian Kosmaczewski (@akosma) October 27, 2016 So what's the plan for VIM users who want the new #MacBookPro?

News SourceÔºö¬† China Daily Apple‚Äôs developments in the market are a hot topic in the technology industry, market rumors that next generation iPhones would be using OLED displays ushered in a large wave of investments in the sector in China. OLED, which was a niche market product, became a hot commodity this year because of Apple‚Äôs interest in adapting the technology in next-generation iPhones. Micro-LEDs were also placed onto the technology industry spotlight two years ago following Apple‚Äôs acquisition of LuxVue, prior to this development micro-LEDs was under the technology industry radar for years. Could the halo effect from Apple make emerging micro-LED technology a contender to mainstream LCD or rising OLED display technologies? A scientist holds a micro-LED chip. Sony launches another micro-LED TV If Apple is a newbie in micro-LED technology, then Sony is a veteran. The Japanese consumer electronic company studied micro-LED and related technology for years, and launched its first micro-LED TV, Crystal LED Display, at CES 2012. Four years after the product launch, Sony went mum about micro-LED TV with no new public product releases. Why has Sony‚Äôs attitude towards micro-LED technology changed after 2012? The LED technology needed to make micro-LEDs is not an issue, since in theory LEDs can be miniaturized to several micrometers, and the accompanying chip and packaging technology is not an issue either, said Philip Chang, Analyst at LEDinside. Yet, the micro-LED technology in 2012 would require usage of 6.22 million LEDs in a FHD Crystal LED display. Leading to low efficiency, low yield rates, and overtly high costs. Commercialization of the micro-LED TV would be impractical using that technology. It took another four years before Sony showed results from continuous investments in micro-LEDs, some spurred by Apple. Sony launched its latest addition to the Crystal CLEDIS (Crystal LED Integrated Structure) at Infocomm in June 2016. The latest product features ‚Äúmodule splicing‚Äù, which greatly lowered the number of LED chips required, and lowered Pixel per Inch from 40 to 15. These changes have made it possible for Sony to realize mass production, and the company announced it would be able to commercialize CLEDIS in 2017. Sony‚Äôs current micro-LED TV design is a ‚Äúvery stupid method,‚Äù it requires splicing the LEDs one by one, or by the thousands simultaneously, explained Zhaojun Liu, Assistant Professor at School of Electronics and Information Technology at Sun Yat-Sen University. Transferring the micro-LEDs and manufacturing period will take a long period, hence it is unsuitable for mass production. If companies want to commercialize the product, they need to be able to reach high volume production, high precision, and high transfer rates. Menglong Tu, head of R&D at Ledman Optoelectronics also noted only when the micro-LEDs first pass yield (FPY) reaches 100% can millions and billions of LEDs be freed from dead pixel issues, which takes technology maturation to achieve. It is estimated the technology will not mature next year, hence the possibility of Sony mass producing micro-LED TVs remains low next year. Micro-LED unaffected by Chinese manufacturers developments Apple‚Äôs entry in micro-LED not only accelerated Sony‚Äôs mass production progress, it also raised Chinese manufacturers interest in the technology. Chinese LED manufacturers are starting to develop micro-LED technology, said Chipone CEO Jingfang Zhang. Last year, Leyard Optoelectronics launched a super small pitch P0.9 mm HD seamless spliced LED wall, which has a pitch less than P1 mm LED displays sold on the market. The main application sector for the LED is still indoor surveillance displays, and unlike Apple and Sony that are both focusing on wearable devices and large TV display market sectors. Even though China‚Äôs LEDs for commercial market reached a reputable size, Chinese manufacturers increased investments in LED equipment sped up national production, but still comprises a small revenue share. Manufacturers are increasingly focused on the commercial LED market, and have not invested as much in advanced micro-LEDs. There have also been few discussions about micro-LEDs in China. So why are Chinese manufacturers uninterested in micro-LEDs? Apple and Sony‚Äôs micro-LEDs are made from a chip perspective, while China‚Äôs small-pitch LED displays are also tiny, the LEDs have a major size difference, said Tu. Domestically, no enterprises in China can form vertically integrated supply chain, and each company is specializing in only one segment of the supply chain. Chip manufacturers are focused on making LED chips, LED packaging, and other specialty applications. Most small pitch LEDs are in the application end, and not in upstream supply chain or chips. Mass produced small pitch LEDs in China are P1.2 to 1.5 mm, while the smallest is P0.9. Apple and Sony‚Äôs micro-LEDs are manufactured on CMOS substrate using IC manufacturing technology to make a LED display driver. The LEDs are then aligned and arrayed on the IC using MOCVD to shrink the LED to micro display size of 100 micrometers, which still lags far behind Apple and Sony‚Äôs micro-LED volume production. More importantly the micro-LED trend led by Apple is still in the R&D phase and far from reaching commercialization. Micro-LEDs on the market currently are similar to LCDs 30 years ago, which required a comprehensive supply chain to lower costs and raise production capacity, said Liu. For Chinese manufacturers the outlook of micro-LEDs is uncertain, companies prefer using current technology and patents. As for when micro-LEDs can really enter the market, it will depend on Apple and Sony‚Äôs technology breakthroughs and market development. Can micro-LEDs challenge LCD and OLED technology? Micro-LEDs have the advantages of low power consumption, high brightness, ultra-high definition, high color saturation, faster response rate, longer lifetimes and higher efficiency. Compared to LCDs and OLEDs, micro-LEDs have the advantages of higher brightness and color saturation. Indoor LED displays made using micro-LEDs can reach 1,000 to 2,000 nits, while LCD brightness reaches several hundred nits, said Tu. Additionally, micro-LEDs can use RGB or RGBW solutions to achieve wider color gamut performance, or better display effects. Micro-LEDs can be divided into two mainstream applications, including wearable devices developed by Apple, while the other is super large TV displays represented by Sony. Potential smartwatches and smart band applications for micro-LEDs based on Apple‚Äôs current market share, if all Apple Watches used micro-LED screens, it will have larger impact on OLED wearables. If micro-LED entered the smartphone market, and had to reach higher PPI or flexibility, it would present technology challenges. Micro-LEDs would have no competitive edge against LCD and OLEDs, hence it would have minor effect on OLED industry. Wearables also have a very small market share in the OLED industry. Meanwhile, cost competitiveness is essential in large displays, where micro-LEDs has limited advantages. There are a lot of challenges for micro-LEDs to overcome in large-sized displays, and over the years the technology had no significant advantages compared to LCDs and OLEDs, said IHS Display Search analyst Terry Yu. The extent of impact from micro-LED developments and impact were not as large as previously thought. LCDs low costs, steady yield rates makes it highly competitive, similar to LCDs and PDP. LCD and micro-LEDs market competition in the future will not be limited to technology, but also the entire supply chain and ecosystem. Micro-LEDs have come under the limelight mainly because of Apple, but it is uncertain whether it can challenge LCD or OLEDs. Technology developments take time, so it is too early to say whether micro-LEDs will replace LCDs or OLEDs, said Professor Zheng Xu, School of Science, Beijing Jiaotong University. Hence, the industry development will still depend on periphery technology developments, for instance if there are no advancements in mask aligner technologies then it will be difficult to raise display image resolution. Micro-LEDs at most can only be described as an emerging challenger of LCD or OLED technologies. Keywords: OLED LCD Technology Micro-LED Disclaimers of Warranties 1.

The trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won‚Äôt have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the Cupertino, California-based company. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display. While Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand. The supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just one version of the next-generation iPhone, push back adoption of the technology or cause other snags. ‚ÄúApple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they‚Äôve also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,‚Äù said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. The combination of Apple‚Äôs stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, he said. Apple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone‚Äôs debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. A pair of other new iPhone models will likely feature screens that use older LCD technology, partly because there won‚Äôt be enough OLED displays to satisfy anticipated demand, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. ‚ÄúDisplay technology is still a pretty key driver of the purchasing experience,‚Äù said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple has previously used new display features as iPhone selling points. For example, the iPhone 4 in 2010 added Apple‚Äôs first Retina Display, the iPhone 5 in 2012 introduced the iPhone‚Äôs first display size increase, and the iPhone 6 in 2014 brought new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen options. The OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device‚Äôs back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple‚Äôs plans. This all-glass design will have virtual Home button embedded in an edge-to-edge screen, rather than a physical button that can be pressed, the person added. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Apple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they‚Äôre unveiled every September, as it did for 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All current iPhone 7 models have LCD screens. Still, Apple may have no choice. Sharp and Japan Display are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track for production in 2018, while seeking to manage expectations. ‚ÄúThere is all this talk about OLEDs, but I‚Äôm not at all sure about their future,‚Äù Sharp President Tai Jeng Wu told reporters recently. ‚ÄúWe need to work on developing the technology, but whether we can succeed remains to be seen.‚Äù Shuji Aruga, president of Japan Display, said earlier this month that he sees a 50-50 split between OLEDs and LCDs that will be used in high-end phone screens. ‚ÄúWe are not yet at a stage where we can decisively choose between OLED and LCD,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to develop OLED capacity so that we are not caught empty-handed if the technology does end up capturing a majority.‚Äù LG Display is the laggard. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that we were late in OLED investment for smaller electronics devices compared to that of televisions,‚Äù LG Display Chief Executive Officer Han Sang-beom said earlier this year, adding that the company now understands OLED‚Äôs importance for smartphones. Apple and Samsung have an exclusive OLED supply deal for 2017, people with knowledge of the agreement said. Still, that doesn‚Äôt guarantee the South Korean technology giant will have enough output to meet demand for the revamped iPhone. For example, Samsung‚Äôs OLED supplies have even been constrained for its own mobile division‚Äôs smartphones. A representative for Samsung Display declined to comment. Apple‚Äôs initial OLED order from Samsung is for 100 million units over one year, according to people familiar with the agreement. Even so, Samsung will probably only be able to deliver a portion of that for the 2017 holiday period. Apple shipped about 75 million iPhones in the 2015 holiday quarter, and some analysts estimate that as many as 90 million could be sold in the last three months of 2017. The OLED screens ordered by Apple in the Samsung deal are for displays larger than 5 inches, a person familiar with the matter said. If Samsung sees supply constraints in its ramp up of OLED panels for the fall 2017 iPhone launch, Apple may not have another major provider to fall back on. That‚Äôs why Apple usually has multiple suppliers for key components. For example, it has sourced LCD panels from all of the major Asia-based display makers. For next year, at least, it appears that OLED supply chain may be a single-company affair. Apple has run into supply problems before, for example when it sought to adopt tough sapphire screens for the iPhone 6 in 2014. Even though it financed a sole supplier, GT Advanced Technologies, to ramp up production and deliver the material, the manufacturer wasn‚Äôt able to deliver enough sapphire glass of acceptable quality. As a result, Apple abandoned plans to use stronger screens, and GT Advanced ended up seeking bankruptcy protection. * With assistance from Takashi Amano, Gao Yuan and Pavel Alpeyev BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

Patrick says Macs are now out of his price range so he‚Äôs looking for a Windows laptop to replace his old machine There are cheaper alternatives to MacBooks out there. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA Jack Schofield Thursday 17 November 2016 05.21¬†EST Last modified on Thursday 17 November 2016 05.40¬†EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Now that Apple Macs have gone up rather steeply in price, they are finally out of my price range. I would like to replace my MacBook Pro with a PC that matches it as closely as possible: well-built, robust, reliable, fast, and with a good, sharp screen. I use my Mac for all the usual surfing, watching videos, listening to music and so on. I also use Adobe Photoshop pretty heavily and video-editing software more lightly. I‚Äôm open to either a laptop or a desktop. Patrick As the old saying has it: ‚ÄúGood, cheap, fast ‚Äì pick any two.‚Äù This is particularly true for Windows laptops, where dozens of companies are competing mainly on price. Things are different for Apple. As the only supplier of MacBooks it can do what it likes. This includes doing things its users don‚Äôt like, such as soldering SSD and memory chips to motherboards and dropping MagSafe, SD slots and standard USB 3 ports from its latest MacBook Pros. This would be suicidal in the Windows market, where buyers can switch suppliers in seconds. Of course, different users want different things, so the big suppliers ‚Äì Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer etc ‚Äì have different ranges for different market segments. Dell, for example, makes three ranges for consumers (Inspiron, XPS, Alienware), three ranges for business users (Latitude, OptiPlex, Precision), and the Vostro range for the soho (small office/home office) market. It therefore caters to budget/price-sensitive buyers (Inspiron and Latitude), prestige/quality conscious buyers (XPS, OptiPlex), and performance-oriented/pro buyers (Alienware games machines, Precision workstations). MacBooks don‚Äôt fit this kind of scheme. They‚Äôre over-engineered consumer laptops with enough performance for most professional purposes. Not many Windows laptop manufacturers can charge pro prices for consumer designs, though Microsoft is having a go. As a result, you will have to compromise. However, you can find Windows laptops that are comparable to MacBooks in many respects, but cheaper. Just look for the various ‚Äúprestige‚Äù consumer ranges such as Dell‚Äôs XPS, HP‚Äôs Spectre and Asus‚Äôs ZenBook. Apple prices Apple has just released new MacBook Pro laptops. There are three versions of the 13in MacBook Pro with Intel Core i5 processors and 8GB of memory at ¬£1,449, ¬£1,749 and ¬£1,949. There are also new 15in MacBook Pros with Core i7 processors and 16GB of memory for ¬£2,349 and ¬£2,699. All prices include VAT but not port adaptors or AppleCare support. You haven‚Äôt given me a budget, but halving Apple‚Äôs cheapest new MacBook Pro prices would suggest a range of ¬£725 to ¬£1,200. This is in the same ballpark as the survivors from the old ranges ‚Äì 13in MacBook Airs at ¬£949 and ¬£1,249, plus the MacBook at ¬£1,249 ‚Äì which I assume you will also consider. Laptop options The Dell XPS 13 and 15 are the most obvious alternatives to MacBooks. Unfortunately, they are at the top of this price range. You can still get an old-model XPS 13 (9350) for ¬£899, but that has a Core i5-6200U with only 4GB of memory. The latest 9360 version has a 2.5GHz Core i5-7200U, 8GB of memory and a 128GB SSD for ¬£999. If you go for a 512GB SSD at ¬£1,099, you‚Äôre only saving ¬£400 on a new 2.0GHz MacBook Pro. The Dell XPS 15 is better value. You get a Core i7-6700HQ, 8GB of memory, Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M graphics with 2GB of video memory, and a 256GB SSD for ¬£1,249. It has a Thunderbolt 3 port, two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI and an SD card slot. It‚Äôs also small and light for a machine with a 15in screen. It measures 357 x 235mm (roughly 14 x 9in) and weighs 1.78kg (3.9lbs). This compares with 349 x 241mm and 1.83kg (4.02lbs) for the new ‚Äúthinner and lighter‚Äù MacBook Pro 15, which costs ¬£1,100 more. HP‚Äôs Spectre x360 range offers similar features to Dell‚Äôs XPS range, except that all the x360 laptops have touch screens that you can rotate to enable ‚Äútent‚Äù (eg for movie viewing) or tablet operation. The cheapest model is the HP Spectre x360 13-4126na. This has a 13in screen, a Core i5-6200U processor, 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD for ¬£999. You can upgrade to an HP Spectre x360 13-4129na with better screen resolution ‚Äì 2560 x 1440 instead of 1920 x 1080 ‚Äì plus a 2.5GHz Core i7-6500U and 512GB SSD for ¬£1,199. Again, this is not much cheaper than a 2.0GHz MacBook Pro 13. Yet again, the 15in HP Spectre x360 15-ap007na is better value. For only ¬£100 more, you get a 4K (3840 x 2160) screen, a Core i7-6560U with Intel Iris Graphics 540, 16GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD in a 1.82kg machine. Even at ¬£1,299, it‚Äôs still ¬£1,050 cheaper than the new MacBook Pro 15. Cheaper and cheaper You could also look at the Lenovo ThinkPad T560, which is a robust, professional 15.6in laptop that starts at ¬£751.19. The main attraction is that you can customise it from a menu with a huge range of options. You could get one with a Core i5-6200U, 8GB of memory, Nvidia GeForce 940MX with 2GB, a 256GB SSD and Windows 10 Home for ¬£901.19 ‚Äì and that includes three years of on-site service. Upgrading the second battery from 47WHr to 72WHr would add another ¬£12. Upgrading the RAM to 16GB would add ¬£52.80. Upgrading the CPU to a Core i7-6600U would add ¬£260. The Asus ZenBooks may also appeal because of their Apple-style aluminium unibody construction, though they‚Äôre really aimed at MacBook and MacBook Air users. The ZenBook UX330UA-FB025T with a 3200 x 1800 screen, Core i5-6200U, 8GB of memory and 256GB SSD is good value at ¬£749.99. PC World has the similar UX310UA for ¬£649.99, and you can find many other models if you shop around. Possibly the cheapest just-about-viable option is the 14in Lenovo IdeaPad 510S, which is a step down from the ZenBooks. All the various models have 1920 x 1080-pixel screens and 8GB of memory. The cheapest on Lenovo‚Äôs website has a 2.4GHz Core i3-7100U and a 128GB SSD for ¬£509.99, while the most expensive has a 2.9GHz Core i5-6267U and a 256GB SSD for ¬£599.99. However, John Lewis has a silver one with a Core i7-6567U for ¬£599.99, so that might be worth a look. Of course, there are hundreds of cheaper Windows laptops, starting at less than ¬£150. It just depends how far you are willing to drop your standards. Chips cost money, so below a certain point, price reductions may be coming from compromises on the quality of the case, keyboard, trackpad and screen. If they break, you just buy another. Why not a desktop? You mention that you‚Äôre ‚Äúopen to either a laptop or a desktop‚Äù. If so, you could get more power and better ergonomics by buying a desktop. I covered this last week in Which desktop PC should I buy for working from home? If you went for a Lenovo ThinkCenter M800, you would have many of the same options as when configuring a ThinkPad T560 laptop. You would also be able to add your own upgrades immediately or after another five years or whatever. If you don‚Äôt need to replace your laptop in a hurry, you could wait to see whether Apple brings out a new version of the Mac Mini next year. The current model was launched in 2010 and hasn‚Äôt been updated for more than two years. It‚Äôs not really expandable ‚Äì the memory is soldered in ‚Äì and not very good value (¬£479 to ¬£949), but it‚Äôs small and it runs MacOS. A 21.5in iMac (¬£1,049 to ¬£1,449) could be an option too.

By Agamoni Ghosh November 17, 2016 10:17 GMT Apple's next iPhone to adopt OLED screen but will the supply of display panels be enough to meet demand?Getty Images Apple wants OLED display panels for its 2017 iPhone but suppliers of the component may not be able to meet the demand for the same, says a new report. The supply constraint may even force Apple to release limited next-gen iPhone units in 2017 with the rest using the older LCD technology. A Bloomberg report states that the four chief suppliers of OLED panels for smartphone flagships, Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display combined will not be able to mass produce as many units as demanded by the smartphone industry. OLED screens are difficult and time-consuming to produce and it is likely that this constraint spills over to 2018, according to the report. Of these companies, Samsung is reported to be the chief supplier for iPhone's OLED panels in 2017 but the South Korean company will not be able to make enough panels due to low yield rates along with high demand. The Cupertino company has reportedly ordered an initial round of 100 million units for 2017 but Samsung is likely to produce only a portion of that for next year's holiday quarter. "Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they've also figured out there will be constraints to these panels," says Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. Apple has plans of releasing a breakthrough model of the iPhone for the 10th anniversary of the smartphone in 2017 and a supply constraint may pose to be a big problem for the tech giant. To ease this demand the iPhone maker may resort to releasing a fair amount of units featuring screens that use older LCD technology, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

In reality it certainly did not come with all of the rumored features, but it seems that Apple is still pushing themselves to get there. According to a report from Fast Company (via AppleInsider), they were told by their sources that Apple is exploring ways in which the Apple Watch and the iPhone could be potentially be used to passively monitor Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms. The idea is that by passively monitoring the symptoms, data can be collected so that when patients visit their doctors, the doctors would have the latest information on hand. As it stands, patients suffering from the disease tend to visit their doctors every 6 months or so, which means that in between their symptoms could have gotten worse, and that until their next checkup, they could be on a wrong and ineffective dose of medicine. The initiative is said to be overseen by Stephen Friend, but Apple has since declined to comment when asked about it. As Fast Company points out, Apple isn‚Äôt the only company looking into how our mobile devices can be used to diagnose and monitor Parkinson‚Äôs, such as Samsung who has been working on their own research device.

Brendon Petersen You might be surprised that the phone that seems to beat them all isn‚Äôt even from a ‚Äòtraditional manufacturer‚Äô. The smartphone market is made up of two big players, Samsung and Apple. Recently, however, Google has joined the ranks. The smartphone market has largely been dominated by two big players, Samsung and Apple. This, in turn, has split users among two OS camps, namely iOS and Android. With Samsung having suffered a recent stumble and¬†Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7¬†less impressive than people were expecting, there was finally the possibility of a third name to step into the spotlight. Many people would‚Äôve expected that to be the world‚Äôs third-largest handset manufacturer, Huawei. But surprisingly, it‚Äôs turned out to be Google. The Google Pixel The search giant (which also happens to own the Android OS) has tried its hand at making hardware before. But it has never reached the same level of success as Apple or Samsung. Its previous range of Nexus devices were a partnership between Google and Android OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) intended to show off the full potential of the Android OS. That didn‚Äôt quite work out as expected. So Google finally took matters into its own hands and created¬†the new Pixel, which forms part of its ‚ÄúMade by Google‚Äù strategy. The phone itself was made by HTC, but Google controlled the entire design process. The result? A phone that international tech reviewers are hailing as the best phone ever made. That‚Äôs quite a lofty claim for a phone that¬†bears a striking resemblance to Apple‚Äôs iPhone and whose¬†main drawcard is its AI (named Google Assistant). Pixel vs Samsung vs Apple In a pure head-to-head specs comparison, here‚Äôs how the Google Pixel XL stacks up against the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the iPhone 7 Plus. .

The much-maligned Google Glass project was scrapped after becoming the subject of online mockery for its awkward product design and high price tag. According to Bloomberg, however, we may see Apple-branded smart glasses as part of Apple‚Äôs new wearables push, following on the success of the Apple Watch. It‚Äôs important to note that these are still rumors, but Apple may have already approached potential suppliers to acquire small quantities of near-eye displays for internal testing. Speaking with unidentified sources within Apple, Bloomberg claims that the contemplated Apple smart glasses would connect wirelessly to iPhones, and would display images and other information in the wearer‚Äôs field of view, and might even employ a version of augmented reality. The augmented reality angle lends a little more credence to these rumors than they might otherwise warrant. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been an outspoken proponent of AR in the past, mentioning on a conference call earlier this year that the company has invested a lot of time and money in AR and plans to continue to invest in the nascent technology. More: The next Apple Watch could have biometric¬†authentication and gesture controls If anyone could pull this off, it would be Apple. The firm has a long history of building on existing technology by simply improving on design, and in fact some of its greatest success stories have been innovative takes on existing ‚Äî and popular ‚Äî technologies.¬†The iPod, iPhone, and Apple Watch¬†all built on existing technology by seeking to improve the design and user experience. While the Apple Watch may still be in the early stages in terms of market acceptance, the iPod and iPhone have had an immense impact on their respective market spaces, transforming them entirely. So while it‚Äôs likely a long way off, and may never happen, Apple-branded smart glasses could be just the kick that augmented reality needs to get off the ground as a ubiquitous, everyday piece of technology.

The store would serve as a flagship location for Apple in Australia. The news comes from Australian publication The Age, which notes that Apple is in negotiations to demolish the building currently in Federation Square and replace it with a more classic-looking Apple structure with an all-glass facade. That could be somewhat controversial ‚Äî the building currently in place is somewhat of a landmark, and it architecturally matches the buildings around it. More:¬†Apple could be planning new wearables push, starting with smart glasses This won‚Äôt be the first controversy in Federation Square ‚Äî¬†when the current buildings were built following an international design competition, they were subject to a lot of scrutiny. Since then, however, the area has proven to be a popular place for locals to get together. For example, people often gather there to watch major events on a big screen. It‚Äôs important to note that the building changes won‚Äôt be for at least a few years. The current tenants include the Koorie Heritage Trust, which still has four to five years on its lease, and an Italian restaurant called Il Pom. The new store would be Apple‚Äôs fourth in Melbourne, but it would be its first stand-alone flagship store in the city. For the Melbourne-based, Apple‚Äôs other stores are found in the Chadstone Shopping Centre, as well as in Doncaster and Southland. In total, Apple has 22 retail store in Australia. Apple has been looking for a central location in Melbourne for¬†more than¬†a decade now,¬†but the¬†requirements are often so strict that it‚Äôs¬†been difficult¬†for the company to find a good match.

It simply means the company is filled with a lot of history, and it's now prepared to share some of that with the entire world, for a cost, of course. The company has designed a new hardbound book that is filled with 20 years of Apple's hardware design history. The book contains around 450 photos highlighting some of the most known devices from the early stages of design to the finished product. In Honor Of Steve Jobs The book is called "Designed by Apple in California," and from what we have come to understand, it's dedicated to the late Apple cofounder and CEO, Steve Jobs. The book will go on sale come Nov. 16 for $199 and $299, seeing as it comes in two sizes. The sizes are 10.20 inches x 12.75 inches for $199, and 13 inches x 16.25 inches for $299. Apple did not state if there will be a digital version of the books. Seeing as it's all about photos, we wouldn't rule this out in the coming months or years. "The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve's motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future," said Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer. "This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years." 8 Years In The Making Apple claims the book has been printed using specially milled, custom-dyed paper that also comes with silver edges. Furthermore, the book was designed over an eight-year period and is being published by Apple and not a third-party company. Now, the images inside the book were shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman, and the book itself is described as a photo archive. Interested folks will find images of products such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPod, Mac and more. Everything from 1998 to 2015, so there's a lot to see inside this beauty of a book. Outside of this new book, Apple is thinking about getting its hands in a new market, the smart glass market.

However, as it stands right now, the Touch Bar doesn‚Äôt work exactly how Apple envisions it, and some apps, especially first-party developed ones, don‚Äôt use the Bar in a way that will¬†work for all users. Glow bright Most onlookers will see Apple new MacBook Pros as the company‚Äôs way of competing with the likes of Microsoft and its Surface lineup, even if the company is doing so on its own terms. The Touch Bar does not turn Apple‚Äôs MacBook Pro line into a laptop-tablet hybrid like the Surface. Instead, it maintains the wall of separation between iOS and macOS that Apple says it will never tear down, even as it adds a new wrinkle to how macOS works. Sure, this feature has been attempted before by companies like Razer, which should come as a surprise to no one given Apple rarely comes up with completely original ideas. What the tech giant does do, however, is take concepts other companies have already attempted, and improves and builds upon them. In the case of the Touch Bar, this is exactly what Apple has done. The advantage Apple‚Äôs Touch Bar presents over past iterations of this idea is that it‚Äôs built into all of the company‚Äôs higher-end Pro offerings. More importantly, the software that powers the Touch Bar is baked directly into macOS. This gives developers a viable platform to build from, which means if the concept of a contextual, always-changing touchscreen is going to prove successful, just like it did when the iPhone revolutionized how we interact with our mobile devices, Apple‚Äôs new MacBook Pro line has the best shot at doing so. How it works While the Touch Bar features a 2170 x 60 OLED panel, it doesn‚Äôt look or feel like a traditional touch screen. My finger slides across its surface with ease, moving from left to right with a slight glide. In fact, the Touch Bar is so slick that it almost feels greasy, which I found off-putting at first, though after spending a few days with the 13-inch MacBook Pro equipped with the Touch bar, it grew on me. Depending on which app you‚Äôre using and what is going on within that app, different options display across the Touch Bar. As expected at launch, few third-party apps support the Bar, though this creates more problems than it probably should. In its standard configuration, the Touch Bar is mostly a blank canvas with the exception of shortcuts that provide control over the computer‚Äôs sound volume, brightness and quick access to Siri, all located on the far right side of the screen. I customized this feature to include the ability to snap a screenshot, shift screen brightness and alter sound¬†volume (not sure why you would add those when the options are already there?). Tapping an expand arrow on the left-hand side of the screen opens up the full set of standard Mac function keys many will find familiar, including one‚Äôs that control media playback backlit key brightness. The issue here stems from the fact that the additional step of pressing the arrow key is always required for the full function bar to show up, even when you‚Äôre using an app that doesn‚Äôt currently feature Bar functionality like Chrome or Spotify. Apple should have given users an option to always display the full Touch Bar, rather than this limited version. It‚Äôs possible to make the full Touch Bar the default, but doing so removes the ability for the screen to shift to contextual buttons when the user is in an app that supports the functionality, defeating the purpose of the Touch Bar altogether. When more developers begin supporting the Touch Bar, this problem will become less of an issue. Currently, however, the system feels convoluted. For example, if I‚Äôm listening to Spotify and don‚Äôt have the Touch Bar‚Äôs function keys expanded, I don‚Äôt have the ability to skip tracks or pause music directly at my fingertips. The level of customization present in the Touch Bar in its current iteration is impressive, allowing users to pin the functions they want in specific locations, especially when Finder is open. The ability to set the Bar for specific needs for every app, however, is necessary, especially in this interim period where few apps support the Touch Bar. Hopefully, this functionality is added in a subsequent macOS software update. Where it works Where the Touch Bar really comes alive is when you use it with one of Apple‚Äôs own apps. Currently, that list includes Mail, Notes, Photos, iMovie, Garage Band and Final Cut Pro X. This means that in order to take advantage of the Touch Bar right now you need to have bought into both Apple‚Äôs hardware ecosystem and¬†its software ecosystem. In my case, this creates issues. While I often find myself using an iPhone or Mac as my primary computing devices, I live in a Google services ecosystem. This means that, for example, Gmail and Keep are my preferred programs rather than Mail and Notes. This will likely change in the future once Google updates Chrome as well as its other apps to support the Touch Bar, but the current situation is less than ideal. In Mail, the Touch Bar offers users a number of options for common actions, most of which weren‚Äôt that hard to reach in the first place. Replying to emails and navigating by week or month can easily be performed with the Touch Bar, though these tasks can just as easily be accomplished with the keyboard. Where the Touch Bar makes more sense is when it comes to Final Cut Pro X, creating a natural more fluid scrubbing experience. Rather than scrolling with a mouse or trackpad, using the touch bar to slide left or right through a video‚Äôs timeline is intuitive and useful. The same can be said about the shortcuts present in Photos and Pixelmator which relate to cropping and altering colour hue. Again, however, most of my creative applications come from Adobe, which currently doesn‚Äôt support the Touch Bar ‚Äî the company has already stated it is¬†committed to supporting the Touch Bar. Touch ID finally hits the Mac Despite the fact that adding a fingerprint sensor is Apple playing catchup, I‚Äôve been thrilled with the addition of Touch ID in the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar I‚Äôve been testing for the last few days. Rather than having to enter my password each time I need to perform a system function or to even log into the Mac, all I need to do is tap my finger on the sensor that doubles as a power button. The process overall is incredibly fast and seamless and in the probably 50 times so far that I‚Äôve used the Touch ID sensor it hasn‚Äôt once been unable to detect my print. If you‚Äôre a Safari user, Touch ID can be used to purchase products via Apple Pay, removing the need to enter credit card details on supported websites. While I haven‚Äôt tried this feature, the general impression I‚Äôve gathered from other technology critics indicates that it works as advertised, though Apple Pay support doesn‚Äôt seem to be very widespread. Not ready for prime time While Apple‚Äôs Touch bar is far from the revolution the company has made it out to be, the concept of a constantly shifting, contextual screen on a traditional laptop is compelling. Unfortunately, as it stands right now, beyond Apple‚Äôs first-party offerings and a few standout third-party apps, there are few apps that take advantage of the Bar‚Äôs unique functionality. While that will likely change over the course of the next few weeks now that the Touch Bar‚Äôs development API is out in the wild, Apple has let consumers down in the past when it comes to devices with untapped potential, with the 4th Generation Apple TV and its ample gaming potential being the most prominent example. Will the Touch Bar become more than just a fascinating gimmick? Only time will tell. As it stands right now Apple‚Äôs print-sized contextual touchscreen is just a fascinating, expensive experiment. Do Do ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs MacBook Pro Touch Bar is fascinating experiment full of untapped potential‚Äù Or a gimmick! Reviewers are already saying it‚Äôs annoying to have to look down to have to use it while working and it‚Äôs not a matter of getting used to it, it‚Äôs a matter of it breaking the flow of how people work. Touch ID is smart however. I don‚Äôt get how it‚Äôs not on all computers. It seems to come and go with some companies but as far as I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs a no brainer, and you don‚Äôt need a touch bar to have touch ID or whatever you want to call it. Patrick O‚ÄôRourke I think that depends on what publications you read. There are plenty of technology critics that like the Touch Bar as it stands right now, even with its current limited app support. Mo Dabbas Can you turn the bar light off or turn it‚Äôs brightness down? For example if somebody wanna watch a movie in a dark room it would be distracting if the that led is on FTR_Part_deux It has potential for sure. Especially with app specific shortcuts. It might be a first iteration, but have you seen a Final Cut Pro keyboard? If you‚Äôre a beginner, it looks pretty daunting and you‚Äôll constantly be looking at the keyboard. I think Apple‚Äôs idea is to combine the two together, in steps of course. The Iceman Cometh This is a gimmick and has absolutely no utilitarian value at all today. Maybe that‚Äôll change as Patrick points out but its no guarantee and many people I know don‚Äôt even bother with Mac App Store applications that you need to be invested in to use this feature. Its most certainly not worth the extra $500 on top of the base price of the unit. Jason A neat idea sure but taking a step back its still an F bar, the emoji picture for example, most emojis can be entered with keyboard shortcuts which most people can probably do blind folded. Selecting a picture, whats wrong with looking at a much bigger (and higher res) monitor? cappein The touch bar is a gimmick and people will quickly look for the ways to disable it. Gewurttraminer You can‚Äôt really disable it because it includes the function keys people are used to on standard keyboards. The more likely outcome is people just not buying this model over the base unit. Patrick O‚ÄôRourke You can set it to always show function keys, which basically accomplishes the same thing as disabling it. FlamesFan89 The touch bar is the definition of a solution looking for a problem. Can‚Äôt Fix Stupid The USB-C only idea is a problem looking for a solution. fruvous Here‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt understand. If they design a laptop to operated by a keyboard and use that as an excuse for not giving it a touch screen, why do they bother making keyboard accessories for iOS devices if they‚Äôre designed to be touch-centric? HotelQuebec Silly gimmick no matter how you sugar coat it. Building it into the trackpad would‚Äôve been better but still not as good as a touchscreen. Smanny Personally I think Apple should have used a touch display. Or if they want something new and different. Then add a touch pad like the Lenovo yoga books. But take it one step further, and add a full display for the keyboard as well. I would love to see a notebook with two full touch screen displays. Now that would be awesome.

The report comes from Bloomberg, which stated that Apple is planning to cut down its revenue percentage from these video streaming apps as a way of improving its relationship with those who belong in the industry. According to the report, Apple is planning to cut its revenue from subscriptions from 30 percent to 15 percent on video streaming apps. Apart from these services, Apple is intent on cutting subscriptions to 15 percent; especially for users who have subscribed yearly. As for video apps, the discount can be observed from the start of the subscription. A number of video streaming apps let their users subscribe to their service through in-app options. But as the case in most of these, the charges may be more for iOS in-app subscriptions instead of subscribing online directly. The effort is to off-set Apple‚Äôs initiative of slashing off the 30 percent it collects. As of this writing, there‚Äôs no clear grasp of how these video streaming services will welcome Apple‚Äôs initiative. The company, however, hopes that apps that charge a higher subscription price for in-app purchases will decide to reduce the price so it could be close to the out-of-app subscriptions. The least they can do is to let users know that Apple is no longer charging as much. This move by Apple would hopefully appease the concerns some of subscription services have voiced out in the past. In particular, Spotify has been very vocal about its frustration with the policies implemented by the App Store. In particular, it was unhappy with the changes Apple made with its subscription policies earlier in the year. ¬†With this new announcement, Apple could be on to something positive.

Apple Will Put OLED Panels in Just One iPhone in 2017 Due to Supply Constraints GO Two other iPhones will come with LCD displays Nov 17, 2016 06:21 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Andrei Vlad ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† There's no doubt that 2017 will be an important year for Apple and its fans, as the Cupertino-based company is trying to completely overhaul its iPhone lineup. If we are to believe the latest rumors, Apple will launch three iPhone models next year, but they will be pretty much different technologically speaking. There's much talk regarding the addition of OLED panels into the next generation iPhone, but things aren't as simple as they might seem at first glance. Although Apple has four different display suppliers, they will not be able to meet the supply demand for OLED panels next year. Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display are working hard to invest in their OLED display lines, so that they can produce more beginning next year. Even though Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays in 2017, it will still not be enough ‚Äúdue to low yield rates,‚Äù as well as the increasing iPhone demand, Bloomberg reports. That's the main reason Apple has decided to use OLED displays in just one of its next year's iPhones. The adoption of OLED display will be pushed by one year, but Apple hopes that it will be at least able to provide consumers with one iPhone packed with such a panel starting 2017. According to a person familiar with Apple's plans, OLED iPhone will feature a completely new design that extends glass from the display to the phone's back and edges. The all-glass design will still feature a Home button, which will be implemented into the edge-to-edge screen, so it won't be an actual physical button that you can press. Samsung Display could be the sole OLED supplier in 2017 It's also worth noting that Samsung and Apple already have an agreement for the delivery of 100 million OLED panels in 2017, but that will probably barely be enough to fulfill the need for the holiday season sales. Since Apple shipped around 75 million iPhones during the holiday season back in 2015 and is expected to ship more than 90 million this year during the same period; in 2017 demand for the iPhone could be even higher. Even though Apple has its own strategy to partner with multiple suppliers for the same components, that might not work for OLED panels since Samsung is the only company that will be able to supply the Cupertino-based company enough displays next year. Only in 2018 supply of OLED panels for the iPhone might become trivial, as Sharp, LG Display and Japan Display will ramp up their productions. #iPhone 8#Apple iPhone#OLED panel#Samsung Display#Japan Display subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related ¬†¬∑¬† Hot right now ¬†¬∑¬† Latest news Apple to Launch 3 iPhone Models Next Year, One Getting OLED Display Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall iPhone 8 to Launch with Curved 5.0-Inch and 5.8-Inch Displays and No Bezels More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked Kapustkiy Breaks into Indian Regional Council Server, 17,000 Users Exposed Microsoft Launches Windows Defender Hub for Windows 10 Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked ¬†¬† iPhone 7 Plus new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Purposely Throttles Down Some iPhone 7 Data Speeds in the United States more on: Apple iPhone i softpedia¬Æ ¬† ¬†¬†Like 202K ¬†¬†¬†+1 56K ¬† ¬†¬†Follow 13K ¬© 2001-2016 Softpedia.

What would you expect to pay for a coffee-table book that chronicles 20 years of Apple design? Quite a bit if you go by the price tag selected by the tech giant. In what could be described as a self-indulgent act, Apple is selling a coffee-table book containing 450 photographs of past and current products for NZ$421.00. Admittedly, there is smaller version of the coffee table book for NZ$280, which some could argue is still a tad excessive. The hardbound book, Designed by Apple in California, showcases products from the company's 1998 iMac to the Apple Pencil released last year. In addition to the pictures of its products, the book has been dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. In addition to the pictures of its products, the book has been dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs and also details the techniques and materials used by Apple's design team. Apple's chief design officer Jony Ive said the book was designed to give a better insight into the company's innovation over two decades. "The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve's motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future," he said. "This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines." The foreword of Designed by Apple in California reiterates this message. Continued below.

It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are," it reads. "It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. "We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative." As mentioned earlier, the small 260x324mm coffee table book will cost NZ$280, while the larger 330x412mm copy will set you back NZ$421. This cost could be due to Apple printing the book on "specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight colour separations and low-ghost ink". Then again, the more cynical among us might think it's just be Apple trying to cash in from its loyal fanbase. Designed by Apple in California can be purchased on Apple's online store. - news.com.au By Matthew Dunn Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day‚Äôs news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

While the Apple Watch and the MacBook Pro‚Äôs Touch Bar use OLED technology, the iPhone has stuck with traditional LCD panels. A new report from Bloomberg, however, says that supply constraints may thwart Apple‚Äôs plan to switch to OLED panels next year‚Ä¶ According to the report, the four main suppliers for OLED displays won‚Äôt have enough production capacity to meet demand next year and further into 2018. This is primarily due to OLED screens being more difficult to produce than LCD panels. Right now, the four top suppliers for OLED panels are¬†Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp, and Japan Display. But at this point, Apple expects Samsung to be sole supplier in 2017. How does this effect Apple‚Äôs plans? Bloomberg notes that the supply constraints may mean that Apple uses OLED in just one variant of the iPhone 8. Apple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone‚Äôs debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. Furthermore, the OLED iPhone will feature an all-glass design with a virtual Home button embedded in an ‚Äúedge-to-edge‚Äù screen. We‚Äôve heard reports of these changes before, but today‚Äôs report adds more fuel to the fire. The dramatic revamp of the iPhone comes after Apple kept the design of the device largely the same with the iPhone 7, instead opting to focus on camera technology and color variants. Today‚Äôs report corroborates a note from KGI earlier this week, noting that the 2017 iPhone lineup will look like what‚Äôs seen below, with the dual camera set up staying exclusive to the 5.5-inch iPhone models. 4.7-inch iPhone with LCD display and single camera 5.5-inch iPhone model with LCD display and dual camera 5.5-inch iPhone model with OLED display and dual camera The 2017 iPhone is expected to be introduced sometime in September, as is usually the case with new iPhone models. If the OLED iPhone comes in at a higher price point, would you shell out the cash for it?

Review: Apple's Touch Bar a slippery time-saver by Mike Yawney Posted Nov 17, 2016 2:00 am EST Last Updated Nov 17, 2016 at 7:04 am EST Business Tech Laptops have undergone many changes over the years. They have become lighter, thinner, more powerful than we ever could have imagined when they were first introduced more than 30 years ago. Over the course of time, mice have been replaced with pointing sticks, and eventually trackpads. Even keyboards have been modified to become more shallow as laptops continue to grow thinner. Yet Apple seems convinced there is still room for improvement. Enter the Touch Bar. Apple considers the Touch Bar on its latest MacBook Pro to be an extension of the traditional keyboard. It replaces the row of function keys (F1 ‚Äì F12), along the top of the keyboard with a customizable touch OLED strip. It‚Äôs easily the standout feature on the mid to high-end MacBook Pros, which is why this review will be focusing on Touch Bar, rather than performance changes over the entry model MacBook Pro which I reviewed a couple of weeks ago. I first have to talk about the design of Touch Bar. Although it‚Äôs made from glass It doesn‚Äôt have a shiny finish. It‚Äôs matte black just like the rest of the MacBook keys. It almost looks like an extra long space bar situated at the top of the keyboard. However that changes when you turn it on. Touch Bar can display millions of colours. Just how will look for you will depend on what application you‚Äôre using. It changes based on what program is open on your MacBook Pro. It‚Äôs also somewhat customizable, so you can change the icons you want to appear in that space. When you first run your finger along Touch Bar you‚Äôll be surprised as just how slippery it is. It doesn‚Äôt have the feel of regular glass. There is no friction whatsoever. Your finger glides effortlessly across the bar. By default Touch Bar displays some of the basic tools and options. There‚Äôs display brightness, volume control, shortcuts to Launchpad, as well as a fast forward, rewind and play/pause button for music in iTunes. There‚Äôs even a shortcut to Siri, which is baked right into MacOS Sierra. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs the beauty of Touch Bar ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs customizable. By opening up the Finder you can change the icons you see. A new window pops up letting you drag icons from the main screen onto the secondary Touch Bar. You can add Mission Control, Sleep, Mute or show desktop to name just a few. Or if you prefer, you can put sliders on the Touch Bar to control screen brightness or volume instead of the increase/decrease buttons. An icon I added right away was screen capture shortcut. Instead of holding down Command + Shift + 3, I was able to save snapshots of my desktop with a simple tap of the Touch Bar. It won‚Äôt take long to figure out what shortcuts work best for you. The true potential of Touch Bar doesn‚Äôt really shine until you begin to open up and use different apps. Remember, Touch Bar changes depending on the program you have open. Let‚Äôs take a look at how Touch Bar changes depending on what apps you are using. When you are in Mail, Touch Bar will display options such as reply, flag, delete, and move to. When you‚Äôre composing an email it will suggest address to send your email to (the email addresses actually appear in the Touch Bar) plus it will display predictive text as you type the same way it shows up while typing on your iPhone. Touch Bar becomes extremely useful in Safari. Not only could you open up new tabs with a single tap, you can actually see thumbnails of each tab you have opened up right on the OLED strip. Tapping on each thumbnail brings that Tab into view on your screen. Thumbnails also play a key role in Photos. Each of your pictures appear as thumbnails in the Touch Bar, similar to how they appear on your iPhone. You can drag your finger across the strip to browse through your pictures. Once a pic is selected you can crop, fix red-eye or apply filters with a simple tap. The neat thing to point out here is Touch Bar not only lets you choose a filter, but it adds a compare button so you can see the before and after with a simple tap. It‚Äôs one thing to read about how Touch Bar works but its another to actually see it in action. I have put together a video showing off how you can Use Touch Bar which can be viewed here. It‚Äôs important to point out Touch Bar can‚Äôt be customized within all programs or apps. Each program has a built-in set of buttons which automatically appear on the Touch Bar with only a handful which are customizable at this point. After playing around with Touch Bar over the course of five days, a couple of things became apparent. It‚Äôs very responsive. I was expecting a tiny delay after hearing it actually runs on a separate operating system, WatchOS, but the experience is seamless. I also found Touch Bar saves time ‚Ä¶ when you remember to use it. Since Touch Bar is a new concept I had to make a conscious effort to use it. Once I did it became like muscle memory, and I instinctively started using the built-in shortcuts. Of course this took two or three days. This however led to another issue. I became so used to Touch Bar I found it difficult to go to my older MacBooks. My fingers instinctively went for the Touch Bar which simply wasn‚Äôt there. Just how efficient Touch Bar is depends on the program you are using. Touch Bar becomes more complicated and a bit more intimidating using some of Apple‚Äôs professional programs like Final Cut Pro. It‚Äôs just a matter of taking time to play with it to learn the new shortcuts. Another interesting feature which can‚Äôt be overlooked on the MacBook Pro is the inclusion of Touch ID. To the right of Touch Bar is a small fingerprint sensor which I have grown to love. When you first setup your MacBook Pro, you will be asked to enrol your fingerprint. The procedure is ver similar to how it works on your iPhone. It only takes a minute. Touch ID has a number of uses on your MacBook Pro. First it makes unlocking your laptop a breeze. Once you open it up, it will ask you to place your fingerprint on the sensor. Voila! It‚Äôs unlocked. This feature has been available on numerous Windows laptops for a few years now but its nice to finally see it on a MacBook! Another added benefit is for administration rights. Typically making system preference changes requires your fingerprint now replaces your a password. Simple I know, but such a convenience! Those who enjoy shopping online will also be able to make use of Touch ID. Websites in Safari which accept Apple Pay will prompt for your fingerprint. I personally don‚Äôt use Apple Pay for online payments but I can see if you do how this could be handy. The final use for Touch ID is for those who share a computer. Touch ID now lets individuals sign into their own accounts on the same computer. I can see this being beneficial in an office setting. I share a MacBook Pro with my cameraman while traveling. I use it to write stories and he uses it to edit videos. Now when he takes the MacBook Pro from me he can load all of his settings and programs with a tap of his finger. I found Touch ID to work flawlessly. So far I have never had to place my finger on the sensor twice. It always worked the first time. We‚Äôll see if that continues. Although this review focuses primarily on Touch Bar and Touch ID, there were a few other things I noticed on the MacBook Pro worth mentioning. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar tends to get warm. I found while having multiple programs open the body of the MacBook tended to heat up within a sort amount of time. It never got hot, but its noticeable on your wrists as they rest on the computer‚Äôs frame. Battery life also didn‚Äôt last quite as long as I expected. While the Apple states you should be getting around 10 hours of use from a single charge, I found six to seven hours to be more accurate. Of course the more graphically intense the programs are, the faster the battery drains, but even extensive typing and browsing took a toll and I was looking for a plug-in by mid-afternoon. It‚Äôs hard to say if Touch Bar plays a role in this. Regardless if you purchase the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar or the entry model, there is one thing you won‚Äôt be able to avoid ‚Ä¶ and that is the need for dongles. Although the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has 4 USB C ports (two more than the entry MacBook Pro) with so many legacy devices out there you will no doubt need adapters in order to connect your devices. That‚Äôs simply the new reality. Apple‚Äôs new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar may not be the touch screen model many had been hoping for, but it‚Äôs an interesting alternative with a lot of potential. The shortcuts and convenience it provides makes you feel like a power user, with next to no effort. It works well but the full potential has yet to be unlocked. Right nowTouch Bar works mostly with Apple‚Äôs built-in suite of apps such as Mail, Safari, Keynote, and Pages. If you use Chrome, Firefox, or web-based you won‚Äôt be able to make use of Touch Bar‚Äôs features. However that is expected to change. More and more developers are tailoring programs to make use of Touch Bar, it will just take time. Microsoft has already announced its new Office Suite will make use of the touch strip, as will Adobe Photoshop. It‚Äôs a waiting game to see who will come on board. If developers don‚Äôt support it, Apple‚Äôs vision of convenience may be short-lived. As it stands right now, Touch Bar is more of a convenience than a necessity. If you simply want a MacBook Pro for work, you‚Äôll get along fine without it. You may want to go with an entry model. But if you want added horsepower under the hood, along with streamlined productivity, then the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the way to go. Just know one thing ‚Äî once you use Touch Bar ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to go back. Join the conversation Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as . Edit Profile | Logout. Loading profile...

Soghoian revealed the news at the MacTech Conference in Los Angeles, according to Mac Observer. He also posted about the news on his website, which is dedicated to the user automation community. Q. I hear you no longer work for Apple; is that true? A. Correct. I joined Apple in January of 1997, almost twenty years ago, because of my profound belief that ‚Äúthe power of the computer should reside in the hands of the one using it.‚Äù That credo remains my truth to this day. Recently, I was informed that my position as Product Manager of Automation Technologies was eliminated for business reasons. Consequently, I am no longer employed by Apple Inc. But, I still believe my credo to be as true today as ever.Soghoian was responsible for advancing a number of automation technologies for Apple, including UNIX CLI, Apple Events, JavaScript, AppleScript, Automator, Apple Configurator, scripting support for Photos, iWork, Finder, Mail and other Apple programs as well as Master for iTunes tools and Dictation Commands. Since Apple eliminated the position, it's unclear what the move means for the future of automation technologies in macOS. Soghoian says¬†the best thing to do for those concerned is to direct any questions or concerns to Apple. If user automation technologies are important to you, then now is the time for all good men and women to reach out, speak up and ask questions. The macOS user automation technologies include: UNIX CLI (shell, python, ruby, perl), System Services, Apple Events (JavaScript, AppleScript, AppleScriptObj-C, Scripting Bridge), Automator, Apple Configurator (AppleScript, Automator), and Application scripting support in Photos, iWork, Finder, Mail, and other Apple applications.Starting on December 1, Soghoian says he will begin considering opportunities and is available for consulting for user automation services. He also says he's optimistic about the future of user automation. "I've seen the benefits and power of individuals being able to automate critical and repetitive tasks," he wrote on his website. "Solution apps are great, emojis are fun, but there's nothing like really great automation tools."

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear View All Editorials ‚Üí Apple‚Äôs Tradition of Always Building the Best Doesn‚Äôt Fit with Current Apple TV John Martellaro @jmartellaro Nov 16th, 2016 7:01 PM EST | Editorial Apple was, it seemed, somewhat late with the 4th generation 1080p Apple TV that shipped in October of 2015. Not delivering at 4K device at that time could be forgiven because High Dynamic Range (HDR) specs hadn‚Äôt been formalized during its development. But for the holidays of 2016, most all the 4K/UHD TVs have HDR. The new Roku Ultra has HDR. So what is Apple thinking? _________________________ Apple, according to CEO Tim Cook,¬†has an intense interest in TV. To quote Mr. Cook: ‚ÄúI would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. Apple, by the way, always builds the best product it can. So when I think about Apple having an intense interest in something, I tend to think about both accomplishment and joyful products that amaze and delight. An often frustrating Siri and remote are Apple‚Äôs plan for the ‚Äúbest‚Äù Apple TV Hurdles What I keep coming back to is that Apple has involved itself in what I would call Imperial Entanglements. By that I mean that the TV industry is complex. There are many players who all protect their IP and have strong agendas. And so, when Apple plays in in this arena, it‚Äôs pitting itself against the vested interests of many entities, all with seasoned executives who know how to maximize revenues and look out for themselves. Is that a place where Apple can flourish? Remember when Apple tried to develop a subscription service? It would have undercut the interests of networks, but Apple felt that its impressive stature would convince others to go along with them. Apple TV would be the wave of the future. Except it hasn‚Äôt been. The result has been a new TV app that doesn‚Äôt support Netflix. Plus, we have an Apple TV that doesn‚Äôt have the Amazon Prime movie app, presumably because Amazon and Apple aren‚Äôt getting along well enough to strike a beneficial deal for both parties. Amidst all that, Apple isn‚Äôt exactly threatening to put Roku out of business with a world-class set-top-box with 4K/UHD, HDR10, perhaps Dolby Vision, optical audio and a stunning industrial design. Roku is the market share leader amongst these devices, and by necessity, always has the best and latest in technology. They have to. Roku acts like a company that‚Äôs hungry and works hard to maintain its position. Its customers a loyal and love them for that. As Lily Tomlin once said, Apple is the phone company. It doesn‚Äôt have to care. In TV, the Best is¬†Advanced, Flexible, Expandable, Competitive In fact, Apple seems totally disinterested in building fabulous hardware that fits in with lots of different kinds of home systems and has the capacity to get us excited. Apparently, another year will pass as millions of customers upgrade to 4K/UHD, and one of the first accessories they‚Äôll buy is a 4K/UHD/HDR Roku player. Meanwhile, Apple always seems to be struggling to get its act together on the app side and has to settle for incomplete, less than thrilling content deals and technical arrangements. A healthy part of me wishes Apple would just build the coolest, best TV hardware on the planet‚Äîan impressive and attractive platform on which other content providers want to play. Right now, I don‚Äôt see how Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúintense interest in TV‚Äù and its legacy of always building the best is being achieved. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple TV 8 Comments Add a comment pjs_boston November 16, 2016 There is only a vanishingly small amount of 4K content available on streaming services, even less HDR 4K content. In addition, there is no dominant standard for HDR content. Only videophiles and √ºber-geeks are currently able to wade through the confusion and can actually find the correct content for their equipment. Apple is not late to the party. The party hasn‚Äôt started yet‚Ä¶. November 16, 2016 at 10:13 EST PM MarcusNewton November 16, 2016 I totally agree with everything in the article. It is painful to watch this opportunity pass by Apple. Did the car project zap that much out of Apple that all the other projects fell by the wayside and are now in disarray? The 4K Roku seems really nice. Another thing I will point out is that the TV manufactures themselves are building up an immunity to external smart TV devices. For example, my Samsung 4K HDR TV has apps built right into it; along with wifi ac and ethernet. (My router and TV are in the same spot, so I connected the TV over ethernet, which has turned out great for streaming 4K content.) I can use Netflix (in 4K), Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and HBO Now without ever leaving the Samsung TV. Even though I do have an Apple TV 4 attached to the Samsung TV, it now remains off most of the time. Not only does Apple need to put 4K into the Apple TV, but the bar has been raised to the point where Apple TV has to offer enough that it is worth even turning it on versus using what is built right into a person‚Äôs TV. There is no difference in Netflix on Apple TV and Netflix on the Samsung TV, except I can stream 4K content directly with the Samsung TV. For Apple to say that the future of TV is apps, they better be some pretty outstanding apps that significantly offer something different other then just another version of the same app on another platform. On another note, I complained a few days ago about trying to type in a strong password like ‚Äúcx7RTZKJnEfMJ_fM?3\‚Äù into an Apple TV because of the silly on-screen keyboard. I tried out using Siri to speak the strong password in and the results were not too bad. I had to speak slowly and say things like ‚Äúcapital R, capital T‚Äù, but it mostly worked. It took about the same amount of time to slowly speak the password as it does to type it in, so I am not sure if it is worth it in the end. Also, when speaking in the password it remains in complete clear-text until a person is finished and releases the button on the remote, and then it applies the password masking. I also wanted to say thank you John for keeping us informed about 4K TV and HDR. I had no idea the TV industry had gotten so confusing, and continues to get even more confusing ( ‚Ä¶ cough, cough, dolby vision). I would not have been able to get the 4K HDR TV that I did if it was not for your excellent and informative articles. Thank you for sorting through all of this for us. November 16, 2016 at 10:38 EST PM MarcusNewton November 16, 2016 @pjs_boston: I don‚Äôt think that is true. I have a 4K HDR TV, and I do not consider myself a videophile. I have had no problems finding 4K content for anything released this year. For example, Netflix does not show the 4K content option unless a person is on the $11.99 streaming plan, and have a 4K TV. When I am on Netflix on my regular Sony HD TV there is no 4K content listed, only regular HD. But when I am on my Samsung 4K HDR TV, the Netflix app has an entire row labeled ‚Äú4K‚Äù to let people know which shows and movies are available in 4K as well. Pretty much anything Netflix released this year is available in 4K. For example, their new TV show ‚ÄúThe Crown‚Äù is in 4K with HDR and it is stunning how rich the colors are and the level of detail is; even in the smallest thing. Even if something is only available in regular HD, the TVs have built in graphics cards that upscales the picture to near 4K. The upscaling is actually really good, it is nothing like when DVDs tried to upscale analog videos and there where all kinds of weird artifacts. The near 4K upscaling makes any digital content look really good. November 16, 2016 at 10:53 EST PM John Martellaro November 16, 2016 MarcusNewton: I also wanted to say thank you John for keeping us informed about 4K TV and HDR. I had no idea the TV industry had gotten so confusing ::blush:: I‚Äôm trying! Thanks. The problem with smart TV‚Äôs is that some contain dubious OSs. Sony, for example, uses Android. There‚Äôs just too much temptation to pry into your affairs, and that Ethernet or Wi-Fi link is the gateway. It‚Äôs also a possible entry point into your home network. My plan is to connect the Apple TV and Roku Ultra into the A/V receiver (HDMI), pass along the selected video to the 4KTV, and never have the TV on the Internet. That‚Äôs sometimes hard to do because of how some remotes work or constant software updates. For example, http://betanews.com/2016/01/20/smart-tvs-pose-huge-security-risks/ So, another complexity to deal with is engineering a fairly secure system! November 16, 2016 at 11:34 EST PM MarcusNewton November 17, 2016 Your welcome John. I agree about the OSs. I think my Samsung is using Android as well, so that is something to keep an eye on. Also, Samsung wants people to have Samsung accounts and remain logged-in while using the TV. They even want people to enter their zip-code for the alleged purpose of getting extra information about local TV. It is all very suspicious. So it is both privacy scary and bot-net scary. My 2-year-old Yamaha audio receiver has two 4K pass-throughs, and before I bought the 4K TV, I ran my Apple TV and everything else through the audio receiver to my older Sony regular HD TV, for the same security reasons you mentioned. I don‚Äôt think my audio receiver has ARC or HDR, so I may have to look into whether that will affect the 4K TV. I would like to eventually get back to running everything into the audio receiver and be assured that the TV is not at risk because it is not even connected. The Netflix app seems to know that the Apple TV cannot display 4K content, so it doesn‚Äôt even give it the option of forwarding the signal on to a 4K TV. The only way for me to stream 4K at the moment is to directly connect the TV through wifi or ethernet and risk my TV joining a bot-net chain-gang. I think Apple is seriously underestimating how many people will choose convenience over security when it comes to TV. After someone buys a new 4K TV with wifi and all their desired apps already in it, how likely are they also going to spend an additional $149 on an Apple TV to get the perceived same apps? In my opinion I don‚Äôt think it is likely, so this is why I keep saying Apple needs to have a very competitive Apple TV to convince people to flat out skip over whatever comes with their smart TV and use only Apple TV. Otherwise the TV manufacturers are going to blow past Apple TV and make it look like a toy. Experience wise there is no difference between my Samsung (Android) TV apps and Apple TV apps of the same thing (except the 4K aspect). It is actually a better experience sticking with just the TV because my Samsung remote controls everything: cable-box, all the stream apps, and the audio receiver; along with easily switching between apps and cable-box. With the Apple TV connected directly to the Samsung TV, the Samsung remote can control the Apple TV too. The remote is not big either, I think it has a total of just 6 buttons. The TV manufacturers are working extra hard to convince potential buyers that everything they need is in the box with the smart TV. I bought my TV from Costco, and every TV box is plastered with big stickers on what apps are included with each TV, so people are being directed away from extras like Apple TV, Fire TV, and Roku. The TV manufacturers have a great marketing message: ‚Äúget this smart TV and matching sound-bar, and that is everything a person needs to watch or stream the latest content‚Äù. It is a simple message that is easy to understand, and it basically comes all in one package. Streaming quality content use to mean an Apple TV was required. Now, Apple TV is an optional extra, and that is not a good spot for it to be in. November 17, 2016 at 1:08 EST AM pjs_boston November 17, 2016 @MarcusNewton, here are a few points to consider: 1) While Netflix and others have some 4K content, the bulk of available programming is still HD and none of the streaming services offer HDR content. For that, you need a BluRay player and a BluRay disc which both support the specific HDR format of your TV. It‚Äôs like HD-DVD versus BluRay all over again. HDR is still a Wild West. 2) 4K TV‚Äôs upscale all HD content to pseudo-4K. This includes output from from the Apple TV. As a result, content from the Apple TV looks just as good as HD content from any other source. When the HDR 4K standards are worked out and the content is there, Apple will be ready with a new Apple TV. 3) I do agree that by building in support for NetFlix, HULU, etc. into their TV‚Äôs, Samsung and others are trying to stem the tide of streaming boxes. However, this most hurts brands like Roku which don‚Äôt offer exclusive content such as iTunes or Amazon Prime. Apple‚Äôs success in set-top boxes and streaming is far from assured, but I don‚Äôt think the lack of a 4K Apple TV is a problem ‚Äì yet. November 17, 2016 at 5:29 EST AM paikinho November 17, 2016 I have been waiting for the 5 generation Apple TV with 4K HDR. I won‚Äôt buy until I get that. I was hoping that it would be available for this holiday, but will have to wait. Why would I want it now? There is 4k content available even though it isn‚Äôt the bulk, that will quickly change. Future proofing. ‚Ä¶.I want to have the system that supports what the future standard will be over the next few years. Until then, I am sticking with my 3rd generation. Perhaps Apple knows this and is working hard to make the 5th gen really really nice. I hope so. Also I could use the 2nd generation Large iPad Pro. Kids were wanting one for this holiday for their artwork, but I won‚Äôt buy the current generation version. So for a while I will be hunkered down waiting it seems. November 17, 2016 at 9:53 EST AM John Martellaro November 17, 2016 MarcusNewton: Things may have changed since I checked, but I believe Samsung TVs use the Tizen OS. From my records: LG ‚Äî webOS Panasonic ‚Äì Firefox OS Samsung ‚Äì Tizen Sharp Android Sony ‚Äì Android Vizio ‚Äì Vizio uses a custom made OS by them.

The outlet says the move is part of an¬†effort to appease content partners, whose TV shows and movies are vital to the company‚Äôs larger video strategy. Previously, the iPhone maker took¬†a 30% cut of revenue from app and in-app purchases. Then in June it announced it would slice that in half after the first year¬†Now it sounds like Apple is going to make that an upfront price for participating video apps. Apple‚Äôs hefty cut of sales made via its App Store has long angered partners, some of whom have accused the technology giant of anti-competitive behavior. The concessions speak to the growing importance of video to Apple, which next month will introduce a new app devoted to TV shows and movies. Apple‚Äôs¬†new TV app¬†is part of the company‚Äôs effort to make its devices the hub for watching video by pooling television shows and movies from multiple apps in one place. Apple has explored creating its own live TV service, but delayed those plans after difficulty getting rights from programmers and broadcast networks, who have observed with caution how Apple has assumed a dominant role in the music industry. Instead, Apple has crafted an app that relies on programming from services like Hulu, Showtime and HBO. Slowing iPhone sales have prompted Apple to focus on other areas for growth, such as services, which is expected to be the size of a Fortune 100 company by 2017. It seems pushing subscription sales, even at just 15%, is a smart move with little overhead.

He says the move is the result of the company eliminating his position as Product Manager of Automation Technologies for ‚Äúbusiness reasons.‚Äù Soghoian is a software developer that has been at Apple since 1997. During his tenure, he advanced a wide range of user automation technologies including UNIX CLI, JavaScript, AppleScript, Automator, and scripting support for several stock apps. Q. I hear you no longer work for Apple; is that true? A. Correct. I joined Apple in January of 1997, almost twenty years ago, because of my profound belief that ‚Äúthe power of the computer should reside in the hands of the one using it.‚Äù That credo remains my truth to this day. Recently, I was informed that my position as Product Manager of Automation Technologies was eliminated for business reasons. Consequently, I am no longer employed by Apple Inc. But, I still believe my credo to be as true today as ever. Q. What does the termination of the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies mean for the future of user automation in macOS? A. Ask Apple. Seriously, if you have any questions or concerns about the future of user automation, ask Apple. If user automation technologies are important to you, then now is the time for all good men and women to reach out, speak up and ask questions. The macOS user automation technologies include: UNIX CLI (shell, python, ruby, perl), System Services, Apple Events (JavaScript, AppleScript, AppleScriptObj-C, Scripting Bridge), Automator, Apple Configurator (AppleScript, Automator), and Application scripting support in Photos, iWork, Finder, Mail, and other Apple applications.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 16, 2016 at 10:12PM Many income investors flock to the stocks with the highest yields. But in doing so, they often neglect stocks with average yields supported by low payout ratios and strong cash flows. These stocks can become good dividend growth plays over time, as management returns more of their robust cash flows to patient shareholders. Image source: Getty Images. Therefore, let's examine three stocks which have seemingly lower yields, but could easily double their dividends in the near future -- Disney (NYSE:DIS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Disney Shares of Disney have fallen 7% this year due to concerns about cord cutters gutting its cable business. Its loss of ESPN subscribers indicated that not even live sports -- once considered immune from streaming competition -- could withstand the paradigm shift. However, Disney is evolving its cable business with new streaming apps and a stand-alone streaming service for ESPN, and its theme park and movie businesses remain strong. The House of Mouse has raised its dividend annually for the past six years. It also switched from an annual dividend to a semi-annual one last year. It currently pays a forward yield of 1.5%, which is easily supported by its payout ratio of 25%. Disney spent just 27% of its free cash flow on dividends -- indicating that it could easily double its dividend to become a more attractive income stock. Apple Apple stock has risen just 2% this year, due to concerns about peaking iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales and its lack of new blockbuster products. Sales of all three iDevices fell¬†year-over-year last quarter, resulting in Apple's first annual revenue decline since 2001. However, Apple's Services (iTunes, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Care, licensing, and other services) revenue rose 24% annually and accounted for 13% of its top line -- indicating that software growth could help offset its hardware weakness over the next few quarters. Image source: Apple. Apple brought back its quarterly dividend in 2012 and raised it every subsequent year. It currently pays a forward yield of 2.1%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 26%. It spent 23% of its trailing 12-month FCF on dividends, which indicates that it could also double its dividend to reward patient investors. Oracle Shares of Oracle rose 7% this year, roughly matching the S&P 500's gain. Like many other aging tech companies, Oracle is pivoting its core IT hardware, database, and software business toward higher-growth cloud-based services. Its total cloud revenues surged 59% to $969 million, but that only accounted for 11% of its top line. Slower growth at¬†its older on-premise businesses caused its revenue to grow just 2% annually for the quarter. Oracle started paying a dividend in 2009, but only raised its dividend annually for the past four years. It currently pays a forward yield of 1.5%, which is supported by its payout ratio of 29%. The company spent just 20% of its FCF on dividends over the past 12 months. Doubling its dividend could make Oracle an attractive income investment like its rival IBM, which pays a forward yield of 3.5%. Watch the free cash flow growth The more free cash flow a company generates, the more likely it is to raise its dividend. By that measure, Disney and Apple seem more likely to hike their dividends than Oracle, which has struggled in that department over the past five years. Source:¬†YCharts However, Disney and Apple may also prefer to retain that cash for investments or acquisitions to diversify their businesses away from ESPN and the iPhone, respectively. Both companies were previously mentioned as potential suitors for Twitter, which has an enterprise value of $12 billion. Apple also expressed interest in buying Time Warner, which has an enterprise value of $89 billion, before AT&T¬†agreed to buy it. Meanwhile, Oracle likely prefers using that cash to continue making big acquisitions, like its upcoming $9.3 billion takeover of¬†NetSuite. The key takeaway Disney, Apple, and Oracle could all easily double their dividends, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they'll do so anytime soon. Nonetheless, investors looking for stable income plays with room for dividend growth should keep a close eye on these stocks. Leo Sun owns shares of AT and T and Walt Disney.

New figures released show that foot traffic to branches is also down, with "branch banker interactions" down 22 percent from 2015. The figures come in the wake of a sales practice scandal that triggered multiple lawsuits, an enormous $185 million fine and the resignation of the company's longtime CEO John Stumpf.

Major hacks seem ever more frequent. Investigators believe that a set of top-secret National Security Agency hacking tools were offered to online bidders this summer.

Inc YHOO ‚ñº 41.19 -0.26 -0.63% And many of those worried about expanded government surveillance by the N.S.A. and other agencies have taken steps to secure their communications. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter In a recent Medium post, Quincy Larson, the founder of Free Code Camp, an open-source community for learning to code, detailed the reasons it might be useful for people to make their personal data more difficult for attackers to access. ‚ÄúWhen I use the term ‚Äòattacker‚Äô I mean anyone trying to access your data whom you haven‚Äôt given express permission to,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs a hacker, a corporation, or even a government.‚Äù In an interview, Mr. Larson walked us through some of the basic steps he recommended. We added a few of our own, based on additional interviews. We encourage you to write back with feedback on this article. If the instructions are too vague, the apps aren‚Äôt working for you or you have additional questions, we want to hear about it. Send an email to smarterliving@nytimes.com. Now, let‚Äôs encrypt. 1. Download Signal, or Start Using WhatsApp to send text messages. Encryption is a fancy computer-person word for scrambling your data until no one can understand what it says without a key. But encrypting is more complex than just switching a couple of letters around. Mr. Larson said that by some estimates, with the default encryption scheme that Apple uses, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd have to have a supercomputer crunching day and night for years to be able to unlock a single computer.‚Äù ¬© Ritchie B. Tongo/European Pressphoto Agency He said that the best way to destroy data was not to delete it, because it could potentially be resurrected from a hard drive, but to encode it in ‚Äúa secure form of cryptography.‚Äù Signal is one of the most popular apps for those who want to protect their text messaging. It is free and extremely easy to use. And unlike Apple‚Äôs iMessage, which is also encrypted, the code it uses to operate is open-source. ‚ÄúYou can be sure by looking at the code that they‚Äôre not doing anything weird with your data,‚Äù Mr. Larson said. ‚ÄúIn general, the idea behind the app is to make privacy and communication as simple as possible,‚Äù said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems, the organization that developed Signal. That means that the app allows you to use emojis, send pictures and enter group texts. One bit of friction: You do have to persuade your friends to join the service too, if you want to text them. The app makes that easy to do. WhatsApp, the popular chat tool, uses Signal‚Äôs software to encrypt its messaging. And in Facebook Messenger and Google‚Äôs texting app Allo, you can turn on an option that encrypts your messages. Here‚Äôs how to do that on Facebook. Here‚Äôs how to do it on Allo. Mr. Marlinspike said that the presidential election had sparked a lot of interested in Signal, leading to a ‚Äúsubstantial increase in users.‚Äù When asked to speculate why that was, Mr. Marlinspike simply said, ‚ÄúDonald Trump is about to be in control of the most powerful, invasive and least accountable surveillance apparatus in the world.‚Äù To download Signal, click here for iOS, or here for Android. 2. Protect your computer‚Äôs hard drive with FileVault or BitLocker. Your phone may be the device that lives in your pocket, but Mr. Larson described the computer as the real gold mine for personal information. Even if your data were password protected, someone who gained access to your computer ‚Äúwould have access to all your files if they were unencrypted.‚Äù Luckily, both Apple and Windows offer means of automatic encryption that simply need to be turned on. Here‚Äôs the link to do that for Apple computers. Here‚Äôs the one for Windows computers. 3. The way you handle your passwords is probably wrong and bad. You know this by now. Changing your passwords frequently is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion. But making up new combinations all the time is a hassle. ¬© Pawel Kopczynski/Reuters Mr. Larson recommends password managers, which help store many passwords, with one master password. He said that he uses LastPass, but knows plenty of people who use 1Password and KeePass, and that he doesn‚Äôt have a strong reason to recommend one over another. Not every security expert trusts password managers. Some noted that LastPass itself got hacked last year. So that means you may want to write them down in one secure location, perhaps a Post-it note at home. It seems more far-fetched that a hacker would bother to break into your home for a Post-it note than find a way into your computer. If you take that route, we suggest setting a weekly or biweekly calendar reminder to change your passwords. As far as making passwords up goes: Don‚Äôt be precious about it. Use a random word (an object near you while you‚Äôre hunched over your Post-it) and a combination of numbers. If you‚Äôre writing passwords down, you don‚Äôt have to worry about making them memorable. 4. Protect your email and other accounts with two-factor authentication. When you turn this step on, anyone trying to sign in to your email from new devices will have to go through a secondary layer of security: a code to access the inbox that is sent to your phone via text message. (Though sadly, not through Signal.) Here‚Äôs the link for turning on two-factor authentication for Gmail accounts. Here‚Äôs the one for Yahoo accounts, and here‚Äôs one you can use for Outlook accounts. You can also set two-factor authentication for social media accounts and other sites. But email is the most important account, since many sites use email for password recovery, a fact that has been exploited by hackers. Once they have access to your email, they can get access to banking, social media, data backups and work accounts. 5. Use a browser plug-in called HTTPS Everywhere. Mr. Marlinspike recommended this plug-in, developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital security organization. It ensures that you are accessing the secure form of websites, meaning that your connection to the site will be encrypted, and that you will be protected from various forms of surveillance and hacking. Download HTTPS Everywhere for Chrome here. For Firefox here. Here‚Äôs a list of FAQ‚Äôs about the plug-in, including whether it is available for other browsers. And this is a good time to note that you should always be aware whether the Wi-Fi network you‚Äôre using is secure. Public networks ‚Äî and even private networks without security keys ‚Äî often are not. 6. Remember that incognito mode isn‚Äôt always private. You may be in such a hurry to use this feature, available on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, among other browsers, that you do not heed its clear warning. On Chrome, the second paragraph of the ‚Äúincognito‚Äù home screen is clear. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt invisible,‚Äù it says. ‚ÄúGoing incognito doesn‚Äôt hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the websites you visit.‚Äù Mr. Larson recommended Tor in his article, a browser that allows for private web activity. But we‚Äôre not going to recommend that here, mostly because Tor is relatively slow and clunky at the moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt use it very often,‚Äù Mr. Larson said. He said that he suspected other browsers would start adding ways to browse more securely. ‚ÄúApple is very security conscious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they started to incorporate Tor-like features into Safari.‚Äù 7. Do sensitive searches in DuckDuckGo. Mr. Larson said that if people were paranoid about Google, he would strongly encourage them to use DuckDuckGo, an alternative search engine. He said however, that he personally, was not paranoid. ‚ÄúGoogle is built on the hacker ethic and they have put principle above profits in some aspects,‚Äù he said. But he also acknowledged that he meets ‚Äúpeople all the time who are extremely skeptical of any large software organization and I think that‚Äôs reasonable.‚Äù There are trade-offs. Google‚Äôs search results are more useful and accurate than competitors‚Äô precisely because of the ways it collects and analyzes information about its customers‚Äô searches. A Bonus: Cover your webcam with tape. That way, if someone has found a way to compromise your computer, they cannot spy on you through its camera. And yes, this happens. Happy encryption.

The effort, which involves teams from several acquired startups, reflects Apple‚Äôs near-term desire to put augmented reality technology into consumers' hands even as it develops special glasses that could eventually change the way people perceive their surroundings. Apple reportedly wants users to be able to point their iPhone at a real world object and have it be recognized. It may also be able recognize and manipulate people's faces. Teams from AR companies Metaio and Flyby Media, both acquired by Apple, are now working in Apple's camera group. Once the AR features are built into the iPhone camera app, Apple plans to release an SDK for app developers, similar to what it did for Touch ID. Business Insider sources also confirmed previous reports that Apple is working on digital glasses that would also offer augmented reality features. The glasses aren't expected until 2018 at the earliest. John Border, former chief engineer at Osterhout Design Group, joined Apple in September. Border is a senior optics manufacturing exploration engineer and likely worked on ODG's R-7 Smartglasses that use "3D stereoscopic ultra-transparent see-thru HD displays" to superimpose computer graphics into the real world. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company is 'high on AR for the long run' so we may see some exciting new products based around this technology in the near future.

Since then, we‚Äôve received a lot of requests for more information on HomeKit and home automation, so in this series, I‚Äôll explain what HomeKit is, how it works, and how to use it. I‚Äôll also look at some of the home automation devices that work with HomeKit. But first, let‚Äôs talk about why you might want to use home automation in the first place. Why Home Automation? -- If you‚Äôve never used home automation before, it can seem like a gimmick at best and a potential nightmare at worst. Untold movies and TV shows have explored the potential horrors of home automation. Most recently, in an episode of ‚ÄúMr. Robot,‚Äù a woman is driven from her home after hackers make her apartment go haywire. Even if complete takeover of your home by revolutionary hackers is far-fetched, problems could be annoying. By definition, home automation takes place in your personal space, and buggy code or simple human error, even in Apple‚Äôs somewhat simplified offering, could have a real impact on your life. Think carefully before diving in. But once you begin to use home automation, you start to see the everyday problems it can solve. Home automation may not change your world, but it can remove friction from your daily existence. Think about how many times a day you turn lights on and off, set your thermostat, adjust a ceiling fan, or check door locks. Even if it‚Äôs just a matter of making sure everything is as you want before bed, that‚Äôs a win. It can also compensate for the thoughtlessness of others ‚Äî those people in your household who forget to turn off lights or check that the fridge is closed. When you set home automation up intelligently, you‚Äôll feel empowered, not overwhelmed. For Apple users, HomeKit offers the easiest, most secure way to achieve that goal. This series will unfold over the next few weeks, but if you‚Äôre in a hurry to learn more, check out my book, ‚ÄúiOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course,‚Äù which has an entire chapter dedicated to HomeKit and iOS 10‚Äôs new Home app. Why HomeKit? -- Apple‚Äôs HomeKit home automation framework gives hardware manufacturers and software developers a unified way to interact with home automation devices on iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Home automation isn‚Äôt new ‚Äî the X10 home automation protocol has existed since 1975, and I‚Äôve heard from readers who controlled home automation setups with Apple II computers! By comparison, HomeKit is a baby. It debuted with iOS 8, although HomeKit-compatible devices didn‚Äôt start hitting the market until iOS 9. Even then, HomeKit control was rudimentary, relying on third-party apps. iOS 10 and watchOS 3 introduced Apple‚Äôs Home app, which offers a standardized way to manage and control HomeKit devices. Standard is good, but HomeKit is far from a complete home automation solution. Every home automation vendor provides its own software, and some of those solutions offer capabilities beyond what HomeKit provides. Some systems, such as the Philips Hue, provide a complete developer API, which makes possible apps like Light DJ, which syncs your lights with music, something HomeKit can‚Äôt do. That‚Äôs just one example ‚Äî an entire ecosystem has grown up around the Hue lights. The other downside of HomeKit is that it can‚Äôt control just any device ‚Äî manufacturers must work with Apple to have their devices certified for HomeKit. Based on my discussions with vendors, that‚Äôs challenging and expensive, though as I‚Äôll explain, there are good reasons for that. As a result, the HomeKit ecosystem doesn‚Äôt offer as many options as more established and more open standards like X10. So why use HomeKit at all? There are several excellent reasons: Security: Apple has arguably the best security of any large consumer-oriented tech company. Remote access to HomeKit devices is disabled by default and can‚Äôt even be turned on unless you‚Äôve enabled two-factor authentication on your Apple ID. You‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find a more secure home automation system that‚Äôs this easy to use. This advantage came into sharp focus recently with the DDoS attack that interrupted Internet service in the United States (see ‚ÄúMassive DDoS Attack Blocks Access to U.S. Web Sites,‚Äù 24 October 2016). That attack was made possible thanks to a plethora of insecure Internet of Things devices like DVRs and IP cameras. Last year, Forbes reported on the pains hardware vendors were experiencing making HomeKit devices to Apple‚Äôs exacting standards, especially when it comes to security. However, after seeing the destructive potential of insecure Internet-connected devices, I think we can better appreciate Apple‚Äôs rigorous approval process. Integration: HomeKit devices work with the built-in Home app in iOS 10, and your favorite Accessories and Scenes automatically appear in the third pane of Control Center. Also, you can control your devices using Siri in iOS 10, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3. Sharing: The Home app makes it easy to manage shared access to HomeKit devices. You can add and remove people, and decide whether or not they can edit your configurations. Also, changes you make to your HomeKit setup are automatically made available to everyone with whom you‚Äôre sharing. Interoperability: The Philips Hue app is pretty good, but it can‚Äôt control my iHome iSP5 or Elgato Eve Energy smart plugs. With HomeKit, I can set up a Scene to turn all of those devices off at once. HomeKit‚Äôs goal is to let you forget about vendors and focus on functionality. Also, since HomeKit is an open framework, developers can create HomeKit control apps, some of which are more capable than Apple‚Äôs Home app. Ease of Use: Home automation is complicated, but HomeKit offers the simplest, most unified home automation experience on the market. Apple‚Äôs Home app may not be the most powerful home automation app, but it won‚Äôt intimidate the casual user. Most HomeKit devices are plug-and-play. As simple as HomeKit is to use, you need to understand its core concepts to feel in control and to know what I‚Äôm talking about in future HomeKit articles. The HomeKit Hierarchy -- First, let‚Äôs go over a bit of necessary terminology, but don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs relatively straightforward. Apple organized HomeKit into a hierarchy, which gives you various levels of control over your devices. The highest level is a Home. A Home could be your residence, but it could also be an outbuilding, an office, a vacation home, or some other multi-room structure In the next level down, you have Rooms. A Room is, as you‚Äôd guess, a section of a Home. You can set up your living room, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen as Rooms in your Home. (Technically speaking, there‚Äôs another level of HomeKit hierarchy above Rooms: Zones, which are collections of Rooms. For instance, all the rooms downstairs in your house could be a Zone. However, Apple‚Äôs Home app doesn‚Äôt yet support Zones, so I won‚Äôt discuss them much in this series.) Next in the hierarchy are Accessories, which are the home automation devices in your Home, like smart bulbs, wall plugs, locks, thermostats, ceiling fans, etc. Accessories offer Services, which are the functions of the Accessory. For most devices, the Accessory and Service are indistinguishable, but some Accessories offer multiple Services. For example, my Elgato Eve Room sensor provides four Services: Current Temperature, Current Relative Humidity, Air Quality, and Battery Level. However, Apple‚Äôs Home app blurs the line between Accessories and Services, listing Services as Accessories. It also doesn‚Äôt display the Eve Room‚Äôs Battery Level Service. If you find the difference between Accessories and Services confusing, don‚Äôt worry about it. At the moment, it‚Äôs trivia. You can also group Accessories to make operation simpler. For instance, I‚Äôve grouped my two Hue-powered living room lamps, so I can adjust their color and brightness together. However, if I dig a little deeper into the Home app, I can still manipulate each one separately. The HomeKit hierarchy is a bit of a pain, but it‚Äôs essential to a smooth HomeKit experience, especially when you use Siri. I can tell Siri to turn on the laundry room light or make my living room blue, and it understands my commands perfectly. (Well, most of the time. It‚Äôs still Siri.) The last two terms you need to know are the most important: Scenes and Automations. A Scene is a collection of actions; for instance, my Good Night scene turns off the lamps in our laundry and music rooms, and dims the lights in the living room to zero (just enough light to see at night, without actually being off). Scenes are one of the most important concepts in home automation, and I‚Äôll cover them extensively. As the name suggests, Automations invoke Scenes automatically according to a user-specified schedule. I‚Äôll cover these more in a future installment. When set up carefully, Automations can remove even more friction from your life. For instance, on weekdays my wife usually wakes up earlier than I do. At 5:30 AM, my Good Morning scene turns on the lights in the laundry, music, and living rooms, so she doesn‚Äôt have to stumble through a dark house (our laundry room doubles as her closet, and the music room ‚Äî a converted garage ‚Äî adjoins the laundry room). At 8:30 AM, the Good Night scene turns off all those lights because by that time, she‚Äôs usually long gone from the house. At 3:00 PM, about the time she usually gets home from work, the Good Morning scene comes on again, so those areas of the house are well lit when she walks in and wants to change her clothes or prep for a music lesson. At night, we activate the Good Night scene manually, because we don‚Äôt all go to bed at a fixed time. I‚Äôve put a lot of thought into these Automations, so no one‚Äôs surprised by a light suddenly turning on or off. When my wife gets up, the lights she needs are on. They turn off after she leaves, and they‚Äôre back on when she gets home. And that‚Äôs with only two Scenes! With careful planning, your automated home can be just as seamless. Planning Your HomeKit Home -- If you‚Äôre intrigued by the promise of HomeKit and want to start playing with home automation, I have a few recommendations. First, communication is essential. Discuss your plans before you start buying stuff so everyone in the house has input. If your partner or roommate isn‚Äôt technical or might be bothered by the inevitable learning pains, consider starting with a single device. In the most extreme case, you might learn that home automation isn‚Äôt worth the conflict it may cause. If you‚Äôre planning to set up automated lights and smart plugs, it‚Äôs important to discuss our habit of using physical switches. For instance, if I turn off a switch that controls a lamp with Hue bulbs, my HomeKit Scene can‚Äôt turn them back on automatically, which could leave my wife fumbling in the early morning darkness. The solution to this problem is to install smart switches that can work with your home automation system and be activated manually (which is also helpful for guests). Elgato just released the first HomeKit-enabled wall switch, the Eve Light Switch. Philips makes a couple for use with the Hue bulbs ‚Äî the Philips Hue Dimmer Switch and the Philips Hue Tap Switch. iDevices announced a couple of HomeKit wall switches months ago, but they have yet to appear on the market. At first, you‚Äôll probably have to get used to using your iPhone or Apple Watch to control lights. I haven‚Äôt personally used any of these smart switches yet, so I can‚Äôt currently offer a recommendation. (If you have, let us know in the comments!) When the decision makers in your home understand and agree to home automation, the next step is figuring out where to begin. I recommend starting small with some sort of light control, either the Philips Hue system or a smart plug like the iHome SmartPlug or Elgato Eve Energy. Everyone I know who has tried Hue loves it (including our own Jeff Carlson, who regularly curses me for hooking him on home automation), but with starter kits ranging between $80 and $200, it‚Äôs an investment. However, if you want to start with a simple smart plug to control a lamp, the iHome iSP5 costs only about $30, while the Elgato Eve Energy goes for about $50. The benefit of these smart plugs is that you can use them with any appliance that plugs into a standard power outlet, so they give you a lot of room to experiment. Once you decide on your initial HomeKit investment, the next step is figuring out where to use it. Again, take it easy at the start so you and your family can get a feel for the experience. There are so many possibilities that it can be tempting to jump in with both feet. Fight that temptation. Before I got my Hue bulbs, I didn‚Äôt think there was any point in having just a handful of automated bulbs. After I started playing with them, I realized that I didn‚Äôt need many to have a functional setup, since our most-used lights are the two floor lamps in our living room. So think about where automation could have the most impact in your home. If you go for the Hue bulbs, the living room is an obvious place to start. But maybe there‚Äôs a certain light that your family members always forget to turn off, or a basement light that you‚Äôd prefer to turn on before you venture down the stairs. If you have a smart plug, you might even want to use it to turn a space heater or fan on and off at certain times. The keys to an intelligent smart home are communication and thoughtful planning. Nail those, and you‚Äôll find that home automation makes your home a more pleasant, comfortable place that doesn‚Äôt require you to run around changing settings and turning things on and off. The tips, techniques, and products that I‚Äôll discuss in the rest of this series are just means to that end.

It has phase couplers for both legs of the incoming power and signal amplifiers for large homes. I use a plug-in controller that is connected to and programmed by an old iMac running OS 9.2. The only thing lacking is decent control software that is up to date. I am interested in HomeKit but, from what I see, it is still 35 years behind in capabilities. I will watch HomeKit development but, for now, I will stick to the MUCH less expensive X-10 system and just hope someone will produce control software for it. Reply Chuck Shotton¬†¬†2016-11-03 13:47 There's a cool open source alternative to a hardware hub. You can get an application called HAP-NodeJS that will run on just about any flavor of computer (Macs for sure) that makes the Mac, itself, into a HomeKit hub. Then you can configure it to act as a bridge to all sorts of HomeKit-unaware things (like WeMO for example). It can also react to Siri commands to interact with virtual devices that can be hooked up to AppleScripts or other programs. You have to be a bit of a hacker to make it go, but you can find it at https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS Reply David Redfearn¬†¬† 2016-11-03 16:04 I have to laugh at this stuff - I don't see the value at all. >>Think about how many times a day you turn lights on and off (twice a day) set your thermostat (once a month - they are already programmed via my electrical utility) adjust a ceiling fan (twice a day in the summer, not at all in the winter) or check door locks (a couple times a day). I tried the colored light bulbs, and they didn't work well and returned them. I agree that Apple's HomeKit is the most secure way to control these things, but no-way would I trust _any_ internet connected door locks to provide real security. These are great for those who like to play around with technology - not so much for the rest of us. David Reply Joe Carl White¬†¬†2016-11-03 22:24 "Elgato just released the first HomeKit-enabled wall switch, the Eve Light Switch." Lutron Caseta dimmer switches are HomeKit enabled (in conjunction with the SmartHub); I installed my first one at the beginning of the year, and just added a second. http://www.casetawireless.com/pages/applehomekit.aspx Reply Yorick¬†¬†2016-11-04 18:58 I started playing with HomeKit Devices (EcoBee Thermostat, iHomeControl and iDevices power sockets). I use the Apple Home app and also the Wink App. I wanted the light in my living room to turn on automatically when I arrived home if it was dark so that I didn't walk into an empty house. Then I set the lights to turn on at dusk and off at random late times when I'm away. Plus the lights all turn off at a set time after I've gone to bed in case I forget. If I remember I can always say "Hey Siri, turn off all the lights". Plus my girlfriend who is 5,000 miles away can turn them off if she knows I forgot. I can check the temperature in the house if I am away and the thermostat will warn me if it is too hot or cold. On the way home from work (a 25 minute drive) I can turn the heating on to arrive home to a warm house. I've played with X.10 since '98 but HomeKit and the like take it to a new level. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne) ¬†¬†2016-11-09 12:24 Good article. I enjoyed it. As someone in my 70th year, I have no plans to use home automation (In fact I hope to actively evade it) but it is interesting to read about. Reply CJ Pitt¬†¬†2016-11-13 12:42 Thanks for this article...and any additional in the series. These are the types of articles I enjoy. They give you ideas on how to use all this technology Apple is providing...albeit without much useful documentation. I think we could also use a similar series of articles on HealthKit and the other assorted Apple Kits. Reply Joseph Haefeli¬†¬†2016-11-14 20:52 The distinction needs to be made between controlling your home world from over the internet, verses requiring the internet to make your home automation work. The former is a manageable security risk by the end user, including the option to simply not allow connections from your home automation to the outside world. The latter is a total PITA. It almost always requires an active internet connection for even the simplest activities to occur, and exponentially increases your home automation system's exposure to outside vulnerabilities malicious or inadvertent. This might be worth it for the benefits of Siri or Alexa, or ITTT sorts of control, but the fact that your thermostat potentially becomes a cripple without internet is simply rediculous. There's more issues, but I'm not paid here.... Just keep this particular topic in mind, esp. if you plan on using home automation to provide security and safety for your remote vacation home with splotchy power and no continuous internet. Reply Steve Nicholson¬†¬†2016-11-18 09:01 When we had an addition built in 2013 I had Insteon switches installed just about everywhere along with a few 8-button in-wall touch pads. We also have controllers in our three ceiling fans, an irrigation controller, six LIFX bulbs, four motion sensors (one of which is also a temperature sensor), a couple of smart outlets, and three Nest thermostats (which also report temperature). I've been controlling them all through Indigo (https://www.indigodomo.com), a Mac home automation program that's been around since 2002. It also has a companion iOS app and an optional subscription cloud service for control over the Internet. For us programmers, it even has a full Python scripting interface. While I can do a ton of geeky stuff with this system, it was also important to be sure that it works like a normal house too. When a visitor comes over, all the light switches work like normal light switches. If we have a house-sitter I only need to give them a couple extra instructions. (The LIFX lights can be turned on and off with the touchpad C button, and the bottom-right button cycles through the ceiling fan speeds.) Now that it's getting dark before we're home from work, I have a few lights come on at sunset so the house isn't sitting dark before we come home. If we're working on the drip system, we can use our iPhones to turn that irrigation valve on or off from anywhere in the yard. I can double-click off my bedside light switch to turn off all exterior lights. If we're going to be out of town, I can check a few checkboxes to enable a series of lighting control schedules to simulate us being home. We have scenes set up for cooking, watching TV, and getting ready for bed. I can turn the bedroom heater on to take the chill off before getting out of bed. My favorite geek accomplishment is my Python script that creates a graph of temperature history along with a forecast from Weather Underground that I can pull up on my iPad from anywhere (http://i.imgur.com/3LixaAd.jpg). HomeKit is ok, but it can't hold a candle to a full-blown home automation system. Is any of this stuff necessary? Absolutely not. Is it convenient and fun? You better believe it.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet says the initiative involves teams from several acquired startups, and will serve as a stop-gap until its digital glasses are ready for market. By adding AR technology into the iPhone‚Äôs camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognized, according to the person familiar with the matter. That would require creating or licensing a database of 3D objects. Another early feature for Apple‚Äôs AR integration into the camera app could be to recognize and manipulate people‚Äôs faces. Apple integrated facial recognition technology into the photos app in the most recent version of its iOS software, and purchased FaceShift, a company with similar technology in 2015.¬† Eventually, the person said, after the AR features are built into the iPhone camera app, Apple will release the technology behind them as an SDK for app developers, like it did with its Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

Apple‚Äôs 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar just received a score of 1/10 for repairability from iFixit, a private company with experts who troubleshoot and repair devices. Given, its very low score, it‚Äôs very unlikely for owners to have their laptops repaired easily if they broke them. On its official website, iFixit published a teardown report on the late 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. In its introduction, the company right away addressed what it found when it disassembled the device, saying it discovered that Apple‚Äôs new laptop is indeed ‚Äúthinner, lighter, faster‚Äù but is sadly less repairable than any other Pro laptops.¬† For the most part, the hardware specs really matched what Apple said about its latest MacBook offering when it launched the new iterations in late October. There is also a noticeable difference in the internal layout of components when compared with its predecessor‚Äôs internals.¬† After disassembling the components of the new MacBook Pro, iFixit gave the device a very disappointing rating of 1/10. In case you are wondering why this is so, the repair and components company found out a lot of very tricky stuff that make it very unlikely for one to repair certain parts of the laptop when they are damaged.¬† Perhaps the most difficult to replace component is the dynamic strip of OLED display called Touch Bar. When iFixit removed this part, it easily broke while it was being dismantled from the chassis. MacRumors has learned that even the flex cable that connects the Touch Bar to the mainboard was very difficult to remove since its wraps underneath the touch strip.¬† Another shocking discovery about the new MacBook Pro pertains to how the new speaker grilles just serve no function at all and are instead there for cosmetic reasons. The sound that is being produced is actually projected from the air vents on the sides of the device ‚Äî a design feature that is not present in the MacBook Pro variant with function keys.¬† In the checklist iFixit made for the different components of the laptop, the company mentioned a lot more of repairability issues. The pentalobe screws are said to be unnecessarily difficult. The battery assembly is solidly glued to the case, while the processor, RAM and flash memory are soldered to the logic board. Finally, fixing a broken power switch was proven to be difficult because it would require one to ask for help from Apple or get a new logic board for the device.¬† The only positive thing that the teardown found is the trackpad. Despite being twice as large as the trackpad of the previous iteration, it is easy to replace since the mechanism to remove it only involves sliding it out from the body of the laptop after removing accessible screws surrounding it.¬† As per 9To5Mac, though the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar got a measly 1/10 rating, this isn‚Äôt actually surprising because Apple products, especially the new ones, are not at all user-serviceable and would require professional help from the Cupertino giant when certain parts are broken.¬† Related Articles Apple Patents Health-Centric Technology For AirPods iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Come in Different Sizes, LCD And OLED Models Apple Rolls Out iOS 10.2 Beta 3 ‚Äî What's New?

(Reuters/Thomas Peter) Share Written by Echo Huang & Josh Horwitz Obsession Batteries November 16, 2016 Chinese iPhone owners are reporting that their iPhone 6 and 6s devices are abruptly shutting down, and Beijing wants to know why. Echoing problems in the US earlier this year, the complaints have led the China Consumers Association, a consumer watchdog group affiliated with China‚Äôs State Council (chaired by vice premier Li Keqiang), to send a letter (link in Chinese) to Apple demanding an explanation. The incident marks another blow to the hardware company as its glory days in China begin to fade. Various Chinese social media users have reported in recent weeks that their devices abruptly power off when their battery is at 50% to 60% capacity. One page on Weibo containing posts with the hashtag #iPhone6sËá™Âä®ÂÖ≥Êú∫# (iPhone 6s shuts down automatically) has generated more than 10 million views and nearly 20,000 comments. One Shanghainese consumer named Li Wei (link in Chinese) told the state-affiliated publication The Paper that the iPhone 6s he purchased from an official Apple Store had shut down abruptly three times since October 2015, all while the battery was at 20% capacity or higher. When Li went to an Apple authorized reseller to fix the problem, the store told him to first perform a factory reset on the phone, and if the problem persisted, he would have to pay 2000 yuan ($291) for a repair. Alternatively, Li could purchase a new phone. ‚ÄúI bought the iPhone6s over a year ago when it started to automatically shut down at 30% charged last month, [and] now it will only turn on again when its charging‚Äù one commenter wrote on Weibo (link in Chinese, registration required). Another suggested the problem might not be an issue with the battery, writing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve changed [the battery] but the phone keeps shutting down at 50% charged, what crap!‚Äù Prompted by the social media backlash, the China Consumers Association wrote a letter (link in Chinese, registration required) to Apple dated Nov. 15, demanding it explain the cause of the malfunctions. The letter urged the company to reply within 10 business days: Recently, this organization has continued to receive reports from consumers stating their iPhone 6 and 6s devices will automatically shut down when the battery still has 50-60% capacity. The shutdown problem persists after upgrading the phone‚Äôs software. [Other times] when the temperature is too warm or cool it will automatically shut down, [or] after the device automatically shuts down it will not turn on again unless it is charging. Media have reported all of these phenomena. Since a considerable number of consumers in China own the iPhones 6 and 6s, and number of people reporting these people is also large, in order to to protect the legal rights of consumers, the China Consumer Association asks that you carry out an investigation that can answer the following questions about the abnormal automatic shutdown of the iPhones 6 and 6s devices: What is causing the iPhone 6 and 6s devices to automatically shutdown? Is there a problem with the battery? How will you deal with the shutdown problems reported by consumers? What measures will you take to fix the shutdown problem, if there is an extremely large number of cases? iPhone 6 and 6s owners outside of China have also complained about similar battery drain issues in the past. In early 2016, the company published a support document acknowledging the issue, suggesting it could be caused by a time zone error. The document does not appear to be accessible currently, and it‚Äôs unclear why this issue has surfaced in China now. Apple did not respond to questions about the reports or letter. The letter comes at a difficult time for the Cupertino, California, hardware giant. The company‚Äôs sales have been lagging in China‚Äîthe country has dropped from its second-largest market in revenue to its third largest. Meanwhile, the Chinese government appears eager to see the company‚Äôs fortunes fade in the country. Amid a larger crackdown on foreign companies entering the media industry, Apple shut down its iBooks and iTunes movie store in China this year.

The iPhone maker intends to reduce the slice of revenue it is paid by subscription video streaming apps from the current 30 percent to 15 percent, according to people familiar with the plans. Other non-video apps see their bill from Apple halved from 30 percent only after a customer has completed a year‚Äôs subscription. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment. Apple‚Äôs hefty cut of sales made via its App Store has long angered partners, some of whom have accused the technology giant of anti-competitive behavior. The concessions speak to the growing importance of video to Apple, which next month will introduce a new app devoted to TV shows and movies. Apple‚Äôs new TV app is part of the company‚Äôs effort to make its devices the hub for watching video by pooling television shows and movies from multiple apps in one place. Apple has explored creating its own live TV service, but delayed those plans after difficulty getting rights from programmers and broadcast networks, who have observed with caution how Apple has assumed a dominant role in the music industry. Instead, Apple has crafted an app that relies on programming from services like Hulu, Showtime and HBO. Slowing iPhone sales have prompted a greater focus on revenue from the App Store and other services, including Apple Music and iCloud. Services have become the fastest growing business segment for the Cupertino, California-based company, with sales jumping 22 percent to $24 billion in the fiscal year ended in September.

The company is now extending the rate to all subscription video services as long as they are integrated with Apple‚Äôs new TV app,¬†said the people who asked not to be identified because the changes aren‚Äôt public. To compensate for the fee, some providers increased the price of their services sold through the App Store to equal the revenue generated on other distribution channels. For example, Google‚Äôs YouTube Red video and music subscription service costs $12.99 a month on iPhones and iPads and $9.99 a month elsewhere. The move may also speak to the growing competition in providing video apps. Amazon.com Inc. has begun selling other companies‚Äô video apps as an add-on to its Prime delivery service, which also includes an on-demand video library.
