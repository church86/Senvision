Of 12 tables set up to show off Apple’s hardware, only one — socked away in the back left corner — was home to desktops. The 21” and 27” iMacs on display were at least relatively new, having received a minor refresh last October. But the Mac mini and Mac Pro models next to them — each plugged into one of the Thunderbolt displays Apple discontinued in June — were last updated in October 2014 and December 2013. Now that Apple has rolled out a line of new laptops while once again leaving its desktop hardware idle, that store display will look just a bit gloomier next Monday. And for many Mondays thereafter. Things didn’t used to work this way Not long ago, Apple (AAPL) updated all of its desktops at least as often as it now updates the iPhone. Each year’s new models wouldn’t always bring huge changes, but going three years between upgrades usually ensured you’d get a good value for your money. Apple letting the Mac mini gather dust should have been the first warning. That affordably priced computer helped demolish the “Macs cost too much” storyline, but Apple started letting it go two years or more between updates. And then Apple introduced a brand-new professional-grade desktop, the Mac Pro, and seems to have forgotten that it existed too — it hasn’t seen a single update since the late 2013 introduction of the computer’s current cylindrical design. Apple’s iMac is beautiful, but losing its touch.More The all-in-one iMac hasn’t seen as much neglect, but its underlying design hasn’t changed much aside from the removal of an optical drive. (Which I didn’t agree with; CDs and DVDs are still a thing, and who cares how thin a desktop computer is? If you’re looking at it from the side, you’re using it wrong.) Note that the aging nature of these Mac desktops has yet to be offset with an appropriate discount. Missed opportunities The cost of going a year or two or three without an update starts with keeping users stuck on a slower processor. You might not notice or mind it at home, and that’s fair; as Adam Engst, editor of the long-running Mac news site TidBits, observed, “for most people, most of the time, CPU power is not a limiting factor.” But creative types who wrestle with pixels for a living — and pay high-end prices for the necessary hardware — certainly will. “Windows is pretty far ahead on all sorts of processor intensive activities that Apple used to do well in,” said Stephen Baker, vice president of industry analysis at NPD Group. He noted the powerful, stylish and expensive desktop Microsoft (MSFT) introduced Wednesday: “Surface Studio is going to hurt Apple a lot in those professional categories.” Apple’s Mac Pro desktop is a beast, but far from “new.”More “A faster Mac Pro would dramatically improve editing of ultra high resolution footage (4K and higher) and it would also decrease render times, ultimately saving us a lot of time,”  noted Vinh Le, a video producer with the Washington marketing firm iStrategy Labs, in an email. Old desktop designs also miss out on useful advances in how we interact with computers. As today’s updated MacBook Pros show, computers no longer need to force us to unlock them with typed-in passwords when they include fingerprint sensors. That’s an upgrade you’d notice dozens of times a day. The Touch Bar — the touchscreen strip atop the keyboard in Apple’s two new MacBook Pro laptops — might also make a good addition to a desktop. But you can’t get that yet. So what? At one level, you could argue that the desktop is irrelevant. That store positioning doesn’t just reflect any shame Apple might feel over its aging lineup. Desktops have been declining for years; by the fourth quarter of 2012, Mac laptops outsold Mac desktops by about three to one. Read More But if you want to maximize storage or expandability, a laptop will suit you poorly. The solid-state drives they use typically max out at 512 gigabytes, while desktops can easily accommodate two or four times as much and offer more expansion ports to connect external devices. Most also let you add as a big of a screen as you want without first paying for a built-in display. Apple’s seemingly forgotten Mac mini.More More important, computer vendors not based in Cupertino, Calif., still seem willing to chase that market. One longtime analyst urged a little more patience in Apple. “These products by Apple are always produced with a strategic goal in mind” — think major operating-system and application upgrades and new web services — said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies. “They also always want to push design to the edge and that also takes time.” Engst, another Mac veteran, noted that switching still isn’t that easy. “I suspect that familiarity with Mac-specific tools and procedures would keep professionals on the Mac for a long time even if Windows PCs promised performance gains.” This is something I, personally, need to think about, since I’m typing this on an ancient iMac I would like to replace if only it didn’t entail paying a 2016 price for a design rooted in 2014. Bajarin suggested I shouldn’t have to wait much longer: “I believe there is a radical new design in the works and that is probably targeted for the spring.” OK, Apple; I’ll hang on a little longer.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook got testy after an analyst asked him if Apple had a 'grand strategy' Kif Leswing Oct. 25, 2016, 6:46 PM 111,551 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.REUTERS/Toru Hanai Apple may have hit its targets in its fiscal fourth quarter, but investors are clearly not dazzled by the shrinking shipments across all of the company's key product lines. Shares of Apple fell by about 3% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. And CEO Tim Cook struggled to convince Wall Street that the company was poised for a new growth spurt. But the moment that best defined the company's predicament came during the conference call on Tuesday, when Cook fielded a remarkable question from an analyst and reacted in what can best be described as a defensive manner. Steven Milunovich of UBS Securities started by pointing out that Apple hadn't released a major new product in a while, then asking: "The question is, A, does Apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do? I know you won't tell us what it us, but do you know what you want to do over the next three to maybe five years?" Cook responded by saying, "We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it, but as usual we're not going to talk about what's in it." The "strongest pipeline" phrase was standard Apple boilerplate language for these kinds of questions. But it was hard to miss a sense of annoyance in Cook's voice, especially when he didn't follow with any other comments, if even just some more platitudes about Apple's focus on innovation. Then something really interesting happened. The unthinkable question Milunovich followed up by pressing on whether Apple had a "stong sense of where technology is going" or simply reacted to changes to the market. "We have a strong sense of where things go and we're very agile to shift as we need to," Cook said tersely. It was a striking sign of how much Apple's reputation has changed from even just a few years ago, as the company has experienced three quarters of declining revenue and struggled to unveil a new, game-changing gadget. Apple was the undisputed leader of the tech industry during the Steve Jobs era. It would have been unthinkable for a Wall Street analyst to have the temerity to ask whether the company had a grand strategy. Apple is the maker of the iPhone. The company does not react to others; it sets the agenda. But these days the Wall Street analysts like those who asked questions on Apple's call on Tuesday aren't taking anything for granted. As a group, they pressed the company's leadership for more information on the direction of the company — like the long-rumored Apple Car — or details about its financial operations. The clearest takeaway from Apple earnings call: No one takes Apple's word for anything anymore.

Apple Press Release Apple unveils groundbreaking new MacBook Pro Revolutionary Touch Bar, Breakthrough Performance in Apple’s Thinnest and Lightest Pro Design Ever The all-new MacBook Pro revolutionizes the notebook user experience. Cupertino, California — Apple today introduced the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever, along with a breakthrough interface that replaces the traditional row of function keys with a brilliant, Retina-quality Multi-Touch display called the Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro features Apple’s brightest and most colorful Retina display yet, the security and convenience of Touch ID, a more responsive keyboard, a larger Force Touch trackpad and an audio system with double the dynamic range. It’s also the most powerful MacBook Pro ever, featuring sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, up to 2.3 times the graphics performance over the previous generation, super-fast SSDs and up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The groundbreaking Touch Bar dynamically adapts to the application you’re using. The Touch Bar places controls right at the user’s fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar, Numbers, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more. The Touch Bar, a built-in Retina Multi-Touch display above the keyboard, was designed to boost creativity and productivity. “This week marks the 25th anniversary of Apple’s first notebook; through the years each generation has introduced new innovations and capabilities, and it’s fitting that this all-new generation of MacBook Pro is the biggest leap forward yet,” said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With the groundbreaking new Touch Bar, the convenience of Touch ID, the best Mac display ever, powerful performance, improved audio, blazing-fast storage and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity in our thinnest and lightest pro notebook yet, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced notebook ever made.” Thinnest and Lightest MacBook Pro Ever The lightest MacBook Pro ever also features a larger trackpad and the most responsive keyboard ever. Building on innovations pioneered in MacBook, the new MacBook Pro features an entirely new enclosure design and all-metal unibody construction that creates an incredibly rigid and dense notebook that is amazingly thin and light. At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 percent thinner and 23 percent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter. Touch ID Comes to the Mac Touch ID enables quick and secure purchases with Apple Pay simply by reading your fingerprint. Integrated into the power button is the convenience and security of Touch ID, one of the great features customers have come to know and love from their iPhone and iPad. Once you enroll your fingerprint in Touch ID on your MacBook Pro, you can quickly unlock your Mac, switch user accounts and make secure purchases with Apple Pay on the web with a single touch. Touch ID enables a quick, accurate reading of your fingerprint and uses sophisticated algorithms to recognize and match it with the Secure Enclave in the new Apple T1 chip. Apple’s Brightest, Most Colorful Notebook Display MacBook Pro’s Retina display is brighter, thinner and supports wider color gamut, making it the best notebook display ever made. The best Mac display ever delivers images that are more vivid, reveal even greater detail and appear more lifelike than ever. As thin as a MacBook display at .88 mm, the Retina display on the new MacBook Pro at 500 nits of brightness, is an amazing 67 percent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 percent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support wider color gamut. And with power-saving technologies like a larger pixel aperture, a variable refresh rate and more power-efficient LEDs, the display consumes 30 percent less energy than before. The Most Powerful MacBook Pro Yet Power up to 130 percent more graphics performance on the new 15-inch MacBook Pro. Powerful processors, cutting-edge graphics, blazing-fast SSDs, high-speed memory and an advanced thermal architecture deliver amazing pro-level performance in a dramatically thinner enclosure. Sixth-generation dual-core Core i5 with eDRAM, dual-core Core i7 with eDRAM and quad-core Core i7 Intel processors deliver pro-level processing performance while conserving energy. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro features powerful Radeon Pro discrete graphics delivering up to 2.3 times more performance than the previous generation; while the 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics that are up to two times faster than before. All models feature SSDs with sequential read speeds over 3GBps and Thunderbolt 3, which consolidates data transfer, charging and twice the video bandwidth in a single port — allowing users to drive a 5K display and power their MacBook Pro with a single cable. The new MacBook Pro is available in a 13-inch model and 13- and 15-inch models with the Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro also offers: Much larger Force Touch trackpads — 46 percent larger on the 13-inch MacBook Pro and twice as large on the 15-inch MacBook Pro; More responsive and comfortable typing on the keyboard with a second-generation butterfly mechanism; Louder, more true-to-life sound through speakers with double the dynamic range and improved bass; macOS Sierra, the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, with new features like Siri integration, Universal Clipboard, Apple Pay on the web and Photos, which helps you rediscover your meaningful memories, organize your library and perfect shots like a pro.

With the new Magnetic Timeline in Final Cut Pro X, users can understand their film at a glance with customizable arrangement and color coding of audio clips based on type or “role” — such as dialogue, music and effects. It’s simple to create and assign roles, and give each one a unique color. And in a first for pro video software, users can simply drag to instantly rearrange the vertical layout of their timeline or highlight specific audio roles while editing. Integration with the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro boosts creativity and productivity by dynamically adapting to each task and presenting intuitive controls exactly when and where users need them.

Nov 2016, 01:24 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte öffnen in 7 Stunden 36 Minuten For crying out loud, Apple, just build a touchscreen Mac alreadyVon Matt Rosoff | Business Insider – Fr., 28. Okt 2016 01:51 MESZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: Apple Inc. AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung AAPL 105,71 -2,72 On Thursday, Apple updated its high-end lineup of laptops, the MacBook Pro, for the first time in four years. The most visible new feature was the Touch Bar, a thin horizontal touchscreen that sits along the top row of the keyboard, replacing the little-used function keys. It looks like this: (AP) The items that appear on the Touch Bar will vary depending on what app you're using or what you want to do. If you have Safari open, you'll use it to scroll through favorite sites or open tabs. If you're in iTunes, it'll let you control the music. If you're doing email or messaging, you can use it to pick an emoji: (Darren Weaver) If you believe Apple design guru Jony Ive, the Touch Bar has been in development for more than two years. It's also an expensive add-on: The 13-inch laptop with the Touch Bar costs $300 more than the same laptop without it. In the demos, it looks really cool. It's colorful and interesting and fun. (We couldn't try it yet because the laptops that ship with it won't be available for another two to three weeks.) But functionally, it doesn't make much sense. When you're using a keyboard to type and select commands, you're not looking down. To use the Touch Bar, you're going to have to interrupt your flow, look down, slide your finger along the strip, and then get back into whatever you were doing before. It also would have been just as easy for Apple, with its massive resources and hardware expertise, to ship new MacBooks with touchscreens and put the exact same functional commands in a strip along the bottom of the screen. Touchscreen computers are also useful in other ways. You can reach out to move windows around, zoom in, swipe through different windows, and so on. You know, the way you do on the iPad. Which Apple invented. Which sent Microsoft into such a panic that it recreated Windows to be touch-sensitive, leading to an explosion of new touchscreen laptops. Too easy or too stubborn? But Apple refuses to go there. "Doing something that's different is actually relatively easy and relatively fast, and that's tempting," Ive told CNET. "We take a very different approach in that we genuinely want to make something that's better." Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller added, "What we wanted to do was bring all this advanced technology of multitouch and Retina displays down to where your hands can take advantage of them on a laptop." In other words, Apple is acknowledging that touch is a useful interface on a traditional computer. But for some reason, it thinks users will want to interrupt their flow to look down and touch a narrow strip running along the top of the keyboard, instead of touching the beautiful massive display they're already looking at as they type. What really seems to be going on here is pure stubbornness. Back in 2012, Microsoft was talking up Windows 8, its forthcoming operating system that would support both touch and keyboard-pointer use. An analyst asked Apple CEO Tim Cook about Apple's plans to do something similar, and he quipped, "You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but you know those things are not going to probably be pleasing to the user." Indeed, Windows 8 was a flop in the market, but that turned out to be an execution problem: Microsoft got rid of too many features traditional PC users wanted, made it unnecessarily complicated to switch between touch and keyboard mode, and made a lot of other bizarre design choices that just didn't work. So Microsoft modified its approach, and with Windows 10 last year the idea of a touchscreen computer that's mostly a traditional PC, but with touch when you want it, became pretty well-baked. So much so that when Apple released its latest iPad a year ago, it offered an attachable keyboard as an add-on — exactly what Microsoft pioneered with its Surface tablet, which first shipped with Windows 8. It's time for Apple to take the next step, swallow its pride, and join the PC world in offering a laptop with a touchscreen that's actually useful.

The new MacBook Pro line includes new keyboards, replacing the former row of function keys with Touch ID and dynamic Touch Bar display. Credit: Apple Most Popular Apple unveiled new Mac computers as it seeks to revitalize a product line that co-founder Steve Jobs once said would be rendered redundant by the iPad. Overhauled MacBook Pro laptops and a new computer monitor were presented in a press conference at Apple's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. While laptops are traditionally more profitable for Apple than the iPad, customers often spend more on films, music and apps with the iPad, making it a long-term moneymaker. The new MacBook Pro has a Touch ID fingerprint scanner which makes it easier to buy online using the Apple Pay payments system. Mr. Jobs heralded tablets as laptop replacements by calling the iPad a "post-PC" device after it launched in 2010. But products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. While Mac revenue has fallen from its 2015 peak, the decline in iPad sales has been more precipitous and the laptop now outsells the tablet. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has meanwhile sought to expand services revenue from the App Store, iTunes and iCloud to offset slowing hardware sales.

The new laptops are lighter, thinner and narrower than their predecessors, and include larger trackpads and faster chips. The highlight was a new digital function display at the top of the keyboard called the Touch Bar, replacing physical buttons. The thin organic light-emitting diode screen allows functions to change based on the application currently in use. Prices start at $1,499 for a 13-inch version without the new Touch Bar. The 15-inch one starts at $2,399, Apple said. "While we don't expect the updates to meaningfully move the needle, we believe this should return the Mac segment to growth in the near term," Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a note to clients, reiterating his overweight rating. Apple also announced a 5K monitor developed with LG Electronics that connects to the new MacBook Pro, and a new TV app. Apple last released new laptop computers in the middle of 2015, and has gradually lost customers in the intervening period. The iPhone maker's personal computing market share fell to 7.4% in the three months through September, down from 8.1% a year earlier, researcher IDC said this month. "Apple is going to be able to regain some of the market share that they've lost in the higher end notebook market because so many of their products have got so long in the tooth," Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research, said before the event. Apple shares slipped about 1% to $114.48 at the close in New York. The stock had jumped about 20% in the past three months on hope for strong sales of the new iPhone 7. After a cautious holiday forecast earlier this week from the company, the shares have given up some of those gains. If Apple is able to sell more services through Macs, they can become far more profitable than iPads, Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin said before the product launch. "Then you really do want to sell more Macs, because it's not only a higher upfront fee but then if you can get the same services revenue that's a more powerful growth engine." The Mac's average selling price is almost $800 more than the iPad, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Apple got 11% of its $216 billion annual revenue from the computer, with the iPhone accounting for most of the rest. Siri, introduced to the Mac operating system in September, could also help guarantee a cut of revenue from taxis, meals and other services ordered with the virtual assistant via computers. Siri can be activated more easily using the new Touch Bar. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Consumer Electronics Design Digital Shopper Marketing Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

PT Written by Jim Dalrymple Events held on Apple’s campus are my favorite and today didn’t disappoint. I wasn’t really sure what to expect from the new Macs, but after getting some time with the MacBook Pro, I was impressed with the new Touch Bar and wide gamut display. Here are some things that struck me during the keynote: Apple’s commitment to accessibility is incredible. They don’t see it as a “market”, but rather a responsibility to that community. The company deserves a lot of credit for figuring out ways to make its products accessible to so many people. Apple TV is moving—slowly, but it’s moving. I can’t wait for Single Sign-on for apps (TV stations), but until then the new TV app won’t be of much use for me. I’m not going to activate every app separately. Interesting that MacBook Pro comes in only two colors. Perhaps what they think the pros want—and it could be. It’s clear that size and weight still matters to Apple. They talked quite a bit about it today. I’m really happy to see the new keyboard (MacBook keyboard) come to the pro. I love that keyboard so much. The Touch Bar is more impressive than what I thought it would be. It’s not just contextual by app, but by function. The Touch Bar is configurable, which is going to be great for third-party developers too. There’s more to the MacBook Pro than a Touch Bar. An entirely new thermal architecture shows the thought that goes into these machines. TWF I think, perhaps next year, we’ll see a more significant redesign to the Retina MacBook to give it the improved keyboard. Maybe even a second USB port. deepknight I was really hoping for a Mac mini update, what am I to use for a home server now that my 2007 Mac Pro is not working? TWF I don’t think they’ll have to wait for an event to update the Mini or the Pro. But you may not see one until next year. Intel’s CPU availability sucks at the moment. deepknight Yeah I heard that about Intel. I often wonder if Apple has a long term plan to make their own CPUs. Billy Razzle Yes, they do. Shameer Mulji they do for iDevices. What about Macs? Billy Razzle Yes, they do. Shameer Mulji Do you think we’ll actually see them in Macs or is it just “science project”? Billy Razzle Yes, we will. Shameer Mulji Cool. Hopefully soon. As in the next couple of years. Alejandro Lozada Hope so. Intel is a shit show… we’re approaching the same situation as with PowerPC all those years ago. Intel dgaf about the Mac, and it’s showing. Also: their modem sucks on the iPhone 7 (vs Qualcomm’s) Adrayven Honestly, Synology is very good with Apple support. Would recommend them.. NAS these days can easily do most, if not all, of the things you’d use a home server for.. I run an email server, Teamspeak server, Dropbox like could sync’ing, file server, has RAID, DNS, web server, photo server, Plex … for less than $300-600 + drives (depending on how many bays you want).. Look at the Synology DS916+ or DS716+.. they both do really well.. deepknight Thank you…I actually have a Synology NAS, but I back up to Crashplan because I need to keep my photos offsite, so that’s where I am stuck. Most of the online backup services don’t even let you use a NAS, but Crashplan does, just not sure how to back up without a computer from NAS. Adrayven If you have DSM 6 installed, look at Cloud Sync, which supports Backblaze backup service directly from Synology. Cloud Sync supports many other backup services as well. deepknight Cool, thank you!! I will check it out. rj Linux on an Intel NUC? John Lundell Happy to see others giving this good reviews because I felt a bit underwhelmed. Sad to see the illuminated logo gone… sad Apple can’t even do a display. Microsoft seemed to garner more excitement this week. (and at least they have a display even though its pure Apple copy going on over there…) rj The displays looks great to me: Thunderbolt, retina, wide gamut, USB C charging. Not sure what Apple could add. DanielSw Who cares about a damn logo! I really like this new MB Pro 15—enough to consider upgrading to it instead of another iMac. I like the 27″ LG display, too, and may get two. Then I’d have a great desktop AND a portable all in one. John To make the overall computer thinner, and especially the enclosure for the screen, you’ve got to shit can the illuminated eye candy. On the plus side you get individually illuminated keys like the MacBook. I find that much more important. DanielSw I agree! fastasleep “can’t even do a display” WTF are you talking about? The display is improved in several ways. isitjustme Kind of interesting to know what make MS more exciting, care to elaborate? Mo http://www.loopinsight.com/2016/10/27/microsoft-surface-studio-a-disruption-courting-the-mac-creative-market-and-beyond/ jgerry I’m concerned that none of the most prominent Apple bloggers have mentioned the insanely high pricing. DanielSw It’s not insanely high. If Apple recommends them, then that’s good enough for me. Far better to HAVE such external displays than to sit around and carp about the lack of them. If you can’t afford them, then you don’t really need them. If you need them, which I do, then the $300 or so “extra” is peanuts compared to increased production capacity. Mingo Hagen It’s not insanely high. Mingo Hagen It’s not insanely high. New 15″ MBP in 2011 started at $1799 New 15″ MBP in 2016 starts at $2399 DanielSw Comparing five-year-old prices? How ridiculous is that! DanielSw But. . .what if they actually NEEDED to raise the price. . . because the new model is actually improved and has more features and that new bar thingie actually had to be invented and manufactured at major expense? Hmmmmm? It’s called PRICING, pal, which has to take into account all the expenses of developing a product and getting it into the hands of the customer. That includes PROFIT, as well. Basic economics. Mingo Hagen In absolute dollars it’s the most expensive introduction of a new MacBook Pro 15″ since 2002. Inflation adjusted, it’s the most expensive introduction since 2005. Compared to the last time Apple did this (with the introduction of the Retina MBP) they didn’t update the the rest of the 15″ line up. So there’s not really an alternative for the non-rich people wanting to buy a current gen 15″ laptop from Apple. jgerry Upgrade from 256GB SSD (which is an insult in and of itself) to 1TB SSD: $600 Upgrade from 256GB SSD to 2TB SSD: $1400 price of a 1TB SSD: ~ $300 price of a 2TB SSD: ~ $600 Come on Apple, you’re already sticking it to us to make 35% margins on the base unit. How about using your massive buying power to let us get a fair deal on storage upgrades? Also, 16GB RAM max? My MBP from 4 years ago maxed out at 16GB. justcause 16GB max, sorry, but what a joke, it’s not 2011 anymore!! These should be Skylake processors which can go to 64GB, where is the Pro in MacBook Pro? Bob Dylan Right, let’s skip right over the Mac Pro, Mac mini and iMac… jennyzeroo I found the price increases shocking. And I own a lot of Apple products. It MAN, those laptops are REALLY REALLY over priced. isitjustme Try calculating it over the number of years you be using it and you wouldn’t find it over priced. Oh one more thing work in the resale value too. noliv Try calculating it compared to the Windows competition. I hate Windows and I love MacOS, I won’t buy a PC anytime soon, but a Windows machine is capable and functional… so if anyone asks me what laptop they should buy, I’ll definitely recommend them to get a heavy but decent PC for 1/3rd of the price of a Mac… sad. David Stewart Intel just released a study where they found Mac’s were substantially cheaper to own and run than PCs in a corporate environment. Initial price isn’t the only consideration when determining value. ondre *IBM http://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/20/ibm-macs-less-expensive-than-pcs/ noliv I think that you mean IBM, not Intel, and I’m sure it’s true in their context. But in many other situations it is a different story. People who buy a computer for personal use don’t have to hire an IT department to manage their computer, most of us spend $0 in maintenance, Mac or PC (actually, most of us would spend a bit of money for anti-virus on PC and a bit more than that to get a few dongles for our Mac). The thing is you have more choices in the PC market: If your ideal Mac configuration is the one Apple decided to build, great, you’ve got the perfect machine… and today it is becoming clear for many of us that Apple’s choices are getting less and less aligned with our ideal Mac. David Stewart Yes, IBM, sorry. I know lots of people who end up spending money getting their computer fixed in the shop. But even if you don’t, any time you spend troubleshooting a misbehaving computer is time you can be doing something else (like making money or spending time with family). So economically there is still a cost associated with it. Of course, these are tradeoffs people have to weigh themselves, based on their needs, interest and situation. Mo “People who buy a computer for personal use don’t have to hire an IT department to manage their computer…” How many people are you referring to? Has Windows become that much easier to diagnose or protect from malware? People who buy a computer for personal use can’t hire an IT department, but they sure do end up spending money on remediation. marv08 Two color options is already too much for some… And by some I mean me. I ordered the 15″ MBP as soon as the store was back up, and I have no bloody idea which color I have ordered, since it is neither mentioned in the order confirmation, nor in the order details on Apple’s web site. Looks like 3.5 weeks of guessing ahead 🙂 Meaux The death of MagSafe is a legit tragedy. Mark The death of the first MagSafe was a tragedy. When they changed it to “cable just falls out” with MagSafe2, it became annoying (even if safe). rb763 I haven’t seen anyone mention if there might be a Touch Bar keyboard for desktop Macs. I hope this is possible and not something that will only work for the next generation Mac models. The Cappy Agreed. It would help popularize the use of the thing for Apple to be able to show devs, “See? Tons of people will be able to use these features. Not just new MBP owners.” djwtwo It will probably depend on having enough bandwidth to push the pixels around on the Touch Bar’s screen (and possibly the ability to carry a real display protocol; it’s not clear to me yet how the MacBook Pro is driving those pixels, but it sounds like it might be a real display protocol.) I can certainly see new desktops going forward having them, but I don’t know what you might require on an existing machine (Thunderbolt keyboards?) John It became obvious today that the MacBook Air is end of life. StruckPaper The biggest feature of the new MBPs is the higher price. It will create a higher barrier to many who are considering switching. And it will drive some mac users away. Apple probably is aware of this but may be looking at it this way – the PC market is shrinking no matter what. We are just going to entrench ourselves entirely in the higher end, and go for high revenue instead. The touchbar is cool. But is is a feature that will attract switchers? No. Is it one that will make everyone willing to spend $500 more? No. Apple will see sales volume go up in the short term because of pent up demand. After that, it will be interesting to see how their market share shakes out. Steven Fisher Two colours make sense when they’re both grey. One of the early reports I saw was that the MacBook Pro came in two colours: space grey and gold. THAT didn’t make sense. This does. 🙂 Alejandro Lozada What’s your view on desktops? I’m really disappointed about the lack of news on the Pro, iMac, and Mini. Are desktops going bye bye?

Home News Laptops Apple's new MacBook Pro powered by AMD Polaris GPU Apple's new MacBook Pro announced, 15-inch model rocks AMD's new Radeon Pro graphics GPU By: Anthony Garreffa | Laptops News | Posted: Oct 27, 2016 11:37 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Apple has unveiled their new refreshed line of MacBook Pro laptops, with two new 13-inch models and a single higher-end 15-inch model that rocks Radeon Pro 450 graphics from AMD.     The lower-end 13-inch MBP features a dual-core Intel Core i5 processor at 2GHz, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, 2 x Thunderbolt 3 ports and Intel Iris Graphics 540 - but it's the higher-end 13-inch MBP where the fun begins.     Specs, Including AMD Radeon Pro Graphics     Apple has refreshed its MacBook Pro line up with some slightly beefier hardware, with Apple noting the new display on the MacBook Pro is 67% brighter, 67% higher contrast, and has 25% more colors than the MacBook.   The higher-end 15-inch MBP features a quad-core processor from Intel in the form of a Core i7 CPU, with 16GB of 2133MHz RAM, an SSD up to 2TB, and AMD's new Radeon Pro 450 GPU. The new 15-inch MBP will be much faster than its predecessor, with a 130% jump over the 3D graphics specs compared to its predecessor.   Apple's higher-end 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models come with 4 x Thunderbolt 3 ports, with two on each side - but all of them support USB-C, so you'll be fine. There is no SD card reader, which might leave some people (myself included) a little upset.   The 13-inch MBP is also much thinner, coming in at just 14.9mm thick compared to the older model which is much thicker, at 18mm.     Touch Bar + Touch ID     Apple's higher-end 13-inch MacBook Pro rocks the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features, with the Touch Bar at the top of the MBP being the big OLED strip we've been hearing rumors about for months. The Touch Bar responds to both gestures and taps, with Apple noting that it will work in specific software like Safari - where your bookmarks and a back button will be displayed. If you're using iPhoto, then you'll have buttons to help flip through your pictures and edit them.     Fingerprint security is now a thing with the MacBook Pro, with Apple including a Touch ID sensor in the Touch Bar, which is in the far right-hand side where the power button used to reside.   BGR notes that the new Touch Bar can serve as a "handy autocorrect tool", so if you're like me and live inside of Word, emails, or right now - inside of Chrome writing this content, the Touch Bar will really help your workflow. You can even throw in some emojis from the Touch Bar, which is a nice addition.     Battery Life & macOS Sierra   Apple noted that the new MacBook Pro rocks the latest OS from the company, macOS Sierra, which should provide around 10 hours of battery life.   Pricing & Availability   13-inch MacBook Pro - $1499 13-inch MacBook Pro (Touch Bar/Touch ID) - $1799 15-inch MacBook Pro (Touch Bar/Touch ID) - $2399   Apple will begin taking orders of the new MacBook Pro models this week, with the two Touch Bar-capable models to start shipping in the next 2-3 weeks.

Macs & Mac OS X | 27 Oct 2016 | Print  | Comment (17) New MacBook Pros Add Context-sensitive Touch Bar by Adam C. Engst At its “Hello Again” special event, Apple finally unveiled new models of the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro, the first update to the company’s professional laptops in nearly 18 months (see “Apple Releases Updated MacBook Pro, iMac, and iPhone Dock,” 19 May 2015). The new models boast an updated industrial design that takes cues from the 12-inch MacBook to reduce size and weight. They also introduced the Touch Bar, an entirely new, context-sensitive input device that replaces the function keys above the keyboard with a multi-touch–capable Retina display that includes an integrated Touch ID sensor. Unsurprisingly, given how much time has passed since the previous models were released, the new MacBook Pros feature significantly improved performance as well. The previous models of the MacBook Pro remain available for sale. The MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook models received no updates, although Apple dropped the 11-inch MacBook Air. Apple made no mention of the iMac, Mac mini, or Mac Pro, so people looking to upgrade a desktop Mac will have to keep waiting. Reach Out and Touch the Bar -- Sure, the new MacBook Pros are smaller, lighter, and faster, but the big news is the Touch Bar. It’s a thin, touch-sensitive screen above the keyboard, where the function keys used to be. It extends the full width of the keyboard and is about as deep as the function key row it replaces at just over 0.4 inches (1.02 cm). Unfortunately, it does not have either 3D Touch/Force Touch or a Taptic Engine, so it accepts only simple touches and doesn’t provide any feedback. The Touch Bar features a 2170-by-60–pixel Retina display that apps can use to show context-sensitive tools. Because it’s multi-touch and can handle up to 10 simultaneous touch inputs, app developers are letting their imaginations run wild with Touch Bar possibilities. In Photos, for instance, depending on what you’re doing, the Touch Bar enables you to scrub through your photo collection, mark photos you love, and edit photos. Once you’re editing a photo, the Touch Bar changes to provide editing tools, such as exposure and color sliders and rotation controls. In video editing apps such as Final Cut Pro X, the Touch Bar can provide a timeline scrubber along with trimming tools. Every app will take advantage of the Touch Bar in its own ways. For example, for those who use emojis, apps like Messages could display available emojis in a scrollable strip. The Touch Bar can also provide the QuickType suggestions familiar to iOS users. Apple also showed how you can customize at least some of the Touch Bar’s tools, much like how you can choose which buttons appear in the toolbars of many Mac apps. Customizing the Touch Bar in the Finder, for example, presents an interface similar to that used for editing window toolbars, letting you drag buttons and controls down to the Touch Bar from an on-screen display of available items. At the far right of the Touch Bar is an integrated Touch ID sensor, which enables you to log in to your Mac with the press of a finger, just like on an iPhone or iPad. Actually, it’s even better, since you can use different fingers to access different accounts on your Mac at startup or via fast user switching. For example, you could have your right index finger log you in to your main account, set your right pinky to log you into a troubleshooting account, and let your spouse log in to yet another account. The Touch ID sensor communicates with a new Apple T1 chip that includes a Secure Enclave for storing Apple Pay information for use within Safari on the Web. For those who still rely on function keys, a press of the physical Fn key in the lower-left corner of the keyboard instantly flips the Touch Bar back to showing classic F1 through F12 function keys. Apple executives Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi made plenty of jokes about people still needing IBM 3270 terminal function keys, but realistically, some people have long relied on the function keys as universal shortcut keys. OK, maybe it’s just me, but several decades ago, I determined that I would be more productive if I could always invoke my preferred writing tool with F1, my default Web browser with F2, my email app with F3, my file transfer app with F4, and so on. If I end up buying one of these Touch Bar-enabled Macs, I’ll have to see how I end up using it. What about the Esc key, the apparent absence of which has prompted all sorts of reactions from Apple observers? Apple reserves the left end of the bar for a “system button” that is either the Esc key or some other system-provided button, depending on the context. So, in the rare event that you need to force-quit an application, Command-Option-Esc is still an option. In fact, Apple’s developer guidelines say that the Touch Bar has three regions: the system button area, a central app region where app-specific controls go, and a control-strip spot to the right where users can manage system level tasks like adjusting the volume or brightness — this is where the dedicated Siri button lives. Users can completely hide the control-strip region in order to display more app-specific controls, and they can also choose to hide the app region. On the one hand, the Touch Bar is a fascinating innovation on Apple’s part. It could revolutionize how Mac users, particularly professionals who manipulate the interfaces and controllers for their apps like musical instruments, interact with virtual software worlds. On the other hand, Apple needs to go all in with the Touch Bar if it’s to become a core part of the Mac experience. Right now, it’s available only on the new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros. Nor did the company even hint about a new Magic Keyboard for desktop Macs. I suspect developers will support the Touch Bar right away just because it’s cool and new, but if Apple doesn’t make it universal across the product line, support will wane over time. Plus, regardless of how much better these new MacBook Pros are than the models they replace, many new buyers won’t consider them because of the inherent tradeoffs in working on a laptop versus a desktop, such as reduced performance, worse ergonomics when used at a desk, and higher cost for an equivalently powerful setup. In SlackBITS, where we were kibitzing with TidBITS readers during the presentation, we were pondering whether the Touch Bar is better or worse than a fully touch-sensitive screen, such as is available on many Windows laptops and Chromebooks. And if the Touch Bar’s location on the keyboard is better for ergonomic and user interface reasons, what does that say about iOS, which is all about touch-based direct manipulation of the interface? Might iOS 11 offer apps the option of including a virtual Touch Bar at the bottom of the screen as a consistent interface element, or even replace the Home button with a Touch Bar? In any case, the idea of a separate multi-touch display dedicated to input and control in addition to the main computer display is powerful, and it will be interesting to see how its use evolves over time. Size and Weight -- Back at the basics, the new MacBook Pros boast some impressive numbers. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is significantly smaller and lighter than the previous model: Height: 0.59 inch (1.49 cm), down from 0.71 inch (1.8 cm) Width: 11.97 inches (30.41 cm), down from 12.35 inches (31.37 cm) Depth: 8.36 inches (21.24 cm), down from 8.62 inches (21.89 cm) Weight: 3.02 pounds (1.37 kg), down from 3.48 pounds (1.58 kg) In comparison with the 13-inch MacBook Air, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is thinner (at the MacBook Air’s thick edge), narrower, and less deep — and it weighs just 0.06 pounds (27 g) more. The 12-inch MacBook is still smaller and nearly a pound lighter, but it has a smaller screen and an anemic CPU. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro sees similar drops in size and weight from the previous model: Height: 0.61 inch (1.55 cm), down from 0.71 inch (1.8 cm) Width: 13.75 inches (34.93 cm), down from 14.13 inches (35.89 cm) Depth: 9.48 inches (24.07 cm), down from 9.73 inches (24.71 cm) Weight: 4.02 pounds (1.83 kg), down from 4.46 pounds (2.02 kg) Functional Specs -- One aspect of the new MacBook Pros will likely jump out at you when you see it: a Force Touch trackpad that’s twice as large as the trackpad on the previous models. In fact, as Phil Schiller noted, the Force Touch technology, which simulates the feel of clicking via a Taptic Engine, is the only reason Apple could create such a large trackpad. It would be impossible to make a mechanical system that worked consistently across such a large surface. The additional size should be better for multi-touch gestures. Both models feature improved screens as well. The resolutions remain the same — 2560 by 1600 for the 13-inch model and 2880 by 1800 for the 15-inch — but Apple claims the displays are 67 percent brighter, have a 67 percent higher contrast ratio, and show 25 percent more colors thanks to support for the P3 wide color gamut. Apple has apparently learned its lesson from the 12-inch MacBook, which garnered significant criticism for having only a single USB-C port for charging and expansion (see “The 12-inch MacBook: A Different Mac for a Particular User,” 29 April 2015). The new Touch Bar MacBook Pros go in the other direction with four Thunderbolt 3 ports, two on each side, any of which can be used for charging and expansion. And no, the MacBook Pro won’t charge faster if you plug in two chargers; it just picks one. Thunderbolt 3, which provides throughput up to 40 Gbps, uses the same connector as USB-C and supports DisplayPort (and thus HDMI and VGA, plus Thunderbolt 2, via adapters) and USB 3.1 Gen 2, which runs at 10 Gbps and is backward compatible with older USB devices. We’re planning to write more about Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C soon, but for the moment, consider the fact that these new machines can drive two 5K displays or four 4K displays. That’s impressive. At this point, I need to acknowledge that Apple actually introduced two versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. So far I’ve been talking about the high-end one, but for $300 less, you can get a model that lacks the Touch Bar, reverting to traditional function keys, and sports only two Thunderbolt ports on one side. Plus, it comes with slower processor options and a less-capable graphics processor. So, regarding processors, graphics, memory, and storage, here’s how the base models stack up. Apple is being quite confusing with the Touch Bar models, offering two configurations of each, with the cheaper version lacking certain options. For instance, the $1799 model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro doesn’t let you increase storage, whereas the $1999 model includes more storage and lets you choose more yet. On the 15-inch side, the $2399 model has a slightly slower CPU, less storage by default, and a less-capable graphics processor than the $2799 model, and Apple charges more for upgrades for this model. So shop carefully! 13-inch MacBook Pro (no Touch Bar) for $1499 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, configurable to a 2.4 GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 (+$300) Intel Iris Graphics 540 8 GB of RAM, upgradeable to 16 GB (+$200) 256 GB SSD, configurable to 512 GB (+$200) or 1 TB (+$600) 13-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar) for $1799 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, configurable to a 3.1 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (+$200) or 3.3 GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 (+$300) Intel Iris Graphics 550 8 GB of RAM, upgradeable to 16 GB (+$200) 256 GB SSD, configurable to 512 GB (+$200) or 1 TB (+$600) 15-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar) for $2399 2.6/2.7 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, configurable to a 2.9 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (+$300/+$200) Radeon Pro 450/455 with 2GB memory, upgradeable to Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB memory (+$200/+100) 16 GB of RAM 256 GB SSD, configurable to 512 GB (+$200), 1 TB (+$600), or 2 TB (+$1400) It can be hard to know how all the new components will affect real-world performance since Apple improved the speed of multiple subsystems. It’s safe to say that these are the fastest Mac laptops ever; what remains to be seen is how they compare to Apple’s desktop models. Phil Schiller did say that Apple limited the maximum RAM to 16 GB to avoid using too much power. In terms of wireless networking, 802.11ac Wi-Fi is standard across all models, as is Bluetooth 4.2. And despite Apple’s “courage” in dropping the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, the new MacBook Pros keep the 3.5mm jack and provide stereo speakers, three built-in microphones, and a 720p FaceTime HD camera. That’s one more mic than the previous models, and a jump from Bluetooth 4.0, but those changes aren’t major. Battery life should also be similar, although Apple rates the new 13-inch MacBook Pro at only 10 hours of iTunes movie playback, down from 12 in the previous model. That’s likely due to significantly smaller batteries; the old 13-inch model featured a 74.9-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery, whereas the non-Touch Bar model has a 54.5-watt-hour battery, and the Touch Bar model’s is slightly smaller yet, at 49.2-watt-hours. Similarly, the 15-inch drops from a 95-watt-hour battery to a 76-watt-hour battery. The new 13-inch models come with a 61-watt USB-C power adapter, whereas the 15-inch model includes an 87-watt USB-C power adapter. No more MagSafe, sorry! Finally, here’s an additional odd fact that came to light after the announcement. The new MacBook Pro models don’t play a startup sound by default, perhaps because they auto-boot when opened after being powered down. Happily, you can re-enable the startup sound and change the auto-boot behavior with simple Terminal commands. The Massively Confusing MacBook Lineup -- Remember the era of the Mac matrix, with a desktop and a laptop each for consumers and professionals? Those simple days of yesteryear are long gone, and it’s now impossible to keep track of Apple’s laptop line without a scorecard. That’s in part because the previous MacBook Pro models remain available, as do the 12-inch MacBook and the 13-inch MacBook Air. Apple did at least drop the 11-inch MacBook Air and the 2012 13-inch MacBook Pro that featured a SuperDrive but not a Retina display. That leaves us with the following list of laptops, sorted by increasing base cost: 13-inch MacBook Air (Early 2015): $999 12-inch MacBook (Retina, Early 2016): $1299 13-inch MacBook Pro (Retina, Early 2015): $1299 13-inch MacBook Pro (Retina, Late 2016): $1499 13-inch MacBook Pro (Touch Bar, Late 2016): $1799 15-inch MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2015): $1999 15-inch MacBook Pro (Touch Bar, Late 2016): $2399 The problem is that size, weight, performance, display quality, available upgrades, and other features see-saw across that list, creating a dizzying array of options for those who aren’t willing to just ante up to get one of the new MacBook Pro models. That’s the easy decision — these new models are the best at everything, and only a little larger and heavier than the underpowered 12-inch MacBook. It’s hard to recommend any of the older models for any reason other than price, and even there it’s difficult since Apple didn’t drop their prices after announcing the new models. Apple doesn’t compete on price, but it’s embarrassing to try to explain to someone why a nearly two-year-old 13-inch MacBook Pro still costs $1299. Ordering -- Both of the new MacBook Pro models are available in your choice of silver or space gray, the latter of which was previously an option only for the 12-inch MacBook. Those who are desperate for some MacBook Pro bling in gold or rose gold will be disappointed. You can order all of the new MacBook Pros immediately, but Apple said the Touch Bar-equipped models wouldn’t ship for 2 weeks, and by the time we ordered ours the next day, the shipping time had expanded to 4–5 weeks. We’re looking forward to getting some personal experience with these new MacBook Pros, since the Touch Bar may feature heavily in the kind of documentation we write for TidBITS and Take Control. Plus, several TidBITS staffers have been waiting patiently for years for Apple to update its laptop line — it’s about time!   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Where is an updated Mac Pro? It was NOT a "Mac" event, rather it was a "MacBook Pro" Event. BTW, when will the new iPads be released? I'd like to replace my old iPad Mini. Reply Shameer Mulji  2016-10-28 00:13 Goes to show, you need to stop listening to all the "experts" & "pundits" and rumors. That is not Apple's fault. Reply Brian S   2016-11-01 01:22 Agreed a disappointment. How many folks watching/attending really needed a review of the new iPhone 7 after it was just covered thoroughly in the event a couple of week prior? Also, I don't really think they convinced professionals that this machine is sufficient by just adding a monitor ( or two ). 16 GB Ram? Most pros needing workstation computing consider 64 GB dead minimum and 128 GB+ is their target. The absence of Mac Pro info ( iMac is clearly waiting on Kaby Lake ) combined with the MacBook Pro presentation sent a clear message to these professionals. Not clear to me if Apple wants to improve its Mac sales. Do they really think Pros will buy a Mac Pro at full price for over three-year old tech? Of more concern to me were Tim Cook's dodged responses on the earnings conference call a few days before the dog and pony show. Apple needs a leader with vision. Reply Gobit  2016-10-27 21:13 Touch Bar is an incremental upgrade, as were the other MacBook changes and not worth holding an “Event” for. 16GB max RAM? Really? So yes, MacBook; not MacBook Pro. Have been looking to replace my 2009 iMac for two years now. Still no compelling replacement announced. Still no iMac roadmap. Today makes Microsoft Surface Studio now worthy of serious consideration, and if I go that way then the iPhone and iPad will also be ditched because they don’t fit that ecosystem. Sad thought after 20 years of Apple. In light of today’s non event, Steve Blank’s article “why-tim-cook-is-steve-ballmer” prompts some serious thinking To quote a mate “ I think today marks the official real indication that Apple is stumbling”. Reply Anonymous  2016-10-28 01:28 From the comments sections on other tech sites, a lot of people seem unimpressed with the specs of the new higher-end MBPs. Apparently there are two or three higher-specced Radeons beyond the 455 or optional 460 models, Apple uses slower DD3 RAM instead of much higher bandwidth DD4 RAM, and there is a lot of teeth gnashing about the 16Gb RAM limit. (Heck, my 2012 Mac mini can be stuffed with 32Gb RAM.) Apple seems to be using the new Touch Bar as cover for lower specs on its high-end laptop in order to hit higher margins. That said, I think that the new MBPs are a well-thought-out answer to the question of touch input on modern Macs. The Touch Bar underscores Apple's decision not to graft touchscreens onto the Mac OS, but offers a rational advancement to the outdated numbered function keys that most people don't use. I used to use Fkeys constantly, but god help me if I went away for a few days and had to reacquaint myself with my QuicKeys programming. When I got my Mac Plus in 1986 it was hard to get used to a lack of Fkeys on the keyboard (Steve Jobs thinking way ahead), but then it was also hard to get used to the horrible touch of that springy, clunky keyboard as well. Although I agree with Adam that Apple needs to bring the Touch Bar into more Macs or risk losing developer interest, none of Apple's keyboards have the feel that I need as a touch typist. But I do think that TouchID is something that Apple desperately needs to seed into all its laptops as well as its desktops and I'd seriously consider an Apple keyboard if it had TouchID that could integrate with 1Password. It is remarkable to me is that Apple seems uninterested in upgrading the Mac Pro, when it could so easily be updated with new processors, Thunderbolt ports and graphics cards. As for the iMac, it seems safe to assume that Apple is waiting on Kaby Lake processors and the built-in support for both Thunderbolt and 5K monitors @30Hz. One last thought: if one compares the $350-$400 Intel processor price 'tax' to the *incremental* cost to produce an extra A10 or A11 chip, and if one considers that apps in the Mac App Store can be easily recompiled to ARM-based chips (see http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/09/30/macos-sierra-code-suggests-apple-could-replace-intel-in-macs-with-custom-arm-chips/ ) then it's possible that next year we'll see MAS-only ARM-based Macbooks, and at price-points that both directly compete on price with mid-tier PC laptops while offering typical high margins for Apple. Reply Brian S   2016-11-01 01:42 "...and if one considers that apps in the Mac App Store can be easily recompiled to ARM-based chips". This is not as easy as that article implies. Yes, it's technically possible but there are both software and hardware hurdles that article doesn't address. One A10 processor can't handle intense computing for very long. Adding in multiple processors means developers will have to change code to allow running on multiple cores/processors ( such as GCD ) and this is a difficult process and not every developer will have the skills or time to implement. I'm not saying moving to Axx processors can't be done but high-level cavalier descriptions with a 2017 delivery suggestion is very aggressive to say the least. Also, this all assumes Apple has enough Mac focus to care about it. I hope they do but Apple's Mac deliveries have suggested otherwise. Reply Anonymous  2016-11-03 08:21 "This is not as easy as that article implies." As the iDownblog article notes, "intermediary bit code is submitted which Apple uses to compile the binary code for the specific CPU architecture. Should Apple release an ARM-based Mac, developers wouldn’t need to re-submit their existing code nor would they need to add any ARM-specific code in order for their apps to run natively on ARM-based hardware." "One A10 processor can't handle intense computing for very long." I'm afraid I don't know what that means. If there is evidence that the A10 (not to mention next year's 10-nanometer A11) processor design somehow stops 'intensive' computing 'after a while' I'd like to see it. At present I find it doubtful since, despite not hearing any evidence for it, we see that current iPad Pro processors are significantly faster than those in the oldest Macbooks that can run macOS El Capitan or Sierra, and lack reports of the processors bogging down as suggested. Reply Jerry  2016-10-28 05:39 For students and the less wealthy they only got one very old non-retina computer left for sale - the MBA 13" and not even the old ones they lowered the prices on ... . Mac laptops used to be bargains, but not so now. Many people are in need to upgrade now and they are not willing to buy a 3 year old Mac mini that cannot power even a 4K display @ 60 GHz, nor do they want an old non-retina portable even if functional (nor in an option with 1 TB SSD). Griffin apparently got a MagSafe solution, but would have been nice if Apple made it and would have been nice if Apple gave a hint to what will happen with lower priced options, so people do not think themselves forced to look for non-Mac solutions. Most disappointing with the keynote is that they tailor everything for a teenage audience even though teenagers also would much rather have them speak to them as if they were adults ... . Reply Anonymous  2016-10-28 07:29 I don't think any Mac laptops were ever price bargains, especially in comparison to actual bargain-priced hardware running other OSes. They, of course, tend to be cheap in every way, from fit and finish to installed bloatware. Aside from the original iPad whose pricing shocked its competitors (for a brief while), Apple never liked to offer bargains per se; they always aimed at affordable solutions that were premium-priced and earned them much higher than average profit margins. If someone could afford a $800 bare-bones low-end Macbook (plus peripherals, plus possibly Applecare) a month ago but can't afford one today for $200 more then perhaps his/her priority shouldn't be a new Mac. Reply Scott Randell  2016-10-28 12:52 Adam, actually the 2015 13 inch MBP that they are still selling, is a better buy than the new one with no touch bar. It has a faster processor, and its $200.0 less. Also if you look around, you can get it (new) for even less than that. Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-28 15:59 As soon as you bring up it up to comparable storage (256GB), the price is the same. I don't know that it will actually be faster, since although the clock speed of its CPU is higher, it's an older generation chip, and the graphics subsystem and storage will likely be slower. Nothing wrong with it, but at the same price, it doesn't feel like a big win. If it was a bunch cheaper, sure, so if you can find a deal, that would make it more attractive. Reply Randy Stokes  2016-10-28 13:30 I currently use a 13" MacBook Air, and connect to a Thunderbolt hub which, among other things, allows me to connect to USB hard drives and an external monitor. Will that hub still work? Will I need an adapter from USB-C to the Thunderbolt/DisplayPort cable? Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-28 16:00 My impression is that the hub will still work, but you'll need a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from Apple (about $50). But it might be worth confirming that with the hub manufacturer in case there's some other issue. Reply James Wilson  2016-10-31 08:31 In spite of the disappointing refresh, I am obliged to update my MBP to one of the new 15" models. I am unclear as to which of the models may be best for my use which revolves around Filemaker, Excel and GIS. Is a higher spec graphics options (455 / 460) likely to make a difference to my GIS work? or are they really only of benefit to applications requiring 3D rendering? I dont really want to dig deep for a max spec model when in reality I could get similar performance from a lower level item. Storage capacity is not an issue and the machine would be used with an external monitor 4K or less. Grateful for any advice. Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-31 09:08 It's impossible to know until they come out and can be benchmarked, but my impression is that there isn't much difference between the CPUs. I don't know what software you use for GIS, but my impression is that the faster GPUs are mostly helpful for gaming and video work. The main thing I recommend is 16 GB of RAM. Reply James Wilson  2016-10-31 16:44 Thanks Adam. I mostly use the open source package QGis - it's pretty versatile and has a lot of online support / supporters. 16GB ram is definitely necessary and if more had been available then this would probably be the way to go. In the meantime I eagerly await some real world tests. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2016-11-01 18:13 Unless you can find information about QGIS explicitly adding GPU acceleration features (when run on macOS), using the graphics card to perform calculations it's good at instead of the CPU, I think any Mac's video will be equally good, including the non-discrete Intel graphics. All the new 15-inch MBPs come with 16GB RAM, no more, no less. Since you're using it with external monitor, you might go with a 13-inch MBP. Is QGIS good at taking advantage of multiple cores? If not, the 13-inch with a processor upgrade to the 3.3GHz dual-core Core i7 could perform better than the maxed out 15-inch for less money. A 13-inch with 3.3GHz dual-core Core i7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, and Intel Iris Graphics 550 is $2,149. The base 15-inch with 2.6GHz quad-core Core i7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, and Radeon Pro 450 w/ 2GB VRAM is $2,249. If your version (and use) of QGIS supports the multithreaded rendering described in this article, a quad-core would be good: http://blog.sourcepole.com/2013/11/26/multithreaded-rendering-with-qgis-enterprise/ Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

In a court in May, Ryan Collins, a 36-year-old from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to federal hacking charges and admitted to a two-year phishing scam to gain passwords of more than 100 people, including actors Jennifer Lawrence and Aubrey Plaza and singers Rihanna and Avril Lavigne. Feminists rally round Emma Watson after nude photos threats online Read more Collins tricked celebrities into handing him their usernames and passwords by sending his targets fake emails that appeared to be from Apple and Google, Pennsylvania US attorney Bruce Brandler said in a statement. Collins then stole personal information, including nude photos, from his targets, most of whom work in the entertainment industry. “In some cases,” Brandler’s office said, “Collins would use a software program to download the entire contents of the victims’ Apple iCloud backups. In addition, Collins ran a modeling scam in which he tricked his victims into sending him nude photographs.” Investigators found that Collins had gained access to at least 50 Apple iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts, many of which belonged to famous women. In August 2014 images of more than 100 actors, singers and other well known women were posted online, which were variously confirmed and condemned by some of the celebrities and called fakes by others. Several quickly criticized Apple for failing to secure private information on its iCloud services, and the company said that it had suffered “a very targeted attack on usernames, passwords and security cases”. “None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems,” the company said that fall. On Thursday the US attorney noted, however, that FBI investigators did not uncover evidence linking him to the actual release of private information or photos “or that Collins shared or uploaded the information he obtained”. He was originally charged in Los Angeles but the case was transferred closer to his home in Pennsylvania, where a judge sentenced him on Wednesday. He had faced up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine. FBI investigators have traced similar hacking attacks on celebrities to two other men, one in Chicago and one in Oregon. Each pleaded guilty earlier this year, and investigators have said the three cases are unrelated.

This is essentially a versatile OLED bar at the top of your keyboard that replaces the function keys with software-based buttons that change based on what app you’re in and what you’re doing. In this post, we’ll mention 20 awesome things you can do with the Touch Bar on your new MacBook Pro. 20 things you can do with the Touch Bar 1. Type more productively Apple has brought the predictive keyboard, also known as QuickType, from iOS to the Mac with the Touch Bar. Now, whenever you’re typing, such as when composing an email, the Touch Bar learns how you speak and predicts what you should say next so you can tap on the words as they appear rather than spelling them out manually with your keyboard. 2. Accept or decline calls Whenever you receive an incoming call, whether it’s via FaceTime or through a nearby iPhone relaying a phone call to your Mac, your Touch Bar will automatically turn into a response pad so you can accept or decline the phone call without clicking on anything. 3. Perform email actions If you’re looking at your email inbox in the Mail app, you’re going to find all kinds of useful functions right on the Touch Bar. Among those, you’ll find quick compose, quick reply, flagging, and even “Move to…” buttons for navigating your email efficiently without clicking on a single thing. 4. Manage your filesystem The Touch Bar becomes useful when you’re in Finder and are in the middle of looking at any of your files and folders. It comes with features like Quick Look, tagging, sharing, and much more, which makes it a breeze to organize your stuff, get a look at what’s on your machine, and send files to others. 5. Use your function keys Apple’s idea with the Touch Bar was to replace those function keys that are hardly used anymore on modern computers (Macs especially). Despite the function keys being replaced, you can still press and hold on the Function (fn) key at the bottom right of your keyboard and the Touch Bar will transform into a virtual function key row (f1 through f12)  until you release the Function key. 6. Customize the action buttons Just like any navigation bar throughout the apps in macOS, you can customize the buttons that appear on your Touch Bar. This is done by opening the editing interface and dragging new buttons into the Touch Bar from the canvas. One of my personal favorites is the screenshot button, which lets you snap a screenshot with a tap rather than pressing a myriad of keys. There will also be other shortcuts, like a Do Not Disturb toggle, among other things. 7. Invoke Siri Always at the ready on the right side of your Touch Bar is a button for launching Siri. By tapping on it, you’ll bring up the voice assistant, and this is going to let you query your Mac with any questions you might have and receive witty responses. You can also use Siri on your Mac to perform intelligent filesystem searches and to launch apps. 8. Access your Mac’s operational keys Since the Touch Bar replaces the functional row of your Mac’s keyboard, you will now start to see two virtual buttons that let you modify your display brightness and speaker volume, as well as other operational features, like Mission Control and Launchpad. When you tap on either of the buttons, all you have to do is utilize swipe gestures in the direction you want the level to move. Simple enough. 9. Format your text If you’re using a supported app that handles any form of text editing, such as Mail, Microsoft Word, TextEdit, etc., then you’ll also be able to use your Touch Bar to format your text. Basic formatting options like the ability to bold, italicize, underscore, and more are going to be included. After you select some text, you can tap on the button from the Touch Bar that translates to the visual effect you want, and it will be applied. 10. Pan through video While watching any kind of video in full-screen, the Touch Bar is going to become a real time video scrubber for apps like Final Cut Pro X, QuickTime, and more. You’ll be able to tap and drag throughout the scrubber and see a real-time representation of your movements on your Mac’s display. The MacBook Pro’s powerful new graphics allow the panning to be super fluid, so you won’t notice any jittering. 11. Send Emojis In certain apps like Mail and Messages, the Touch Bar also acts as a hub for accessing for favorite Emojis. When you tap on one, it’ll suggest even more that are similar to the one you’ve already tapped on. You can scroll left and right through them and tap on them to input them into any text field you’re working in. It’s even smart enough to keep a history of your frequently-used ones so you always have access to them. 12. Browse the web When you’re browsing the web in Safari, and you open a new tab, the Touch Bar loads up your favorite pages automatically like magic. When you’re ready to fire up one of your favorite websites, all you have to do is tap on it from the Touch Bar to launch it. After a page loads, it becomes a navigation bar with a URL field, back and forward buttons, and even a new tab button. 13. Control your music Whenever you’re listening to audio on your Mac, the Touch Bar becomes an off-screen media controller. Complete with forward/back and play/pause buttons, which were already present in the function row on the basic keyboard, the Touch Bar-based music controller lets you command your music without ever having to open a window on your Mac to access the controls. 14. Pick the best color for your art If you’re in a creativity app that supports a color picker, such as Keynote or Photoshop, the Touch Bar is going to provide you with a color picker so you can more easily choose the color you want to use. The new method of tapping and dragging to the color you want is so much more fluid than clicking on a color option box and then clicking the color you want. 15. Edit your photos If you’re using Photos, or another Touch Bar-enabled photography app on your Mac, then you will be able to use your Touch Bar to edit photos as well. Depending on what you’re doing, you can use your Touch Bar for rotating, cropping, filtering, auto adjustment and more. These kinds of features will be built into Photoshop before the end of the year, but some will also be available in Apple’s Photos app. 16. Write code Developers who will be picking up Apple’s new MacBook Pro can use the Touch Bar to enter commonly-used coding keywords in coding languages like Swift, so long as they’re editing code in supported apps like Xcode. For some, this will be a time saver, especially if you’re using the same keywords over and over again, which happens a lot in the programming world. 17. Pan through your calendar events When you’re using the Calendar app to keep track of everything that’s important to you, the Touch Bar is going to let you scroll through all the weeks of each month in your calendar so you can quickly get a grasp of all your past and upcoming events. 18. Control your Mac’s CLI Not everyone uses Terminal, but it’s a huge part of a lot of Mac power-users’ lives. The Touch Bar is capable of working with the command line interface by letting you move up and down through lines of command input and output. 19. DJ your favorite jam Algoriddim is making just one of the third-party apps that will support the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar in time, and some of the things you can do with their djay app is mess around with scratching noises, sound effects, and transition yourself from one track to another as you DJ a mix for a party or for other entertainment purposes. 20. Edit videos Apple is introducing a new update for its Final Cut Pro X app and you’ll be able to use Touch Bar for a wide variety of video editing situations. Among those, you can trim audio and video clips, adjust the volume of your audio clips, interact with your video timeline, and much more. The actions change depending on what you’re actually doing in the app, so the number of things you can do with Touch Bar while editing video is seemingly endless. A good function key replacement? I think it goes without saying that the Touch Bar is an amazing replacement for the hardware function keys that have been on the Mac since the beginning. Not only does it provide basic function key functionality out of the box, but it goes even further by providing versatile shortcuts in real time for whatever you might be doing on your Mac. Thanks to the APIs available for Touch Bar, even third-party apps can be programmed by their developers to take full advantage of it. Many apps with Touch Bar support are already under way and will be released before the end of this year. Are you excited for the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro? Tell us why in the comments below!

Just kidding. Seriously Apple? A “touch bar” is the best you can do? How about that 5-years old technology called a touch screen which you still haven’t managed to implement in your MacBooks? So excited about that Surface Book introduced yesterday. Way better than this outdated technology. People want some innovation – like a keyboard you can detach and use the laptop as a tablet, one that doesn’t feel crippled by an operating system that’s running on my phone. czbird Yeah. We don’t know what to do with Fn keys, so we better remove them completely. Woot? chjode Touch screens are five years old? Agneev Mukherjee of course not, they’ve been existing way before then. It seems this guy knows way too much. Phil Randle Okay, firstly if Apple wanted to add a touch screen to a MacBook they could, they have the some of best multitouch technology on the market, they could easily integrate it into a MacBook. The reason they haven’t is they don’t work, and the demand is small because only a small number of people want them. Microsoft average 1-1.5M Surface devices each quarter (inc there Surface Pro Tablets) about 30% of these are the Surface Book. So comparatively if you look at the 4.5M Mac’s sold every quarter or the 10M+ iPad’s it clear that if consumers wanted converged touch screen laptops then these figures would be closer aligned. Daniel Tiecher While having a touch screen is indeed nice sometimes, I actually feel I’ll prefer using the Touch Bar over a touchscreen, if I have to choose one or the other. I’ve used a Surface Book for more than a month and felt that being able to touch the screen was great, but during daily usage it got tiring and made me loose my focus even more than using a mouse or trackpad (I like to use the keyboard as much as possible). For someone like me, I feel it would be better to have the Touch Bar, since my hands need to move less, not to mention the fact something like this on a new Magic Keyboard would be great for desktop usage as with desktop monitors, the screen is even farther away, making a touchscreen an even less desirable way of interacting with the interface. All-in-all, different choices for different people, if I could I’d love to have both but right now I feel Apple’s offer suits my needs better. Let’s see if the touch bar lives up to my expectations when I finally try it. iBanks What exactly is innovative about an keyboard that can detach and use the laptop as an tablet? That touch bar will be something serious in which others will surely try to implement. siddique if they make touch screen make its like to kill iPad sell ..they will never do it Liam Mulcahy Wrong. apple has used touchscreen tech since 2007 Icisz So making a tablet hybrid 10 different ways is innovative? Perhaps. I like what Microsoft is doing in certain areas but deciding some pathways and product categories would go a long way to making me believe in thier abilities to follow through. Outdated technology? Lmao, ahhh an observation only a youngin could make. How many horrible Mobile Os did Microsoft fail at before they realized the only way to have a competitive mobile user base was to merge their mess of operating systems into one unified system, and to support other more successful mobile platforms. Clearly it works for you but for me, I find it quite crippling. Granted a studio touch screen iMac might be an interesting offering without question for the creative sector, but if MacBook ever becomes a touchscreen based interface or a take me apart abortion, sorry son. Not for me. After decades of stagnant innovation at MS at least they are finally getting a nice fanboy base. I just hope they can continue the trend because for now, their replica retail stores are a long way from being packed. ProllyWild This is a very nice concept and a lead-in to later technologies that might have keyboards completely in this format. This is not enough to make me wanna buy a new macbook, but i do look forward to a standalone keyboard for imacs and mac pro. I dont expect a touchscreen macbook until an OS is adequately designed for desktop function and based around touch. The new surface device that’s coming out is likely a small step in that direction, but you cannot just slap touch onto a basic desktop OS and call it a success. There needs to be a logical reason and flow to justify that. Hell and who cares? the real winner in these new models is the thunderbolt 3 integration. Brandon I can accept everything they implemented in the new macbook line up. Except for, no usb 3 port, no magsafe, no more apple logo glowing, no hdmi, no sd card. They just force me to get a converter… James Jennett-Wheeler Thunderbolt 3 is a USB-C port (which supports USB 3.1)… so it has 4 USB 3 ports technically haha. Still need an adaptor for USB-A. I don’t think the intention is to force you to buy adaptors, rather it’s about supporting the future of tech (which always has a side effect of making older tech obsolete – which is why adaptors are created). I truly believe that USB-C paves the way for wired future. I hope it lasts as long as USB-A and that it becomes more widespread (negating the need for adaptors). thunderqus “I don’t think the intention is to force you to buy adaptors” – thats exactly what their intention is, money eaters, future doesnt mean abandon everything and hit a dead wall, rather provide new and old ports together for continuity & not force us to buy adaptors, Apple is forcing it , where as it can be done in more friendly manner. Roomuch Just one word for this – needless. Kernel Kosmos Anyone can explain to me what’s going to happen if I want to control my multimedia when typing? With old MacBook, you just press the physical key to play/stop/forward/volume up/down. Now with TouchBar, I would only see the typing shortcuts on the TouchBar right? I won’t get access to the multimedia shortcut WHILE typing. Anyone already hands-on can verify it?

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Hands-on: the MacBook Pro’s innovative Touch Bar will grab you Susie Ochs 28 October, 2016 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News It’s thinner, lighter, and smaller all around, but the new MacBook Pro makes a big impression. The trackpad on the 15in version is downright ridiculous – twice as large as the trackpad on the previous generation – but I didn’t look down and say, “Holy cow, that is a seriously huge trackpad,” until I’d been using it for a couple of minutes.   Because it’s really all about that gorgeous Touch Bar. Apple doesn’t do touchscreen Macs, but the Touch Bar adds a strip of ultra-handy iOS-style contextual controls right where you need them, and the rest of the MacBook Pro got great updates too. After my limited hands-on time, I think it’s got the right mix of power, portability and ports to satisfy users of previous MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models. Let’s dive right into my first impressions – we’ll follow up with a full review later. Touch Bar The Touch Bar, which replaces the row of Fn keys on top of the MacBook Pro’s keyboard, enables new functionality like Touch ID to unlock the Mac and make Apple Pay purchases in Safari without needing to authenticate with an iPhone or Apple Watch. It’s made of smooth glass, so it feels great under your fingers, just like the trackpad itself. The Touch Bar supports multi-touch, in case you need to tap or slide on more than one control at once. This would come in handy in some apps, like djay Pro, but since the bar isn’t really tall enough for common multi-finger gestures like pinch-to-zoom, I was content to poke at it one finger at a time. I love how you can customise the Touch Bar’s default controls. Just pick View > Customize Touch Bar from the Finder menu, and you get a full suite of buttons you can drag right down to the Touch Bar. The options are similar to what you see when customising the toolbar in your Finder windows. But the coolest part of the Touch Bar is how quickly it changes as you switch apps. I used it for scrolling through a full-screen album in Photos, as well as for scrubbing through the timeline in Final Cut Pro. Both were fast and responsive. However, when I opened a new Mail message and started typing, the QuickType suggestions shown in the Touch Bar lagged behind my fingers. I had to consciously slow down to be able to see the predictions and select them from the Touch Bar, so it was faster to just type the entire word with my fingers. Happily, pulling up the scrolling emoji menu in Messages and choosing an emoji from the Touch Bar is a million times faster than pressing Command-Control-Space and using the Characters menu, like I have to do on my MacBook Air today. The other killer Touch Bar feature may be predictive suggestions in Mail. When you’re looking at a list of messages in your Inbox, you’ll see a button on the Touch Bar that says ‘Move to Vacations’ or the name of another folder the app thinks is suitable. Mail seems to be guessing based on context, such as the sender and content of the message, and I can’t wait to see how well it does with the volume of email I get every day. The new keyboard The new MacBook Pro models have a low-travel keyboard similar to the 12in MacBook, but Apple says it uses a second-generation butterfly mechanism to give the keys a better feel. They don’t seem to travel physically further, but it’s possible Apple did increase the travel distance slightly. My guess is that it’s augmenting the physical sensation of pressing a key with a little bit of haptic feedback – I’ll let you know if I can get Apple to comment. The keys feel about the same to me as on the MacBook. They don’t wiggle back and forth if you happen to strike one off-centre, and they make a deep clicking sound when you pound on them. But when I switched back to my trusty 2013 MacBook Air to write this hands-on, my fingers immediately preferred the bouncier mechanism of Apple’s old laptop keys. I’ve never had trouble with the MacBook keyboard, and I’m sure I’ll get used to this one too, but I do like the old kind better. Ports on both sides If you were worried Apple would ditch the headphone jack on the MacBook Pro, you can exhale now. (After all, Apple did ask its customers a while back if they were using it!) Every MacBook Pro model has a headphone jack on the right-hand edge. You also get four Thunderbolt 3 ports on the 13in and 15in models (only two on the lower-end 13in MacBook Pro with Function Keys, but we’re discussing the Touch Bar models here). Apple put two on each side, and it’s kind of cool how all the ports can charge the laptop or connect to Thunderbolt, DisplayPort 1.2 and USB-C devices. I’m used to having dedicated ports for each IO method, so the flexibility is appreciated, and it’s a relief Apple went with four instead of, say, two. You’ll still need adapters for some things, like peripherals that use USB-A or Thunderbolt 2 ports, or an SD card reader, since that slot is gone. But having multiple ports may let you avoid picking up one of the USB-C docks that MacBook owners need if they want to connect more than one device at a time. Only first impressions The beautiful Retina screen is unchanged from previous generations, and with the new Mac lineup, every notebook Apple sells is now Retina. In our full review, we’ll dive more deeply into the performance of the updated processors and GPU, as well as Apple’s promised 10-hour battery life. But from what I’ve seen so far, the updated MacBook Pro is going to be worth the wait.

On Thursday, Qualcomm said it would acquire chipmaker NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: October 27, 2016 at 2:59 pm | UPDATED: October 28, 2016 at 4:39 am Top of the Order: Calling in the Chips: What’s $39 billion between soon-to-be very good friends? Well, it’s actually enough to become much more than friends. As if we all didn’t have enough to wake up to Thursday (more on that later), communications semiconductor giant Qualcomm said it will pay $39 billion to acquire Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors. It’s one of the biggest acquisitions ever in the tech sector, surpassing the $37 billion Avago paid last year to acquire Broadcom. So what makes NXP such a Dutch treat? It’s all under the hood. Or in the dashboard. Wherever it is, it’s somewhere in the car console system. NXP is the top maker of automotive chips, and with more and more chipmakers looking to get into the market for driver-assisted and self-driving technology, the chance to expand its product line became too much for Qualcomm to pass up. The majority of Qualcomm’s earnings come from licensing its technologies to mobile phone makers. In addition to its place in the automotive-chip market, NXP also makes semiconductors used in near-field communications, a technology that allows smartphones to make mobile payments via services such as Apple Pay. And speaking of Apple … Middle Innings: All About the Touch: One could almost be faulted if they forgot that Apple still makes computers. The company sold 4.8 million Macs in its most-recent quarter, which is nothing to sneeze at. That is, until you realize that those sales were down by 14 percent from a year ago. Which may be why Apple wants to spur more enthusiasm for its Mac business. And with Christmas coming up, the company chose Thursday to show off the latest updates to its line of MacBook Pro laptops. One of the main new features of the new MacBooks is what Apple calls the Touch Bar, which is capable of showing different keys and functions based on what kinds of programs a person is using. The new laptops also come with hefty price tags, which start at $1,500. Tweet Early, Tweet Often: Earlier this week, Twitter said it would move its third-quarter earnings report from after Thursday’s stock market close to before the stock market opened. This led many Twitter watchers to wonder what was going on with Twitter, as a company changing its earnings-release day or time doesn’t usually mean good news is at hand. Well, at 4 a.m. Pacific, Twitter told us all what was up. The main items are that the company will lay off 9 percent of its workforce, or about 350 employees, and shut down its Vine video-sharing app. The Merc’s Queenie Wong set her alarm for early Thursday to get all the nuts and bolts of what’s going on with Twitter’s business today. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Thursday … Movin’ on Up: Gains came from Shutterfly, ServiceNow, VMware, SolarCity and FormFactor. In the Red: Decliners included Infinera, Oclaro, NeoPhotonics, NetGear and Finisar. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.7 percent to 5,215.97. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.2 percent to end the day at 18,169.68. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shed 0.3 percent to close at 2,133.04. Quote of the Day: “Alexa may be Amazon’s most loved invention yet — literally — with over 250,000 marriage proposals from customers and counting.” — Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, in a statement in which Amazon released it third-quarter results. And what made that statement interesting was that it wasn’t apropos of anything else in Amazon’s release at that point. Amazon shares fell by more than 5 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the company’s results. Sign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com.

Got an Apple-branded laptop? The tech giant will give you up to $650 to part ways with it, just as long as you spend that cash on a shiny new Surface Pro 4 or a Surface Book. Microsoft's "trade in and trade up" laptop program is yet another campaign in the company's buyback war against Apple. Microsoft runs a buyback service for businesses that includes lot of different Apple gadgets. If you own an iPad of any shape or size, for instance, that's worth up to $455 towards a Windows tablet. You can also trade in an iPhone 7 Plus for a measly $580 in Microsoft credit. However, the new MacBook campaign is open to any soon-to-be-former Apple user. Image: Microsoft.com It's not a terrible deal, actually. The MacBook Air I'm typing this on is worth $450 in Microsoft credit. That's a little over $1,000 away from being able to buy a Surface Book Pro. So it's not a terrible deal, but it's not an even trade either. What it really is, however, is sassy little PR move for Microsoft to announce this new MacBook trade-in program just a couple hours before Apple revealed its new MacBooks.

Entertainment | 27 Oct 2016 | Print  | Comment (8) Apple’s TV App Seeks to Unify the Apple TV Experience by Josh Centers With the debut of the fourth-generation Apple TV, Apple declared that apps are the future of TV. But the trouble with iOS-style apps on your TV is that you have to dig through them to find the content you want, unless Siri can find it for you. Apple is introducing a new app, simply called TV, that the company hopes will solve this problem. TV on the Apple TV -- The new TV app is due in December 2016 and will bring together content from all the apps you have installed that opt in to Apple’s aggregation plan. About 1600 apps could currently provide content to the TV app, but Netflix has reportedly opted out, and Amazon Prime Video is still nowhere to be seen on the tvOS platform. We expect that Netflix will come around eventually, but it’s hard to imagine Amazon changing its tune at this point. The hub of the TV app is the Watch Now screen, which presents your favorite shows in an Up Next list. The top of that screen lets you pick up shows where you left off and shows new episodes as they become available. Don’t know what to watch? The Watch Now screen offers TV and movie suggestions, based on your preferences and Apple’s curation. The Watch Now screen also lets you browse for TV shows and movies by category. The demo showed some unusual categories like Political Animals — presumably shows and movies with a political focus. The TV app may suggest content provided by an app you haven’t yet installed. In such cases, you can install the app from inside the TV app, after which its content is integrated into the TV app. Apple Design Lead Jen Folse demonstrated this capability by installing the Starz app from inside the TV app and showing how the Starz show “Power” and the Starz exclusive “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” appeared under What to Watch. As is often the case with apps available for both tvOS and iOS, apps installed from the TV app on the Apple TV also appear on iOS devices that use the same Apple ID (if, of course, you have enabled this in your devices’ settings). The TV app also offers a Library screen that brings together all of your iTunes-purchased TV shows and movies, as well as a Store screen that enables you to rent or buy more content. Speaking of iOS, the TV app is also coming to iOS 10, where it will replace the Videos app and provide a consistent user experience. Your content preferences will sync between the two operating systems. The TV app will be a big change for how you use the Apple TV, so much so that the Home button on the Siri Remote will open the TV app instead of going to the Home screen. I presume that you’ll jump to the Home screen the same way you did on the third-generation Apple TV, by pressing and holding the Menu button. Single Sign-On, Sort Of -- Along with the TV app, Apple will finally introduce the Single Sign-On feature it promised for tvOS 10 (see “tvOS 10 Brings Dark Mode and More,” 13 June 2016). That feature gives you a central place to sign in to your TV provider to authenticate multiple content apps, instead of having to connect to each one individually. Unfortunately, per Apple’s own press release, the only two major TV providers that will support Single Sign-On at launch are DirecTV and Dish. If you subscribe to Comcast, Cox, or Time Warner Cable, you’ll still have to activate every app individually for now. Siri to Straddle Operating Systems -- We’ll also see some Siri improvements alongside the TV app. Siri can already show you sports scores and display live content, but Apple is enhancing that capability soon. Folse demonstrated asking Siri about “the Louisville game,” and got back the current score and an option to view the game live. Additionally, you’ll finally be able to search for TV and movie content on your iPhone and iPad. Right now, if you try to use Siri in iOS to search for James Bond movies, it just displays a generic list of random films. It will be nice to finally see these two Siri implementations work the same way for media content. Minecraft Arrives on Apple TV -- In other big Apple TV news, Minecraft is coming to tvOS by the end of the year! Minecraft is one of the largest gaming success stories in recent history, making its creator, Notch, an instant billionaire when Microsoft purchased Minecraft for $2.5 billion. The game combines a fantasy role-playing game with a virtual Lego set, and it has become a sensation with kids of all ages. For more on that, see “FunBITS: A Minecraft Crash Course” (19 September 2014). I’m curious to find out how controllers will work with Minecraft. I don’t see how the game could be playable using the Siri Remote, so it might be one of the first to require a Made for iPhone (MFi) game controller. At first, almost all tvOS game developers had to support the Siri Remote for game control, but that changed with tvOS 10, which lets them instead depend on a custom MFi controller (see “tvOS 10 Brings Dark Mode and More,” 13 June 2016). Better but Still Not Great -- The TV app is a step in the right direction, making Apple TV content easier to find and improving the content viewing experience in both tvOS and iOS. However, without Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, it lacks two key sources of content that leave it crippled, if not completely dead in the water. It was hard not to snort as Apple talked about how TV would provide access to “all your video,” knowing that for many people, Netflix is all they watch. The TV app pushes tvOS closer to competitors like Amazon’s Fire TV and Google’s Android TV, both of which implement a more content-focused approach on their home screens. But that approach has a downside: they often show you what they want you to see (and pay for), not what you necessarily want to watch. Will Apple strike pay-to-play deals for content owners to be featured in the TV app? Maybe they have already. Another annoyance with the Apple TV is its lack of support for 4K resolution content, which Apple touts elsewhere, such as on the iPhone 6s and later and with Final Cut Pro X on the Mac. Right now, if you have a 4K TV, you need to either use its built-in apps or a 4K-capable Blu-ray player, Fire TV, or Roku box to take advantage of 4K content. Even if you don’t have a 4K set, you could still see improvements with 4K streaming. My new Sony TV has made me realize how “noisy” even 1080p streaming content is, resulting in pixelated backgrounds and other ugliness. Even though I don’t always see a huge difference in sharpness with 4K content from Netflix, I do notice its lack of visual artifacts. One final thing to chew on. As my pal Zac Cichy pointed out, the TV app’s icon is identical to the Home button on the Siri Remote. Did Apple intend to ship the TV app with tvOS, and was it always meant to function as the Home screen? Was it held back due to a lack of content deals? Why is Apple introducing the TV app now, and why isn’t Netflix on board? I would love to learn the answers to these questions, but I’m not sure we’ll ever get them. And now I need to get started on the third edition of “Take Control of Apple TV.” Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Take Control of Apple TV Whether you're considering an Apple TV or you already have one, you can fully master Apple's living room device with this ultimate guide by TidBITS managing editor Josh Centers. You'll learn how to set it up and use it to watch movies and TV shows, play music, display photo slideshows, give presentations, and access all manner of apps on the big screen.   TextExpander: Your knowledge at your fingertips.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michel Hedley  2016-10-27 19:43 Everything about Apple TV smacks on US-centric - even this story is a useful example. There's never any thing from Apple about how Apple TV might work (if it does work) in other countries and how it might work with those countries' television and cable services. Simply nothing. I have no idea how Apple TV might work in Australia or Europe let alone China. I suspect we would be paying on par with the US price for Apple TV, but with a much reduce service offering. Given the lack of useful information from Apple, there's no incentive for me to even look at Apple TV particularly as my Samsung TV has a rather satisfactory interface with TV, cable and internet providers. Reply Josh Centers   2016-10-28 14:14 Sadly, Apple's prime focus is on the U.S., as is ours. One of my big laments with the Apple TV book is that it's nearly impossible to know what's available outside the U.S. And Apple struggles with content deals in the U.S., much less in the rest of the world. The content rights landscape is just an enormous mess. Reply Cat  2016-10-28 17:38 Content rights can even be a mess within a single territory such as the States where content can be created by a producer for a network, resold yo another and made into a DVD set by another. Sometimes a series, say Farscape, is produced by someone like The Henson Company in Australia with money from a number of networks that will carry it. Reply Anonymous  2016-10-28 20:07 Netflix has been doing personalized recommendations based on proprietary user data and reporting since the late 90s. They don't need Apple's help giving recommendations or Up Next functionality to customers. Also, given that Apple gets valuable user choice data flowing through the TV app it is unlikely that Netflix would want to share it; indeed, they refuse to share user viewership data with any other businesses. International content deals are far more complex overall. The iTunes Music Store opened in 2003 and it started movie rentals in 2008, yet it wasn't until the end of 2012 that it was able to finally finalize deals so as to launch in Russia, Turkey, India, and South Africa. Reply Grant  2016-10-29 14:49 With the exception of some sporting events, 90% of my TV is on Amazon Prime. It is paid for and has some of the best content. Period. I have two Apple TV boxes. I can think of no reason why I'd ever want or need another one. Certainly not for Netflix. It is available many other ways. They collect dust and I periodically update them. For me, they simply have moved themselves from relevance. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2016-10-31 23:36 Can you use your TV to watch Amazon Prime on a large screen TV? I want to watch "Grand Tour" when it debuts in November but don't want to be limited to my iPad or iMac. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2016-11-01 18:20 There is no Amazon Prime app for the Apple TV. To watch Amazon Prime on a TV via the Apple TV, you must use AirPlay from another device. Since Grant refers to Netflix being available "many other ways," I suspect he uses something other than his Apple TVs to watch Amazon. Reply xandra  2016-11-02 15:36 No NETFLIX?! I'm hoping I misunderstood, and this only referred to its inclusion is the TV App. (I can live without Amazon since it's already included with my blu-ray player and ROKU.) I've always felt the main reason to buy an Apple TV was to view/play my iTunes content - but lack of Netflix would still be a deal breaker.

The feature on the new MacBook Pro that's generating the most buzz is an interface that replaces the traditional row of function keys. Called the Touch Bar, it will "dynamically" adapt to the applications currently in use. The newest version will also contain an updated Retina display, Touch ID, a more responsive keyboard, a larger Force Touch trackpad and an audio system "with double the dynamic range." "The most Powerful MacBook ever," according to Apple, features a sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, increasing the graphics performance up to 2.3 times better than previous generations. It will also have up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple TV Tuned-Up With New TV App Apple Says It Needs More Time Before New Ear Buds Are Ready Global Stocks Hit by Gloom on Wall Street, Lower Oil Prices The design of the MacBook pro has been upgraded as well. It features a new enclosure design and all-metal unibody construction that "creates an incredibly rigid and dense notebook" that is still thin and light, according to Apple. The 13-inch laptop weighs in at three pounds and is 17 percent thinner with 23 percent less volume. The 15-inch version is 4 pounds and is 14 percent thinner with 20 percent less volume, the company said. Stephen Lam/Getty Images An Apple employee points to the Touch Bar on a new Apple MacBook Pro laptop during a product launch event on October 27, 2016 in Cupertino, Calif. Touch ID has been integrated into the power button, making it possible to pay for purchases with Apple Pay in a single touch. The updated retina display at 500 nits of brightness is 67 brighter than the previous generation. The new MacBook Pro also will have power-saving technologies like larger pixel aperture, a variable refresh rate and more power-efficient LEDs, making the laptop's display consume 30 percent less energy than before, according to Apple.

Apple’s new set-top box, released last year, introduced universal search using the Siri voice control.  But CEO Tim Cook said during a Mac event today that universal search was just the beginning. “We want to do even more to make this experience even better,” he said.  “We want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television.” The TV app will be available for Apple TV, iPhone and iPad and will be offered to Apple customers as a free software update in December.  TV was announced as part of a large Apple TV presentation during today’s event, which featured the introduction of a new MacBook Pro.  The iPhone maker also announced an update to Siri on Apple TV that will make it easier for viewers to tune into live news and sports. Apple is also introducing a new single sign-on for Apple TV’s pay TV apps, those that require a cable subscription like HBO Go.  At first, single sign-on will be available for DirecTV and DISH Network subscribers.  — The Hollywood Reporter /Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Huawei wants to beat Apple in smartphones in two years TAG Heuer invades Apple’s home turf with Silicon Valley office Apple’s new laptop gets more touchy, but not on its screen Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple special event live blog: New MacBook Pros, no new MacBook Air Apple special event live blog: New MacBook Pros, no new MacBook Air By Grant Brunner on October 27, 2016 at 11:02 am Comment Updated at 2:25pm: That’s a wrap. Most of the even was spent on the new features of the MacBook Pro. The poor MacBook Air more or less gets the boot. Updated at 1:39pm: The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro are getting updated with a slimmer design, a Touch Bar, and TouchID. Updated at 1:25pm: New “TV” app on Apple TV, iPad, and iPhone helps you find and watch your favorite content across different streaming apps. Updated at 1:02pm: Here we go. The event is starting. At today’s special event, Apple will likely show off a handful of major Mac updates. New laptops are definitely in the cards, but the rumor mill hasn’t been very kind to the beleaguered Mac desktop fans among us. By and large, Apple has been slow to change the Mac line-up. At best, the favorites see a meaningful refresh about once a year. At worst, the likes of the Mac Pro and Mac Mini get ignored for years on end — a sorry situation for desktop die-hards. The event begins at 1pm ET (10am PT), and we’ll be live blogging the entire thing. Want to watch the keynote live? You can do that too! Apple will be streaming it, so anyone running Safari or Edge can enjoy the show. Live blog 2:23pm: It’s over. What do you think? 2:22pm: Tim Cook is wrapping it up. Thanking his team. 2:20pm: The non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro starts shipping today. The Touch Bar models ship in two to three weeks. You can order today. 2:17pm: Seems like they’re killing the MacBook Air. They’re shipping a slightly worse MBP with only 2 Thunderbolt 2 ports and no Touch Bar instead. 2:15pm: (Relatively) eco-friendly. 2:12pm: Jony Ive MacBook Pro video playing. 2:10pm: Office is getting Touch Bar support. 2:06pm: Demoing a DJ setup on the MacBook Pro. 2:01pm: Demoing Photoshop now on the MacBook Pro. 1:56pm: Showing the MacBook Pro in a demo. Another woman on stage now. 1:55pm: You can use the ports for pretty much anything. 1:54pm: 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports. Uses USB-C connector. 1:53pm: The 13-inch isn’t quite as impressive though. 1:51pm: 15-inch features a Core i7 Skylake CPUs. Has faster RAM, better SSDs, and GPU. 1:50pm: The new display is pretty sweet. 1:48pm: Fast user switching with TouchID. 1:44pm: HASHTAG EMOJI 1:42pm: How long until the entire keyboard is replaced with a touchscreen? Soon, right? 1:41pm: Demo time. 1:40pm: TouchID is built in. Good news. 1:38pm: The Touch Bar is a retina display, and it’s multitouch. 1:37pm: Eulogizing the function keys. 1:36pm: Uses a new generation of switch for the keyboard – revision of the 12-inch MacBook. Touchpad is twice as big. 1:35pm: The new models are thinner and lighter. 1:34pm: 13-inch and 15-inch models available. Two colors. 1:32pm: New MacBook Pro. Toolbar confirmed. 1:29pm: This week is the 25th anniversary of the first Powerbook. 1:28pm: Summarizing macOS Sierra. 1:27pm: Mac time! 1:26pm: The TV app launches in the US this December. 1:24pm: Siri integration lets you get to live content quickly. 1:22pm: The TV app is also available on your mobile devices so you can watch on the TV or on the go. 1:20pm: The TV app does recommendation as well. Seems fine. 1:18pm: Okay, so it seems like this is just an aggregation app for all your video content across different streaming apps. 1:18pm: New app called “TV.” 1:16pm: Get animated Gifs on your screen while watching football. Sure? That seems like something Silicon Valley would do. 1:15pm: A person from Twitter is on stage. Showing discussion and stats on live video. Social viewing, etc. 1:12pm: Over 8,000 apps for Apple TV. Over 2,000 games. Minecraft is coming. 1:11pm: Announcing something for Apple TV. 1:11pm: Apple Watch Nike+ will be available tomorrow. 1:10pm: Talking about how Apple Pay launched in Japan. 1:09pm: Showing portraits taken with iPhone 7+ 1:08pm: Over 60% of iDevices are running iOS 10. 1:07pm: Over 400 million “memories” from photos have been viewed. 1:06pm: Sharing photos taken with the iPhone 7. 1:05pm: Some iPhone talk. 1:05pm: Apple is launching a new accessibility site to emphasize how Apple products can help people with disabilities. 1:05pm: Tim is on stage. 1:04pm: Strong start. Very strong. 1:03pm: Starting with a video about disabilities and tech. 1:02pm: Okeydoke, it’s beginning. Fingers crossed for new desktops. 12:53pm: It’s almost time to begin. What are you looking forward to? Scared that Apple will kill your favorite Mac? What we expected So far, we’ve mostly heard rumblings about updates to the various MacBook lines. A 13-inch Air, 13-inch Pro, and 15-inch Pro are all on the table, but the 11-inch Air might get dropped completely. If rumors are right, we’ll see faster GPUs, strong support for USB-C, and an OLED magic toolbar. The 12-inch MacBook received an update earlier this year, so we wouldn’t bet on a new version just yet. On the desktop side, there hasn’t been much movement. It’s been two years since a major update to the Mac Mini, and nearly three since the Mac Pro got any real love. It’d sure be nice if those got complete overhauls, but it’s anybody’s guess if Apple will even bother. The iMac, on the other hand, very well might get a kick in the GPU. A new standalone display, the Apple TV, and countless smaller Apple accessories might get some attention on stage, but it seems like the MacBooks will be Cupertino’s focus this time around. If you’re an iPod fan, don’t let your hopes get too high.

AP by Hayley Tsukayama Apple unveiled a redesigned MacBook Pro, its top-of-the-line laptop that incorporates smartphone-like touch screen features right into the keyboard. Apple has been furiously updating its smartphones every year, but it has been years since customers saw much more than basic refreshes of the company's popular laptops. At its event here in Cupertino, California, Apple spent considerable time showing off its newest innovation for its new MacBook Pro. The company called it the "touch bar", which replaces the long-standing function keys at the top of the keyboard with a tiny, long touch-screen. The touch bar changes depending on the program that is running on the computer. It offers quick typing suggestions in a word processor, emojis in a texting program, or volume and play buttons in a music program. An attendee demonstrates the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro laptop. Bloomberg It also offers "touch id", enabling a user to unlock the computer with a fingerprint. Apple said the laptop had a 67 per cent brighter screen, a faster processor, and was lighter - 4 pounds (1.81 kg) for the 15-inch notebook, which Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said was "almost unheard of" for a high-performance professional notebook. The MacBook Pro also comes in a 13-inch screen size. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements The new professional notebook might put a squeeze on the rest of Apple's lineup. Last year, Apple introduced a new version of the MacBook that was ultra-light, portable and had a high-end "Retina" display. The new MacBook was very similar to the entry-level, ultra-portable MacBook Air line in almost every way - except price. The result was a somewhat confusing lineup of laptops. At its event, Apple is expected to streamline or at least clarify the differences between the Air and the new MacBook and introduce at least one new lightweight laptop that will help lure people into the Mac laptop world. Desktop Macs murkier Finally, when it comes to desktop Macs, the prospects are a little murkier. In August, Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on new iMacs and a new high-end "Thunderbolt" display, but fairly reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities says that these are unlikely to come out until next year. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during the announcement of the new MacBook Pro. AP/Marcio Jose Sanchez The Apple event comes just a day after Microsoft introduced two new expensive computers - the Surface Book laptop and the Surface Studio desktop. Microsoft took aim at its old rival, Apple, by noting that the Surface Book was three times faster than Apple's best 13-inch MacBook Pro. On Thursday, Apple had its chance to hit back with a few jabs of its own. Apple kicked off its announcements with a somewhat unexpected subject: Apple TV. The company did not announce a new version of its set-top box, but it announced some new apps that could make the device more appealing to consumers. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Minecraft, the popular building game owned by Microsoft, will hit Apple TV by the end of the year. Twitter's Ryan Troy, the company's global lead for TV devices, also took to the stage to show off the new Apple TV Twitter app, which is being held up as a prime example of interactive viewing apps. The new Pro comes in three versions and two colours. AP Apple is trying to simplify the Apple TV for users - a key move as more cord-cutting services flood users with more options than they may actually be willing to sift through. With a new Apple TV app simply called "TV" the company is aggregating users' many streaming options into one spot, making it easier to search and surface content. It looks somewhat like iTunes, but with television content. And, of course, it works with Siri for search. The app will look the same across Apple TV, iPhone and iPad and will be part of a free update in December.

The LG monitor has a 5K resolution, a wide range of color, four USB-C ports, and at least one built-in camera (and possibly more). It can connect to your MacBook using a single cable and, since it's USB-C, that same cable can also be used to charge it. More on Apple's event Apple's amazing strip show reinvents the laptop keyboard Photos from Apple's Hello Again Mac event See all of our Apple event coverage According to Apple exec Phil Schiller, Apple worked with LG to create a display that's the ultimate docking solution for your new MacBook Pro. The 5K monitor can display 35 million pixels, driven by the graphics circuitry of the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, which can run two of the displays at the same time. Full specs, pricing and availability have yet to be announced. Considering both the new MacBooks and 5K monitors cost more than a few pretty pennies, we don't expect the self-described "ultrafine" LG to come cheap.

They can be ordered from today. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/ibShKgGs5o— Apple Event (@AppIeEvent) October 27, 2016 Apple, the Cupertino, California company fetishized the world over, just finished streaming its signature brand of product demo and presentation. Geeks everywhere — not to mention those who use a laptop to make a living through video/sound editing etc. — will be happy to learn that the thrust of today's product announcement is a new MacBook Pro after a four-year hiatus on that product line. Other Mac users — specifically the huge MacBook Air crowd tapping away in coffee shops and campus libraries — may be less pleased to learn that their next computer won't be like their last one, and it will likely be more expensive, too: As Gizmodo reports, Apple is killing the MacBook Air, shepherding current users to a 13-inch version of the new MacBook Pro instead, though that version will come without a key new feature of the 15- and 17- inch versions. Apple officially unveils the new MacBook Pro. #appleevent pic.twitter.com/DeqIXP38Jv— Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) October 27, 2016 It's been 25 years since Apple first released a laptop/notebook, the Powerbook as TechCrunch reminds us, so plenty of changes have come in small iterations over time. Just as you'd expect, the laptops announced today are "thinner," "lighter," and all those other descriptors that Apple executives love to use (and presumably shout at designers on a daily basis). Still, here are three more substantive changes to take note of (I know what you're thinking, don't worry, there's still a headphone jack). Wow, the first Apple notebook next to the new MacBook Pro. The new one is 6.8 million times faster. #appleevent pic.twitter.com/PeQej6Swvm— Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) October 27, 2016 1. There's a "Touch Bar" on the keyboard on the 15- and 17-inch versions On a MacBook Pro, when you turn the power on, you'll do so as you might on an iPhone: With a touch sensor for a finger: Touch ID now comes integrated within the power button, right there on your Mac. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/U36P89Y4PE— Apple Event (@AppIeEvent) October 27, 2016 That's part of the new Touch Bar, which will replace the top row of keys, and is particularly handy for those working on editing software, where dynamic shortcuts are called for. Or, you know, for those with a penchant for emoji: Of course, Touch Bar gives you emoji. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/rItgC8kEe5— Apple Event (@AppIeEvent) October 27, 2016 This isn't coming out on the 13-inch version, which is strange and generating a lot of noise on Twitter. 2. Apple used a third-party, LG, to make the screen Tech pundits are busy speculating that we've seen the last in-house Apple screens now that Apple low key announced it worked with LG to make the display on the new MacBook Pro.

 Apple's new MacBooks, explained Steve Kovach Oct. 27, 2016, 6:39 PM 15,926 facebook linkedin twitter email print The new MacBook Pro.AP Apple refreshed its line of MacBooks Thursday, starting at the top with a redesigned MacBook Pro with a fancy new digital control pad. But it also shook up things at the lower end, eliminating the 11-inch MacBook Air and offering a new, entry-level MacBook Pro.  It's confusing! So, here's an FAQ explaining everything you need to know about Apple's MacBooks. What new products did Apple announce? The new MacBook Pro is the only major new product announced Thursday. How many models are there? There are three basic MacBook Pro models: The first is a 13-inch version that does not have the new digital Touch Bar or TouchID fingerprint sensor. (More on the Touch Bar in a bit.) Instead, it has the standard row of physical function keys. This entry-level MacBook Pro looks mostly the same as the higher end MacBook Pros, except it has slower internal specs. It also only has two Thunderbolt ports (more on Thunderbolt later) instead of four like the high-end models. The second model is a 13-inch version that has the new Touch Bar and TouchID fingerprint sensor. It also has faster internal specs than the entry-level MacBook Pro. There are also four Thunderbolt ports. Finally, there's a 15-inch version. It's mostly the same as the 13-incher with Touch Bar, except with a much larger screen. Touch Bar? What the heck is that? AP The Touch Bar is a glass touchscreen that replaces the function keys at the top of your keyboard. The display changes depending on the app you're using. For example, you can scrub through video in QuickTime using a slider, pause or play tracks in iTunes, or easily select emojis when typing an iMessage or email. The Touch Bar is fully adaptable, so it'll be different depending on which app you're using. Third-party apps can also write code to work with the Touch Bar. Expect to see a lot of experimentation in the future. What about a fingerprint sensor? The MacBook Pro has a TouchID fingerprint sensor at the end of the Touch Bar. It's also the power button. You can use the sensor to unlock your computer or make online payments with Apple Pay. You can also program multiple user fingerprints if you share your computer with someone. That way each person can easily log in with their own fingerprint. No more passwords! What kind of ports does it have? Steve Kovach/Business Insider The MacBook Pro has Thunderbolt ports. This is a new generation of Thunderbolt called Thunderbolt 3 and it can charge the device, transfer data, transfer video to a monitor, and so much more. It also works with USB-C accessories, the new standard kind of USB plug showing up in more and more devices. There aren't any standard USB ports or slots for SD memory cards. How do I plug in my old accessories? Unfortunately, you'll need to use dongles, new cables, or adapters for your old accessories to plug into the Thunderbolt ports. For example, if you want to charge your iPhone with your new MacBook Pro, you'll have to buy a new Lightning to USB-C cable. It costs a whopping $25. Ugh. Does it have a headphone jack? Yes! All new MacBook Pro models have a standard headphone jack. Is the main display a touchscreen? No. Only the Touch Bar is a touchscreen. The main display is just a normal high-resolution screen. What colors does it come in? All the MacBook Pro models come in two color options: Space gray or silver. How much does it cost? The 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar starts at $1,499. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar starts at $1,799. The 15-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar starts at $2,399. However, you can add more powerful specs to all these models, which will cost more. There are loads of options. When can I buy it? Now. The MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar starts shipping Friday. The other models will ship in two or three weeks. Wait, didn't Apple say something about a MacBook Air replacement? The MacBook Air.Flickr/Tim Trueman Yes. But that probably wasn't the best thing for Apple to do since it seems to be confusing a lot of people. The MacBook Air is still around and has not been replaced. But Apple is positioning the entry-level MacBook Pro (the one without the Touch Bar) as a more powerful alternative to the MacBook Air. That's because the redesigned Pro has slimmed down a bunch and is close to the same size and weight of the MacBook Air. Unfortunately, it's also a lot more expensive. So what's up with the MacBook Air? The 13-inch MacBook Air is still available starting at $999. It did not get any upgrades. However, Apple did kill the 11-inch MacBook Air on Thursday. The 13-inch Air is your only option now. Are there any other MacBooks? Yup. There's one more model, simply called MacBook. It's the super-thin MacBook Apple launched in 2015 and updated again this year with faster specs. So, which MacBook is the best? Wow. That's a loaded question. It really depends on what you want to do. Do you need something relatively cheap and don't care about a high-res screen? Go with the MacBook Air. Do you want the best of the best? Go with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Do you want a massive screen? Get the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Want something shockingly thin and light? Get the MacBook.

Mello Jr. Oct 27, 2016 3:03 PM PT Xiaomi on Tuesday fired another shot in the shrinking bezel wars, as it announced a smartphone with a front that's more than 90 percent display. The Mi Mix is a 6.4-inch phone that's stylishly crafted by French designer Philippe Starck. It sports a feature set that indicates Xiaomi wants to compete at the high end of the smartphone market. "For many years, Xiaomi has had a reputation of copying designs and branding from Apple and Samsung," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. "This phone breaks with those designs," he told TechNewsWorld. "One factor for success is trying to get the greatest possible screen area into the smallest possible footprint," Rubin said. "This design comes close to the ideal of an all-screen phone." The Mi Mix has a screen-to-body ratio of 91.3 percent. That compares to 67.7 percent for Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. Real Estate Grab To expand the Mi Mix's display, Xiaomi grabbed the real estate at the top of the phone occupied by the front-facing camera, ear speaker and proximity sensor. It did that by moving the front-facing camera to the bottom of the phone, and replacing the ear speaker with a piezoelectric speaker that uses the metal frame of the phone to generate sound. It also replaced the infrared proximity sensor found on most phones with one that uses sound. The proximity sensor turns off a smartphone's display as the device approaches the ear. Most phones use an infrared sensor at the top of the phone to do that. The Mi Mix uses ultrasound waves and software to do it. "We use the sound transmitter that's already inside the phone," explained Guenael Strutt, vice president of product development at Elliptic Labs, maker of the ultrasound technology, which it calls "Inner Beauty." "The sonic wave echos off the head, is picked up by a microphone, and the data is processed by our algorithms inside the phone," he told TechNewsWorld. "We use components in the phone to detect the head -- we don't have to add a new sensor." Using sound to detect proximity also avoids issues that make infrared sensors unreliable from time to time, such as weather conditions or skin and hair coloring. Top-Shelf Play In addition to its eye-catching display, the Mi Mix has a 16-megapixel camera with phase-detect auto focusing, a generous 4,400 mAh battery, two SIM slots and a Snapdragon 821 processor. It supports high-definition audio with a 192 Hz/24-bit DAC chip, which users can listen to through a standard headphone jack. Although the Mi Mix is officially a concept phone, Xiaomi will start selling it in China next week. Models with 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage will be priced at US$516, and those with 6 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage will sell for $590. "Xiami lost a lot of traction in China as Vivo and Oppo strengthened their position in the lower end, and Huawei and Apple took the high end," said Carolina Milanesi, a principal analyst at Creative Strategies. "I see the new Mi Mix concept phone as an attempt by Xiaomi to recapture the higher end of the market and reposition itself as an innovator," she told TechNewsWorld. Xiaomi already is a top global contender because of its performance in China, and it wants to challenge Huawei in the West as best-performing Chinese brand. "If this phone really goes up for sale in the West, it might jump ahead of the iPhone in terms of sexiness and design appeal," Newzoo CEO Peter Warman told TechNewsWorld. Just the Beginning It's unlikely the Mi Mix will be made for the mass market, though, in Milanesi's view. "Chinese consumers love large screens, and the quality of the display looks fantastic," she said, and "$520 is in line with their pricing strategy of delivering a high-end experience at an affordable price." That said, "it will be interesting to see what supplies will be, as I have a feeling that these phones are more focused on revamping brand than growing sales," Milanesi added. Xiaomi might be wise to sell as many Mi Mixes as the market will bear as fast as it can before competition heats up. More designs like the Mi Mix will start appearing in the next 12 months, said Daniel Matte, an analyst at Canalys. "This is an indicator of where things are going. We'll see a lot of bezel-less designs in the next year," he told TechNewsWorld. "Xiaomi is one of the first to do this, but there will be many more to come."

Check out these accessories first 0 Share: Laptops by Dong Ngo October 27, 2016 1:48 PM PDT @riceandstirfry Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Apple debuts MacBook Pro Apple announces its lightest, thinnest notebook ever. The new laptop features an all-metal design, a Touch Bar, and it comes in two sizes, 13-inch and 15-inch. It also comes in two colors, silver and space gray. 2:05 Close Drag Face it, connecting devices to your new Mac laptop, be it the new MacBook Pro (of which the 13" version basically replaces the MacBook Air as a new budget, compact, full-feature notebook) or the 12-inch MacBook can be annoying. Each includes one to four Thunderbolt3/USB-C ports (Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are interchangeable ports) as their sole connectors. Most peripherals on the market today aren't natively compatible with Thunderbolt/USB-C. They'll need an adapter to function, and here's where this list comes in. Each of the devices below will allow you to connect your Mac notebook with a monitor, portable drive and SD card of your choice. Satechi Slim Aluminum Type-C Multi-Port Adapter Photo by Satechi Satechi Slim Aluminum Type-C Multi-Port Adapter This is likely the first accessory you'd need. It adds two USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI (with support for 4K video) to your computer. It also comes with an USB-C port but only for pass-through charging. I've tried it out myself and have had no problems, but I've yet to spend enough time to review it. You can have it, too, for $60 on Amazon. Satechi Type-C USB 3.0 3 in 1 Combo Hub Photo by Satechi Satechi Type-C USB 3.0 3 in 1 Combo Hub If you don't need the HDMI port, you can opt for the Satechi Type-C USB hub. This hub adds two USB 3.0 ports, one SD card slot, and one miniSD card slot to the Mac, so it's great for photographers. It also has an USB-C port, but like the multiport adapter above, it's only for pass-through charging. The hub also looks like it was made for the MacBook itself, and comes in four colors for you to choose from. I haven't tried it out yet, but you can get the Satechi Type-C hub on Amazon for $50. Choetech Type-C USB 3.1 Hub Photo by Amazon Choetech Type-C USB 3.1 Hub Now if you need HDMI and USB 3.1, and don't care about SD cards, the Choetech hub is a better choice. Basically if you want a compact accessory that allows you to hook your MacBook to an external screen and host a regular USB device this is a great device to carry along. I'm still waiting to give this one a try, but it can be had for just $33 on Amazon. Nonda USB-C to USB 3.0 Mini Adapter Photo by Amazon Nonda USB-C to USB 3.0 Mini Adapter And speaking of compact, this tiny accessory turns the MacBook's USB-C into a regular USB 3.0 port allowing you to plug all traditional non-Type-C USB devices into your laptop. Note that with the 12-inch MacBook you can't charge your computer when using it, though. I haven't tried it out yet, but you can get it for just $10 on Amazon. SanDisk Ultra 128GB Dual Drive USB Type-C Photo by Amazon SanDisk Ultra 32GB Dual Drive USB Type-C If extra storage is what you need, this SanDisk thumbdrive will come in handy. It's basically like any thumbdrive, but comes with both a regular USB connector and a USB-C connector, allowing it to work with any computer, including any of your MacBooks. I haven't tried it out yet, but it likely works like most SanDisk drives out there. It's available in many capacities up to 128GB on Amazon for $120. The Samsung Portable SSD T3 is one tough cookie This fast, rugged portable drive is such a tough cookie it's practically a choking hazard. CNET editor Dong Ngo warns you not to eat it. by Dong Ngo 1:49 Close Drag Samsung Portable SSD T3 And speaking of extra storage, the Samsung T3, my personal favorite, is the ultimate portable drive for the new generation of Mac laptops that have completely abandoned ye olde USB connection type. This portable drive is super-compact -- just about the size of a small chocolate bar. The drive is also one of a few portable drives on the market that uses a USB-C port and therefore will work right away with the laptop, as well as other computers.

A few years ago, Microsoft was an afterthought for most in the tech world. Having all but missed the mobile revolution, it was hard to believe chief executive Satya Nadella when he said last year that Microsoft would focus on making innovative products people loved.

But he meant it. And Microsoft, still looking to shake off its image as the default option for the world's cubicle workers, took to a New York City stage overnight to show off a generation of products designed to promote passion and creativity — not just productivity. Microsoft introduced a new desktop, reimagined with the touchscreen and pen technology that have earned it a following for its Surface tablets. The 28-inch computer, called the Surface Studio, sits on sleek chrome arms and can adjust to a flat angle for writers and sketchers who want to use it as an enormous piece of paper. Its minimalist design brought to mind the obsessive simplicity of Apple's thinnest Macs. Surface Studio's unprecedented versatility adjusts to every step of your creative process. #MicrosoftEvent pic.twitter.com/gaPUzofTNH— Surface (@surface) October 26, 2016 The Surface Studio also comes with a magnetic hockey puck-like dial, in addition to a mouse. Users can place the dial on the screen to change things, such as paint color, mid-stroke. It can also be used off-screen, on your desk. Advertisement "Every single one of us is a creator," said Microsoft's Panos Panay, the company's corporate vice president of devices. "We want people to use this product to help everyone create." Microsoft also introduced a new version of the Surface Book, its high-end laptop, which boasts 16 hours of battery life and, according to Panay, has three times the performance of the highest-end MacBook Pro. That was a not-so-subtle dig that hints at the resurgence of an old rivalry. Microsoft's push into a space that has traditionally been Apple's domain — devices for creative types — comes at the same time as Apple has been touting the productivity of its own devices. Both are trying to frame their devices as products that can take customers seamlessly from work to play, at a time when the line between the two domains is blurring more than ever. Apple is also expected to introduce new laptops this week, at an event at its California, headquarters. But the MacBook maker has already made clear that it has its eye on the business world that has been Microsoft's domain for many years, particularly with the introduction of its large iPad Pro tablet, which supports a keyboard and is sold as a possible laptop replacement — similar to Microsoft's Surface. Of course, it remains to be seen how well either company's attempts to alter their images stick with consumers. And both Microsoft's new products are pricey — the Studio starts at $US3000 ($3925) in the US, with local prices to be advised, while the new Surface Book will start at $3799 in Australia — which makes them for high-end buyers. But it seems as if both firms are increasingly marketing to the same group of people. Hardware isn't the only place where Microsoft is trying to change its image. The firm also showed ways it plans to bring 3D-modeling, virtual reality and augmented reality into the mainstream. The company's new "Creators" version of its Windows 10 operating system, due out in the spring, lets anyone scan and manipulate 3D objects into their computers to place in sketches and PowerPoint presentations. The Windows 10 Creators edition also has more user-centric features such as a "people bar" powered by Microsoft's Skype, that will give users easy access to their most-used contacts. Users can also edit emoji, to fit their own personalities. Microsoft also showed off a native program called Beam that lets users stream video games from their PCs.

In an announcement called 'Hello Again,' Apple's Tim Cook rolled out a new website to showcase accessibility features across many of Apple's products, including the iPhone, the Mac and the Apple watch. "It's all about the accessibility features that we've designed and built into our products," Tim said in a keynote address, according to MacRumors. "We believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, and we hope this website becomes a great resource that people can use all around the world." As part of the showcase, Apple released a video that shows people with all kinds of disabilities doing what they love using technology. "People think that having a disability is a barrier, but that's not the way I see it," a woman with a disability said in the video. "You can catch up with friends, you can capture a moment with your family, and you can start the day bright and early." The person catching up with friends is deaf, using face time to have a conversation in Sign Language. The person capturing a moment with his family appears to be blind. His phone is talking out loud to help him aim and focus the picture. The person starting the day used her phone to turn on the lights and open the blinds in her phone. She uses a wheel chair. The products include workout options on the Apple Watch for people who use wheel chairs, computers will allow people to use joy sticks and other adaptable controls, iPhones will connect with special hearing aids that allow the wearer to adjust volume and clarity levels for different environments, and the list continues. These options allow people with disabilities to use technology the way able-bodied people do. That's how it should be, and it's great that Apple is making those features more visible. It shows the world that people with disabilities are capable of anything, just like anyone else. The video makes this point in a beautiful way. The girl with a disability narrating the video also turns out to be the one editing it. "When technology is designed for everyone, it lets anyone do what they love," she said. "Including me."

Apple announced their new MacBook Pro, which uses four Thunderbolt 3 ports for IO. During the launch event, Apple also noted that LG would be launching a new pair of monitors to go along with the MacBook Pro. These new monitors are branded as LG UltraFine, and LG is advertising them as monitors designed to seamlessly integrate with macOS and both new models of the MacBook Pro. I've included the known specifications for both monitors below:   LG UltraFine 21.5 LG UltraFine 27 Panel 21.5" IPS 27" IPS Native Resolution 4096 x 2304 5120 x 2880 Refresh Rate 60 Hz Brightness 500 cd/m² Color Gamut Display P3 Color Depth 8bit 10bit Viewing Angles 178°/178° horizontal/vertical Inputs USB-C Thunderbolt 3 USB Hub 3 x 5Gbps USB-C Audio Stereo speakers The first LG UltraFine display is a 21.5" 4K model. Unlike most "4K" displays which really use the 3840x2160 resolution defined in the UHD spec, this is a 4096 x 2304 display that actually has over four thousand pixels on its longer axis. The 27" model is a 5K panel with a resolution of 5120 x 2880. Both monitors connect over a single cord. In the case of the 4K model it can be driven using a single DisplayPort 1.2 stream over a normal USB-C port. The 5K monitor requires two DisplayPort 1.2 streams and so it is a tiled display. However, using Thunderbolt 3 for the link avoids the dual-cable solution used on existing 5K monitors. These solutions also allow for data and power transfer, and so the monitors can actually charge a connected laptop while also providing three 5Gbps USB-C ports and stereo speakers. The panel characteristics for both displays are similar. Both have a peak brightness of 500 nits, and they use the P3 color gamut, although it's almost certain that they retain the standard 2.2 gamma and white point of D65 from existing displays. The one key difference to note is that the 21.5" model is only an 8bit display, with support for 16.7 million colors, while the 27" model is a 10bit display supporting 1.07 billion colors. The 27" model also has a camera and a built in microphone for audio and video calls. At this point you may have noticed that all of these specs are the same as Apple's iMacs. LG Display makes the IPS displays in the iMacs, so it's very likely if not certain that these are the same panels. Given that these monitors are targeted at users of the new MacBook Pro, it's also very likely that they do not have any sort of sRGB fallback mode, as such an option is unnecessary on macOS where there is end to end color management in any AppKit app and even in most apps that don't use AppKit. This is important to keep in mind for anyone interested in buying these for a Windows computer. The state of color management on Windows means that in nearly every application you'll be stuck with oversaturated colors and no workaround, so I wouldn't recommend it even if it can work. While I'm on the topic of Windows support, I will say that from a technical perspective, the displays should work with a Windows computer. However, product listings for the monitor specify that you need a Mac with USB-C for the 4K model, and a Mac with Thunderbolt 3 for the 5K model. This limits the 4K model to Apple's MacBook, and the new MacBook Pros, with the 5K model only working on the latter. This also ties back to the integration with macOS. Most monitors use physical buttons for controlling brightness and volume, but the LG UltraFine displays use the integrated controls that macOS provides, meaning that it can respond to the volume and brightness keys on Mac keyboards. It doesn't look like the monitors have any buttons to fall back on, so this may be another situation where Windows users should be wary, and it definitely explains why the monitors are being marketed specifically for their integration with macOS. Both of LG's new UltraFine monitors have already shown up online, although you can't buy them directly from Apple's online store as of right now even if you'd like to purchase one alongside a new MacBook Pro. The listings do tell us that the 4K model is priced at $699.95 in the US, and the 5K model is $1299.95. According to LG, the 4K model will be available next month, and the 5K model will launch in early December. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 47 Comments View All Comments sorten - Thursday, October 27, 2016 - link Very interesting that LG is locking themselves into such a small addressable market. These would be popular with people in the Windows crowd. Even if I bought a new MB I would not consider these monitors because I also want to use that monitor for my work laptop, SP4 and PS4. Reply GodHatesFAQs - Thursday, October 27, 2016 - link I think an alternative model will be released for Windows users soon, probably first half of next year. Reply PixyMisa - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link The obvious use for these would be second displays for the 2015 iMac range, because you get an exact match for the size, resolution, and gamut. But there's still no Thunderbolt 3 iMac, so nope. Reply V900 - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Perfectly understandable if you look at the demographics of that market. Mac users are a tiny part of the overall computer market, but a big majority in the market for computers that cost 1000$ and up. LG knows their customers! Reply jmelan - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link that is only because no one can keep track of all of the PC users that just buy parts off of amazon and newegg how many mac users picked up a gtx 1070/1080?? Reply rjashton - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Hiya :-) 10x0 not my upgrade cycle but I did pick up a 970 on launch more or less, do I count? Reply RMSe17 - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link Getting the new MBP for laptop, but DIY for desktop with GTX1080 :) (but no, I will not be buying these, too high resolution for me, I prefer 27" 1440p ) Reply jmelan - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link i agree overpriced 4k 8 bit 21.5" monitor, why would anyone buy this? the 27" is more interesting but why limit to macs?? Reply Ancillas - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Do you think LG might have insider knowledge of better color management coming to Windows 10? Reply Meteor2 - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link It *must* be coming, if Microsoft has any desire to stay relevant in visual industries.

In short, Apple hasn’t given its professional laptop lineup a real overhaul in some time. Only the smaller 13” model ever got Intel’s 5th gen Broadwell CPU – the 15” model is even further back, on 4th gen Haswell – and otherwise the laptops haven’t had major feature updates since 2013. As a result, Apple has been due as anyone can be to update their laptops. And at a special event held at their campus this morning, they have done just that, launching the 4th generation of the MacBook Pro. For better or worse the new 4th generation family doesn’t have a catchy name like Retina to help set it apart from the prior models. But make no mistake, Apple has been busy on giving their languishing laptops a much-needed facelift. All-told, Apple has introduced 3 new MacBook Pro models: a basic 13” version, and then two full-featured versions at 13” and 15” respectively. All three models are form the same mold, so to speak. All of them get the same new unibody design, the same wide color gamut (P3) display, and the same upgraded internal hardware composed of Intel’s 6th generation Skylake CPUs, Thunderbolt 3, and new SSDs. What separates the basic 13” from the other two models, besides cost, is that it doesn’t include Apple’s new multi-touch Touch Bar (more on this in a sec). 4th Gen MacBook Pro Lineup Model 2015 15" 2016 13" (basic) 2016 13" (touch) 2016 15" Dimensions 1.8 cm x 35.89 cm x 24.71 cm 1.49 cm x 30.41 cm x 21.24 cm 1.55 cm x 34.93 cm x 24.07 cm Weight 4.49 lbs (2.04 kg) 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) CPU 2.2GHz Core i7-4770HQ (Haswell) 2.0GHz Core i5-6360U (Skylake) 2.9GHz Core i5-6267U (Skylake) 2.6GHz Core i7-6700HQ (Skylake) GPU Intel Iris Pro 5200 Intel Iris Graphics 540 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Intel HD Graphics 530 + AMD Radeon Pro 450 (2GB) Display 15" 2880 x 1800 IPS LCD sRGB Gamut 13" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD P3 Gamut 15" 2880 x 1800 IPS LCD P3 Gamut Memory 16GB DDR3L-1600 8GB LPDDR3-1866 8GB LPDDR3-2133 16GB LPDDR3-2133 SSD 256GB PCIe SSD (PCIe x2) 256GB PCIe SSD Touch Bar No No Yes I/O 2x Thunderbolt 2 (supports DP1.2), 1x HDMI 1.4, 2x USB 3.0 (Type-A), 3.5mm Audio, SDXC Slot 2x Thunderbolt 3 (supports DP1.2 & USB 3.1 Gen 2 modes), 3.5mm Audio 4x Thunderbolt 3 (supports DP1.2 & USB 3.1 Gen 2 modes), 3.5mm Audio Battery Capacity 99.5 Wh 54.5 Wh 49.2 Wh 76 Wh Battery Life 9 Hours 10 Hours Price $1999 $1499 $1799 $2399 If you’ve been watching Apple over the years, then you know that the company has a (sometimes unhealthy) obsession with reducing their products’ thickness, and the 4th gen MacBook Pro follows that obsession to a T. The new family of laptops is thinner than ever, with Apple taking them from 18mm to 14.9mm and 15.5mm for the 13” and 15” models respectively. Altogether, the total volume is down 23% for the 13” model and 20% for the 15” model. Apple is still using their now tried-and-true aluminum unibody design for the family, so if you’re familiar with the current color-coated MacBook, then you know what to expect here. Though the event was very brief on how Apple was able to shave off so much volume compared to the last generation, it sounds like they’ve gone with a thinner cooling system, and in the case of the 15” model, AMD’s low-profile Polaris 11 GPU. Under the hood, this change in volume comes without a significant change in official TDPs (so all factors held equal, Apple would be removing the same amount of heat in a thinner design). Apple has finally made the jump across the entire family to Intel’s 14nm Skylake processors. The basic 13” model uses a 15W CPU, the higher-end 13” model uses a 28W CPU, and the 15” model uses a 45W CPU, the latter two being the same TDPs as the last generation. Apple isn’t talking up CPU performance too much here, but given how long they’ve been on Haswell on the 15” model in particular, we should see a good performance bump. Meanwhile, in a change from the 3rd generation design, all 15” 4th gen MacBook Pros come with discrete Radeon Pro graphics. Apple has tapped AMD’s new Polaris 11 GPU, in part for the low z-height it offers, which replaces the 4 year old Cape Verde GPU in the previous MacBook Pro. Apple is offering 3 dGPU configurations at increasingly higher performance. From what AMD has told me, these chips are all in the ballpark of 35W. Relative to the previous dGPU models – or even more, the previous model that only offered an integrated Intel GPU – GPU performance should be greatly improved over the last generation. Over 2x for the top-tier Radeon Pro 460 is a very reasonable assumption right now, though one that testing will need to confirm. On the SSD side of matters, Apple has quickly talked up the fact that the new MacBook Pros use a new SSD. Apple traditionally uses multiple vendors, but the quoted 3GB/sec read speeds are consistent with the latest generation of drives out of Samsung and Toshiba. So is the fact that Apple is now offering SSDs up to 2TB in size. More visible is the change to the display. Apple hasn’t increased their resolutions at all – so these are the same 2880x1800 & 2560x1600 resolution configurations at before – but they have upgraded what these displays can do. All of the MacBook Pros now support the wider P3 color gamut that Apple has been championing for the last year and already offers on the iMac, iPhone 7, and iPad Pro. Meaning that the new laptops now support a wider color gamut and can display material mastered for P3 (or photos taken from the iPhone 7) at their full gamut. The new displays are also said to be quite a bit brighter than before; Apple is throwing around 500 nits, or 67% brighter. And, perhaps most interestingly, Apple has confirmed that the new displays support “variable refresh rate” technology. I need to dig into this more, but if this is an implementation of AMD’s FreeSync tech or something similar, then it would potentially be a nice improvement in perceived screen smoothness.  Apple’s also touting that the new display consumes 30% less power, but it’s not clear how much of that is due to variable (e.g. lower) refresh rates and how much of that is from panel and backlighting improvements. Apple has also reworked the keyboard and trackpad, in part to integrate the latest technologies and to achieve their thinness goals. The new MacBook Pros utilize a newer revision of the butterfly switch first introduced on the MacBook keyboard. This means we’re talking about a shorter travel distance than the prior generation MacBook Pros – something that may not be popular in all corners – but at the same time we’re told that these aren’t the same identical switches as on the MacBook, and that there have been some changes to improve the feel. Meanwhile the Force Touch trackpad has been enlarged; it now goes from the bottom edge of the laptop to the keyboard, the full area that Apple could hope to give it.  This is a 100% area increase for the 15” model, and a 46% increase for the 13” model. Apple has also overhauled their input/output options on the new MacBook Pros; quite radically in fact. Apple has doubled-down on Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C. All three models contain solely either 2 (13” basic) or 4 (all other models) TB3 ports (which also double as USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 ports), and then a 3.5mm audio jack. This means the MagSafe port is gone, as are the USB Type-A ports and the Thunderbolt 2 ports. In this sense it’s very close to what has happened with the MacBook, except the MacBook Pro gets a larger number of ports. TB3 is enabled through the use of Intel’s Alpine Ridge controller; the 2 port versions have a single controller, and the 4 port versions have 2 controllers (since Intel doesn’t make a 4 port version). Furthermore all 2 or 4 ports can be used for charging or display outputs as necessary, so they are all equals in functionality. Last, but certainly not least however, is perhaps the marquee feature of the 4th generation MacBook Pros: the Touch Bar. A bit of a poorly kept secret in the run-up to today’s launch, the Touch Bar is a (presumably OLED) capacitive multi-touch display that replaces the row previously occupied by the function keys.  The idea, in a nutshell, is to make a dynamic row of virtual buttons that can be whatever an application (or user) needs them to be, bringing with it all of the advantages of multi-touch that Apple has developed over the years for their iOS devices. Note that the Touch Bar is only available on the higher-end MacBook Pros; the basic 13” model forgoes the Touch Bar in favor of a traditional row of function keys, presumably for cost reasons. Rounding out the feature set, the Touch Bar also includes a Touch ID fingerprint sensor on its right side, and the necessary controller – what Apple calls the T1 – to handle Touch ID and the Secure Enclave duties. This sensor means that virtually everything that can be done with Touch ID on iOS devices can be extended to macOS: one-touch login, Apple Pay confirmation, etc. You can even use it to do things iOS can’t do, such as swap between users. Taking a page from those iOS devices, the Touch ID sensor is the one physical button that’s part of the Touch Bar; it is both a fingerprint scanner and the device’s physical power button. Judging from the presentation alone, the Touch Bar is going to be divisive among users. Replacing physical buttons with a capacitive strip is a major change; if you’re used to feeling buttons, there’s nothing here to feel. On the other hand, Apple is convinced that the function keys are underutilized right now, and that space can be put to better use. Even with the track pad already offering Force Touch, the Touch Bar has the advantage of being able to display what button it is, and behave separately from the trackpad. As someone who admittedly is still old school enough to configure the function keys to work as actual function keys – and not the screen/sound/playback controls Apple defaults to – I’m definitely going to have to sit down with the new Touch Bar to get an idea of what the transition is like. It’s a bold idea for Apple; but bold ideas can be both good and bad. Wrapping things up, the new MacBook Pros are available for order today. The basic 13” model (the one without the Touch Bar and only 2 TB3 ports) will retail for $1499 and is shipping immediately. The other two models will be at $1799 and $2399 for the 13” and 15” models respectively, and will not be shipping for another 2-3 weeks. Finally, Apple has also illustrated how the overall MacBook family of laptops is organized now that they’ve added the new MacBook Pros. The 11” MacBook Air has been removed from sale entirely, while the 13” model is still for sale, but hasn’t received any update. Given that the new MacBook Pros are thinner than the MacBook Air 13”, it seems likely that it’s going to eventually be phased out entirely. Consequently the new, modern MacBook lineup consists of 4 laptops: the 12” MacBook, the basic 13” MacBook Pro, the advanced 13” MacBook Pro, and the 15” MacBook Pro.

Wonder how battery life is going to be affected by that. Also damn they jacked up the prices... Reply Morawka - Thursday, October 27, 2016 - link the pro's always used a 28w cpu, i'm not sure why anandtech thinks otherwise. IIRC the 15w CPU's were only used in the Macbook Air Reply Morawka - Thursday, October 27, 2016 - link the 13" pro mind you, or course the 15" got a 45W CPU.. although my current rMBP is using a 45w CPU and a 100W GPU. They cut the GPU TDP quite a bit from when they used Nvidia. I really wish they would start using Nvidia again and quit signing these contracts with AMD that tie their hands for 3-5 years. after all, nobody beats Nvidia at Perf per watt in mobile GPU's Reply arayoflight - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link A bigger advantage of Nvidia GPUs will be CUDA. Most applications or libraries don't support OpenCL. Reply Stuka87 - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link CUDA is almost unheard of in the Mac world. OSX itself uses OpenCL, as do all of Apples Pro apps. The fact that nVidia doesnt support the latest OpenCL is one of the reasons they have not been used for a few years now. Reply Polacott - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Apple uses OpenCL as is an open standard, wisely they won't tie to a proprietary api that is supported and owned by only by one manufacturer. I really wonder how CUDA reach so far in time. Reply ImSpartacus - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link Nvidia has a ton of marketshare and pretty tremendous mindshare. It's one of the reasons that I'm still nervous about getting a vrr monitor because I'm not convinced that freesync will be the "winner" just because it's in an official standard. Nvidia has shown that they can play by their own rules and still "win". Reply Azix - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Apple favors openCL and CUDA should be able to run on AMD GPUs soon enough. Reply jameskatt - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link Apple prefers developers use Metal - it's own proprietary graphics standard. Metal is much faster than OpenCL. And Metal runs in iOS, MacOS, and TVOS. OpenCL is the backup. Reply Polacott - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link CUDA is a proprietary api owned by Nvidia on the other hand OpenCL is an open standard that in the begining was created by Apple, IBM, AMD, Intel and Nvidia. Adobe for instance uses OpenCL to accelerate processing operations. So, OpenCL is future proof. "Most applications or libraries don't support OpenCL" do you have any data to support such a thing? Think a bit instead of just incorporating pure NVidia corporate bs.

The company’s new MacBook Pro line-up, with as many as four Thunderbolt 3 ports, finds itself on the cutting-edge of notebook connectivity, but it’s a rare owner indeed who will be quite so modern in their digital lifestyle. Just as an ethernet adapter was par for the course with the old MacBook Pro, so even more dongles and connectors are likely to feature in the laptop bag of the typical new MacBook Pro user. If you missed this morning’s big news, the new MacBook Pro has taken the 12-inch MacBook’s example and run with it. Gone are the USB 3.0 ports. Forgotten are the Thunderbolt 2 connectors. Retired is HDMI, and the SD card slot has evaporated into the ether. Even MagSafe 2 has disappeared. Indeed, the 3.5mm headphone jack is the only old-school connector yet, and the reprieve there comes as a minor surprise given how ruthlessly – or “courageously” – the iPhone 7 did away with it. Instead, on the flagship 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models you get four Thunderbolt 3 ports, using the latest USB Type-C connector. Listen to Apple, and you could be forgiven for thinking that’s the bee’s knees. Thunderbolt 3 is undeniably a wunder-port. For a start it’s really three things in one: a single cable can supply power to the new MacBook Pro, hook it up to a data peripheral such as an external drive, and connect an external display, all simultaneously. Any of the four such ports on the new notebook can be used for any or all of those things. So, you could have a display hooked up to one Thunderbolt 3 port and also use that to recharge the notebook’s battery, if the display itself supports that. If it doesn’t, you can plug the power adapter into a different port: it doesn’t matter which, all will charge it. The discrete AMD Radeon Pro GPU in the 15-inch MacBook Pro is potent enough to drive not one but two 5K displays at the same time as the notebook’s own Retina display. Take a look around your desk for Thunderbolt 3 peripherals, though, and I suspect you’ll come up short. It’s been more than a year since we first saw the interconnect, and yet we’re far from a world where devices relying upon it are commonplace. Even USB Type-C, which Apple used on the 12-inch MacBook, is yet to make a significant on aftermarket accessories. That, almost certainly, is Apple’s target with the wholesale embrace of Thunderbolt 3. The company does have a track record in vanquishing old standards – 3.5-inch floppy disks, for instance, along with optical drives – and usually the ecosystem catches up in response. Sometimes that requires ripping off the Band-Aid in one painful go: if you still had old-style USB ports alongside, you’d end up using those rather than upgrading. I’m inclined to support Apple’s appetite for driving change. All the same, it’s not quite as straightforward as casting out old ports and embracing new ones: the Cupertino firm itself must take some responsibility for the frustration and confusion faced by its customers. After all, it’s not like Apple has thrown its weight universally behind ubiquitous standards. An excellent example is Lightning, which is used on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and AirPods charging case. If you’re feeling generous, you could point to its pre-Type-C reversible plug, a real convenience advantage over microUSB, but there’s no denying that it gives Apple a further advantage in controlling its iOS ecosystem and the devices that connect to it. If you want to plug an iPhone 7 into your new MacBook Pro, there’s no escaping it: you’ll need a new cable or adapter. That might be a Thunderbolt 3 to USB dongle, into which you’ll plug your existing USB Lightning cable; that’ll set you back nineteen bucks. Or, you might opt for a USB Type-C to Lighting cable, which is a little more streamlined albeit less flexible; that’s $25. Even though you’re potentially paying several thousand dollars for a brand new laptop, Apple doesn’t make it easy for you and include a legacy adapter in the box. Indeed, all you get is a power supply and charging cable. Apple’s vision of the future does away with wires as much as possible. iPhones synchronize via WiFi, preferably to the cloud rather than to your Mac direct, and photos are shuttled across through AirDrop. Headphone cables are snipped, and wireless headphones – whether they be AirPods or something from Beats – take their place. High-speed WiFi gets your shiny new MacBook Pro online. NOW READ: New MacBook Pro hands-on Unfortunately that’s just not a world many live in, particularly the professional buyers of high-end machines like the MacBook Pro. The reality is, if you’re a photographer then the absence of an SDXC card slot is going to be a headache; if you have an existing display you plug in for desktop use, the lack of HDMI will be a problem. Unquestionably there are dongles and adapters and cables and docks, but when Apple’s flagship phone can’t, out of the box, plug into Apple’s flagship laptop, that seems like a shortcoming. The world will catch up, undoubtedly, and peripherals will gradually embrace Thunderbolt 3. Just don’t be surprised if the sides of your shiny new, even-thinner MacBook Pro are marred with a nest of dongles and adapters until that happens. After all, life on the cutting edge demands some compromises.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Radeon Pro specs hint at a full-fat Polaris 11 GPU in MacBook Pros by Jeff Kampman  3:46 PM on October 27, 2016 Apple's latest MacBook Pros house a new line of Radeon Pro graphics processors: the Radeon Pro 450, the Radeon Pro 455, and the Radeon Pro 460. AMD has given us some more info on those graphics processors in the wake of Apple's unveiling. While the red team didn't say as much, the fact that it's touting the thinness of these chips and the GPUs' spec sheets point to a Polaris 11 chip underpinning these products. First, though, let's take a look at the specs of these new chips (along with a couple educated guesses about their performance). I've marked my guesses with question marks.   Boost clock (MHz) ROP pixels/ clock SP TFLOPs Stream pro- cessors Memory path (bits) Memory transfer rate (GT/s) Memory bandwidth (GB/s) Thermal envelope (W) Radeon Pro 450 ~800? 16? 1 640 128? 5? 80 <35 Radeon Pro 455 ~850? 16? 1.3 768 128? 5? 80 <35 Radeon Pro 460 ~900? 16? 1.86 1024 128? 5? 80 <35 From these specifications, we can draw a number of interesting conclusions about the graphics subsystems in the 15" MacBook Pro. Given the memory bandwidth on tap, it seems likely Apple is using GDDR5 RAM clocked at 5GT/s in the new machines. Furthermore, the 1024 stream processors across 16 compute units in the Radeon Pro 460 suggest Apple is getting the lion's share of fully-enabled Polaris 11 GPUs to cope with demand for its new systems. If that's true, it might indicate why we haven't yet seen something like a Radeon RX 465 to compete with the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, and it may also explain why AMD is so willing to cut prices on cards with the bigger, more costly Polaris 10 die on board. Regardless, AMD has got to be elated with this design win—we look forward to seeing how the new chips perform under the hoods of the new MacBook Pros. Perhaps our Radeon RX 460 review would be a good place to start if you're trying to get a sense of how these parts will handle.

Smaller, thinner, and featuring four Thunderbolt 3 ports, the signature feature is a “Touch Bar,” a Multi-Touch, Retina Display strip above the keyboard that offers users context-aware controls, keys, and other user-interface features. Apple’s New MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Thinner and Faster Apple said the new 15-inch MacBook Pro is 17% thinner than the previous model. It also occupies 23% less volume. Apple achieved part of that thinness by ditching the see-through, lit Apple logo on the cover. The device weighs four pounds, a full half-pound less than the previous model. It features up to 10 hours of battery life, and is powered by a quad-core Core i7 Intel processor starting at 2.6GHz. The 13-inch model is stuck at a dual-core i5 processor starting at 2.9GHz. A third 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar features a dual-Core i5 starting at 2.0GHz. New Stuff Apple’s new MacBook Pro models have what Apple says are faster SSDs with read speeds over 3GBps. That’s gigabytes per second. RAM is faster, too, and it has four Thunderbolt 3 ports. Those ports use the USB-C connector for connecting and charging whatever you’d like. Unlike iPhone 7, both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros have headphones jacks. The trackpad is redesigned, as well, and is larger—”46% larger on the 13-inch MacBook Pro and twice as large on the 15-inch MacBook Pro.” Apple also integrated Touch ID into the power button. Like iPhone and iPad, the Touch ID sensor includes a sapphire cover. Touch Bar Touch Bar is the signature new feature on which Apple hung its “hello again” monicker for Thursday’s media event. I’ll write separately about that, but the key takeaway is that Touch Bar is Apple’s solution to 2-in-1 convergence devices. Rather than touching the display to manipulate user-interface elements, one touches the dedicated strip above the keyboard with context-aware commands and buttons. It’s also where the function keys have been moved, as well as the Escape key. That’s part of the whole context-aware aspect of Touch Bar, as only those controls relevant to the task and app at hand are displayed. Display Apple said the Retina Display on MacBook Pro is as thin as the display on the 12-inch MacBook. But, it’s brighter, with 500 nits of brightness. The company said that’s 67% brighter with 67% more contrast than the previous MacBook Pro display. Pricing & Availability There are essentially three base configurations: 13-inch, 13-inch with Touch Bar, and 15-inch with Touch Bar. Below are the starting prices for each with basic specs. Availability has been highlighted. The 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at US$1,499, features a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage, and ships today. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with the revolutionary Touch Bar and Touch ID starts at $1,799 (US), and features a 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage, and ships in two to three weeks. The 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,399 (US), features the revolutionary Touch Bar and Touch ID, a 2.6 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5 GHz, 16GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage, and ships in two to three weeks.

That for me is key as it has saved me from laptop death more than once. October 27, 2016 at 5:17 EST PM archimedes October 27, 2016 The flash storage speed and size and the new GPU with 4GB should be nice upgrades. The possibility of a single-port docking connection for display, power, and data is also nice. I will miss MagSafe – MagSafe-equipped laptops have been pulled off my desk exactly zero times. And the illuminated Apple logo has been my friend since its semi-accidental appearance years ago in ghostly, inverted form. It is too bad that they haven’t (yet?) added a 32GB RAM configuration for these new MBPs, but one can always dream… I also dream of Apple shipping a 5K display to replace the discontinued Thunderbolt display!! The giant trackpad is intriguing… but after using the Apple Pencil I don’t really want to use anything else for drawing. I think it’s clear that the 2012 retina MacBook Pro was a landmark product that changed the design an entire industry. Once you experience a high-resolution display and fast flash storage, you really never want to go back. And it’s not really surprising how many laptops (and other computers) have changed their design to look more like Apple devices. October 27, 2016 at 6:07 EST PM archimedes October 27, 2016 Make that “changed an entire industry” or perhaps “changed the designs of the entire laptop industry.” Sadly I can’t seem to edit my post. October 27, 2016 at 6:09 EST PM geoduck October 27, 2016 256GB SSD? That’s absurd. With these premium prices 512 should be the minimum. 16GB RAM should be the minimum. These are PRO systems for crying out loud. October 27, 2016 at 6:59 EST PM Lee Dronick October 27, 2016 I will have to try them and see just how useful the Touch Bar is. October 27, 2016 at 7:00 EST PM domsin October 28, 2016 I seriously think Apple is headed in the wrong direction with these new MacBook models. They are less customizable and less repairable. I wouldn’t buy one for myself and I think that more naive computer shoppers will be disappointed after they purchase one. I could be wrong but I’m worried about loss of market share going forward. Open question: Why is Apple doing this? Are there good engineering reasons to reduce customizability and repairability? If so, I am not privy to the reasons. Would appreciate any feedback to educate me. October 28, 2016 at 12:43 EST AM geoduck October 28, 2016 domsin Technically replaceable RAM and HDD are a bit more prone to failure. Coming unplugged and that sort of thing. Practically that hardly ever happens. Technically the sockets take up space so soldering everything together makes for a more compact system. In reality I only see accountancy and marketing here and I think it’s going to backfire. I expect Mac sales to continue to decline in the face of competition from Win10, which is vastly better than 8 or even 7, and other computer manufacturers that are bringing out very impressive, indeed much more impressive hardware for less money. October 28, 2016 at 8:01 EST AM mrboba1 October 28, 2016 This is quite literally the first time I have been actually sad about an Apple product announcement. We are in the market for 1 or 2 new computers in the next year, and I was hoping these machines would be the fix for that. We have a 2015 MBP with 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM, 2.7Ghz/3.1 boost that was USD1699 retail. Our upgrade path for the same $$ is either: the non-bar MBP with 512GB, 2.0/3.1GHz or the bar MBP with 1/2 the storage and faster processor for an extra $100. And many times, this machine is operating closed-lid. I see absolutely no reason to even think about replacing this 18 month old machine. We have a second machine in the office, (2011 MBP) which won’t see this upgrade either. I have upgraded my 2008 MB with RAM and SSD to still make it very usable, but as everyone knows is now getting left behind (it IS 8 years old, I’m not complaining). But to keep pace with the rest of the office, it needs to be replaced. I just can’t see shelling out for this. I was also considering an iMac as the office replacement, but I will not buy a machine full price at the end of its cycle. I was hoping for some desktop announcement, but so much for that. For the first time ever, I’m just not happy with the offerings. October 28, 2016 at 2:45 EST PM geoduck October 28, 2016 From a discussion released yesterday. One topic brought up was the price. “But we don’t design for price, we design for the experience and the quality people expect from Mac. Phill Schiller Unfortunately these systems won’t provide the experience for a lot of people. Either they will have to settle for less than the computer they wanted/needed because they can’t afford more, or will have to forgo a Mac entirely. I found it more than a little ironic that they opened with Apple’s commitment to Accessibility in a presentation where the prices of the systems make them inaccessible for a lot of people. FWIW I just checked out places that sell Linux Systems. I can get a 15″ i7 KabyLake system with 16GB RAM, TWO! 512 GB SSDs, and an equivalent video card for half of what the Mac I was looking at costs. I don’t want to go Linux. I like the Mac environment, how everything just works, how my iPad and iPhone and Mac share documents through iCloud, the App store and iTunes store. I like that. But economics like this are hard to argue with. October 28, 2016 at 4:12 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The new MacBook Pros are very nice—but they were the only major Mac announcement.  In contrast, the event tagline suggested that Apple would say something important about the “Mac” as a product. Instead, the vacuum persisted and Apple elected to take a stand on how it sees the MacBook Pro catering to the pro market with the Touch Bar. The context sensitive OLED Touch Bar was the highlight of the event. Image credit: Apple The first thing I noted during this event was the apparent filler as Tim Cook updated us on the success of the iPhone 7. It seemed like something that was inserted to fill the time. That’s wasn’t exactly the way to wake up an audience, onsite and via streaming, who knew all that already. The next thing I noticed was that the new “TV” app from Apple, while terrific and long awaited didn’t seem to fit in with Apple’s tagline either. The first part of the event felt like a kitchen sink approach. Finally, I started feeling hardware starved. It’s beginning to look like we won’t be getting a 4K/UHD/HDR Apple TV for the holidays. Sigh… Good-Bye Again My colleague Bryan Chaffin brilliantly commented that this event felt more like a “Good-bye” event. By that I mean–and I’m doing my own take on his observation–that a boatload of questions were left unanswered. Why was there no mention of the iMac line? The 21.5-inch iMac could use an update to Skylake and Thunderbolt 3. What’s the fate of the Mac mini? What’s the fate of the Mac Pro? By discussing the MacBook Pro only, Apple seemed to be saying, “We never intended, nor do we need, to talk about anything else.” Unsatisfying. Evidently, we are to take Apple’s silence on other Mac matters as a statement of steadfast indifference. Walls Closing In Conversely, Apple seemed to focus almost to exclusion on the new Touch Bar. While very cool and a technical line in the sand that Apple customers just don’t want to reach out and touch their notebook display, did it merit such extensive coverage? Again, I felt hardware starved, especially since Apple insists on making 16 GB of RAM the maximum available in its MBPs. Another way I felt hardware starved is that a “pro” machine has to have lots of connections to peripheral equipment. True, the USB-C hub market has developed thanks to the 12-inch MacBook, but the a 15-inch quad-core MacBook Pro is more likely to be connected to a large external display. Apple discontinued its own 27-inch Thunderbolt display, and Phil Schiller left us to ponder the idea of just the LG display with USB-C connectors. What if that’s not the display a user wants? Again, hardware starvation and technical closed doors seems to be the theme. Phil Schiller shows your new pro workspace. Image credit: Apple Finally, the feeling we all at TMO got during this presentation is that Apple just doesn’t see a future in powerful desktop Macs. If you are a technical or creative professional, a MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar is going to be your thing. If that doesn’t do the trick, there’s little recourse available in the rest of the product line. You’ll need to turn elsewhere. This event didn’t seem calibrated to address a “Hello again” audience who, I think, expected a broad range of solutions from a brilliant hardware company.

SSD have reduced the need for RAM but not eliminated it, and as a pro user I want to have 2-4 VMs going and my standard OS. iMac should be early December., maybe the 6th. Apple will never release everything at the same time because the value of media releases. October 27, 2016 at 4:12 EST PM ibuck October 27, 2016 It also looked to me that things were different than originally planned when Phil Schiller fumbled a bit through his first stint on stage. Then I thought a new Apple TV would arrive, and was disappointed that it was just a new TV app. (At least Siri’s capabilities were expanding—albeit slowly.) During the MacBook presentation I began to wonder if a new Mac keyboard—with Touch Bar—would be available for desktop Macs. My wallet was half-way out…but alas, no. (At least not for now.) Such a keyboard, along with speed & spec bumps for desktop Macs, would improve sales there. Here’s the fabled hardware company, sales of which form a huge part of their revenue, with just a partial rev of their hardware offerings for their biggest sales quarter. Sigh. October 27, 2016 at 4:17 EST PM think.different October 27, 2016 Mac mini 742 days and counting… Mac Pro 1043 days and counting… iMacs 380 days and counting… sadly still counting. October 27, 2016 at 4:22 EST PM Jamie October 27, 2016 How disappointing. I’m totally open to new ideas and new ways of doing things, but this is pathetic. I doubt I’ll get a Surface Studio, either, but there are much better options than any of the available Macs on the other side of the fence. What has happened to this once amazing company? Burberry and iPhones? Is Apple officially just a ‘lifestyle’ company now? Is it true that at this point they have used up all the sauce that Steve Jobs left them with? Again, very disappointing, and you know it’s bad when people like us, their longtime and ardent supporters are thinking of switching to freaking *Windows* just to get our work done. Ridiculous. :/ October 27, 2016 at 4:23 EST PM Old UNIX Guy October 27, 2016 OK, everyone … if you hear about an earthquake in California don’t panic. It was just Steve Jobs rolling over in his grave. That was a truly pitiful event … and would have been even if they hadn’t raised expectations with the whole “Hello again” thing. Pathetic. I do have to congratulate Tim Cook, however … he went thru that whole pathetic excuse of a special event with a straight face and without being red-faced with embarrassment. If I were him, I could’ve done neither of those things. October 27, 2016 at 4:45 EST PM paikinho October 27, 2016 I was so waiting on the 5th Gen Apple TV. Looks like Apple won’t be getting my money for now. And where is an update for the larger iPad Pro to include what the smaller version has and more? These are 2 things I was ready to part with cash for. Now I will have to wait…. what… until spring or next fall? Gaaack. October 27, 2016 at 4:47 EST PM paikinho October 27, 2016 “During the MacBook presentation I began to wonder if a new Mac keyboard—with Touch Bar—would be available for desktop Macs” I hadn’t thought of that, but I truly would spring for such a thing. I also would spend some for the expanded Touchpad with the newer tech. Where the heck is the hardware Apple? It is as if they hare losing a bit of focus or something. I would love for my older mac to be infused with newer touch technology. Apple needs to think more creatively about its existing customers or it might begin to lose a few from gross neglect. October 27, 2016 at 4:52 EST PM Rick Allen October 27, 2016 Normally I would have paid already for a new MacBook pro, and be waiting on delivery. I was hoping for a more revolutionary product (see Surface Studio) vs evolutionary product. Sadly I think I am taking a pass at this time on a new MacBook pro. My portable work device (surface pro 4) has had sixth gen i7 processor all this year and the same max ram as the new pro. The loss of MagSafe is horrible, as it has saved me from “Laptop death” more than once. Also this new machine is adapter-holic! I need adapters for everything so a USB hub is mandatory carry now. October 27, 2016 at 4:55 EST PM archimedes October 27, 2016 I agree it was an extreme waste of the “hello again” tag, which implied something as significant as the original Mac (“hello.”) or the iMac (“hello (again)” – very disappointing marketing, Apple! Of course I like the new MacBook Pro (though still stuck at 16GB unfortunately 🙁 ) but I agree completely that this wasn’t a “hello”-worthy Mac event. October 27, 2016 at 4:57 EST PM MonkeyT October 27, 2016 I have no doubt that this wasn’t hyped as “A NEW BEGINNING FOR MACS” because they want to know that the TouchBar will be accepted (From early hands-on feedback by fairly skeptical reviewers, I looks like it will.) It’s really obvious that the next iMacs will support a TouchBar on their keyboards, as will Mac Minis and Mac Pros (if they survive). This was a dry run – the merging of contextual keyboards and full screen workspace displays in applications is about to take over the macOS world. This is how iOS and MacOS are going to become more closely related. THAT will be the true “Hello Again” moment. October 27, 2016 at 5:11 EST PM archimedes October 27, 2016 I do think contextual keyboards are likely to be a big thing – Apple’s rumored acquisition of e-ink keyboard company Sonder Design certainly points to this. October 27, 2016 at 6:13 EST PM archimedes October 27, 2016 “the feeling we all at TMO got during this presentation is that Apple just doesn’t see a future in powerful desktop Macs… This event didn’t seem calibrated to address a “Hello again” audience who, I think, expected a broad range of solutions from a brilliant hardware company.” 🙁 October 27, 2016 at 6:15 EST PM d'monder October 27, 2016 Apple just doesn’t see a future in powerful desktop Macs. What does Apple use in-house for release-level development and graphic design? Apple, if you have a need for horsepower in-house, your customers do as well. 🙂 October 27, 2016 at 6:23 EST PM xmattingly October 27, 2016 16gb of maximum RAM was a brutal disappointment; especially since Apple has stagnated on that spec for at least the last four years and these are supposed to be “pro” machines. It would stand to reason that if they’re (quite obviously) neglecting their pro desktops, they’d be beefing up their mobile computers to fill in the gap. Sorry Apple, I need a gee-whiz virtual toolbar far less than I need a pro machine that can multitask in several memory hungry apps and get things done. And we’re expected to cough up a minimum of $2200 for the maximum available RAM? No thanks. I’ll wait until a future round, when/if Apple decides to take their professional customers’ needs seriously. October 27, 2016 at 6:42 EST PM CudaBoy October 27, 2016 A Strip-Bar, the Air was left out to dry as was we Pro users. But hey, you guys were great at the Hangout – Zeppo was kind of understated but Hey, it was nice to see your ‘sausage’ I mean – see the sausage being made…. October 27, 2016 at 6:42 EST PM bjeast October 27, 2016 Well, this was a disappointment for me, as well. So we got thinner. We knew that was coming. And a better display. That’s good! But with the 15, we get a middle of the road, discrete GPU, at a premium price. We get four Thunderbolt 3/USB ports. That means if I replace my current MacBook Pro I potentially need 3 new adaptors. One to use older USB devices, of which I own plenty, including an iPhone 7Plus (if want to be able to charge it.from the laptop); One to connect an HDMI connector (to use projectors at one of my client’s locations) and one to connect older projectors that don’t have HDMI (yes, they are still out there). And I guess I’ll have to buy a USB-C compatible card reader, too. That whole presentation just seemed …. off to me. It seemed awkward, and it seemed like everyone was trying to oversell . By the time they were on the third demo for the Touch Bar, including a DJ demo, and they had started by showing me Emoji, any enthusiasm I had was long gone. And then factor in the price increases (reminds of the 9.7 iPad “Pro”), and well, there you go. I’m not a Pro user (I mean, I’m a professional, and use my computers to make money, but I don’t tax them as much as some people), but even for me, this event was kind of a non-event. Add to that the complete silence on the rest of a Mac line that ranges from moderately outdated to extremely outdated and, well, there you go. October 27, 2016 at 7:00 EST PM geoduck October 27, 2016 Strip-Bar. I think this is a name that will stick. October 27, 2016 at 7:11 EST PM remoran@digcns.com October 27, 2016 Go to http://beyondrealtime.blogspot.com/2016/10/where-are-you-steve.html to see the post regarding MS and the hardware Apple should have. Cook is NOT Jobs and neither is Ivy. This is meh to the max and, as a creative person, Apple is beginning to lose it big time, October 27, 2016 at 7:21 EST PM Lee Dronick October 27, 2016 Death knell 😀 October 27, 2016 at 7:27 EST PM brilor October 27, 2016 Spot on comments John; thank you. I don’t envision professionals with demanding computing needs looking at a machine with maximum of 16 GB of RAM; even 32 GB is unacceptable and maybe 64 GB approaches minimum RAM. 128/256 GB workstations would be acceptable. Being able to connect a 5k monitor to a new MBP is great but for my own use the laptop screen would interfere with my work ( if connected to a external monitor ). Brian October 27, 2016 at 10:33 EST PM furbies October 27, 2016 Apple must be planing to make a “pile of cash” selling USB-C -> everything else adapters ? October 27, 2016 at 11:51 EST PM geoduck October 28, 2016 I had planned to order. I was ready to order. but I haven’t ordered. For what they are, they are just not worth the price. The specs, the limitations, the cost just aren’t adding up. the system that I had braced myself to get is significantly more expensive than I had, based on the old prices, expected. The system priced at a level I had expected to pay is not going to be up to the task of what I want to do with it. Most telling though, after 30 years of using a Mac, and only Macs, at home I’m thinking of other options. I can get a nice 15″ laptop with equal or better specs and put Linux on it for far less than the MacBook Pro I want would cost. It is a very viable and tempting idea. That says something very telling about the state of the Mac in 2016. October 28, 2016 at 8:41 EST AM Lee Dronick October 28, 2016 Good news friends, there is a support group. See today’s Joy of Tech comic http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/2347.html October 28, 2016 at 8:42 EST AM Old UNIX Guy October 28, 2016 As others have noted, even Phil Schiller gave a very unusually poor presentation (for him) yesterday. He even forgot to say the one thing he *should* have said: “Can’t innovate – that’s RIGHT!” October 28, 2016 at 9:15 EST AM Lee Dronick October 28, 2016 I suspect that there were things that they want to present, but were not quite ready. October 28, 2016 at 11:45 EST AM Chazaska October 28, 2016 As others have said, it seemed to me that the usual near cult-like fervor was missing from all the presenters, as if they clearly knew that they would not be meeting the expectations of the faithful. October 28, 2016 at 1:22 EST PM colinddarby October 28, 2016 Apple said in an internal iPhone memo, “Consumers want what we don’t have”. Sadly, you can now apply this to the notebook line. Let’s hope that they don’t expand this line of thought to the iMac, Mac Mini and the poor old MacPro. These are sad times to be a power Mac user and that Surface Studio sure does look nice.

The first redesign in several years is a sign Apple still sees a role for the product that launched the company, even though its iPhone has become the flagship product. Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, described the changes as “important incremental upgrades” which would convince people with old Macs to trade up to the smaller, faster model. But he noted that Microsoft Corp’s competing Surface notebook allowed touch on its main screen. “A lot of people spend a lot of time on these machines. The key for them is incremental innovations that make their job easier,” said Bajarin.  “That’s value.” The new pricing is roughly line with expectations, Bajarin said, but it surprised some. On Twitter, many potential buyers were underwhelmed by the new features and posted pictures of people crying about the new prices.  Others tweeted that they hoped for more products. Apple shares fell 1.2 per cent. Buttons as screens  Customers will be able to access the new machines with Touch ID, the fingerprint reader also used on iPhones, and use the touch screen bar of keys, called the Touch Bar, to control programmes on the main screen. The buttons, which change depending on what programmes the user is running, effectively act as a second screen, showing older versions of a picture being edited, for example. Other computer makers have chosen to use touch screens for the main display screen, including Microsoft’s first-ever desktop and a revamped Surface Book laptop, launched on Wednesday. The MacBook Pro with Touch ID, Touch Bar and a 13-inch screen will start at US$1,799 (RM7,561), compared with US$1,299 for the previous 13-inch product.  Apple also will offer a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch ID and Touch Bar for US$1,499. The 15-inch notebook will start at US$2,399, compared with US$1,999 for the previous version. The Mac line accounted for about 11 per cent of Apple sales in the just-finished fiscal year, with the number of machines sold down by 10 per cent to 18.5 million. Apple has steadily upgraded components to the MacBook Pro, but the overall form has changed little, and PC Week described the unit being replaced as a “fossil” which had not had a major design change since 2013. Apple also announced a new TV App that would work on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad products, in an effort to make it easier to tune into programmes across devices. The company also said that it would integrate Twitter Inc feeds into live sports games on Apple TV, adding a social element to the product. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Huawei wants to beat Apple in smartphones in two years Five luxury laptops for stylish and powerful portable computing TAG Heuer invades Apple’s home turf with Silicon Valley office Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The update comes out at the same time as Final Cut Pro X 10.3, which was announced during Apple’s “hello again” media event. Apple’s patch notes for the update include a list of all codecs already supported in OS X and macOS. At the top of the patch notes, however, are three new codecs, as below.

By Danny Zepeda | October 27, 2016 Front Page /Computers/Gallery By Danny Zepeda | October 27, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo The biggest announcement Apple made today at its October event was the introduction of the Touch Bar on its new MacBook Pros. The new addition, which also comes with a Touch ID sensor, will come with the 13-inch and 15-inch version of laptops. Apple also introduced a non-Touch Bar Pro computer, but that one is mainly competing with MacBook Air users. The 13-inch version looks to replace last year’s model, which boasted a Retina display and already slim design with all the ports you could want. Those were the days of old because now you’re stuck with four USB-C ports and headphone jack. Granted, those USB-C ports handle everything, including charging and simultaneously display your MacBook onto an external display in the same port, but it’s a shame to lose MagSafe. The new MacBook Pro also sheds half a pound, down to just 3 pounds, and is even thinner than the MacBook Air. It also comes standard with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, no more 4GB/128GB configurations. The meat of this new MacBook is the Touch Bar, which adds a lot of functionality as new apps start to support it. It might take a second to get used to it, but once you learn to navigate around it, you’ll wonder how you ever got on without it. At least that’s what Apple is hoping for.

the rajam report about archive contact feed twitter 27th October 2016 permalink On Apple TV’s new “Discovery” app Peter Kafka, reporting at Recode: Apple plans to unveil its new version of a TV guide tomorrow during a product event in California. This is the next-generation TV guide concept we first told you about back in August. The idea is that Apple wants to make it easier to find and watch video content without requiring users to sift through a bunch of apps. Instead, Apple’s guide will aggregate and show content that’s available and then send users directly to that content via deep links. The feature is supposed to work on the Apple TV streaming box as well as on other iOS devices like iPhones. Not all major video providers will be participating, however, according to industry sources. Netflix, which has worked closely with Apple in the past — and has been a Siri voice search partner for Apple TV — won’t be part of the program, sources say. While everyone with a compatible device will be able to use the new guide, Apple wants to tie it in with a new “single sign-on” feature that it announced this past summer at its Worldwide Developers Conference. One of the biggest problems with the app-centric future of television is how fragmented the user experience has become. Each streaming service has its own UI, its own content library, its own recommendation engine (if it even has one), its own user credentials, and its own content restrictions. While Apple’s platforms now have Universal Search, there’s nothing connecting each of these services together. No single app gets a complete picture of the user’s viewing habits, which undermines how effective recommendations can be1. A system-level feature which aggregates the content and usage data across discrete apps fixes a lot of these issues. As for why Netflix is opting out of this app, I have 2 theories: Netflix views usage data as highly confidential, proprietary information. They don’t even share this data with their show creators, so there’s no way in hell they would share this data with a partner who, it could be argued, is trying to disintermediate them. Netflix also doesn’t need help curating and personalizing their content library, they are already the best in the industry. Almost all of the other video apps need all the help they can get. Consider HBO GO/NOW, one of the most popular premium video apps, which has been on the market since 2010. There’s little personalization besides the user’s Watchlist. Every user who opens the HBO app has the same content surfaced to them. There’s little useful curation beyond a few small collections of “What’s New” or “Featured” and even then it’s clearly an afterthought rather than a core feature of the service. This seems to be the case with almost every video app that isn’t Netflix, Amazon, or YouTube2. Personal example: I’ve seen every single episode of “Louie” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” on Netflix, but Hulu keeps recommending both shows to me. ↩ In general, I think Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube are best in class with regards to personalization. Hulu has a personalized queue and some basic “Top Picks for You”, but little beyond that. ↩ About

These minor details are a bit on the technical side, but they might be important if you’re contemplating purchasing a new MacBook Pro. Here are a few things you should know before you take the plunge and buy the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Up to 100% faster flash storage. MacBook Air still exists along with every other MacBook model. New MacBooks have headphone jacks. Any USB-C port can be used to power the computer.

Much of the event was actually spent covering existing features, demoing the Touch Bar, and highlighting Apple TV capabilities, allowing us to condense the full 82 minute presentation into four minutes. If you missed Apple's keynote, our recap is a great way to get caught up without having to invest an hour and a half. Apple's new MacBook Pro models feature a thinner, lighter body, better battery life, upgraded processors, improved displays, and the aforementioned Touch Bar, but all that innovation comes at a price, which has many customers disappointed. Apple is charging $1,799 in the United States for the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro model with a Touch Bar, and the 15-inch MacBook Pro models start at $2,399. While the MacBook Pro was the main highlight of the event, Apple also introduced a new Accessibility site, 4K and 5K monitors from LG, a new Apple TV app that serves as a TV guide to help users find what to watch. For a more in-depth look at everything that's new today, make sure to check our full event recap post.

Videos have gradually been emerging from the hands-on area, and we’ve rounded them up below… Laptop Magazine’s Mark Spoonauer went hands-on with both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar. Spoonauer showed off the Touch Bar’s ability to change depending on what app is open, as well as the default function row icons. Additionally, the design and size of both the 13-inch and 15-inch models are shown off, as well. Finally, Touch ID functionality is also demonstrated. Touch ID, of course, will allow for the MacBook Pro to be unlocked more easily, as well as for Apple Pay purchases to be completed without the need for authentication with another device. Engadget also took a look at the 2016 MacBook Pro, noting of the new slimmer design, as well as the USB-C ports, Touch Bar, Touch ID, and much more. The Touch Bar is showcased in use with Safari, with bookmarks and other quick links intelligently appearing. Next up is SlashGear, who spent some time with Apple’s new laptops, as well. The blog again highlights the Touch Bar and its intelligent app switching, specifically in iMessage and its ability to show emoji and Tapback options. The video also shows the ability to customize the icons that appear in the Touch Bar. The general consensus from early hands-on seems to be that Apple has a solid update on its hands with the new MacBook Pros. The design, while similar to the previous generation, is slimmer and lighter, making it easier to carry around for extended periods of time. Additionally, the Touch Bar seems to work very well and is incredibly quick to update as you move around various apps and interfaces. It’s also nice to see that the Touch Bar is customizable to the degree that it is, and open to third-party developers. View a few more hands-on videos with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros below, as well as one video with Apple’s new TV app for Apple TV.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Related Coverage Apple delays its AirPods launch Apple’s quarterly sales fall, but forecast calls for gains CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — Apple‘s high-end Mac laptops are getting a touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard, as the company aims to spark consumer interest in a product line that’s often overshadowed by newer gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The new Touch Bar in the long-awaited Mac updates replaces the old function keys on a traditional laptop, offering a variety of controls that change according to the app or website that’s open. It also has functions that will be familiar to many iPhone users — showing word suggestions as you type, for example, or letting you scroll through a library of emojis. Along with faster processors and brighter screens, Apple’s new laptops will have a fingerprint sensor, similar to the one on its iPhones. The sensor can unlock the device or recognize a different user and quickly switch to that person’s settings. It works with Apple Pay, so users can authorize an electronic payment for online purchases. NEW FEATURES, HIGHER PRICE At least for now, the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features will be available only on higher-end models — a 13-inch MacBook Pro starting at about $1,800 and a 15-inch MacBook Pro at $2,400. Apple also introduced a $1,500 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar, but with other improvements. Apple will continue to sell older, less expensive MacBook and MacBook Air laptops. The company unveiled the laptops at its headquarters, where executives showed how the Touch Bar works with a variety of apps and software — providing playback and editing controls for videos or music, for example, and search functions for Apple’s maps and photos apps. Apple is also opening the Touch Bar to work with outside software, including Adobe’s Photoshop editing program and Microsoft’s Word, PowerPoint and Skype. In keeping with recent updates to other Apple products, the company is also replacing some computer ports with new outlets compatible with USB-C standards. They can be used both for charging and transferring data. Connectors with USB-C technology can transmit data faster than older USB jacks. They are also smaller and have a symmetric shape, which means the USB-C jack can be inserted with either side facing up. But older USB printers and other devices will need adapters. LAPTOPS VS. TABLETS The changes to the Mac are the first significant ones in years. Sales of the Mac have been in a slump this year, after a streak of growth in 2014 and 2015 that seemed to defy global trends. Consumers generally are buying fewer PCs and using smartphones or tablets instead. Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as a device capable of replacing the laptop for many users. And in contrast with the Mac’s earlier years — when Apple marketed its computers to people who saw themselves as creative professionals or just independent thinkers — Apple has begun promoting the Mac as a computer for businesses that once mostly used competitors’ PCs running Microsoft’s Windows software. Microsoft, meanwhile, has begun selling its own line of high-end Surface laptops and this week introduced its first Surface desktop PC. Like the iMac in years past, analysts say the new Surface machine has a premium price and features that will most likely appeal to visual designers and other creative professionals. Microsoft has boasted about modern controls with touch screens; the Touch Bar is Apple’s answer to that, placed near the keyboard where people’s fingers are already. For Apple, the Mac line has been eclipsed financially by other products — first the iPod and now the iPhone — that have made far more money in recent years. Apple sold $22.8 billion worth of Macs in its past fiscal year, although that was just 11 percent of the company’s total revenue. It sold $136 billion worth of iPhones. In the most recent quarter, Apple sold 9.3 million iPads and 4.9 million Macs, although the iPads accounted for just $4.3 billion in sales while the Macs contributed $5.7 billion. But the Mac has remained a significant product for Apple, since co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the first model in 1984, and it commands intense loyalty from fans. “The Mac is more than a product to us. It’s a testament to everything we do and everything we create at Apple,” CEO Tim Cook said Thursday. BABY STEPS IN TV Cook also used the event to promote a newer endeavor, Apple TV, and a new unified menu feature that shows recommendations and recently watched shows, so viewers don’t have to search through different apps to find them. Amazon’s Fire TV is taking a similar approach with a software update, though the unified experience will be part of the home screen, not an app. Apple’s app, though, is short of a full-fledged streaming-TV service, which reports say Apple has been pursuing. Rather, it brings together TV shows and movies viewers already get through individual subscriptions. The TV app will be synced with iPhones and iPads, so viewers can catch the next episode regardless of device. Apple said its Siri voice assistant will also direct viewers to live events, such as streaming sports. Apple said Apple TV already has 8,000 apps, including more than 2,000 games. The addictive building game “Minecraft” will come later this year. In a minor setback, meanwhile, Apple said Wednesday that it’s delaying shipment of its new wireless earphones, called AirPods, which had been scheduled for late October. In a statement, the company said, “We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Apple didn’t elaborate. ___ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Apple's MacBook lineup: What you need to know 0 Share: Laptops by Scott Stein October 27, 2016 2:11 PM PDT @jetscott Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech The new MacBook Pro: How Apple added touch without a touchscreen Apple's latest laptops have a particularly neat trick up their sleeves. by Dan Ackerman 2:16 Close Drag Apple's MacBook lineup has finally been updated, which is great news. But what does that mean, and what laptops are available? Here's what you need to know after Apple's event. Top-end: Apple's new MacBook Pro The newest MacBook Pro line comes in three flavors: two 13-inch models, and a 15-inch. They all have thinner bodies, larger touchpads and faster processors, and all ports have shifted to a USB-C type Thunderbolt 3 connection. But the upper-end 13-inch and all 15-inch Pros have a Touch Bar with Touch ID, which steals the show. The mini touch strip contextually changes to icons in different apps. Sliders, hot keys and function buttons emerge on the fly as needed, almost like a bit of an iPad flew onto the keyboard of the MacBook. 60 Apple MacBook Pro swaps outdated function keys for Touch Bar Both models have: A shallower butterfly keyboard, like the 12-inch MacBook Brighter display, better color gamut than older MacBook Pros Louder speakers New Thunderbolt 3 ports that convert to other needs, using USB-C style port design The OLED Touch Bar and Touch ID fingerprint sensor Headphone jacks (as do all MacBooks, don't worry) Space gray or silver color More on Apple's event Apple's amazing strip show reinvents the laptop keyboard Photos from Apple's Hello Again Mac event See all of our Apple event coverage The 13-inch Touch Bar-enabled MacBook Pro has: 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, upgradable to 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 Intel Iris 550 graphics A 13.3 inch 2,560x1,600-pixel display 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports 8GB RAM, upgradable to 16GB 256GB SSD, upgradable to 1TB Starts at $1,799, £1,749 or AU$2,699 The 15-inch MacBook Pro has: 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, upgradable to 2.7 GHz quad-core i7 AMD Radeon Pro 450 graphics with 2GB of GDDR5, upgradable to Radeon Pro 455 15.4-inch 2,880x1,800-pixel display 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports 8GB RAM, upgradable to 16GB 256GB SSD, upgradable to 2TB Starts at $2,399, £2,349 or AU$3,599 47 All the action at Apple's Hello Again event A more affordable 13-inch MacBook Pro ditches the OLED Touch Bar and saves some money Another entry-level MacBook Pro aims to be the budget model, minus that crazy magic Touch Bar. Also, it only has two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt support instead of four. But you save a few hundred dollars or pounds. Who's it for? Maybe someone who was looking for a new 13-inch MacBook Air, because this is the closest you'll get. 2x Thunderbolt 3 USB-C type ports 2GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, upgradable to 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 Intel Iris 540 graphics Starts at $1,499, £1,449 or AU$2,199 Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET The smallest 12-inch MacBook stays as-is The super-thin 12-inch MacBook is Apple's tiniest laptop. It was updated back in March, and it's still the same now. Has only one USB-C port, which isn't as fast as the Thunderbolt 3-capable ones on the Pros Has a 12-inch, 2,304x1,440-pixel display 2.03 pounds (920 grams) 8GB RAM, 256/512GB SSD options Around 10 hours of battery Comes in four colors (rose gold, space gray, silver and gold) $1,299/$1,599, £1,249/£1,549 or AU$1,999/AU$2,449 Exclusive interview Does the Mac still matter? The MacBook Air remains as-is, too If you always liked Apple's older, non-Retina MacBook Air, good news: it's still here. And it's unchanged. 13-inch, 1,440x900-pixel display 2x USB ports, Thunderbolt and an SD card slot, plus MagSafe charge connector 8GB RAM, 128/256/512GB SSD $999, £949, AU$1,549 and up The 11-inch MacBook Air is education-only now Sorry, if you want a small MacBook, you'll need to be associated with a school or university, find one for sale online somewhere or get the new 12-inch MacBook instead. The older MacBook Pro laptops are still around, it seems Looking to buy one of those older MacBook Pros without USB-C, and good old-fashioned MagSafe connectors? They're still on Apple's website, strangely. They cost a little less, but do a little less. However, they pack a more diverse set of older ports. So, which MacBook do you get? Good question. Apple hasn't made the decision any easier...in fact, you could say Apple added yet another option with the toolbar-free 13-inch MacBook. The 13-inch MacBook Pro seems great if money is no object; but the step-down version probably fits the bill for more people. The 12-inch MacBook is attractive, but probably too limited for hardcore users. The 15-inch model is the one to get for graphics-needy functions. Stay tuned for full reviews, of course. I feel more confused by the new MacBook lineup than before, but maybe choice is a good thing.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Hours before the new MacBook's are Introduced, Apple's UK Trademark Filing for 'Touch Bar' Surfaces | Main | Apple Executives Continue to Hold the Philosophy that Touch Screens Aren't Right, but Not Everyone Agrees » October 27, 2016 Today's Apple Event Focused on the All-New 'Touch Bar' for MacBook Pro   Just before the Apple Event started we posted a report on Apple's official trademark filing for 'Touch Bar' that surfaced in the UK. Apple began the keynote telling us that it was the twenty-fifth anniversary of Apple's notebooks. They rifled through the breakthroughs for their notebooks over the years which led to today's big breakthrough feature called the Touch Bar. Apple's new mid to high-end MacBook Pro's will include the new contextual 'Touch Bar' that replacing the traditional F-Keys bar. Every time you open an Apple app such as Mail, Safari, Photos, Keynote or Final Cut Pro, the Touch Bar controls will automatically change to give you a faster way to work. It's a whole new productivity tool that truly adds a new dimension to the MacBook Pro. The new Touch Bar also introduces Touch ID for the MacBook, a feature that we covered in a patent report back in 2015. The new MacBook Pro also introduced an updated keyboard with second generation butterfly keys. Whether this fully matches Apple's latest patent features isn't known at this time, but the patent was discussing the next generation of butterfly keys. The actual Touch Bar was covered in a report in August pointing to a patent going back to 2012. Lastly, the MacBook Pro's high-end model does indeed include an AMD graphics card based on the Polaris Architecture as we reported on back in April. You could find more about Apple's new MacBook specifications here and about the new individual features here.       And what would an Apple Event be without a new Jony Ive video?     It must be said that most analysts and major Apple blogs were hoping for a lot more at this event. The big miss was without a doubt an iMac refresh going into the all-important holiday season. Others were expecting the Mac Pro to be updated and an all new standalone display to replace their defunct Thunderbolt model.   Yet the rest of the Mac line-up is likely to be refreshed in the first half of 2017. In September we posted a report titled "Future iMacs Supporting Intel's 7th Gen Core will usher in Immersive Internet Era." In that report we pointed to Intel's Navin Shenoy, VP, GM Client Computing Group who clearly pointed out that the new Seventh-Gen Core processors for desktops were only coming to market in early 2017. So technically the delay in updating the iMac is squarely on Intel for dropping the ball. Most people purchase major ticket computers at Christmas, so what were they thinking?   Yet with that said, Apple could have presented a 'sneak peek' of the next-gen iMac and tell us that it would be launching sometime in March or April (or whenever). There's nothing like a great movie trailer to pump up an audience prior to a movie debuting at a later time and Apple could have done that here.   Of course all die-hard Apple fans will patiently wait to upgrade their iMac and/or Mac Pro in 2017 without blinking. But those who are able to run macOS and Windows 10 fluently, there are certainly more choices out there than ever before if your system is on its last legs.    Yesterday Microsoft introduced their all-new 'Surface Studio' desktop aimed at Pro creatives like animators and graphic artists. The system's hot 28" PixelSense Display offers 63% more pixels than a 4K television. They also introduced the 'Surface Dial' which is a new tool for artists that is generated a lot of buzz in the press. Amazingly for an all-in-one design they were able to jam it with a whopping 32GB RAM. Yet without a doubt Microsoft's first generation of Surface Studio is aiming squarely at the higher-end creative community, a market which has traditionally been a stronghold for Apple. It's a market that won't blink at the US$3000 starting price.    For the mid-range (AIO) All-In-One Computer, HP reinvented their desktop systems so that the brains of the computer now resides at the base of the display so that the displays could be lighter and much, much thinner. One of the features that many will appreciate is their all-new pop-up camera and microphone. When a user needs to start their Windows system in the morning using their biometrics system associated with 'Hello Windows' or when holding a video conference, the user taps the top of the display and the camera and microphone pops-up. When not needed it tucks back into the display. This way there's no need for user's taping over the camera for fear of snoopers. The new HP (AIO) desktops are also priced for mainstream wallets. See the video below that focuses on the new HP Envy features.     So over this holiday season, the iMac will have a lot of competition aimed at the general consumer who doesn't particularly care about the operating system for simply writing the odd Word report, be on social media or play games.   Considering that Apple just came off its weakest year in over a decade, I was surprised at how little was refreshed today. Apple is such a huge company with so many engineering teams and to have only updated their MacBook Pro line-up was baffling.   Then again, if you happen to be ready to upgrade your MacBook Pro, then today was certainly a great day with Apple putting all of their weight behind a dozen or more refinements to make this MacBook Pro upgrade a great buy for the holidays.   At the end of the day, did today's Apple Event live up to your expectations?

By Chris Mills on Oct 27, 2016 at 5:50 PM Email @chrisfmills Computers Share This Story Tweet Like Share Submit Shop ▾ Today, Apple announced two new MacBook Pros. Microsoft announced a new and upgraded Surface Book yesterday. There’s only one thing to do: compare specs, judge designs, and declare a winner. DON’T MISS: Everything you need to know about Apple’s new MacBook Pro There are two (really three!) versions of the MacBook Pro: 13-inch models with and without the OLED mutli-touch panel, and a 15-inch model that has to have the touch panel. On the Surface side, there’s only one chassis, the convertible 13-inch model. But there are a range of different specs you can buy, most notably versions with and without discrete graphics. So let’s take a look at how the different versions stack up. Specs The base 13-inch MacBook Pro ships with a 2.0GHz Core i5, with 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that all the way up to a 3.3GHz Core i7, 16GB of storage and a 1TB SSD if you want. The Surface Book starts at $1,500 also, but with a lower-specced 128GB/8GB/Core i5 version. For that, you are getting a touchscreen and a stylus however. The real advantage goes to the Surface Book in the higher configurations. You can get a version of the Surface Book with a discrete graphics card for $1,900, and upgrade that to a version with a more powerful GTX 965M graphics card and a Core i7 for $2,400. To get discrete graphics from a MacBook Pro, you have to buy a 15-incher. It comes with a Core i7 and 16GB of RAM as standard, starting at $2,400 also. Basically, you’re getting similar performance from the cheapest 13-inch Pro and the cheapest Surface Book. But Microsoft wins this, because you can get the performance of the 15-inch MacBook Pro, for the same price, in a much smaller body. Assuming you don’t want to lug a 15-inch laptop around but you need real graphics performance, the Surface Book is your only option. Design and Size Apple made a big deal of how thin the 13-inch Pro is, and for good reason. It’s a consistent 14.9mm thick, which is somehow thinner than the MacBook Air. The Surface Book is quite a lot thicker at its widest point, because of the “hinge gap” between the screen and keyboard. But at its thinnest point, it’s actually a whole millimeter thinner than the Pro. On weight, the difference is more noticeable. The new MacBook Pro is an even three pounds, while the Surface Book tips the scales at 3.63 pounds. Of course, the big design difference between the two is that the Surface Book’s screen detaches to become a tablet, while the MacBook Pro is just a laptop. I’m willing to be that a lot of people don’t care at all to have a 13-inch tablet as well as a laptop, but then again, I assume people have bought the iPad Pro. Touch Input The biggest change to the MacBook Pro is the addition of the new Touch Bar. On the $1,800 model and up, the row of function keys along the top of the keyboard have been changed to a multi-touch, multi-function OLED display. In regular use, the Touch Bar will display common controls like brightness and volume. When you delve into an application, the bar switches to provide specific functions, like tools in Photoshop or a scrolling bar for watching video. Apple spent a lot of time and effort on stage trying to convince us that it’s a better system than a regular keyboard and mouse, or a touchscreen for that matter. For some applications — and for general browsing around the laptop — it does look fun, but playing a whole DJ set using a tiny touch bar is a bit of a reach. The Surface Book goes the other way, with a full touchscreen and pressure-sensitive stylus. Because you can flip the screen around to turn the entire laptop into one big tablet, it is better for something like drawing, and it gives you the option to annotate documents or the like. But because it’s more effort to reach all the way up to the screen (or pull out the stylus), it’s probably going to get used less than the Touch Bar. Overall, Touch Bar is better for small stuff, touchscreen is better for working on bigger projects. We’ll call this one a tie until we can try both in the real world. Ports The MacBook Pro has four amazing ports! Unfortunately, they’re all the same, and you probably don’t own anything that works with them. That’s right: Apple has fully bought into the USB-C craze, and equipped the MacBook Pro with four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports. (There’s only two ports on the base 13-inch MacBook Pro, though.) This is probably a good thing in the long run, since USB-C is an icnredibly versatile standard that can exchange data, power a display or even charge your laptop, all at the same time. But in the immediate future, it’s bound to be far less useful that the Surface Book’s selection. Ever model of the Surface Book has two USB ports, a mini DisplayPort for connecting to monitors, a charging port, and an SD card reader. Point Microsoft. Pricing This one’s pretty much a wash. Both laptops start at $1,5000, although for the price, you get 256GB of storage for the MacBook Pro vs 128GB on the Surface Book. The impressive thing on Microsoft’s end is that for the same price as the base MacBook, you get a fully convertible laptop/tablet, with a stylus, with virtually the same specs as the new MacBook Pro.

At an event held at its Cupertino, California headquarters, the company showed off two new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro notebooks. Both include a new display called the Touch Bar at the top of the keyboard. The display, positioned where the function keys used to exist, allows you to control Mac apps with your fingertips. It will adjust in real time based on what software, such as Photoshop, you’re using. The devices feature a trackpad double the size of its previous models. But the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 23% smaller in volume and considerably thinner than the previous version. The smaller version weighs just three pounds — the 15-inch MacBook Pro clocks in at one pound more. Touch ID is also coming to the MacBook Pro, located next to the Touch Bar. You can use it for security, like logging into your computer or switching between users, and access Apple Pay with the touch of your fingerprint. With an Intel Core i7 processor and a new graphics card, the 15-inch MacBook Pro is more than twice as fast as the previous 15-inch model. The 13-inch model also features improved speed and performance. Apple is also making a model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with traditional function keys with no Touch Bar. The product is meant to appeal to potential 13-inch MacBook Air buyers — its smaller and thinner (and more affordable) laptop. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is priced at $1799, while the 15-inch model is $2399. The MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar costs $1499. The cheapest version will start shipping on Thursday, while the Touch Bar models will be available in two to three weeks. Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the event by announcing a TV app which lets you access content across other apps. A feature called “Up Next” allows you to toggle between what you’re watching on your mobile device and the TV (i.e. you’ll be able pick up where you left off in a movie bought on iTunes, or a TV show from HBO Now). The free app will roll out by the end of the year. Cook added that 8,000 apps are now available on Apple TV — 2,000 of which are games. Popular game Minecraft will be coming to the platform soon. “We believe the future of TV is apps,” Cook said. However, the company didn’t announce any updates coming to the iMac desktop computer. We also didn’t learn more about when consumers can buy a pair of AirPods, Apple’s new wireless earbuds teased at the iPhone event last month. The company said on Wednesday it is delaying the launch for an unknown amount of time. Although the iPhone remains the company’s biggest moneymaker, Mac sales accounted for 12% of revenue in the third quarter of 2016. Earlier this week, Apple reported an annual sales decline for the first time since 2001. It’s uncertain if Thursday’s news will drum up consumer excitement and spark an uptick in sales.

The 13-inch model with physical buttons is shipping to Canada starting today, while the other two versions are now available for pre-order and will ship in two to three weeks. While I’ve only spent a brief amount of time with the laptop, I walked away from the experience impressed. At least at the outset, Apple’s new MacBook Pro is a worthy upgrade to the Cupertino, California-based company’s line of laptops. The Touch Bar could be revolutionary The new Pro’s marquee feature is the oft-leaked Touch Bar, which actually happens to feel less like a screen and more like a touch panel due to its textured matte finish. This gives the buttons a physical feel despite the fact that they’re still contextual. The secondary display also isn’t bright, which ensures it isn’t distracting, though because it’s always changing you’ll need to look at it fairly constantly and this could make it difficult to use when rapidly jumping between apps. In terms of brightness, the light of the Touch Bar is probably about the same as the keyboard’s backlight. The key to the Touch Bar actually making sense for everyday users is app developers utilizing it in a way that’s comprehensible. In the short period of time that I tested out the matte touch panel, it worked great for adjusting simple options like volume, altering settings in Photoshop, as well as applying filters in Photos and working through emails at a rapid pace. Buttons can also be rearranged and moved around the panel, allowing you to customize them how you see fit. However, I’m not sold on the Mail-related features that allow you to long-press to reply to messages and fill in text with quick prompts as well as add emoji. It’s unclear if this will be the case across the board when it comes to apps that take advantage of the feature. The Touch ID fingerprint scanner Apple discussed during its keynote is located on the right-hand side of the laptop’s Touch Bar. While I didn’t get to test out the feature myself, it seemed to work well enough when I watched an Apple representative demonstrate it. It’s also worth noting that holding down the Touch ID button turns off the computer as well, though I didn’t see this feature in action during my brief hands-on time with the new MacBook Pro. Butterfly keyboard strikes again I may be in the minority with this one, but I’m a fan of the 2015 and 2016 MacBook’s Butterfly keyboard. I disliked it at first, but the longer I spent with the computer, the more I began to appreciate the keyboard. That keyboard is back, for better or worse, in the new MacBook Pro, though the keys do feel like they have slightly improved travel and accuracy. For some, this could be a deal breaker. There’s a vocal demographic out there that absolutely hates this keyboard. The new MacBook Pro’s trackpad, on the other hand, is enormous and significantly larger than the one present on the older MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. It feels just as accurate as the trackpad featured in the previous iterations of the Air and Pro too. Palm-rejection also feels accurate, though again, I’ve only spent a small amount of time with the laptop. While a Retina screen is standard in most of Apple’s Mac products now, it’s still worth noting that at least at the outset, the 2016 Pro’s display is vibrant, bright and full of colour depth, especially in Apple’s dimly lit hands-on demo room. Thinner than the MacBook Air Let’s get this out of the way first: the 2016 Pro is not as light as the 2015 or 2016 12-inch MacBook, though it does feel considerably lighter than past iterations of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, measuring in at about 1.3kg (approximately 3 pounds). The wedge shape present in the MacBook Air and Pro is also a thing of the past, with Apple adopting a flat form factor for the Air. Some probably won’t like this shift but I’ve never found the wedge look aesthetically pleasing and prefer a more uniform form factor. Port-wise the new Pro comes equipped with 4 Thunderbolt USB-C ports and any of these ports can apparently be used to charge the device, which will come as a relief to those who were frustrated with the 12-inch MacBook. USB-C is an obstacle right now so you’ll have to adopt the #donglelife, but the port technology really is the future. This is a period of transition and utilizing a dongle is a fact of life when you’re an early adopter. Adapters are annoying, it’s true, but until USB-C becomes standard, which could take a number of years, this is set to be the new normal. Still, it’s impossible to deny that including some sort of dongle with the Pro would have made this less of an issue. And yes, you guessed it, the Pro does include a 3.5mm headphone jack, unlike the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus of course. Specs and pricing In terms of specs, the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,899 CAD and comes equipped with an Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Iris Graphics 540, 8GB of RAM, 256Gb of storage and a 13.3-inch LED backlit IPS display with a 2560 x 1600 227 ppi pixel resolution. Another more high-end 15-inch iteration of the laptop, priced at $2,999, rocks an Intel Core i7 and a Radeon Pro 450 or Pro 455 graphics card, 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and a 2880 x 1800 pixel resolution display. While far from a gaming PC, these specs are a significant improvement over the current Pro and Air models. There’s also a 13-inch MacBook Pro that starts at $1,899 that doesn’t include the Touch Bar, which, while the panel is the marquee feature of this refresh, could appeal to those looking to save a few hundred dollars. It’s difficult to pass judgment on the new Pro given the brief amount of time I’ve spent with the laptop, but I’m impressed with what I’ve experienced so far. The Touch Bar is impressive and could truly be extremely useful, its revamped look and size is great and its upgraded internals are long-overdue. However, for some, this might not be enough, especially those expecting a total and complete overhaul of the concept of a laptop. We’ll have more on the new 2016 MacBook Pro, including a full review, in the coming weeks. Do Do I can’t see anyone upgrading from a 2012 and later model, maybe 4 years when the next one comes out but you’re getting slightly more speed and an oled. Ya, I’ll pass for now And that replacement for the “Air” is a joke from what I can tell. It’s basically the 13″ pro without oled and 2 less ports, for a little less money. WTF? Bryan Breguet Why? Windows 10 is so superior. Do Do LOL In your opinion, as a 30 year “windows” user, IMO macOS, at this time, is far superior. MS simply had to improve on Windows 7 NOT force us into the spyware generation of their OS and maybe some minor cosmetic changes. As is, Window 10 is simply a marketing/advertising platform created to make MS more money not make the users experience any better. That’s not to say macOS is perfect, far from, I’m not a batty apple fanboy, but at this time macOS is far superior to Window 10 IMO. Bryan Breguet I can’t stand the user experience and the closeness of macOS. The windows management alone is enough to drive me crazy. You should also remove this tinfoil hat off you head. Croc Ography Completely agree the windows management on MacOS Is usable for me as well. (mother-daughter windows are a must have for me) Do Do “You should also remove this tinfoil hat off you head.” Words of a fool, if you can’t make your point without insulting someone, it’s a good indication you should avoid trying to make any point as you’re probably lacking enough intelligence to accomplish your task. Bryan Breguet If somebody made a fool of himself here, it’s you in your first comment. Also, I didn’t insult you previously. Maybe remove your over-sensitivity hat as well? Do Do Like I said you’re a fool as you apparently can’t even recognize that suggesting someone should take his tin foil hat off is insulting. You’re also a fool because you cant understand my simple point. Lastly, I’m repeating what experts have said about Windows 10. A fool would argue with internet security experts. thomas nguyen Who’s more of a fool? The fool? Or the person following the fool? Do Do Right back where we started. That would make you the fool. The Iceman Cometh Much truth to your comment as I’ve also been a fan of OS X for some years now over Windows but recently I’ve been using W10 more and coming to like it more whereas really MacOS is just friggin stale. I mean what was the big update in Sierra? Incorporating Siri into the system? Big deal. I’ve updated and yet to use the feature to be honest whereas what MSFT is proposing with the Creator’s Update in 2017 is truly revolutionary in how we interact with devices. This is something you’d think Apple would come up with and yet stodgy old Microsoft is leading the way. Gerry Wolff Hey Pat, how much Apple pay you to write this “review” ? T-bar is gimmicky, prices, especially in Canada are outrageous and a Pro laptop without any ports that are most in use today, replaced with 4 least used ones requiring a bag of dongles is not my idea of progress. The fact that you cannot see anything wrong here, makes you a bought for journalist that’s afraid of not being invited back to their next event. I’m done with Apple, after 30 years !! jay there is the other guy from montreal and without seeing it he wrote how amazing it feels so you do not want to see that review. amazing product apple release over time….. ciderrules Ah, the typical conspiracy theorist. Can’t understand why someone likes an Apple product, so have to pretend the reviewer was paid off. Patrick O’Rourke This isn’t a “review.” It’s quick hands-on impressions after spending about 15 minutes with the laptop. Apple’s laptop prices have always been pretty crazy and you could say the same about Microsoft’s Surface Book and even the standard Surface. This is a high-end laptop with a high-end price tag. USB-C is the future of connectivity and if you can’t acknowledge that, then unfortunately you must not be that familiar with the tech industry. If you want to be an early adopter of tech like these, there’s going to be obstacles. This is how things have always worked. Henry Wilson > Apple’s laptop prices have always been pretty crazy This isn’t true at all. I was able to purchase the 15 inch macbook pro with the highest end dGPU in 2011 for 2300 canadian after taxes. The 2.7Ghz model with the 455 starts at 3500 before tax!! Even taking the Canadian dollar into consideration, the price increase is nothing short of ridiculous. The Iceman Cometh Well its greed. I mean the company wouldn’t be able to manage the incredible margins it realizes if the prices weren’t going up and suckers paying for it. No doubt Apple is in desperate need of some humble pie Patrick O’Rourke $2300 for a laptop is crazy. Croc Ography MOD – “Apple’s laptop prices have always been pretty crazy and you could say the same about Microsoft’s Surface Book and even the standard Surface. This is a high-end laptop with a high-end price tag.” — Major freaking difference: the touch screen and peripherals like the pen and dial completely change the way you interface with the device making it a much more compelling user experience. Your statement makes everyone erroneously believe that they are similar experiences with little to differentiate them. Patrick O’Rourke They may not offer similar experiences but they’re competing in the exact same space and going after similar segments of the market. I’ve interviewed the head of all things Surface related Panos Panay and he told me that Microsoft’s goal with the Surface line is compete directly with Apple in the high-end market. The Iceman Cometh In all fairness this new MacBook is nowhere near top-end regardless how you look at it. The specs are reminiscent of many of last years laptops and the fact that that you could say the Surface Book or Pro is somehow in line with this product is specious at best. The number of things you can do with a Surface product now, especially after their announcements earlier this week, just speaks to how far behind Apple is and that most of what they are selling now is truly gimmicky as others point out. I said it before on an earlier thread but these guys are really falling behind their competitors and seem to think that getting rid of things function keys and standardizing USB-C is the ‘cutting edge’ when it just ain’t. I don’t believe you’re paid to shill for one company or another but I also have yet to read a ‘review’ or any impression of yours about an Apple product that is critical in a sensible way and let’s face it, there is MUCH to be critical of with this company and its lacklustre offerings. Patrick O’Rourke If you can’t acknowledge that USB-C isn’t the future of connectivity then you just haven’t been following the tech industry. Sure, it causes problems now, but in two years it’s going to be the standard. Every device is switching to USB-C. If I like a product or a feature, I’m not going to be dishonest and say I don’t in order to move my opinion in-line with others, that’s just a disservice to our readers. I think the Touch Bar is awesome and could evolve into something really great, but it also could wind up being a disaster for Apple, and I say that in the story. Before knocking a feature like the Touch Bar, give it a shot and try to understand what it’s for. It’s easy to dismiss it as a gimmick from the short sizzle reel Apple showed off, but I think there’s much more to it then that. BetelgeuseOrion if USB C is the future why does the iPhone 7 not have it? and dont say “because of courage” The Iceman Cometh Yeah. Windows Lumia phones do. lol! Its certainly an inconsistent view. The Iceman Cometh I never said USB-C isn’t the future of connectivity however its probably at least 3-4 years away from being totally standard with peripheral connections and most people aren’t going to be inclined to dump their existing hardware to accommodate USB-C. I feel that Apple should’ve kept 2 USB ports and 1 USB-C and I suspect the reason they didn’t go all in like last year’s MacBook with its one USB-C port is because of customer outrage. It’s all well and fine to be ahead of the game where the market is headed but you simply can’t ram this down peoples’ throats and expect them to shell out $2000 or more for the hardware that limits what they can use it for. In regards the Touch Bar I’m not convinced this is going anywhere and not just because its gimmicky and been tried before by other manufacturers, but because really it heavily relies upon the use of apps from the Mac App Store apparently. If you aren’t a big user of that stuff then its a pointless upgrade, something you alluded to in your article for those looking to save money going for the base model so I’ll give you that. The bottom line here is that for the price you are getting a quality product yes, but the functionality is limited compared to other devices on the market for similar price points and superior specs. You have to be a serious fan of MacOS to buy this or alternatively, require it for graphics design, photography and other multimedia uses these devices have been better at, but even that’s stretching it for some. jay apple price was not always crazy i bought a macbook air 13 inch for 999$ at staples and yeah price is a little high but fair because i use it a lot and love it. i would buy a macbook for 999$ but that is not the case those models are just crazy. start your review with the price and people not even reading it anymore. Patrick O’Rourke When the Air first released it cost over $2000 in Canada. When ever Apple revamps a product or releases a new iteration, it’s always astronomically priced. This is nothing new. jay look at that 3.5 headphone jack so apple has no more courage ? lol courage for a good price would be needed. so surface will win Marc Palumbo You’ll need courage when you buy this thing 🙂 simbob There is a typo in the scren resolution of the 13in mbp. Patrick O’Rourke Thanks. Fixed! simbob Also, it is becoming clearer and clearer than Apple is walking away from OSX and traditionnal machines now. The focus is on mobile. I feel like the current Thinkpad X1 lineup is a much better machine in the 13in market. At least they have propper FR-CA keyboards, something important to a large number of people in Canada. I hate how technology compagnies like apple have no considerations for peoples languages and just impose shody hybrid solutions. beyond What? They kept the headphone jack? I feel like they don’t know what they are doing and/or are experimenting. I mean if they are going to ditch it, why not ditch it in all their products to be consistent. Do Do Apparently they lacked the “courage” thomas nguyen No, the MacBook line does not “feature” courage, this will be in the mid year revision BetelgeuseOrion i think they will actually remove the ability to charge the laptop on your own, you will need to pay $20 for each recharge but it can last maybe 36 hours. that way they can get rid of the last port and just have nothing at all. Patrick O’Rourke As funny as these “courage” jokes are, when you look at the Pro, why would Apple remove the 3.5mm headphone jack? It’s a completely different device and use-case. Whether or not you feel’s Apple’s justification for the removal of the 3.5mm with the iPhone 7 is consumer friendly, there were obvious performance benefits. In the case of the Pro, there’s literally no reason to drop it. xxxJDxxx Different device, different use case, sure. But I use the headphone jack on my iphone 1000’s of times more than I have on my macbook. Patrick O’Rourke Definitely, that’s a fair point. thomas nguyen You’re right, it is a different use case, but let’s look at the day to day use, who uses the headphone jack on a phone vs on a laptop? And if you’re moving your company to a jackless future, you choose to segment off the highest use group and leave the laptop jack in place for no discernable reason (unless you think they cater to DJ’s that uses the headphone jack?). This decision makes no logical sense, and to hide it behind “courage” and the excuse that other jack is old so it has no use in our technology driven world is why we continue to make fun of Apple. PygmySurfer “It’s a completely different device and use-case.” Maybe I’m strange, but I like to use the same set of headphones with my phone that I do with my computer. Is Apple including a lightning->3.5mm adapter so I can use my iPhone 7 headphones with my fancy new MacBook? Or are they going to sell me that for $19? mwahahahaha How long is Apple going to milk this cow? Let’s fast forward and see… 2016 – no function keys – revolutionary! 2017 – no number keys – revolutionary! 2018 – no ‘letter ‘a’ key – revolutionary! 2019 – no letter ‘b’ key – revolutionary! … … 2043 – apple removes the ‘z’ key – revolutionary! 2044 – apple removes all remaining physical keys – revolutionary! 2045 – apple removes all remaining ports, hinges, buttons, and trackpad – extraordinary! 2046 – apple removes all physical materials and switches to holographic technology to project the MacBook pro in front of its users. With nothing to touch users must interact with the device using brain waves transmitted with Apples new product the iThought. Denis M. I’ve never had a Mac, can someone explain what is the function of the Fn key (bottom left side) that is still present on these new Macbooks with the touchbar? Joseph FN key is just a function key even on some PC’s you have the FN key usually it’s to allow you to get other functions out of your F1-F12 keys. Denis M. well, that’s my point. They removed the F keys, so why keep the Fn key any longer? Is it still used to switch something else? Aytisi FN can modify any key, not just the F1-F12 keys. Joel L. In the keynote, Federighi shows that holding down the Fn key restores f1-f12 on the touch bar The Finder lol I use an external keyboard and mouse, so I probably wouldn’t even use the touchbar. It would be funny if they made the touchbar one the default and the one with the function keys the one you pay extra for. But that would be kinda mean too. FlamesFan89 Touch typists everywhere are yawning, and going back to their mechanical keyboards and getting work done. babyface Apple has priced themselves out of the market as far as I’m concerned. They seem to have replaced innovation with gimmickry, as well. After using Macs for over 10 years, my next laptop will be something reasonably priced running Linux as I can’t stand Windows. Victor Victory I’m still waiting for 30th century laptops Pingback: MacBook Professional 2016 Arms-on: A future with out perform keys | nrt3 Technology Topic() jay Future is last year processor! BetelgeuseOrion So what i see here is Apple ripped off Microsoft’s Side show from Windows Vista (yes back in 2007, 10 years ago). they also ripped off Razer’s switchblade UI. how is this innovation again? also $1900 for a POS laptop with an i5? no dGPU? this thing is a sad piece of garbage with low-mid specs, how do “Pros” render anything on this thing? for $1900 i expect a quad core i7 (Kaby lake) with at least a nVidia pascal based GPU like a GTX1060 if not a 1070 and 6GB of ram. if its over $2K i expect a 1080. Being thin is useless for actual work, The older 13″MBP that i have is not too thick and neither is any other laptop in its price range. lol at keeping the 3.5mm jack, now your lightning headphones that came with the iphone are useless in this thing, they should maybe make up their minds about which ports they want to use, you want to go lightning or USB C? dont potato this and go half way. Cowpoke You done…? The Iceman Cometh Tell us how you really feel? You aint gonna get dGPU,, 6GB RAM, or an i7 prepackaged for $1900, although maybe its fair to expect that. Even MSFT doesn’t offer this kind of specs at that price. I agree the specs here don’t call for this kind of pricing and the inconsistencies with 3.5mm headphone jacks is certainly noteworthy but best to keep it in perspective. BetelgeuseOrion im not going to get a dGPU w/6GB for $1900? well then what the hell is this that im typing on? (GS43VR for $1849) go to reflexnotebook, newegg, any of the big online tech stores, click on gaming laptops, literally all of them match the specs i just posted for that price. hell for $1200 you can get an i7-6700HQ with a GTX960 which is faster than the fastest model they have for $4000. real work including compiling, rendering videos and editing pictures isnt done by how a laptop looks or how it makes your emotions feel, its done by the actual specs and processing power. Cowpoke Hot dang! But there’s a whole heap o’ cryin’ an’ whinin’ in these here comments. fruvous Finally! Apple had the courage to integrate 8 year old keyboard technology into their laptop. dave I am currently using a 2010 white macbook and am looking to upgrade to a 15″ macbook pro. Is now the time to upgrade? Marc Palumbo @disqus_0b1xODgsfg:disqus Why is the TouchBar revolutionary? It’s been done before multiple times. What makes it revolutionary? The Iceman Cometh Lenovo tried this to some effect not that long ago and really it didn’t go down well. BetelgeuseOrion when lenovo did it with the X1 carbon they got ripped a new A-hole by their consumer base, guess what the new model has? thats right, regular buttons ciderrules Because nobody cares about PCs. They’re all the same with hundreds of manufacturers all cranking out the same commodity devices. Just like nobody cares about Samsung specific features on their phones (like the edge display) and developers can’t be bothered to specifically code for it. You’d need to have Microsoft define a specification for something like a touch bar and build the APIs for it into Windows. PC makers have never been successful with their own custom features when trying to get developers on board. Apple has great success with this, though. All the major developers have already updated their software for the Touch Bar or are planning to. Just like developers are quick to code for iOS specific features. The Iceman Cometh What developers? Care to explain? I guess it’s like all those developers that immediately jumped on the Force Touch bandwagon and where in reality less than half bothered. Furthermore, the App Store for Mac is a different beast than the iOS version and many who make mobile apps do not do so for the Mac. You are really nothing more than a fanboy making unsubstantiated statements that can’t be taken seriously Patrick O’Rourke Marc, I did not say it’s definitely revolutionary; what I did say is that it could be if it pans out and third-party des jub on board. Yes, this has been attempted before, but not with this level level of potential developer support. Pingback: Did Microsoft out-Apple Apple?

Surface computers take aim at Macbook domain() Pingback: Microsoft's Surface computers take aim at Apple's Macbook domain – Rincon Intl News() alphs22 I’m generally an Apple guy, but some of the design choices here are indefensible. If you were to buy an iPhone 7, you can’t plug it in to the Macbook Pro without adapters. The pair of headphones that came with your new iPhone also can’t be used with the Macbook Pro. When you have two of your flagship products that can’t physically connect with each other, you have a problem. I’m still a fan of Apple’s end-to-end customer experience, but some of the design decisions under Tim Cook has been questionable to say the least. Was waiting for the new Macbooks, but will be buying a 2015 MBP for a discount instead. Cowpoke I think ol’ Cooky is too busy takin’ a bath if you follow my meanin’… Patrick O’Rourke The removal of the MagSafe definitely is a hit, that totally slipped my mind with this hands-on. hyperhyper I think @alphs22:disqus hit on something important below. Despite all the courage jokes for including a 3.5mm port and the fact that the biggest feature for this “this is your only choice if you only use Apple device” product is is a touch bar, I think he/she touched on a fundamental issue. Apple is expected to deliver a top notch end to end experience. It’s why one is willing to a price that is well beyond what the technology is actually worth. You don’t have to fuss with it, you don’t have to worry about wires, dongles and compatibility. That whole idea does not seem to exist anymore – last year’s single usb port fiasco, the dongle on dongle action going on with the iPhone 7 and now this shows that there is a lack of cohesive vision going on within Apple. I hate to bring up the Steve Jobs argument but do you really think you would see these Frankenstein like dongle/wire piles at coffee tables if he were guiding this? I love aesthetics as much as anyone but once it starts impacting me financially and with what I have to do after I buy an already overpriced device and realize what you need to buy after the fact just to have what you had before, you start to look elsewhere and see some pretty good alternatives. Yes, I realize it’s a ‘transition’ stage but there are much better ways of achieving this. I have devices that have current and future technologies built into it so I don’t have to go dongle crazy. Why did they choose not to go down this road and make the transition less expensive for their customers? The markup and profit margin on the MBPs would still be crazy/desire by any other company even if that they designed that in. Pingback: Did Microsoft out-Apple Apple?

It is also killing off Vine, a mobile video app where people share short video clips that play in a loop. While beloved by users, it never took off with the masses and has lost its lustre as of late. Twitter has failed to keep pace with rivals Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram and in recent months, rumours abounded that it would be acquired. CEO Jack Dorsey on Thursday quickly brushed aside what he called “recent market speculation.” ___ Rising star: YouTube playing key role in Google’s success SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — YouTube has emerged as a break-out star for Google. The popularity of the service has shifted a bigger chunk of advertising budgets from traditional network television programming to the eclectic mix of clips found on YouTube. And that is making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 per cent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 per cent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. ___ Amazon misses 3Q profit forecasts SEATTLE (AP) — Amazon.com Inc. shares fell in after-market trading on Thursday after the online retailer reported third-quarter net income that missed analyst expectations. The company said net income tripled to $252 million, or 52 cents per share, from $79 million, or 17 cents per share, in the prior-year quarter. That missed analyst expectations of 85 cents per share, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue jumped 29 per cent to $32.71 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Amazon has begun to balance spending with revenue more prudently and has reported a profit in each of the past five quarters. ___ Apple adds keyboard touch functions to Mac in major refresh CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — Apple unveiled long-awaited updates to its Mac computers Thursday, aiming to spark consumer interest in a product line often overshadowed by its other gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The company is adding a new touch-sensitive panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple’s top-of-the-line laptop. The Pro will also come with a fingerprint sensor, similar to one in the iPhone, to unlock the device. It can recognize different users and offer quick switching based on the fingerprint. The new Macs will also offer a dedicated key for the Siri voice assistant, a feature added with the MacOS Sierra update last month. ___ US stock indexes slip further, but bond yields surge NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks slipped for the third consecutive day Thursday as media and defence companies skidded. Bond yields climbed to their highest levels since May, which helped banks and hurt stocks that pay big dividends. Cable and TV companies and publishers sank, and industrial companies like Raytheon and L-3 Communications fell after reporting weak results. ___ Ford’s 3Q profit falls on recall, truck launch DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Troubles in Ford Motor Co.’s home market — including slowing U.S. sales, a massive recall and the difficult launch of new heavy-duty pickups — are hurting the company’s bottom line. Ford said Thursday its net income plunged 56 per cent to $957 million in the third quarter. Its adjusted results beat market expectations but that didn’t do much to offset concerns that Ford is headed for a rough patch. The company has already announced temporary plant shutdowns in North America this month to curb production, and plans more actions in the fourth quarter. ___ Aetna tops Street 3Q expectations, narrows 2016 forecast Aetna’s third-quarter earnings rose nearly 8 per cent to top Wall Street forecasts, as growing government business and cost cutting countered higher costs from the health insurer’s Affordable Care Act coverage. But the nation’s third-largest insurer narrowed its 2016 forecast just below analyst expectations heading into the year’s final months, and its stock edged lower. Aetna’s enrolment in government programs like Medicaid and Medicare grew 11 per cent, to nearly 4.5 million people, and the insurer said Thursday that segment now contributes about half of its total health care premiums. ___ Altria to close 2 tobacco facilities affecting 580 workers RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said Thursday that it will close manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania and Illinois by early 2018, affecting about 580 workers. The company said about 200 jobs in different states will be available for those workers, if they choose to transfer. Altria did not say how many workers it expects to lay off. Full-time workers that do not transfer will be given a minimum of six months of severance, in addition to benefits and free job training, a spokesman said. ___ UPS 3Q profit up 1 per cent as US revenue increases DALLAS (AP) — UPS said Thursday that its third-quarter profit inched higher on growing revenue in the U.S. and a more profitable international delivery business. The package-delivery giant is heading into biggest test of the year, the holiday season. UPS expects to deliver more than 700 million packages between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve, about 100 million more than last year. The third-quarter profit was roughly in line with Wall Street expectations but revenue beat the forecasts. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate eases to 3.47 per cent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates declined this week, moving closer to historically low levels. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage eased to 3.47 per cent from 3.52 per cent last week. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 per cent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 per cent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, ticked down to 2.78 per cent from 2.79 per cent. ___ American and Southwest raises base fares by $5 each way DALLAS (AP) — American and Southwest are raising fares by $5 each way, the latest move by airlines to reverse a price slump that has lasted nearly two years. American Airlines Group Inc. raised prices first and Southwest Airlines Co. followed suit on Thursday, according to J.P. Morgan Securities and FareCompare. Both airlines confirmed the price increase. Fares have been falling since airlines began adding flights and seats faster than the growth in travel demand. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gave up 29.65 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 18,169.68. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 6.39 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,133.04. The Nasdaq composite sank 34.29 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 5,215.97. U.S. benchmark crude rose 54 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to $49.72 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, added 49 cents, or 1 per cent, to $50.47 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline remained at $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas added 3 cents to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

Skip to main content Apple Valley Review Main menu Home Arrest Logs Classifieds Community Events Contact Us Opinion Roy's 100th You are here Home Water still the main concern among Town Council candidates October 27, 2016 By Matthew Cabe Staff Writer APPLE VALLEY — Tuesday’s Town Council candidate forum at Rock Spring Senior Living Facility saw the five challengers continue efforts to separate themselves not from one another, but from the incumbents. Richard Bunck, Salvatore Ortiz-Lopez, Tom Piper, Jiles Smith and Bryen Wright were aligned on a number of key issues facing Apple Valley, and they criticized Councilors Art Bishop and Larry Cusack primarily on money the town has spent on its acquisition attempt of the water system currently owned by Liberty Utilities. Smith, who ran in two previous elections, characterized the nearly $1.6 million spent on acquisition since 2011 as wasteful, while newcomer Wright promised “fiscal responsibility” if elected. Both Wright and Piper were critical of the Apple Valley Golf Course, which showed a negative balance of more than $3.5 million in the town’s Enterprise Funds as of July 1, according to the town’s budget. Piper said he would “probably sell the golf course” if he were elected. Meanwhile, Ortiz Lopez attacked the town’s purchase of the Hilltop House, which he deemed irresponsible and a waste of taxpayer money, despite the town’s use of $160,000 National Park Service grant to fund nearly 52 percent of the property’s price tag. Among the challengers, Bunck was the most critical of the incumbents, referring to Cusack and Bishop as part of a “good ol’ boy” network and calling the Council corrupt. Bunck pledged that if he were elected, he would donate to charity the stipend Council members receive for public service, which Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin said is $811 per month plus a twice-per-month car allowance of $285. Meanwhile, Bishop and Cusack positioned themselves as part of a Council dedicated to “the future of the town.” Bishop, when asked about the $132,000 the town has spent on acquisition-related public relations services, said hiring outside help is “what good government does” because it allows staff to concentrate on a “daily routine” of providing services to residents. And Cusack pointed to residents who’ve let their lawns go brown amid rising water rates as one reason the town continues to fight for public ownership of water in Apple Valley.

 Apple's cord situation is completely out of control Kif Leswing Oct. 27, 2016, 5:23 PM 27,301 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple's newest computer, the MacBook Pro, looks pretty great: It's got fast chips, a good screen, MacOS, and a new kind of touchscreen keyboard it's calling the Touch Bar.  But I'm personally worried that buying the new MacBook Pro will doom me to carrying around various dongles for years, or as long as I'm in Apple's ecosystem. And you should be worried about that too.  In the company's zeal to move to next-generation connectors and future-proof devices, Apple's created a morass of different cords, dongles, and standards. Take a user who has an iPhone 7 and new MacBook Pro. That's Apple's core customer: someone with disposable income who wants the best computers. This person needs to think hard about what cords they are going to carry from day to day. The iPhone and MacBook Pro use different chargers, so that person would have to carry both. iPhones use Apple's proprietary Lightning charger. The new MacBooks use the relatively new open USB-C standard.  (That's not a big deal, although it's worth pointing out that if this person had a Google Pixel phone instead of an iPhone, their phone and computer could use the same charger. That's not very elegant, Apple.) Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Things get worse when you consider headphones. The new MacBook Pro has a headphone jack, so you can plug basically any pair of headphones into it. The iPhone 7, as you've probably heard, does not. Customers can use the dongle that comes with the iPhone 7 to use their laptop headphones with their iPhone. But if someone wants to use the Lightning Earpods that come with the iPhone 7, there's no way to plug them into your laptop, unless Apple makes another dongle — some kind of male USB-C-to-female-Lightning adapter. Of course, what Apple wants you to do is buy its new AirPods, which cost $159, and need to be charged too. AirPods haven't gone on sale yet because Apple says they're not ready.  And finally, just try to charge your phone from your laptop using the cord that comes with your iPhone. You can't — unless you have yet another adapter (this one USB-C to USB), which Apple will sell you for $19. A USB-C to Lightning Cable costs $25.  Apple Apple's insistence on using Lightning as its proprietary standard on its phone makes its choice to commit to USB-C on Mac a confusing one. I understand that ports change and technology has to change with it. But the whole reason to adopt open standards like USB-C is so things can be standardized. And USB-C can do a lot of different things, like power a monitor — so it can certainly charge a phone, handle headphones, or anything else Lightning does. It's madness. Apple's head of design Jony Ive said last month that "we believe in a wireless future." But my immediate future — deciding whether or not I buy a new MacBook Pro — looks to be full of different cords and dongles. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/ECpJ1dwEOK — Arvid Bräne ✌️ (@Kodagrux) October 27, 2016 EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Apple worked with LG to develop special 5K monitors for the MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro goes on sale today. The Macbook Pro with Touch Bar ship in 2 to 3 weeks. The new thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever features a breakthrough interface that replaces the traditional row of function keys with a brilliant, Retina-quality Multi-Touch display called the Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro features Apple’s brightest and most colorful Retina display yet, the security and convenience of Touch ID®, a more responsive keyboard, a larger Force Touch trackpad and an audio system with double the dynamic range. It’s also the most powerful MacBook Pro ever, featuring sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, up to 2.3 times the graphics performance over the previous generation, super-fast SSDs and up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The Touch Bar places controls right at the user’s fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar, Numbers, GarageBandm Final Cut Pro X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more. “This week marks the 25th anniversary of Apple’s first notebook; through the years each generation has introduced new innovations and capabilities, and it’s fitting that this all-new generation of MacBook Pro is the biggest leap forward yet,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With the groundbreaking new Touch Bar, the convenience of Touch ID, the best Mac display ever, powerful performance, improved audio, blazing fast storage and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity in our thinnest and lightest pro notebook yet, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced notebook ever made.” Building on innovations pioneered in MacBook®, the new MacBook Pro features an entirely new enclosure design and all-metal unibody construction that creates an incredibly rigid and dense notebook that is amazingly thin and light. At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 percent thinner and 23 percent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter. Integrated into the power button is the convenience and security of Touch ID, one of the great features customers have come to know and love from their iPhone® and iPad. Once you enroll your fingerprint in Touch ID on your MacBook Pro, you can quickly unlock your Mac®, switch user accounts and make secure purchases with Apple Pay® on the web with a single touch. Touch ID enables a quick, accurate reading of your fingerprint and uses sophisticated algorithms to recognize and match it with the Secure Enclave in the new Apple T1 chip. The best Mac display ever delivers images that are more vivid, reveal even greater detail and appear more lifelike than ever. As thin as a MacBook display at .88 mm, the Retina display on the new MacBook Pro at 500 nits of brightness, is an amazing 67 percent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 percent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support a wider color gamut. And with power-saving technologies like a larger pixel aperture, a variable refresh rate and more power-efficient LEDs, the display consumes 30 percent less energy than before. Powerful processors, cutting-edge graphics, blazing-fast SSDs, high-speed memory and an advanced thermal architecture deliver amazing pro-level performance in a dramatically thinner enclosure. Sixth-generation dual-core Core i5 with eDRAM, dual-core Core i7 with eDRAM and quad-core Core i7 Intel processors deliver pro-level processing performance while conserving energy. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro features powerful Radeon Pro discrete graphics delivering up to 2.3 times more performance than the previous generation; while the 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics that are up to two times faster than before. All models feature SSDs with sequential read speeds over 3GBps and Thunderbolt 3 which consolidates data transfer, charging and twice the video bandwidth in a single port — allowing users to drive a 5K display and power their MacBook Pro with a single cable. The New MacBook Pro Also Offers: • Much larger Force Touch trackpads — 46 percent larger on the 13-inch MacBook Pro and twice as large on the 15-inch MacBook Pro; • More responsive and comfortable typing on the keyboard with a second-generation butterfly mechanism; • Louder, more true-to-life sound through speakers with double the dynamic range and improved bass; • macOS Sierra, the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, with new features like Siri® integration, Universal Clipboard, Apple Pay on the web and Photos, which helps you rediscover your meaningful memories, organize your library and perfect shots like a pro.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple Launches TV App On Apple TV Posted: Oct 27 2016, 12:19pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Oct 27 2016, 12:45pm CDT, in News | Apple   Gallery 1 images   Apple TV app enables unified TV. Apple unveiled today an app called TV that enables unified TV. The TV app unifies all videos from all apps on Apple TV. Apple is taking a short cut to the rumored vision of replacing the cable box with an Apple TV. Now that many TV networks offer their content through apps like HBO and CBS, Apple can easily introduce a unification layer on Apple TV. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart The User interface looks clean and very convenient. The TV app is a logical evolution to the user interface of Apple TV. The TV app also is available also on iPad and iPhone. So you can take your shows and movie on the road. The TV app comes by the end of the year in the United States only. “Using apps on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad has become the primary way for so many of us to watch television,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “The TV app shows you what to watch next and easily discover TV shows and movies from many apps in a single place.” • Watch Now: Watch Now is where viewers will see their collection of available shows and movies from iTunes® and apps. From Watch Now, viewers can then go to Up Next or Recommended to choose what to watch. • Up Next: Users can enjoy the shows and movies they are currently watching, including recent iTunes rentals and purchases — all presented in the order they are most likely to watch first. For example, when viewers finish an episode, the next one will automatically appear at the start of the Up Next queue, as will any new episodes as they become available. At any time, users can simply ask Siri to continue watching a show and immediately pick up where they left off. • Recommended: Viewers can explore a great selection of curated and trending shows and movies, including collections handpicked by Apple’s curators, and dedicated categories and genres such as kids, sci-fi and comedy. • Library: Viewers can access their entire collection of iTunes movies and TV shows that they have rented or purchased on iTunes. • Store: If users are looking for something new, they can check out the Store to discover great new content across video services that they have not yet downloaded or are not yet subscribed to, along with the latest releases on iTunes. The TV app will be available for Apple TV, iPhone and iPad and always stays in sync so that when users begin watching on one device they can easily continue where they left off on their Apple devices. Siri continues to gain powerful new capabilities, including making it really easy to tune right to live news and sporting events on Apple TV. Siri is now aware of live sporting events across apps so users can simply say things like, “Watch the Stanford game” or “Which games are on right now?” Siri knows additional details of the games, can provide live scores and can take viewers directly to the live stream within the app that’s carrying it. Viewers can also tune directly to live video by just saying the name of the app, for example “Watch CBS News” without having to navigate to the live stream from within the app. In addition to the new TV app, customers in the US will have a simplified way of enjoying their pay-TV video apps by using single sign-on. Starting in December, subscribers to DIRECTV, DISH Network and more will just sign in once on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad to enjoy immediate access to apps that are part of their pay-TV subscription. Since its introduction just a year ago, the latest Apple TV has revolutionized the experience in the living room with 8,000 apps, including 2,000 games and 1,600 video apps, across categories such as sports, news, fitness, education, kids, lifestyle and more. The TV app and single sign-on will be available in December as free software updates for Apple TV (4th generation), iPhone and iPad customers in the US. Live tune-in with Siri is available today. For more information, please visit: apple.com/tv. Features are subject to change and only apply to participating apps. Some features may not be available in all regions or all languages.

According to Apple, the Touch Bar is meant to replace the function keys “that have long occupied the top of your keyboard with something much more versatile and capable.” However, without a physical Power button, how on earth do you turn the thing on? Well, according to The Verge’s Dieter Bohn, the new MacBook Pro automatically turns on when you open the lid, and when you want to power it down, simply hold down the Touch ID button found on the rightmost side of the Touch Bar. In essence, the Touch ID button is the new Power button. Tags: MacBook Pro, touch bar, Touch ID About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: As usual Microsoft did the “Touch Bar” first, but actually thought better of it (video) 6 by Surur  @mspoweruser Oct 27, 2016 at 21:21 GMT3 weeks ago Apple revealed their latest innovation today, the Touch Bar, which is a touch sensitive strip above the keyboard on some of their laptops which replace their function keys. While there it little doubt Apple’s unveiling was less impressive than Microsoft’s Surface Studio yesterday, it becomes even less so when we remember that Microsoft first showed off the same idea in 2010, with much of the same “innovations”. In the above video we have Microsoft Hardware showing off their Adaptive keyboard. What’s an Adaptive Keyboard? It is a research prototype developed by Microsoft Hardware to explore how combining display and input capabilities in a keyboard can allow users to be more productive. The keyboard incorporates a large, touch-sensitive display strip at the top. In addition, the display continues underneath the keys, allowing the legends to be modified in real time. This lets you do things like change the character set to a different language or display command icons. It’s almost as if Apple engineers watched this video (which has 150,000 views) at some point… In fact Microsoft has been looking at the idea more recently, when they showed off their Surface-attached “Display Cover” concept in August 2015. The DisplayCover is a peripheral cover and also a tactile keyboard affords users with the comfort and ease of use provided by physical keys. A thinfilm e-ink display with a resolution of 1280 x 305 pixels extends the available screen real estate of the slate device by up to 8%. It supports dynamic UI manipulation, concurrent access to multiple applications, stylus annotation, gestures and trackpad interactions on the horizontal plane. See the video demo below: Sometimes we lament when Microsoft develops an idea first but we see it implemented first in a competitor product. On this occasion however, particularly looking at Apple’s implementation, the idea does seem rather clumsy, requiring the user to constantly take their eyes from the screen and split their attention between the screen and the keyboard, and that rather narrow strip seems incredibly overloaded with functions. Maybe one day Apple will consider using the large, expansive screen for touch rather than the tiny 1/2 inch strip above the keyboard instead… Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 27, 2016 at 4:40PM We've heard murmurs about an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) car for years now, yet no official word has ever been released from Cupertino about such a vehicle. In this clip from Industry Focus: Industrials, Motley Fool analyst Sean O'Reilly and senior auto specialist John Rosevear explain what we know about the potential project, and why the company is playing its car so close to the vest. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 20, 2016. Sean O'Reilly: You are clearly the person to talk to about today's topic, which is -- Dylan Lewis over on the Tech podcast is going to be mad, we're talking about Apple, but not about iPhones or computers. We're talking about their plans to build a car, or lack thereof. John Rosevear: Yeah. Here's what we know. Apple, of course, has said nothing about this officially, except a couple little hints from people like [CEO] Tim Cook. But, what we know from reports is that Apple, for a while, has had a team called Project Titan, which is pursuing the idea of building an Apple car -- or, maybe an Apple car service, it's never been completely clear. Bloomberg came out with a report on Monday confirming some other things that have come out of Silicon Valley in the last few months, saying Apple has scaled this thing way back. Initially, they planned to build their own car, which might have been a futuristic electric car, sort of to out-Tesla Tesla. O'Reilly: It would look like a Mac mouse, probably. Rosevear: No idea. A lot of the Apple senior execs are car enthusiasts. Eddy Cue is on the board of Ferrari. These people are into cars. There's kind of been this project for a long time, even Steve Jobs had talked about it. Tim Cook said last year, "The auto industry is an inflection point for massive change," which was kind of a big hint that the car is going to be the next device and Apple's going to play. The hint was they were working on this revolutionary new high-tech electric car, or possibly a premium Apple-branded ride-hailing service, something fully automated. Like robot Uber, only it's fully integrated with the Apple device ecosphere, so it knows your iPhone and your iPad and your Mac and everything else, and it all works the same way. This project had over 1,000 people on it at one point. O'Reilly: Which makes one's eyebrows pop. Rosevear: Right. Even for Apple, that's a big crew, it's something serious. They're spending a good amount of money here. But something changed at the end of last year or the beginning of this year. It looks like senior management decided to scale the thing way back. Steve Zadesky was a former Ford engineer who had been with Apple for a while, leading the project, he left early this year. It was taken over by Bob Mansfield, who's a longtime Apple veteran, has held all sorts of roles in the company for many years ... O'Reilly: But, obviously, no auto industry experience. Rosevear: Right. It was sort of like, "OK, the old Apple culture is bringing this back in." The team was told, "We're not going to build a car now. We're going to work on an underlying self-driving program," which is a big shift. John Rosevear owns shares of Apple and Ford. Sean O'Reilly has no position in any stocks mentioned.

By Danny Zepeda | October 27, 2016 Front Page /Computers/Gallery By Danny Zepeda | October 27, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo In unveiling its new laptops today, Apple put the focus on power for the bigger of the three – the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Not only does it come with the awesome Touch Bar, Touch ID and new trackpad, but it also comes with quad-core Intel i7 chip. The most notable internal upgrades are minor, it’s the design that really changes things up. The footprint of the computer is much less noticeable, and that can largely be attributed to the half-pound of weight it lost. This computer has always been for power users, but it’s also been the heaviest Apple laptop offers. It’s nice to see it lose some weight making it easier to carry around. The new MacBook Pro also comes with a better Retina display that Apple stated was 67% brighter, 67% higher contrast ratio and offers 25% more colors. The wide color gamut introduced in the new iPhones is also makings its way into the new computers. And did we mention, you can now get a fully specd MacBook Pro in Space Gray? It can be upgraded to up to 2TB of SSD, but unless you have $1,200 lying around, this might be too pricey. For as awesome as this new computer is, it did lose most of its ports, including the MagSafe, which has saved by butt from trashing my computer countless times. It also comes with the new butterfly mechanism keyboard, which I’m not a big fan of. Overall it’s a worthy upgrade, but not a perfect one. Check out our spec by spec breakdown of the computers down below.

It is also killing off Vine, a mobile video app where people share short video clips that play in a loop. While beloved by users, it never took off with the masses and has lost its luster as of late. Twitter has failed to keep pace with rivals Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram and in recent months, rumors abounded that it would be acquired. CEO Jack Dorsey on Thursday quickly brushed aside what he called "recent market speculation." ___ Rising star: YouTube playing key role in Google's success SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — YouTube has emerged as a break-out star for Google. The popularity of the service has shifted a bigger chunk of advertising budgets from traditional network television programming to the eclectic mix of clips found on YouTube. And that is making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 percent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 percent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. ___ Amazon misses 3Q profit forecasts SEATTLE (AP) — Amazon.com Inc. shares fell in after-market trading on Thursday after the online retailer reported third-quarter net income that missed analyst expectations. The company said net income tripled to $252 million, or 52 cents per share, from $79 million, or 17 cents per share, in the prior-year quarter. That missed analyst expectations of 85 cents per share, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue jumped 29 percent to $32.71 billion in the period, which topped Street forecasts. Amazon has begun to balance spending with revenue more prudently and has reported a profit in each of the past five quarters. ___ Apple adds keyboard touch functions to Mac in major refresh CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — Apple unveiled long-awaited updates to its Mac computers Thursday, aiming to spark consumer interest in a product line often overshadowed by its other gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The company is adding a new touch-sensitive panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple's top-of-the-line laptop. The Pro will also come with a fingerprint sensor, similar to one in the iPhone, to unlock the device. It can recognize different users and offer quick switching based on the fingerprint. The new Macs will also offer a dedicated key for the Siri voice assistant, a feature added with the MacOS Sierra update last month. ___ US stock indexes slip further, but bond yields surge NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks slipped for the third consecutive day Thursday as media and defense companies skidded. Bond yields climbed to their highest levels since May, which helped banks and hurt stocks that pay big dividends. Cable and TV companies and publishers sank, and industrial companies like Raytheon and L-3 Communications fell after reporting weak results. ___ Ford's 3Q profit falls on recall, truck launch DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Troubles in Ford Motor Co.'s home market — including slowing U.S. sales, a massive recall and the difficult launch of new heavy-duty pickups — are hurting the company's bottom line. Ford said Thursday its net income plunged 56 percent to $957 million in the third quarter. Its adjusted results beat market expectations but that didn't do much to offset concerns that Ford is headed for a rough patch. The company has already announced temporary plant shutdowns in North America this month to curb production, and plans more actions in the fourth quarter. ___ Aetna tops Street 3Q expectations, narrows 2016 forecast Aetna's third-quarter earnings rose nearly 8 percent to top Wall Street forecasts, as growing government business and cost cutting countered higher costs from the health insurer's Affordable Care Act coverage. But the nation's third-largest insurer narrowed its 2016 forecast just below analyst expectations heading into the year's final months, and its stock edged lower. Aetna's enrollment in government programs like Medicaid and Medicare grew 11 percent, to nearly 4.5 million people, and the insurer said Thursday that segment now contributes about half of its total health care premiums. ___ Altria to close 2 tobacco facilities affecting 580 workers RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, said Thursday that it will close manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania and Illinois by early 2018, affecting about 580 workers. The company said about 200 jobs in different states will be available for those workers, if they choose to transfer. Altria did not say how many workers it expects to lay off. Full-time workers that do not transfer will be given a minimum of six months of severance, in addition to benefits and free job training, a spokesman said. ___ UPS 3Q profit up 1 percent as US revenue increases DALLAS (AP) — UPS said Thursday that its third-quarter profit inched higher on growing revenue in the U.S. and a more profitable international delivery business. The package-delivery giant is heading into biggest test of the year, the holiday season. UPS expects to deliver more than 700 million packages between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve, about 100 million more than last year. The third-quarter profit was roughly in line with Wall Street expectations but revenue beat the forecasts. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate eases to 3.47 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates declined this week, moving closer to historically low levels. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage eased to 3.47 percent from 3.52 percent last week. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, ticked down to 2.78 percent from 2.79 percent. ___ American and Southwest raises base fares by $5 each way DALLAS (AP) — American and Southwest are raising fares by $5 each way, the latest move by airlines to reverse a price slump that has lasted nearly two years. American Airlines Group Inc. raised prices first and Southwest Airlines Co. followed suit on Thursday, according to J.P. Morgan Securities and FareCompare. Both airlines confirmed the price increase. Fares have been falling since airlines began adding flights and seats faster than the growth in travel demand. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gave up 29.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,169.68. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 6.39 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,133.04. The Nasdaq composite sank 34.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,215.97. U.S. benchmark crude rose 54 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.72 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, added 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $50.47 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline remained at $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas added 3 cents to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The TV app is supposed to keep track of all the shows you watch across apps available on Apple TV, but there's a huge catch. The TV app will not include Netflix or Amazon Video, two of the most popular subscription video streaming services. To be fair, Amazon has never had an app on Apple TV. That's probably because the company has been too busy working on its own competing devices in the Fire TV stick and Fire TV. Amazon also quietly banned Apple TV from its website back in October 2015. But Apple doesn't have much of an excuse for leaving out Netflix. The streaming service has long been considered the most important (and for some people, the only important) streaming service available. It's also surely one of the most popular apps on Apple TV. Yet, Apple casually left out whether Netflix would be included in its keynote speech today. Wired later confirmed with Netflix spokesperson that it will not be included. So what does that mean? Well, for starters, you can still watch Netflix on your Apple TV, but you'll have to use the regular Netflix app rather than the new TV app. You can't watch Amazon Video at all on your Apple TV, again, because Amazon hasn't built an app. So if the new TV app is meant to show you all of your favorite streaming shows, your not going to see a single thing from Netflix or Amazon on there. For me, that basically renders Apple's fancy new TV app useless. Apple also showed off the app's ability to stream news, sports, and other services, but it's important to note that those services will also require their own logins to authenticate, just like regular Apple TV apps. So, in order to get the most out of the TV app, you'll need to be a subscriber to a bunch of other services or you're just stuck with the iTunes Store. These limitations are not exactly what cord-cutters like myself are looking for. If you were thinking this new app would be a killer feature for Apple TV, think again. It's actually going to be pretty limited without two of the most popular streaming services at launch. So if you're looking for an intelligent way to discover new shows and keep track of your favorites, you're probably better off sticking to the Netflix and Amazon Video home pages for now.

[x] Win a Gigabyte GTX 1070 G1 Gaming Bundle [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop System Builders News 43 Apple shows off thinnest, lightest MacBook Pro ever with Touch Bar by Mark Tyson on 27 October 2016, 21:31 Tags: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadaim Add to My Vault: Apple has wrapped up its special Hello Again event in Cupertino. As expected, the main attraction at the invite-only gathering was the introduction of new MacBook Pro laptops. The major innovation that arrived with the new MacBook Pros didn't escape the leaksters either; the new machines feature a multi-touch sensitive OLED bar where a traditional laptop's function key row would sit. The new MacBook Pro is hailed as "groundbreaking… a touch of genius" by Apple. It is available to pre-order straight away in either its 13-inch or 15-inch incarnation. Whichever you choose Apple says you are getting the thinnest, lightest and most powerful machine of its class yet. For the record the new 13-inch MacBook Pro weighs 1.37Kg and is 1.49cm thick, its 15-inch sibling is 1.83Kg and 1.55cm thick. As mentioned in the intro, the headline attraction of the new MacBook Pros is the Touch Bar. In earlier leaks this was dubbed the 'magic toolbar'. Apple calls this OLED multi-touch Retina display a "revolutionary new way to use your Mac". It says that it has replaced the ancient function key row with something "much more versatile and capable". The content of the OLED display changes as you work in different apps on your Mac. It can display system adjustments like brightness, volume, and so on. While browsing the internet it can provide a row of favourites, when messaging it can provide easy access to emoji and predictive text. In third party apps like Photoshop it was used for various control panels like a colour picker or brush size. Apple also demoed a DJ app using the Touch Bar for scrubbing, which is also an applicable function in video editing apps like in the new Final Cut Pro X. Touch Bar functionality will be supported by plenty of other apps in the near future including Microsoft's Office suite. Bringing in some of its mobile tech to the Touch Bar, the default configuration includes a Siri button, and TouchID for ID verification and power button access. The bar can be customised by dragging things down from the main laptop screen to a pane that pops up. Moving on to more general specifications, the new MacBook Pros deliver the brightest (500 nits) and most vivid displays yet while consuming significantly less energy. The 13-inch model has a native resolution of 2560-by-1600 pixels, and the 15-inch version offers 2880-by-1800 pixels. Both models use IPS screens with LED backlighting. For processing you have a choice between various 6th generation Intel Core processors. The 13-incher is available with a dual-core 2.9GHz Core i5, while the 15-inch model is offered with a choice of a quad-core 2.6GHz or 2.7GHz Core i7 processor. For graphics the smaller model uses integrated Intel Iris graphics only, while the larger version features either a Radeon Pro 450 or 455 with upgrade options to a Radeon 460. Various memory and storage options are available up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB PCIe-based SSDs. All the MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar) models include 4x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports with support for charging, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt (up to 40Gbps) and USB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gbps). Users can connect up to 2x 5120-by-2880 resolution monitors at 60Hz with over a billion colours. Adapters can be purchased to support older VGA and HDMI screens. Wi-Fi 802.11ac and BT 4.2 is built-in. There is a handy 3.5mm headphone jack too. Above the screen panel is a 720p FaceTime HD camera supported by a trio of microphones. Apple has built-in some enhanced HDR stereo speakers "with double the dynamic range and improved bass". Apple says it has improved the responsiveness of these laptop keyboards "with a second-generation butterfly mechanism". All models feature keyboard backlighting. The Force Touch trackpad has been almost doubled in surface area across all models too, thus it is said to offer even better cursor control and gesture recognition. MacOS Sierra ships with these Macs, supporting all the new Touch Bar features. You can buy all the MacBook Pros online (with Touch Bar with integrated Touch ID sensor versions shipping in 2-3 weeks from now (3-4 weeks in UK)), with prices ranging from $1799 (£1749) to $2799 (£2699) in the default pre-made configurations. Apple is keeping one older style 13-inch model with regular physical function keys, but otherwise modernised, priced at $1499 (£1449) and available immediately.

Posted by nitro912gr - Thu 27 Oct 2016 22:28 Did I jumped somehow to some alternative reality or something? Because we expect from Apple what Microsoft showcased and from Microsoft… well we didn't expect anything from Microsoft to begin with… And today I was like “Apple will probably show who is the boss in innovations today” and we got a machine with some small touchscreen above the keyboard, which is basically a gimmick, the innovative need for an adaptor for virtually every device you own and you may want to connect to your macbook (yeah even your brand new iPhone 7…) and the removal of the most innovative charging cable in the history of computers (which have saved my macbook a hundred times!), omg they really did removed magsafe! It is the same story all over again, like when Jobs was kicked out of apple and they where playing it super safe, with minor changes in their line of products which eventually sent apple almost in bankruptcy. The only problem is that now, there is no Steve Jobs to save the day… Posted by Bluecube - Thu 27 Oct 2016 23:16 And those prices…! Posted by aidanjt - Thu 27 Oct 2016 23:21 Good to see Apple is applying their ‘kill all the connectors and never improve the specs’ logic to macbook pros, of all things. Posted by LSG501 - Fri 28 Oct 2016 02:09 LOL.. this is a device aimed at professionals and the only thing professional about it is the price. No normal usb sockets or external display without using an (expensive) adapter. Are we supposed to just ditch all our old items…oh right this is apple…. they'll sell me that adapter we shouldn't need. They don't even use a professional gpu, just a consumer ‘gaming’ card. A tiny touch screen in one of the most unergonomic places on a laptop which will in most cases be nothing more than f-keys or emojis. Dev's will need to develop for it and that's not necessarily going to happen, even if it is apple, because not all programs have the api to allow that sort of access. No magsafe just seems daft considering all the money that was invested in it's development/patents and keeping their lawyers happy going after infringing 3rd parties. Then theres the price… how much, I know theres some flux in pricing due to brexit but those prices are just stupid.

The new laptop features an all-metal design, a Touch Bar, and it comes in two sizes, 13-inch and 15-inch. It also comes in two colors, silver and space gray. 2:05 Close Drag Face it, connecting devices to your new Mac laptop, be it the new MacBook Pro (of which the 13" version basically replaces the MacBook Air as a new budget, compact, full-feature notebook) or the 12-inch MacBook can be annoying. Each includes one to four Thunderbolt3/USB-C ports (Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are interchangeable ports) as their sole connectors. Most peripherals on the market today aren't natively compatible with Thunderbolt/USB-C. They'll need an adapter to function, and here's where this list comes in. Each of the devices below will allow you to connect your Mac notebook with a monitor, portable drive and SD card of your choice. Satechi Slim Aluminum Type-C Multi-Port Adapter Photo by Satechi Satechi Slim Aluminum Type-C Multi-Port Adapter This is likely the first accessory you'd need. It adds two USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI (with support for 4K video) to your computer. It also comes with an USB-C port but only for pass-through charging. I've tried it out myself and have had no problems, but I've yet to spend enough time to review it. You can have it, too, for $60 on Amazon. Satechi Type-C USB 3.0 3 in 1 Combo Hub Photo by Satechi Satechi Type-C USB 3.0 3 in 1 Combo Hub If you don't need the HDMI port, you can opt for the Satechi Type-C USB hub. This hub adds two USB 3.0 ports, one SD card slot, and one miniSD card slot to the Mac, so it's great for photographers. It also has an USB-C port, but like the multiport adapter above, it's only for pass-through charging. The hub also looks like it was made for the MacBook itself, and comes in four colors for you to choose from. I haven't tried it out yet, but you can get the Satechi Type-C hub on Amazon for $50. Choetech Type-C USB 3.1 Hub Photo by Amazon Choetech Type-C USB 3.1 Hub Now if you need HDMI and USB 3.1, and don't care about SD cards, the Choetech hub is a better choice. Basically if you want a compact accessory that allows you to hook your MacBook to an external screen and host a regular USB device this is a great device to carry along. I'm still waiting to give this one a try, but it can be had for just $33 on Amazon. Nonda USB-C to USB 3.0 Mini Adapter Photo by Amazon Nonda USB-C to USB 3.0 Mini Adapter And speaking of compact, this tiny accessory turns the MacBook's USB-C into a regular USB 3.0 port allowing you to plug all traditional non-Type-C USB devices into your laptop. Note that with the 12-inch MacBook you can't charge your computer when using it, though. I haven't tried it out yet, but you can get it for just $10 on Amazon. SanDisk Ultra 128GB Dual Drive USB Type-C Photo by Amazon SanDisk Ultra 32GB Dual Drive USB Type-C If extra storage is what you need, this SanDisk thumbdrive will come in handy. It's basically like any thumbdrive, but comes with both a regular USB connector and a USB-C connector, allowing it to work with any computer, including any of your MacBooks. I haven't tried it out yet, but it likely works like most SanDisk drives out there. It's available in many capacities up to 128GB on Amazon for $120.

The drive is also one of a few portable drives on the market that uses a USB-C port and therefore will work right away with the laptop, as well as other computers.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | October 27, 2016 -- 17:40 GMT (10:40 PDT) | Topic: Laptops The Touch Bar is a multi-touch strip that replaces the function keys. Apple unveiled a revamped MacBook Pro that features a new architecture, an aluminum design that's a half-pound lighter than current models, Touch ID, and a Touch Bar that integrates with the OS and apps. Of those aforementioned items, the Touch Bar offers the biggest change. The Touch Bar is a multi-touch strip that replaces the function keys. The new MacBook Pro comes 25 years after Apple launched the PowerBook. When incorporated with Apple's MacOS Sierra, the Touch Bar offers a changing menu that adapts to whatever app you're using. "For 25 years we've been defining and redefining what a notebook is and what it can do. Today we're going to do it again," said CEO Tim Cook.

The PC industry firmly believes in 2-in-1 devices, but Apple argues that the touchscreen is for the iPad. The MacBook doesn't have a touchscreen and likely never will. Here's a look at the options. You can order now, with availability going into November. Apple had to get its large third-party software partners on board with the Touch Bar. The walkthrough of Touch Bar was interesting given how it adapts by application, replicates what functional keys used to do, and highlights controls within an app. Apple had to get its large third-party software partners on board with the Touch Bar. For instance, two key demos with the Touch Bar was Final Cut Pro and Adobe PhotoShop. Microsoft Office will completely support Touch Bar. These apps are for creative pros, enterprise, and Mac power users. A look at Photoshop with Touch Bar: Adobe Photoshop will completely support Touch Bar. Here's how the Touch Bar adapts in email. Navigation and tab controls are also possible with previews of tabs in Safari. The Touch Bar can be customized easily. MacBook Pro at 13 inches is smaller than the MacBook Air. Marketing chief Phil Schiller said that the MacBook Pro is 14.9mm thick and 17-percent thinner than the predecessor. The 15-inch version weighs 4 pounds, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro weighs 3 pounds. Apple is touting up to 10-hour battery life for MacBook Pro.

SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 57 NEXT PREV The high-end MacBook Pro fills out the top part of the Mac portfolio for Apple, with the MacBook Air occupying the entry level. Will the MacBook Pro provide a growth engine for Apple? We'll see, but one thing is clear: the Mac refresh is important for Apple on multiple fronts. Consider: Apple's iPhone franchise is struggling with the law of large numbers. For instance, iPhone revenue in Apple's fourth quarter was $28.16 billion, down 13 percent from a year ago. Apple needs other product lines to do well. The Mac still matters for Apple financially. Mac accounted for fourth quarter revenue of $5.74 billion, down 17 percent from a year ago. Apple hasn't updated the Mac all that frequently, so that explains a bit of the sales shortfall. For fiscal 2016, Mac delivered $22.83 billion in revenue. That sum is more than the $20.63 billion in sales from the iPad and just behind the $24 billion attributed to Apple's various services. Apple and the Mac has owned the creative crowd for decades. If Apple is going to be a player in the enterprise, it needs the Mac. You can talk tablets and smartphones all you want, but real work still needs a laptop for most corporate workers. And finally, Microsoft wants the Mac's turf. The Surface Studio unveiled Wednesday was an entry designed to court creative types. Microsoft is even calling its Windows 10 update the Creators Update.

Baig , USA TODAY 10:38 a.m. EDT October 28, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Apple unveiled three new MacBooks on Thursday, Oct. 27 with new TouchBar and Touch ID features. USA TODAY The new MacBook Pro (Photo: Apple) NEW YORK — A touch strip on a MacBook Pro isn't a surprise. Its usefulness might turn out to be. Apple added a novel touch-strip above the keyboard on its new MacBook Pros, an expected flourish to the 13- and 15-inch laptops. I'm impressed by how versatile this Retina-quality, multi-touch strip of glass appears to be, and how much third-party support the Touch Bar is getting. A quick explainer: Touch Bar supplies dynamic shortcuts to the controls, sliders, menus and tools that relate to the task at hand, so they appear and disappear as needed. As you tap, swipe or drag the Touch Bar keys, you see the results of your actions on the MacBook Pro’s full-size Retina displays. Pros: Many uses If you’re in the Messages app, for example, you might use the Touch Bar to scroll through and choose emojis, which show up on the strip. If you’re listening to music, you’ll find the play controls there. And if you’re editing in Photos, you can scrub through images and apply filters or rotate the pics you choose. Through the Touch Bar you can easily access favorite websites in Safari or answer (or reject) incoming FaceTime calls. As you’re writing something, you can also get predictive suggestions of the words you may want to type next, similar to a feature found on iOS devices. What’s more, Apple opened up Touch Bar to outside app developers. So you might employ Touch Bar when choosing brushes or blending colors in Adobe Photoshop, one of the partners Apple trotted on stage in introducing the feature. There will even be Touch Bar support for Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other Office apps. And in case you’re wondering, you can still summon Touch Bar versions of the physical function keys that used to reside above the keyboard to raise the brightness or lower the volume. Touch Bar keys are also customizable. The new MacBook Pros have Touch ID.  (Photo: Apple) Con: The price, USB adapter Now the bad news. As with prior MacBook Pros, they're expensive. MacBook Pros with Touch Bar start at $1,799 for a 13-inch model and $2,399 for a 15-inch model. If you can live without the Touch Bar, you can also purchase a 13-inch MacBook Pro that still has physical function keys for $1,499. While Touch Bar is the feature that will surely garner the most interest — and I only briefly got to demo it —  Apple has also added the Touch ID sensor to the MacBook Pro, which means you can unlock the Mac with a fingerprint, just like you can do on state-of-the-art iPhones. It is integrated with the power button. And if you share the Mac with other members of your household or office, you can use Touch ID to take advantage of the feature Apple calls “fast user switching.” When an authorized person places his or her finger on Touch ID, their user environment takes over. Touch ID also makes it much simpler to pay for web transactions through Apple Pay, a feature that arrived with the macOS Sierra upgrade and that used to require an iPhone or Apple Watch. Longtime fans of MacBook Pros, notably professional and creative types, will also appreciate that these long-in-the-tooth computers will be outfitted with state-of-the-art specs: sixth-generation dual or quad-core Intel Core i5 or i7 processors for starters. Apple says they’ll will run much faster than the prior generation. The entry point is 256GB of storage. Apple executive Phil Schiller shows off Touch Bar at a press event in Cupertino, Calif.  (Photo: Edward C Baig) Moreover, at 3 pounds and 14.9mm or 4 pounds and 15.mm, respectively for 13- and 15-inch models, these are also the lightest and thinnest MacBook Pros, a welcome relief to those schlepping predecessor versions. They are even thinner than the MacBook Air. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar comes with a pair of Thunderbolt (USB-C) ports; the 13- and 15-inch models with Touch Bar four such ports. You can use these to charge the computer — Apple touts about 10 hours of battery life — or to drive external monitors. Keep in mind though that your existing magnetic MagSafe Mac charger won't work without an adapter, and you’ll also need an adapter to connect your older USB gear or even to charge an iPhone, which relies on a Lightning type connector that you won’t find on any Macs. Alas, none are included in the box and Apple sells a Lightning to USB-C cable for $25. Apple has also ditched the SD card slot, a turn-off for many photographers. USA TODAY I'm really missing the SD slot on the new MacBook Pro The machines have significantly larger Force Touch trackpads than the prior generation, and Apple says the butterfly-mechanism keyboard (which is based on the keyboard first introduced on the MacBook) has been improved. I briefly got to type on it in a demonstration area, and I did feel more comfortable, though I'd still like to spend more time testing. Touch Bar looks to be one of those innovations that goes beyond a gimmick and could potentially make you more productive. Which means my review, once I get the laptop, should be written in half the time.

The new laptop features an all-metal design, a Touch Bar, and it comes in two sizes, 13-inch and 15-inch. It also comes in two colors, silver and space gray. 2:05 Close Drag Apple's latest MacBook laptops are finally here. During a press event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Apple introduced its newest 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros, which sport a slimmer design, a larger Force Touch trackpad and a dynamic Touch Bar with Touch ID. A 13-inch model without the Touch Bar was also announced. These new features, unsurprisingly, also mean a higher price -- the new models cost $200 more than their predecessors. Though Apple's senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller told CNET that affordability is "absolutely something we care about," the price hike may be off putting to potential users looking for a budget laptop.

Sarah Tew / CNET ​Last year's MacBook Pros are still here 0 Share: Computers by Scott Stein October 27, 2016 1:49 PM PDT @jetscott Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Apple has a lot of laptops for sale lately. In addition to the 12-inch MacBook, the new 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pros and the older MacBook Air, last year's 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models remain on sale on Apple's website. It's a bit surprising, since they're inferior choices. And they're also being offered at the same price as before, with no discounts. But those older Pros offer a few minor advantages. Even without a price cut, they're more affordable (slightly) and they support a variety of older ports (USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2, SD card, HDMI) without dongles. They also use the easy-to-detach MagSafe power connection, and they at least have Force Touch trackpads (but smaller than those on the new Pros). This is the older MacBook Pro -- note that it's only available in silver.Photo by Screenshot by Scott Stein/CNET But the new MacBook Pros seem like the better bet across the board. They're significantly faster, smaller and lighter, and most have that new OLED touch strip called the Touch Bar, as well as Touch ID (the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, however, doesn't). Exclusive interview Does the Mac still matter? How do you tell the difference? On Apple's purchase page, the new MacBook Pros are labeled "new." The legacy models -- one 13-inch, one 15-inch -- hang out at the bottom. Also, the older MacBook Pro is only available in silver. The new Pros come in silver or space gray.

Apple and Microsoft have shared various battles over many years, in an ongoing rift over the direction of computing, but this week has marked a switch in both of their war strategies. Microsoft is now going after Apple's core customers, and the two are split over the role of touch and input interfaces for PCs. The fundamental differences and disagreements between the pair of tech giants can be tracked back to the hardware and software products they both produce. Apple separates its tablets and phones with the iOS operating system, and its range of Macs running macOS. Microsoft on the other hand believes in having one operating system, Windows 10, to rule them all and work across phones, PCs, tablets, and even devices like the Xbox One and HoloLens. The strategies are remarkably different. Microsoft and Apple went head-to-head this week This week, both Microsoft and Apple held events back-to-back, providing us with a rare opportunity to compare their latest takes on modern computing all in less than 24 hours. Microsoft spent the first part of its keynote demonstrating new Windows 10 features, a new Paint app, and its VR strategy, before the big news of a Surface Studio all-in-one PC. Apple spent the first part of its keynote highlighting pictures from its iPhone 7, and launching a new TV app for its Apple TV, before moving onto the unveiling of its new MacBook Pro lineup. Apple doesn't believe in touchscreen Macs, but it did add a touchscreen of sorts to its MacBook Pro, just not where you'd expect to find one: the Touch Bar, an OLED touchscreen, replaces the function keys at the top of the keyboard. It includes Touch ID and is easily accessible, customizable, and has the relevant controls displayed dynamically in each app. If you're in Photoshop you'll get tools for manipulating images, and in iTunes you'll get all the music controls you need. It's too early to judge whether Apple's Touch Bar will be beneficial or just a gimmick, but it's an entirely different approach from just adding a touchscreen to a MacBook. Apple is expecting developers to create contextually aware controls for their apps, and for MacBook users to learn these new controls. There's a clear value here and an interesting take on touch input, and Apple isn't shying away from ripping out old function keys and replacing them with something entirely new. Apple's Touch Bar has many challenges it needs to meet The challenges are clear, too. Apple has a lot to prove here, and the company's demos showed controls that could have easily been achieved from using existing keyboard shortcuts or just the trackpad. Apple highlighted emoji input at one point, which seemed like an unusual aside for a laptop that's designed for professionals who care about the speeds and feeds, not gimmicks. Apple enlarged the trackpad on its MacBook Pro, too, but it barely noted the change or explained why bigger is necessarily better. It now looks like a miniature Wacom tablet, but Apple didn't do something wild like getting the Pencil working with it. Touch Bar aside, it was a cautious refresh to the MacBook Pro line, with modern additions instead of big bets. Microsoft's approach to its Surface Studio was the type you would normally expect from Apple. The sleek product videos, the focus on power, and a new theme of focusing on creatives. A new Surface Dial forms the input mechanism for the Surface Studio, and the whole device is geared toward professionals and creators. It's the type of market that Apple typically dominates, but Microsoft is trying everything to get these users to switch to Windows. Microsoft still needs to convince everyone that touch PCs are the future Microsoft has a lot to prove, too. The Surface Studio is a niche product, and the Surface Dial will require developers to build contextual menus into their apps to really make use of the new hardware. Apple is betting on a touch strip interaction model, and Microsoft wants you to wear headsets and create 3D objects, or place crazy puck-like devices on a Surface Studio display. It's tough to compare a laptop directly to a desktop, but it further highlights Apple's resistance to touchscreens on Macs, and Microsoft's new focus on stealing some of Apple's usual customers. The two tech giants are split by fundamental disagreements about the new methods to provide input to modern PCs. There's a lot of work for both companies to achieve what they've demonstrated this week. This war is far from over, and it's impossible to predict a winner just yet. Apple might not like touchscreens on Macs, but the company has shown it's willing to compete with Microsoft's Surface devices with an iPad Pro. Now Microsoft is showing it's willing to go the extra mile to try and tempt a niche market of professionals over to the Windows world. If you thought the Mac vs. PC days were long gone, think again. They're just about to jump back to life, and customers will elect the winner.

Apple announced a new MacBook Pro this morning at an intimate event in Cupertino, along with small refreshes of a couple of its other laptops. The Air is the cheapest MacBook, and the MacBook is the thinnest MacBook, but the MacBook Pro is the best and most important MacBook. Finger Work The new Pro, which comes with either a 13- or 15-inch screen, does look like the last model. Which is to say, it still looks like a laptop. But as soon as you open the thing up, crack your knuckles, and put fingers to keys, you won’t be confused anymore. Actually, you’ll figure it out before even that, as soon as you see that massive new trackpad. But the keys really sell the change. The new Pro has the same keyboard as the super-thin MacBook, though it’s been tweaked a bit from the smaller model, and has a surprisingly satisfying amount of travel, but there’s no doubt your fingers are going to have to get used to a little less clack. Those shallow butterfly keys feel somewhere between the traditional mechanical keyboard and the on-screen keys on your iPhone. Speaking of on-screen keyboards! Instead of function keys, the row of F1-F12s you don’t care about and media controls you do, the new MacBook Pro has a small touch-friendly strip that apps can use to display quick controls and information. It’s called the Touch Bar. There’s a Touch ID fingerprint reader on the right side of the strip, too right above the Delete key. That feels dangerous. The whole idea is going to take some getting used to: each app does different things, in different ways, to different effect. In Mail, you can quickly tap on the Touch Bar to compose a message; in Pages, it’s a super-fast way to access a bunch of formatting options. In Photos, you can use the Touch Bar to quickly scrub through a bunch of images, and it’s a really nifty way to move through a timeline in Final Cut. A bunch of demos on stage at Apple’s event featured a number of people doing a sort of two-handed dance, one twiddling on the my-god-it’s-huge touchpad and one on the Touch Bar. How people will use this thing, and what the right features and mechanisms will be, will take some time to sort out. Moving Pictures One thing’s for sure, though: the tech is solid. The slightly raised platform is remarkably responsive, and the screen is so vibrant it almost looks like Apple slapped a sticker over it. There’s virtually no lag as you swipe or tap—it’s just a touchscreen, really, with support for up to 10 fingers. Why you would ever put all 10 of your digits on the tiny stripe, I don’t know, but it’s nice to know it’s possible. In general, the Touch Bar is a clever way to marry the tactility of a physical keyboard with the malleability of a touchscreen. You could argue that a full-on touchscreen would be better, but Apple sure doesn’t think so. Other than the keyboard, the MacBook Pro is exactly what you’d expect from the long-overdue update. It’s lighter, it’s thinner, it definitely feels faster. It’s a little heavier than a MacBook Air, but quite a bit smaller. The screen is brighter than ever, and so are the speakers and thermals and everything else because that’s what you do when you upgrade a laptop. Best of all, it comes in Space Gray! Because Apple is currently in an exclusive relationship with Thunderbolt ports (which is basically Apple’s take on USB-C), there are four of them on the sides of the device. And, yes, there’s a headphone jack peeking out as well. It’s nice to see that little guy. The new Pro starts at $1,499, but you don’t want to buy that one. That one doesn’t have a Touch Bar. You want the 13-inch model that starts at $1,799, or the $2,399 15-inch model. These are seriously expensive machines, for people willing to pay for seriously powerful machines. Sure, the MacBook Air is still on sale, but Apple didn’t update it and in fact spent a bunch of time on stage sick-burning the device. The lineup seems to go like this: You want a cheap laptop? Buy an iPad Pro. Super-portable laptop? MacBook. Beast Machine? MacBook Pro. It’s expensive, but at least at first glance it seems like you’re going to get what you pay for. Go Back to Top.

Center stage was the new MacBook Pro, which now has a touchscreen strip at the top of the keyboard. Neat! But that’s not all. Here are all the big announcements. 01 New MacBook Pro Holy smokes these new MacBooks are thin! The aluminum bodies have shrunk significantly since the previous model—the 13-incher is 23 percent smaller and weighs three pounds—but the screen and keyboard stay the same size. Pricing starts at $1,799. They have the latest generation of chips inside, Force Touch trackpads, and huge SSDs. But also… Credit: Apple Holy smokes these new MacBooks are thin!

Pricing starts at $1,799. They have the latest generation of chips inside, Force Touch trackpads, and huge SSDs. But also... 02 The Touch Bar The function keys are gone. In the place of the keyboard’s top row is a thin touchscreen display Apple calls the Touch Bar. It has the controls for brightness and media playback, but it’s also a touchscreen, so users and developers can set it up however they want. All the big apps (Photoshop, Pages, Safari, Photos, Terminal) will have custom keys that swap in to make shortcuts and common controls easier to access. And yes, it works as an emoji keyboard too.

There’s a 13-inch version of the new MacBook Pro that’s spec’d a little lower but has traditional keyboard with function keys intact. It’s $1,499 and it is available today. Oh and it’s so, so tiny—that photo to the right shows the new 13-inch MacBook Pro back-to-back with the seemingly massive 13-inch MacBook Air. Credit: Apple "Baloney," you say.

Sure, there have been fingerprint readers on laptops before, but now your Mac gets fingerprint-based Apple Pay transactions on the web and in apps, and the benefits of fingerprint-based fast user switching.

Apple hopes to change that with a new app simply called “TV” that pulls together recommended shows from all of your installed services and puts them into one app. It’s Siri-powered too, so you can talk to your TV more often than you already do. One thing to note: It has a lot of services, but it won’t have Netflix or Amazon. Credit: Apple The Apple TV is a sweet device, but you can often spend eons looking for something to watch.

This feature, called Depth Effect, lets you take a sharp snapshot of a person and leave the background all creamy and blurry and pretty. That feature didn’t ship with the phone, but it’s available now. Apple actually released it a few days ago, but the company reminded us today that it exists, and that it looks pretty cool. They even had the photos to prove it.

V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » TOPICS computers desktops laptops lifestyle and leisure gadgets (general) The touch bar will offer functionality that’s familiar to many iPhone users. Apple on Thursday unveiled some of the long-awaited updates of its Mac computers, aiming to spark consumer interest in a product line often overshadowed by newer gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The breakout feature is, as widely speculated, a new touch-sensitive panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple’s top-of-the-line laptop. The touch bar will offer functionality that’s familiar to many iPhone users. It shows word suggestions as you type and lets you scroll through libraries of emojis. When watching movies, the touch bar can offer playback controls. When editing photos, the touch bar changes to offer options to lighten or rotate. It adapts and offers different controls for whatever app or website you’re using. The Pro will also come with a fingerprint sensor, similar to one in the iPhone, to unlock the device. It can recognise different users and offer quick switching based on the fingerprint. The new Macs will also offer a dedicated key for the Siri voice assistant, a feature added with the MacOS Sierra update last month. USB-C outlet In keeping with recent updates of other Apple products, the company will replace some computer ports with a new USB-C outlet. Connectors using USB-C technology can transmit data faster than older USB jacks. They’re also smaller and have a uniform shape, which means the USB-C jack can be inserted with either side facing up. Apple unveiled the new Macs at an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California. During the event, Apple said it wanted to unify television viewing on its streaming TV device with a new app simply called “TV.” Laptops vs. tablets The changes to the Mac are the first significant ones in years. Sales of the Mac have been in a slump this year, after a streak of growth in 2014 and 2015 that seemed to defy global trends. Consumers generally are buying fewer PCs and using smartphones or tablets instead. Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as a device capable of replacing the laptop for many users. For Apple, the Mac line has been eclipsed financially by other products; first the iPod and now the iPhone that have made far more money in recent years. Apple sold $22.8 billion worth of Macs in its past fiscal year, although that was just 11 per cent of the company’s total revenue. It sold $136 billion worth of iPhones. In the most recent quarter, Apple sold 9.3 million iPads and 4.9 million Macs, although the iPads accounted for just $4.3 billion in sales while the Macs contributed $5.7 billion. But the Mac has remained a significant product for Apple, and one that’s important to intensely loyal fans. Baby steps in TV Apple TV is a newer endeavor, and the new TV app could make it easier for viewers to find shows to watch, as it means they don’t have to check individual apps The app, though, is short of a full-fledged streaming-TV service, which reports say Apple has been pursuing. Rather, it brings together TV shows and movies viewers already get through individual subscriptions. The TV app will be synced with iPhones and iPads, so viewers can catch the next episode regardless of device. Apple said Apple TV already has 8,000 apps, including more than 2,000 games. The addictive building game “Minecraft” will come later this year. Shipment of AirPod earphones Separately, Apple said it’s delaying shipment of its wireless AirPod earphones, which was scheduled for late October. In a statement, the company said, “We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Keywords: Apple Macbook, Mac computers, iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, AirPod earphones More In: Gadgets | Technology | Sci-Tech Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

(AP) — Apple's high-end Mac laptops are getting a touch control strip above the keyboard, part of a long-awaited update aimed at reviving interest in a product often overshadowed by newer gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The new Touch Bar, which is both a narrow display and a control panel, replaces the old physical function keys on a traditional laptop. It will offer a variety of controls that change according to the app or website that's open. It also has functions that will be familiar to many iPhone users — showing word suggestions as you type, for example, or letting you scroll through a library of emojis. NEW FEATURES, HIGHER PRICE Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) The company unveiled the laptops at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where executives showed how the Touch Bar works with a variety of apps and software — providing playback and editing controls for videos or music, for example, and search functions for Apple's maps and photos apps. Apple is also opening the Touch Bar to work with outside software, including Adobe's Photoshop editing program and Microsoft's Word, PowerPoint and Skype. Along with faster processors and brighter screens, two of Apple's new laptops will also get a fingerprint sensor, similar to the one on iPhones. The sensor can unlock the device, authorize software installations or recognize a different user and quickly switch to that person's settings. It works with Apple Pay, so users can authorize an electronic payment for online purchases. At least for now, the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features will be available only on higher-end models — a 13-inch MacBook Pro that starts at about $1,800 and a 15-inch MacBook Pro at about $2,400. Both ship in a few weeks. Starting Thursday, Apple is selling a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar or Touch ID, but with other improvements, for about $1,500. Older versions sold for prices starting at about $1,300 for 13 inches and $2,000 for 15 inches. Apple will still sell older MacBook Pros at those prices, along with less expensive MacBook and MacBook Air models. But its cheapest laptop, the 11-inch MacBook Air for about $900, will be sold only to education markets. The company is also replacing some computer ports with new outlets compatible with USB-C standards, which can be used both for charging and transferring data. Connectors with USB-C technology can transmit data faster than older USB jacks. They are also smaller and have a symmetric shape, which means the USB-C jack can be inserted with either side facing up. But older USB printers and other devices will need adapters. The new Macs still have traditional headphone jacks, unlike the latest iPhones. LAPTOPS VS. TABLETS Sales of the Mac have been in a slump this year, after a streak of growth in 2014 and 2015 that seemed to defy global trends. Consumers generally are buying fewer PCs and using smartphones or tablets instead. Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as capable of replacing the laptop for many users. And in contrast with the Mac's earlier years — when Apple marketed its computers to people who saw themselves as creative professionals or just independent thinkers — Apple also has begun promoting the Mac as a computer for businesses, which once mostly used competitors' PCs running Microsoft's Windows software. Microsoft, meanwhile, has begun selling its own line of high-end Surface laptops and this week introduced its first Surface desktop PC. Analysts say the new Surface Studio has a premium price and features that will most likely appeal to visual designers and other creative professionals — an area that has been Apple's strength. Microsoft has boasted about modern controls with touch screens; the Touch Bar is Apple's answer to that, placed near the keyboard where people's fingers are already. For Apple, the Mac line has been eclipsed financially by other products — first the iPod and now the iPhone — that have made far more money in recent years. But the Mac has been important for Apple since co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the first model in 1984. It commands intense loyalty from fans. "The Mac is more than a product to us. It's a testament to everything we do and everything we create at Apple," CEO Tim Cook said Thursday. BABY STEPS IN TV Cook also used the event to promote a newer endeavor, Apple TV, and a new unified menu feature that shows recommendations and new episodes of recently watched shows, so viewers don't have to search through different apps to find them. Amazon's Fire TV is taking a similar approach with a software update, though the unified experience will be part of the home screen, not an app. Apple's app, though, is short of a full-fledged streaming-TV service, which reports say Apple has been pursuing. Rather, it brings together TV shows and movies viewers already get through individual subscriptions. The TV app, coming in December, will be synced with iPhones and iPads, so viewers can catch the next episode regardless of device. Apple said its Siri voice assistant will also direct viewers to live events, such as streaming sports. Apple said Apple TV already has 8,000 apps, including more than 2,000 games. The addictive building game "Minecraft" will come later this year. In a minor setback, meanwhile, Apple said Wednesday that it's delaying shipment of its new wireless earphones, called AirPods, which had been scheduled for late October. In a statement, the company said, "We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." Apple didn't elaborate. ___ Technology Writer Anick Jesdanun contributed from New York.

Apps are isolated silos of content not unlike channels on cable TV, but harder to switch between. Today, Apple announced its solution. Jen Folse, a design lead at Apple, explained that the solution is, not surprisingly, an app. Apple took a stab at the discovery shortcomings of tvOS with the Siri Remote. Introduced with the fourth generation Apple TV, the remote allows you to execute voice searches across many, but not all, content providers simultaneously. Today, Apple announced at an event in Cupertino that it will also tackle content discovery with a new app. The app announced today is called TV and will be integrated with the upcoming Single Sign-on feature that was announced at WWDC in June. Single Sign-on allows users to enter their cable TV credentials into the Apple TV's settings once to get access to content in any participating app that requires a cable TV subscription. Originally anticipated to launch with tvOS 10, which debuted alongside iOS 10 in September, Single Sign-on has not yet launched. During the event in Cupertino, Apple said that the TV app will recommend content across apps installed on customers' Apple TVs based on the apps a customer has downloaded as well as media watched, purchased, and rented. TV will also be available on iOS devices, unifying TV and movie watching across iOS and tvOS. In addition, TV will include curated suggestions based on user's watching habits. Unfortunately, not all content providers will participate in TV. According to Recode, Netflix, which was an early third-party supporter of search on the Siri Remote, will not be part of the guide, which leaves a rather large hole in the app at launch. The TV app will be available as a free download on the US App Store in December.

At an event held at its headquarters, the company showed off new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro notebooks. Both include a new display called the Touch Bar at the top of the keyboard. The display, positioned where the function keys used to be, allows you to control Mac apps with your fingertips. It will adjust in real time based on what software, such as Photoshop, you’re using. The devices feature a trackpad double the size of its previous models. But the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 23% smaller in volume and considerably thinner than the previous version. The smaller version weighs just three pounds — the 15-inch MacBook Pro clocks in at one pound more. Touch ID is also coming to the MacBook Pro, located next to the Touch Bar. You can use it for security, like logging into your computer or switching between users, and access Apple Pay with the touch of your finger. With an Intel Core i7 processor and a new graphics card, the 15-inch MacBook Pro is more than twice as fast as the previous 15-inch model. The 13-inch model also features improved speed and performance. Apple is also making a model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with traditional function keys and no Touch Bar. The product is meant to appeal to potential 13-inch MacBook Air buyers — its smaller and thinner (and more affordable) laptop. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is priced at $1,799, while the 15-inch model is $2,399. The MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar costs $1,499. The cheapest version will start shipping on Thursday, while the Touch Bar models will be available in a few weeks. The devices will also work with a new LG 5K display, which launches in December and will cost $1299. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) CEO Tim Cook kicked off the event by announcing a TV app that lets you access content across other apps. A feature called “Up Next” allows you to toggle between what you’re watching on your mobile device and the TV (i.e. you’ll be able pick up where you left off in a movie bought on iTunes, or a TV show from HBO Now). The free app will roll out by the end of the year. Cook added that 8,000 apps are now available on Apple TV — 2,000 of which are games. Popular game Minecraft will be coming to the platform soon. “We believe the future of TV is apps,” Cook said. However, the company didn’t announce any updates coming to the iMac desktop computer. We also didn’t learn more about when consumers can buy a pair of AirPods, Apple’s new wireless earbuds teased at the iPhone event last month. The company said on Wednesday it is delaying the launch for an unknown amount of time. Although the iPhone remains the company’s biggest moneymaker, Mac sales accounted for 12% of revenue in the third quarter of 2016. Earlier this week, Apple reported an annual sales decline for the first time since 2001. It’s uncertain if Thursday’s news will drum up consumer excitement and spark an uptick in sales.

Essentially a mini Retina Display, the Touch Bar offers all of the functionality of system controls, while providing TouchID access and transforming Mac apps with a series of contextual controls. Related: 5 Things you need to know about the new MacBook Pro Users will be able to tap and slide as they would on an iOS device with available options varying depending on which app they’re using. It’s also multi-touch friendly with 10 touch-points available at a time. Here’s a guide to the coolest features and the apps that have already committed their support. TouchID fingerprint sensor The new MacBook Pro’s power button is now located within the Touch Bar, so it makes sense it would also be the home for the first Mac ever to boast a TouchID fingerprint sensor. Now, instead of entering a password, users will be able to log into the Mac with their fingerprint. It’ll also be used to authenticate Apple Pay on the Web payments. Better still, if there’s more than one user authenticated, tapping the sensor will instantly switch to a different account. Related: MacBook Pro 2016 - What's new and should I upgrade? Default view Once you’ve logged into a MacBook Pro via TouchID, the default view will show familiar system controls like brightness, volume, media controls, Launchpad and more. Siri also has a dedicated key. There’s also an Escape button. The old function Keys can still be accessed by holding down the ‘fn’ unction button on the physical keyboard. Messages When working within Apple’s Messages app, it’ll offer access to some quick replies. There are thumbs up and thumbs down icons for example. Frequently used emoji will also be available. Mail During the event, Apple also demonstrated how, when using the Mail app, the text will be analysed to suggest recipients from your contacts list. When launching the app, you’ll also be able to tap the touchpad to commence new emails, reply, send others to the trash or move mails different inboxes. There’s also formatting options. Just like on iOS devices, the new MacBook Pro analyses your typing habits and offers predictive ‘next word’ suggestions within some apps. Instant Emojis When the moment calls, the Touch Bar will enable you to scan through the full range of emojis, starting with the most recently used. When typing words, the Touch Bar will also suggest emojis you might like to use. Safari When you open Apple’s default web browser on a new MacBook Pro, you’ll see tappable icons displaying shortcuts to your favourite sites. You’ll also be able to slide to move through open tabs. You can even open new ones. Photos Editing tools which will now sit within the Touch Bar. You’ll be able to crop, straighten, rotate, auto enhance, adjust lighting, add filters (previewed within Touch Bar) while previewing the before and after. The advantage here is that Touch Bar removes controls from the screen, meaning you can view photos in full screen. Again, it’s easy to swipe through the library and even scrub through videos. Related: MacBook Pro vs MacBook Air Finder Quick look, share and tag will appear when Finder windows are selected. However you can also customise these options by dragging and dropping items, like a Do Not Disturb button from within the Touch Bar. Other core macOS apps The Touch Bar pervades the entire macOS ecosystem. You’lll be able to search for gas stations along a route in Maps or end a FaceTime call. There’s support for Calendar, iWork, iMovie and Garage Band too. Hell, it even supports Terminal! Third-party apps - Adobe Photoshop The experience appears to be centred around the ability to work with both the left hand and the right hand at the same time. “It’s kind of like playing a musical instrument,” Adobe said on stage. The TouchBar is customised depending on the task in hand, while it’s always possible to resize aspects of the image with a slider. There’s the option to customise favourite commands such as entering full screen and adding new layers. There’s even a mode of the Touch Bar for brush control. However, one of the coolest elements is the ability to scroll back through the image history using the Touch Bar and just pick up at a previous stage of the editing process. Integration coming by the end of the year. Djay Pro For DJs, the Touch Bar could replace the need for a dedicated controller when performing with the professional DJ’s traditional laptop of choice. DJs will be able to access the waveform to find cue points and to scratch, for example. There’s also one-tap access to sound effects. An update to enable the Touch Bar is coming later this year. Final Cut Pro Much like Photoshop, the Touch Bar promises to offer huge productivity gains. You’ll be able to scan through the timeline of a video represented perfectly within the Touch Bar. It’ll also allow you to zoom into a clip and trim as you would on an iOS device. Other support Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar functionality to the entire Office Suite, while the Affinity design software will also support it. Pixelmator, Sketch and Da Vinci Resolve are also among the apps for creatives adopting the Touch Bar. Is this enough for you to commit to a new MacBook Pro?

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Angela Ahrendts is Now Simply Senior Vice President of Retail as Apple Drops 'Online Stores' From Her Title Angela Ahrendts is Now Simply Senior Vice President of Retail as Apple Drops 'Online Stores' From Her Title Sunday, 2 October 2016 Apple updated its leadership page this weekend to reflect a minor change to Angela Ahrendts' title, which has been simplified to "Senior Vice President, Retail" as "Online Stores" has been dropped. Ahrendts remains responsible for "strategy, real estate and development, and operations" of both Apple's physical stores and online storefront, according to her slightly updated bio. Angela Ahrendts is Apple’s Senior Vice President of Retail, reporting to CEO Tim Cook. Angela is responsible for strategy, real estate & development, and operations of Apple’s physical stores, Apple’s online store and contact centers. Since joining Apple in 2014, Angela has integrated Apple’s physical and digital retail businesses to create a seamless customer experience for over a billion visitors per year with the goal of educating, inspiring, entertaining and enriching communities. Apple employees set the standard for customer service in stores and online, delivering support from highly trained Geniuses and expert advice from Creative Pros to help customers get the most out of their Apple products. The title change is likely in line with Apple's simplified retail branding, including dropping the "Store" moniker when referring to its retail locations by name. Apple has also been attempting to converge its physical and online retail experiences over the past few years, and Ahrendts' new title reflects those efforts.Related Roundup: Apple Stores Tags: Angela Ahrendts, Apple retail Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Geo Beats - on October 5, 2016< > Embed Mall Of America Will Close On Thanksgiving Day 00:51 Over the past few years, many stores have allowed Black Friday festivities to creep into Thanksgiving Day, but one truly giant retail entity has declared ‘no more.’ Over the past few years, many stores have allowed Black Friday festivities to creep into Thanksgiving Day, but one truly giant...

The new model comes with heavily upgraded performance, a thinner and lighter design and a unique capacitive touch strip above the keyboard called the Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro is long overdue. Apple's neglect of its high-end PCs hasn't gone unnoticed by customers and critics. Today, the company caught up with its Windows-powered rivals, launching a new range of laptops with sixth-generation Intel Core processors and up to 2.3 times greater graphics performance than the previous MacBook Pro. As rumoured this summer, Apple has created a new kind of interface to headline the MacBook Pro's spec sheet. In place of the function keys above the keyboard, the laptop sports a Retina multi-touch secondary display. The "Touch Bar" is contextually aware and provides one-touch access to controls in open apps. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) Apple Touch Bar is integrated into many of Apple's built-in apps including Mail, Finder, Calendar and Numbers. In Safari, it can show open tabs and favourites, letting you switch view without reaching for the touchpad. In Messages, the Touch Bar becomes an emoji strip. Alternatively, in Photos, Touch Bar lets you scroll through thumbnails and edit images from a regular typing position. Third-party developers will also be able to access the Touch Bar. Apple has improved the MacBook Pro's primary display too. Available in 13-inch or 15-inch form, the Retina panel is up to 67 percent brighter than the outgoing model. It benefits from new power-saving technologies that reduce overall consumption by up to 30 percent, leading to a longer battery life. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) Apple Apple has managed to make the laptop up to 17 percent thinner at just 14.9mm on the 13-inch model. Despite the reduction in interior space, the MacBook Pro is now more powerful than ever. It's available with processors up to Intel's sixth-generation quad-core Core i7 chips with discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics. Every model features an SSD with sequential read speeds greater than 3GBps. There's also support for biometric authentication via Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensors, making an appearance on Mac for the first time. It can be used to login to Mac OS and compatible websites in Safari. Alongside the headline features, Apple has also improved the laptop's speakers, keyboard and touchpad. Apple says the MacBook's sound now has double the dynamic range and additional bass. The touchpad is 46 percent larger on the 13-inch model, rising to 50 percent larger on the 15-inch version. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) Apple The launch of the new MacBook Pro comes during the 25th anniversary week of the first Apple notebook PC. After letting the line stagnate for a while, the release marks a significant improvement in the premium laptop's capabilities. With the Touch Bar, Apple has brought something new to the traditional laptop form factor, introducing a new kind of input device that replaces the function keys with media playback controls, quick access shortcuts and bookmark links. It's likely to be more useful to typical consumers than the typical F1-F12, although not everyone will appreciate the change. "This week marks the 25th anniversary of Apple’s first notebook; through the years each generation has introduced new innovations and capabilities, and it’s fitting that this all-new generation of MacBook Pro is the biggest leap forward yet," said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) Apple "With the groundbreaking new Touch Bar, the convenience of Touch ID, the best Mac display ever, powerful performance, improved audio, blazing-fast storage and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity in our thinnest and lightest pro notebook yet, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced notebook ever made." The baseline 13-inch MacBook Pro with a dual-core 2.0GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage starts at $1,499 and is available to purchase today. A faster model, with a 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, will start shipping in 2-3 weeks. Finally, the 15-inch Core i7 version can be pre-ordered today for shipping within the next month. All models can be purchased from Apple's website at Apple.com.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple on Thursday officially unveiled a new MacBook Pro with improved internals and revamped chassis. But the real story is the Touch Bar, which promises to change how people interact with programs such as Photos and iMovie. The unfortunate part is that Apple’s new MacBook Pros are pretty pricey. The 13-inch model with the Touch Bar starts at $1,799 and the price only goes up from there. The top of the line 15-inch model without any upgrades costs $2,799—but customize your order and it can get even more expensive than that. If you configure a 15-inch MacBook Pro with all available options, you’ll spend $4,299. The upgrade alone in storage from 512GB to 2TB is $1,200. That’s an absolutely incredible price. Hey, at least you can get up to 18 months of special financing. The new MacBook Pro promises better performance all-around, along with an improved display and a smaller overall footprint. But if you want your device with all the bells and whistles, you’re going to have to pay. And we thought Microsoft’s new Surface Studio was expensive.

The new Touch Bar, which is located just above the traditional keyboard, can be used for context-specific input, unlocking different functionality depending on each and every app. During the press event, presenters demonstrated the use of the Touch Bar for video editing with a new version of Final Cut Pro, picture editing with Photoshop, and as a DJ for Algoriddim's DJ app. Apple is also adding Touch ID to these new laptops, making it possible to switch computer accounts and secure online shopping with fingerprint recognition. The company will sell a 13-inch Macbook Pro with Touch Bar at various configurations starting at $2499, and a 15-inch version starting at $3999. Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller speaks on the new Apple Touch Bar (Getty) Aside from Touch Bar and Touch ID, both machines also feature other hardware updates, with faster processors, brighter screens and an overall lighter weight. The cheapest 13-inch has a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage, and ships today. It doesn't have the Touch Bar. But for $2999 you get the Tough Bar, a 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. That one ships in a few weeks. The cheaper 15-inch model has the Touch Bar and Touch ID, a 2.6 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5 GHz, 16GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. It ships in a few weeks also. For $4699, you get twice as much storage and a better processor. But there are also some changes that may not go over well with everyone: Apple is ditching some ports on the Macbook Pro, including the HDMI port and SD card slot included with older models. Instead, it is adding more Thunderbolt 3 ports. The company is also shipping both devices with smaller batteries than the ones it used for previous-generation Macbook Pros, which could affect how long consumers will be able to use the devices without plugging them in.

Called TV, the app will also work across iPhone and iPad, and enables users to search for TV shows and movies from their iTunes library as well as other apps. The app includes a Watch Now section where all a user’s available content is displayed, and is able to start streaming from within other video apps. (Screenshot) However, there is one pretty big caveat for keen streamers – the new app does not support Netflix or Amazon Video. Rivals yes, but also a big chunk of some of the best content, too. Netflix hasn’t ruled out joining at some point, according to Wired, but for now neither is there. Apple’s Eddy Cue, though, is confident about what the tech giant has to offer: “Using apps on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad has become the primary way for so many of us to watch television. (Screenshot/Apple) “The TV app shows you what to watch next and easily discover TV shows and movies from many apps in a single place.” (Screenshot/Apple) As well as the new TV app, Apple also revealed a partnership with Twitter that will enable Apple TV users in the US to see social media streams alongside sporting events as they are happening live. A new feature using Apple’s voice-powered assistant Siri was also announced. Called Live tune-in, it can find live news and sport based on a single voice command – taking users directly to the stream and relevant app once prompted.

Launched earlier today, the new MacBook Pro features the Touch Bar – a strip of glass built into the top of the keyboard. "We're introducing a new way to interact with your notebook," said Apple's chief design officer Jonathan Ive. "A multi-touch bar that provides a more intuitive, more immediate connection to your content." This bar replaces the function keys and changes automatically based on what the user needs. It can be used to adjust volume and brightness, write with predictive text and emojis, skip through audio and video, and access shortcuts. Icons on the bar will also be customisable in some apps. "Commands that were once hidden are now visible, accessible and also customisable," said Ive. "In each application, the most relevant controls are displayed dynamically, allowing you to work with greater efficiency." Additionally, the bar incorporates Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology, so users can unlock their machines almost instantly, as well as use Apple Pay on their laptops. Integrated speakers have also been redesigned to provide up to 58 per cent more volume, and bass that is two and a half times louder. Related story Apple's AirPod headphones connect wirelessly to iPhones and other devices Pressure-sensitive Force Touch trackpads are up to twice as large, providing more space for gestures during activities like digital drawing. The main screen features brighter LED backlighting and an increased contrast ratio. Apple also claims that the models are up to 17 per cent thinner than the current devices. "With our new design, the product's overall volume has been reduced dramatically," said Ive. "This results in an extremely purposeful and powerful creative tool." The announcement coincides with the 25th anniversary of the release of the company's first notebook, the PowerBook, and follows a series of launches last month. The iPhone 7 smartphone, AirPod wireless earphones and Apple Watch Series 2 were all revealed at the company's Keynote event in September 2016.

No new iMacs, Mac Pro or Mac Mini at Apple's October Mac event 0 Share: Laptops by David Carnoy October 27, 2016 2:14 PM PDT @DavidCarnoy Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Enlarge Image The Mac Mini hasn't been updated in two years.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Rumor had it that the focus of Apple's October event would be on its new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and sure enough it was, with a new, entry-level 13-inch MacBook with standard functions keys thrown in as a bonus. But if you were hoping for news about any other new hardware products, you didn't get it. Here's a quick look at some products we've been hoping Apple might update: iMac: The last iMac update came in late 2015, with bumps to the processors and Retina displays across the line. Nothing new on that front yet, even as Microsoft is debuting a promising touch-screen competitor, the Surface Studio. Mac Mini: The Mac Mini, Apple's most affordable computer, was last updated in October 2014. Exclusive interview Does the Mac still matter? Mac Pro: Forgot about this one, didn't you? Apple's powerhouse canister Mac desktop computer made its debut in December, 2013. It hasn't been updated since. MacBook: Nothing new on Apple's super-slim 12-inch MacBook. We didn't expect anything new, but a $100 price drop would have been nice. Networking/storage accessories: Apple last updated the AirPort Extreme and AirPort Time Capsule in June 2013, while the AirPort Express was last updated in June 2012. We're still waiting for new versions. 47 All the action at Apple's Hello Again event iPad Pro 12.9-inch: We didn't expect anything new on the iPad front, but the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is a year old. A processor or screen update -- to bring it into line with the 9.7-inch Pro that debuted in March -- would've been nice. New Apple TV with 4K and HDR: Yes, Apple gave us a new Apple TV app called TV that conveniently aggregates content from all your video apps. But it'd be nice if Apple TV did 4K (with HDR support) like Roku's latest video streamers. Thunderbolt Display: Everybody thought Apple was killing its old Thunderbolt Display earlier this year to make way for a new one. But at today's event Apple talked up a 27-inch, 5K UltraFine Display from LG to pair up with its new MacBooks. Editors' note, 2:14 p.m. PT: Added Thunderbolt Display to the list.

As usual, Apple is expected to upload the video to YouTube and iTunes at some point later in the day. Apple always shares a few commercials during its keynotes as well, and today was no different, with six videos hitting its YouTube channel in the minutes following the event's ending. The videos include a focus on Apple's venture into accessibility, and of course deeper dives into all of the features of the all-new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. - Apple – Accessibility – Sady (with Audio Descriptions) - Apple – Accessibility – Sady - MacBook Pro — QWERTY - MacBook Pro — Reveal - The new MacBook Pro — Design, Performance and Features - The new MacBook Pro featuring Touch Bar – So much to touch In addition to the videos posted online about the MacBook Pro, you can catch up with all of the news out of the Hello Again event by checking out our list of keynote highlights below, which encompass all of MacRumors' event coverage posted today. Besides plenty of news articles surrounding the MacBook Pro and Touch Bar, as well as the discontinuation of the MacBook Air, there's also pieces about the new "TV" app coming to tvOS and iOS, and gaming-related announcements, like Minecraft launching on the fourth-generation Apple TV.

The breakout feature is, as widely speculated, a new touch-sensitive panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple's top-of-the-line laptop. The touch bar will offer functionality that's familiar to many iPhone users. It shows word suggestions as you type and lets you scroll through libraries of emojis. When watching movies, the touch bar can offer playback controls. When editing photos, the touch bar changes to offer options to lighten or rotate. It adapts and offers different controls for whatever app or website you're using. The Pro will also come with a fingerprint sensor, similar to one in the iPhone, to unlock the device. It can recognize different users and offer quick switching based on the fingerprint. The new Macs will also offer a dedicated key for the Siri voice assistant, a feature added with the MacOS Sierra update last month. In keeping with recent updates to other Apple products, the company will replace some computer ports with a new USB-C outlet. Connectors using USB-C technology can transmit data faster than older USB jacks. They're also smaller and have a uniform shape, which means the USB-C jack can be inserted with either side facing up. Apple unveiled the new Macs at an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California. During the event, Apple also said it wants to unify television viewing on its streaming TV device with a new app simply called "TV." LAPTOPS VS. TABLETS The changes to the Mac are the first significant ones in years. Sales of the Mac have been in a slump this year, after a streak of growth in 2014 and 2015 that seemed to defy global trends. Consumers generally are buying fewer PCs and using smartphones or tablets instead. Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as a device capable of replacing the laptop for many users. And in contrast with the Mac's earlier years — when Apple marketed its computers to people who saw themselves as creative professionals or just independent thinkers — Apple has begun promoting the Mac as a computer for business users, too. Microsoft, traditionally a software company, has begun selling its own line of high-end Surface laptops and this week introduced its first Surface desktop PC. Like the iMac in years past, analysts say the new Surface machine has a premium price and features that will most likely appeal to visual designers and other creative professionals. For Apple, the Mac line has been eclipsed financially by other products — first the iPod and now the iPhone — that have made far more money in recent years. Apple sold $22.8 billion worth of Macs in its past fiscal year, although that was just 11 percent of the company's total revenue. It sold $136 billion worth of iPhones. In the most recent quarter, Apple sold 9.3 million iPads and 4.9 million Macs, although the iPads accounted for just $4.3 billion in sales while the Macs contributed $5.7 billion. But the Mac has remained a significant product for Apple, and one that's important to intensely loyal fans. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the first Macintosh in 1984 with the famous commercial of a woman hurling a hammer at a dystopian overlord, setting the tone for Apple's corporate marketing strategy in the years to come. BABY STEPS IN TV Apple TV is a newer endeavor, and the new TV app could make it easier for viewers to find shows to watch, as it means they don't have to check individual apps. Amazon's Fire TV is taking a similar approach with a software update, though the unified experience will be part of the home screen, not an app. The app, though, is short of a full-fledged streaming-TV service, which reports say Apple has been pursuing. Rather, it brings together TV shows and movies viewers already get through individual subscriptions. The TV app will be synced with iPhones and iPads, so viewers can catch the next episode regardless of device. Apple said its Siri voice assistant will also direct viewers to live events, such as streaming sports. Apple said Apple TV already has 8,000 apps, including more than 2,000 games. The addictive building game "Minecraft" will come later this year. Separately, Apple said it's delaying shipment of its wireless AirPod earphones, which had been scheduled for late October. In a statement, the company said, "We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." Apple didn't elaborate. A Nike edition of Apple Watch for runners will still go on sale on Friday as planned. - Brandon Bailey, AP Technology Writer Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Business Names in the News Does your company have a recent hire, promotion, appointment or honoree to announce?

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy October 27, 2016 Apple unveiled its latest laptops today, but they don’t seem wildly different from their predecessors. And one thing that definitely hasn’t changed is Apple’s approach to upselling. At the event in Cupertino, Apple revealed prices for memory and storage upgrades on the new MacBook Pro that far outstrip the cost of the components. On the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar, the base hard drive option is a solid-state 512 gigabyte hard drive. If you want to upgrade to a 1 terabyte (TB) hard drive, it’ll set you back an extra $400, and if you want to upgrade to a 2 TB hard drive on the 15-inch MacBook Pro (this option isn’t available on the smaller Pro), you’ll have to pay an extra $1,400. (Apple’s cheapest modern laptop, the MacBook, is actually $200 cheaper than that storage upgrade.) A 1 TB solid-state hard drive for a laptop costs about $250 on Amazon. A 2 TB hard drive runs about $760. These aren’t made for Macs, so it’s not a perfect comparison, but you get the idea. You could even buy a complete HP computer with a 17-inch screen and a 2 TB hard drive for only slightly more than the MacBook Pro upgrade. Apple has always prided itself on creating well-designed, well-built machines that just work. It also asks customers to pay a premium for that experience. But with rival machines creeping up in quality every year, it’s not clear how long Apple can continue doing that. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Apple debuts “TV,” a TV guide and watchlist app for Apple TV, iPhone and iPad Posted Oct 27, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Minecraft comes to Apple TV Confirming a series of earlier reports which said Apple would launch a universal TV guide to simplify watching video on the Apple TV, the company today announced a new app it’s simply calling “TV.” The new app will allow you to track your favorite shows and movies across the video apps across the Apple TV platform. The problem with watching video on Apple TV – or really, any streaming media device – is that you have to move from app to app to find the programs or movies you want to see. Companies have been addressing this issue in a variety of ways. For example, Roku offers a personalized “My Feed” section where users can track their favorite shows and movies, and learn about new releases. It also offers a universal search that will help you find the program in question across all the apps on its platform. Meanwhile, Amazon’s forthcoming new interface for its Fire TV products includes rows featuring your personalized video suggestions, pulled in from services like Netflix and HBO. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, there are now over 1,600 apps from video content providers on Apple TV today, which highlights the complexity of watching TV over-the-top via apps. How it works For Apple’s new TV app, the company has partnered with video providers in order to aggregate their content into a single view, so Apple TV owners can more easily see what’s available to watch. This way, users can find programs they like instead of worrying about which app actually houses the content. When you click to watch one of the programs, you’re just taken to the right app. When launched, the app will display a “Watch Now” section, where you can track the shows and movies you’re currently watching. Here, you’ll see things like how many minutes you have left on the movie or which season and episode you’re on in a series, for example. It will also alert you to new episodes from your favorite shows. From here, you can go into “Up Next” and “Recommended” sections, in order to find new things to watch from across favorite shows, movies, as well as iTunes purchases and rentals. In the “Recommended” section, content is organized into different groups, like trending shows and movies. And similar to iTunes, the TV app features curated “Collections,” which are thematic groupings of content, like political shows or thrillers, for instance. Other sections in the TV app, “Library” and “Store,” will point you to your prior iTunes purchases, including rentals, or let you browse for more movies and shows to buy. You can also use Siri will the new app, and the assistant is smart enough to know which app to launch to watch the program you ask about. For instance, if you want to watch the game, you just ask to watch the game – you don’t need to know which app is streaming it. You can also say things like “which games are on right now?” or “watch CBS News,” without having to navigate to the app directly. This feature, called Siri Live Tune-In, is available today. Unfortunately, Netflix is not participating in this experience, it’s been reported, and Apple did not explain why on stage or offer any promises of future integrations. It’s possible that Netflix bristled at giving away too much control to Apple, which could then choose which shows were promoted. In addition, while the app is primarily meant to address the challenges of watching across apps on Apple TV, the new TV app will also arrive on iPhone and iPad this December, the company says. Along with the new TV guide app, Apple is rolling out support for Single Sign-on, which was announced at WWDC 2016 as a tvOS feature. This lets you enter your username and password for your pay TV subscription only once, instead of in each video streaming app that requires authentication. tv-apple-tv-app tv-app-interface up-next watch-now-tv-app 0353 what-to-watch-tv-app interface-tv-app 0354 tv-app-store library-tv-app 0355 tv-app-ipad-1 screen-shot-2016-10-27-at-10-03-26-am tv-app-ipad tv-app 0357 tv-app-icon  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit When you add a new app to your TV app, it’s installed on all your devices. Then, thanks to Single Sign-on, you can just launch the app and start watching your show. Both USA Today and Recode previously reported on Apple’s plans for a TV guide app and watchlist. “We want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television,” said Tim Cook, when announcing the new product. “One place to access all of your TV shows and movies.” While it seems like a universal TV guide would be great for cord cutters, the reality is that a lot of the video apps still require authentication in order to work. That means you still have to pay for a cable or satellite TV subscription. The new guide will make it easier for you to navigate through these apps, but the only advantage to watching via apps is that you can access the programming on-demand, as opposed to in a linear fashion. large_2x-1 large_2x large_2x-2  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Project Zero in the XNU kernel at the core of Apple's iOS and macOS platforms. Ian Beer of Google Project Zero first reported the XNU kernel vulnerability to Apple in February. And, according to Beer, Apple has since shipped two iterations of mitigations before releasing a refactor in macOS 10.12.1 and iOS 10.1. Beer said the simplest way to describe the kernel vulnerability was, "You cannot hold or use a task struct pointer and expect the [effective unique identifier (EUID)] of that task to stay the same." "When a [binary file with permissions set to Set owner User ID upon execution] is executed, it's true that the task's old task and thread ports get invalidated; however, the task struct itself stays the same. There's no fork and no creation of a new task. This means that any pointers to that task struct now point to the task struct of an EUID 0 process," Beer described in the Chromium bug report. Ultimately, Beer said this could lead to either a privilege escalation or sandbox-escape exploit. Beer noted that "this isn't an easy bug class to fix" and required a lot of work from Apple to fix the XNU kernel, which may explain the eight-month lag between his initial report to Apple and release of a full fix. "Due to the design of XNU, there are task_t pointers everywhere, and the underlying issue affects more than just task_t; threads suffer from the same issue. Apple decided to refactor the execve code to allocate new task and thread structures when loading a binary, which should fix the underlying issue," Beer wrote in a blog post. "This is a considerable amount of work; kudos to Apple for the engineering effort they put into fixing these bugs, and I look forward to the release of the MacOS 10.12.1 XNU source to see the new code." Pwn2Own 2016 Meanwhile, at Pwn2Own 2016 in Tokyo, Tencent's Keen Security Lab team won $375,000 -- plus potential bonuses -- in prizes for two exploits of an iPhone 6s running iOS 10.1 and an exploit of a stock Google Nexus 6P. Keen Security Lab had partial success installing a rogue application on the iPhone 6s, but did not receive full marks because the app did not persist through a reboot of the phone. Keen Security Lab also made use of a use-after-free bug in the renderer and a memory corruption bug in the sandbox to take photos off an iPhone 6s.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Apple MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar: Thinner, brighter, faster, and very touchy feely Stuart Miles27 October 2016Laptops Pocket-lint From £1,749 (with Touch Bar) Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple has revamped its MacBook Pro range delivering a device that is thinner, lighter and more powerful, and we were at the Apple Event at the company's headquarters to check it out ahead of it going on sale in November. Rather than just roll out the usual annual revamp of new and improved internal specs, the company has added a new feature, called Touch Bar, that it hopes will change the way you use your Mac in the future. Apple MacBook Pro (2016): Exterior design Now available in grey or the traditional MacBook Pro silver, the new MacBook Pro will come in two sizes, 13- and 15-inch, and three different off the shelf models. It will feature a somewhat familiar design, but with a number of enhancements. On the outside that means all the familiar ports have been removed, like the MacBook that launched in 2015. The MacBook Pro ditches the USB sockets, the SD card slot, DisplayPort, the Magsafe power adapter, in fact everything except the headphone socket - clearly not enough Courage just yet. Don't panic though, the MacBook Pro does have connections. Four Thunderbolt 3 sockets that can be used to power and connect to an array of different devices, supporting standards like USB Type-C, DisplayPort, HDMI and more. Those changes mean that the laptop is now considerably smaller and thinner than before, with Apple being able to shave 3mm off the thickness without resorting to the Apple MacBook Air trick of a thin wedge design.  This is Apple simplifying, but it could also lead, in the short term, to dongle city, as you'll need to use adapters to connect most existing equipment you have, or upgrade to different cables. Apple MacBook Pro (2016): Release date, specs and everything you need to know Pocket-lint Apple MacBook Pro (2016): Under the lid Flip the lid and the new MacBook Pro has gone under a radical design change too. The screen is much brighter, crisper, and more colourful, with the 13-inch model offering a 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution and the 15-inch model 2880 x 1800 pixels. The keyboard has been tightened, getting the same feel as the MacBook, while the trackpad has doubled in size. The keyboard is stiff, certainly compared to the current MacBook Pro range, and it's a similar, but improved, tech found in the current 12-inch MacBook keyboard. It's comfortable to type on, but will take a moment to realign your typing skills. The tighter keyboard is now sandwiched between two speakers that promise a louder, clearer, cleaner noise although we were unable to tell the improvement based on the loud gaggle of journalists at the event keen to get their hands on the new laptop. Pocket-lint Apple MacBook Pro (2016): The Touch Bar While these changes might not affect how you do use your MacBook Pro on a daily basis, the biggest change, and one that is likely to get the biggest wow, is the introduction of a new feature called Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is OLED strip that replaces the Fn and system keys, running across the top of the keyboard. It dynamically changes based on what you're doing and what apps you're using. It doesn't offer any form of haptic feedback however, it's for touch only. That means it can go from offering volume keys one minute to displaying an array of smiling emoji the next. It's very cool, very responsive, and very easy to use. We especially like the ability to scroll through pictures in the Photos App or picking the right emoji in a tweet. The visual performance is similar to the Apple Watch; it is beautifully crisp and clean. Switch apps and the options change, while you can customise the default options all via the settings display. Furthermore, the Touch Bar has a Touch ID sensor buried beneath it at the far right-hand side hidden under a small piece of sapphire crystal (presumably to stop it scratching). That means you'll not only be able to unlock your Mac in the same way you do your iPhone, but also use Apple Pay on the web. While the keyboard is identical in size on both the 13 and 15-inch models, the trackpad on the 15-inch model is considerably larger, meaning more space to work on this bigger model. For those on a budget (a £1,449 sort of budget) there is an entry-level MacBook Pro available without the Touch Bar. This model also only has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple Touch Bar: What can I do with it and what apps are supported? Pocket-lint Apple MacBook Pro (2016): At the core It's not just about the exterior, the internals gets a refresh too with new processors, new graphics, and faster storage. The starting model features a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1GHz, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage and will cost £1,449 making it a very pricey upgrade from the £900 12-inch MacBook or £949 MacBook Air. If you want to get that Touch Bar you'll have to dig deep. Featuring a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3GHz, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD it will cost £1,749.  If you want to go big, there is a 15-inch MacBook Pro that comes with the Touch Bar, a 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5GHz, 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD, but that will cost you £2,349. This also gets you AMD Radeon GPU options too. This is Apple returning back to the traditional MacBook Pro pricing of yesteryear and one that will insist you are serious about getting the company's new flagship laptop. There are a number of options, however, like storage, RAM and GPU on the 15-inch models, but the top configurations are costly. First Impressions With or without the Touch Bar the new 2016 Apple MacBook Pro looks to be an amazing laptop that will get MacBook users excited. It's smaller, lighter, but more powerful, bringing the MacBook Pro line back to be ahead of the MacBook launched last year. Adding the Touch Bar is a more innovative move. It gives Apple MacBook Pro users greater touch control they are probably used to without making the entire screen one big touch screen like the iPad. That was something that Steve Jobs always said was a big "no, no". But by adding touch elements that change an adapt, the laptop becomes a lot more intelligent, and smudge free. It's certainly got the wow factor, we can't wait to get to see how it works in the real world.

The Bad You're paying a hefty premium for the Touch Bar, which supports only a limited handful of Apple apps for now. The USB-C-only ports mean carrying a bag full of dongles. The lack of high-end graphics or huge RAM options in the 13-inch model may frustrate photo and video professionals. The Bottom Line Apple's smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro. 8.6 Overall Design 9.0 Features 8.0 Performance 8.0 Battery 9.0 Review Sections Review Prices Specifications User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Computers Laptops Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Apple's taking big swings with the new MacBook Pro. Some land square, some miss their mark. Altogether, this is a beautiful, powerful machine that almost everyone will want, but consider the trade-offs carefully. This MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than its predecessor, with a flattened keyboard and expanded touchpad. It has a newer selection of Intel processors, faster flash storage and a brighter Retina screen. The new MacBook Pro has also dropped all its legacy ports for Thunderbolt 3-powered USB-C -- a controversial move that requires you to buy a truckload of dongles, but also a move that many high-end Windows laptops are following. Apple even threw in the pleasing and very useful TouchID fingerprint sensor, imported almost whole-hog from the iPhone and iPad. But you know all that already. What you really want to learn about is the new MacBook Pro's headline feature: the Touch Bar, a tiny 1cm tall touchscreen that replaces the function key row on the top of new Pro's keyboard, and also jacks up the price for this high-end machine. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET We've already extensively covered the basics on the new 13- and 15-inch Pros, which were unveiled at Apple's headquarters on October 27 and are available for sale as of early November. That includes our exclusive early hands-on with the new MacBook Pro, as well as our review of the entry-level 2016 MacBook Pro model (which keeps its traditional function key row, and doesn't include TouchID). Start with both of those stories if you want an exhaustive overview of the design changes, component upgrades and port-related compromises of this MacBook Pro -- which is essentially the 10th anniversary edition of the original 2006 MacBook Pro. More on the MacBook Pro Apple's amazing strip show reinvents the laptop keyboard Apple MacBook Pro (no Touch Bar) review: The Retina MacBook Air you've always wanted Does the Mac still matter? Jony Ive talks about putting the Apple 'touch' on the MacBook Pro The Mac and iPad aren't merging. Get over it Here, however, we're focusing on that Touch Bar. How does it work? Is it useful? Can it replace the iPad-like touchscreen Mac we're not likely to get in the foreseeable future, according to our recent exclusive interviews with Apple execs? View full gallery The new MacBook Pro (on the left) is thinner than the previous design. Sarah Tew/CNET I've lived with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for almost two weeks. Here's what I learned. A tiny slice of iPad on your MacBook The Touch Bar is a long, skinny OLED touchscreen that sits above the keyboard, replacing the traditional F1-F12 keys, as well as the escape key and power button. On the far right end of the Touch Bar is a fingerprint reader, similar to the one found on the iPhone, which enables Touch ID and Apple Pay for secure system log-ins and online payments. By default, the Touch Bar displays system tools, including screen brightness and volume control. But when using select apps (for now mostly Apple-created apps such as Safari, but more third-party support is on the way), new contextual commands appear on the Touch Bar, and the system tools roll up into a condensed version on the right side of the strip. You can still access volume and brightness controls, but to get the full default list of commands back, you'll have to tap on a small arrow to expand it (which also hides the contextual commands for the app you're currently using). View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Having spent some serious hands-on time with the Touch Bar version of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, and testing its capabilities with a wide range of apps, it feels like a tool that can enhance your computing experience, but won't revolutionize it. It does less than a full touchscreen might, but Apple has found a way to use it to cut down on keystrokes, streamline tasks and add additional levels of fine control. I almost immediately started find little things it did better than traditional keyboard and touchpad input Some who've seen the Touch Bar only from afar call it a gimmick, but I almost immediately started finding little things it did better than traditional keyboard and touchpad input, and after a very short time I was using a handful of these Touch Bar functions instinctively, without even thinking about it. If you spend a bit of time trying it out in different apps, you'll end up with maybe a half-dozen or so shortcuts you love the Touch Bar for, while your computing experience remains otherwise unchanged. That makes it harder to justify as an expensive add-on to the new MacBook Pro line. The least expensive Touch Bar system is the one reviewed here, at $1,799 (£1,749 or AU$2,699). That's a $300 jump over the more mainstream $1,499 entry level MacBook Pro (£1,449 or AU$2,199), which lacks the Touch Bar. But in addition to the Touch Bar, this version also has a faster processor (a 2.9GHz Intel Core i5, versus a 2.0GHz Core i5), marginally better integrated Intel graphics (Iris 550 versus Iris 540), and it doubles the number of included USB-C Thunderbolt ports to four. So at least you're getting more for your $300 than just the Touch Bar. View full gallery The new MacBook Pro has a shallower butterfly keyboard. Sarah Tew/CNET Previously, the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro cost $1,299 (£1,249 or AU$1,999), but that model had half the storage of these new ones, only 128GB. Note that if you're kicking yourself for missing out on the older Pro (which was excellent in its own right), with its lower starting price and wider variety of ports, Apple is still selling a single 13-inch and single 15-inch 2015-era configuration, at least for now. Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch) Price as reviewed $1,799, £1,749 or AU$2,699 Display size/resolution 13.3-inch 2,560 x 1,600 PC CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5 PC Memory 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 Graphics Intel Iris Graphics 550 Storage 256GB PCIe SSD Networking 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 4.2 Operating system macOS Sierra One bar, many versions The Touch Bar is is filled with possibilities, but like the branching menus within menus it's supposed to replace, some of its functions can remain buried under additional taps and swipes, depending on which apps you use it with. There's only so much one can fit into a 2,170x60 display. Actual instructions for how to use the Touch Bar are sparse. Instead, it's up to you to eyeball the new buttons that pop up contextually in each supported application and figure out how to use them. In most cases, it's presented logically, but some on-screen buttons have layers within them, and navigating deeper in and then moving back out isn't always intuitive (as in the case of Photos, Apple's photo organizing and tweaking app). In other cases, the Touch Bar buttons are a perfect distillation of the most important functions in an app (such as Safari or Messages), and easy to pick up and use immeidately. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Each Touch Bar series of commands has its own visual and organizational language. That's easy enough to translate when only Apple-created programs are supported, but we'll have to wait and see how other software makers handle the Touch Bar. Windows PC makers have struggled for years with how to properly present proprietary software interfaces, asking consumers to learn and relearn new behaviors for apps they may already be familiar with, or for programs and features that may disappear or change radically in the next version. Adobe is one company you really want to watch in this space. A key partner for Touch Bar support, Photoshop will add Touch Bar controls later this year. It'll be very interesting to see what they do, and if long-time Photoshop users take to it. That's especially important because Adobe is a master of extreme usability and platform continuity. (As an example, I took a single-semester Photoshop tutorial course as a college undergrad way back in the 1990s. All these years later, and through countless versions of Photoshop, and I can still sit down in front of the latest iteration of the software and have a basic idea of what I'm doing.) View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Microsoft has also pledged to add Touch Bar support for Office. But until those companies and others deliver, it's all about Apple's in-house apps, including Mail, Messages, iTunes and Safari. I found the Touch Bar added something useful to each of these, but that's predicated on actually using those apps. If you prefer Spotify to iTunes, or Chrome to Safari, there's not much the Touch Bar can do for you from within those apps, besides the basic system functions previously mapped to the Function key row, such a volume controls. One interesting comparison to make is to Microsoft's new Surface Dial. That physical control knob works on many Windows PCs, but is specifically designed with the Surface Studio desktop in mind, and it covers a lot of the same ground as the Touch Bar. Both the Bar and Dial offer easier access to specific menu items in select apps. Like the Touch Bar, the Dial provides basic system functions, including volume controls, when not in a supported app. Both are very early in their development, and both call out for wider app support (neither has a Photoshop-specific set of controls yet). For illustrators and animators, I can see the real appeal of the Surface Dial and its big, analog-feeling wheel. For more efficient general computing, so far I find that Apple's Touch Bar is the more immediately useful of the two ideas. First steps The initial thing you'll want to do with the Touch Bar is set up Touch ID. That uses Apple's custom T1 security chip, which is built into the system, and the fingerprint reader that sits on the far right side of the Touch Bar. Setup is similar to an iPhone, with repeated fingertaps on the sensor recording fingerprint data. Unlike an iPhone and iPad, Macs support multiple user profiles, so each person using the machine can set up fingerprint access to their profile. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET User switching via fingerprint is especially impressive, and nearly instantaneous. I set up a "CNET" profile linked to one finger and a personal profile linked to a different finger. Just by placing each finger in turn on the Touch ID and clicking down (it's both a fingerprint sensor and a physical button), the profiles switched on the fly. After setting up the fingerprint access, which can also be used for Apple Pay purchases from supported merchants, you might also want to change the default lineup of buttons available on the Touch Bar. That menu is a little hard to find, tucked away in System Preferences under Keyboard > Customize Control Strip (oddly, it's called Control Strip here, and not Touch Bar). View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET From that menu, new buttons can be dragged down to the bottom of the screen, where they'll appear on the Touch Bar, and from there, can be moved left and right. For example, I swapped out the Launch Pad button for a Show Desktop button. The default setup is the logical choice for most, but customization options are always welcome.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search New MacBook Pro hands-on Chris Davies - Oct 27, 2016 6 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Somehow both familiar and fresh, the new MacBook Pro is more than the sum of its parts: there’s some witchcraft in here, too. I’ve spent some hands-on time with Apple’s new flagship notebook, just announced at the company’s Cupertino HQ in California today, and it’s the upgrade many Mac users have been waiting with middling degrees of patience. More importantly, it feels like the final piece of Apple’s argument against touchscreen notebooks and 2-in-1s. The rumor machine may have spoiled the big Touch Bar surprise – even if we weren’t entirely sure of its name at the time – but there’s a big difference between seeing it in renders and using it in person. It’s definitely the feature your eyes latch onto first when you see the new MacBook Pro, eclipsing the skinnier body and even the larger trackpad. When it comes down to it, our eyes are used to regular aspect-ratio displays, and that’s very different from this narrow strip. Apple isn’t the first to put a display where the function keys once were, and Lenovo beat them to that. What helps distinguish Apple’s system is the brightness and clarity of its display: it’s hard to believe this isn’t a printed panel backlit, rather than an actual screen. It’s only when the graphics start changing that you can accept what you’re seeing. The physical design is clever, too. The Touch Bar has the same feel as the regular keycaps, which helps switching between keyboard and touch-strip as your fingers flick between them. It’s not sapphire glass – that’s reserved for the Touch ID reader at the far right – but it feels like it could handle some fairly aggressive stabs of your fingertip. Touch ID lets you log into the MacBook with a finger-press, switch between users, and authorize Apple Pay payments – there’s a neat red readout of your total that runs alongside on the Touch Bar like a point-of-sale terminal. Still, I feel like most people will get more use out of the contextually-changing app shortcuts and buttons that show up. By default, you get shortcuts for volume and such, though they can be customized: you drag the other options down from the display, and then slot them into the row of buttons (which are wiggling, iOS-rearrange style). Expand it, and you get the keys you’d find on a traditional Function row bar from an earlier MacBook. That includes an Escape key, if you were losing sleep over that. However it’s in other apps when the Touch Bar really comes into its own. Scrolling through photo thumbnails in Photos or webpage tabs in Safari; getting shortcuts to the most common controls in apps like Word and Mail. Tap them, and they flourish open to give more granular control, like dragging scroll bars or swiping through filters. It works, because it’s sufficiently high-resolution to show enough of the thumbnails to be useful, and because it’s very responsive. Coupled with the oversized trackpad – now so large, those with thick wrists might start to think Apple has something against them, though I’m told palm-rejection is significantly improved for the new machine – you can bring both hands into play, as though you’ve got a perfect memory for keyboard shortcuts but without having to actually remember them. If I had one lingering complaint, is that haptic feedback – like you get when you tap the iPhone 7’s home button or, indeed, the Force Touch trackpad on the new MacBook Pro – would be nice. Still, as I used it, I couldn’t help but think that it was Apple’s final answer to those demanding a touchscreen MacBook Pro. The argument – first set out by Steve Jobs years ago – was always that the ergonomics of reaching out to tap a laptop display just weren’t as comfortable as, say, leaning over a tablet like an iPad. Whether Surface Book fans would agree is questionable, but the new MacBook Pro’s approach shows that you can get a whole lot done with a full-screen image or video being edited, while your hands swarm over the keyboard deck. Most controversial, inevitably, is Apple’s decision to switch away almost entirely from legacy ports and embrace a Thunderbolt world. You still get a 3.5mm headphone jack, but all of the other connectors have been replaced with Thunderbolt 3. Two USB Type-C ports are on each side of the notebook, for both the 13- and 15-inch models. The upside to Thunderbolt 3 is clear. It’s much faster than USB or Thunderbolt 2, of course, and supports not only power, but video output and data. You can use any of the four ports to recharge; the 15-inch is capable of driving two 5K displays simultaneously, in addition to running its own screen, and those external displays can also recharge the MacBook Pro itself. Clearly, though, there are issues too. Get used to dongles if you want to plug in any legacy hardware, which at this point probably means the vast majority of your devices. That’s not entirely foreign to MacBook Pro owners who needed ethernet, for instance, but if you’ve been used to slotting an SD card into the side of your notebook, or plugging in a mouse or USB drive, you’ll now need an adapter in-between. I suspect in the long run the switch will be beneficial rather than a hindrance and, just as we saw with the USB Type-C on the 12-inch MacBook, will drive the progression of Thunderbolt 3 accessories. All the same, it’s going to earn Apple some criticism, not least because there are no dongles in the box with any of the new MacBook Pro models. All you get is the power adapter and a charging cable. As for the rest of the design, it’s the MacBook Pro you know, but skinnier. The keyboard isn’t quite like that of the 12-inch MacBook, despite the physical resemblance: if anything, it feels much like the best of old and new keyboards, with much more stable keys than the old MacBook Pro but deeper travel than the first iteration of the butterfly hinge. Bear in mind, I speak as a 12-inch MacBook keyboard fan. With a DCI P3 color compatible display – like the iMac 5K and the iPhone 7 – photos that take advantage of the wider color gamut look incredible. It’s the same resolution as before, but contrast takes a noticeable step up, as does color richness. NOW READ: All the news from today’s Apple event The new 13-inch MacBook Pro kicks off at $1,499, though to be frank I suspect you don’t really want that one. It’s Apple’s attempt to ween you off the MacBook Air, and so you don’t get the Touch Bar and have just two Thunderbolt 3 ports. You’ll need to spend $1,799 to get the Touch Bar, double up on the Thunderbolt 3, and step up the processor from a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 to a 2.9GHz Core i5. Opt for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, and that starts at $2,399. That comes with a 2.6GHz quad-core Core i7, 16GB of memory, a 256GB SSD, and AMD’s 2GB Radeon Pro 450 graphics. Throw the contents of your wallet at the configurator, and you can end up with a 2.9GHz quad-core Core i7, 16GB of memory, 2TB of SSD, and a 4GB Radeon Pro 460. You’ll also be $4,299 poorer.

Here's a huge spec breakdown. MacBook Pro vs. Surface Book vs. Razer Blade vs. Dell XPS 15 0 Share: Laptops by Sean Hollister October 27, 2016 12:37 PM PDT @starfire2258 Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Apple debuts MacBook Pro Apple announces its lightest, thinnest notebook ever. The new laptop features an all-metal design, a Touch Bar, and it comes in two sizes, 13-inch and 15-inch. It also comes in two colors, silver and space gray. 2:05 Close Drag If you really want a MacBook Pro, you'll buy a new MacBook Pro. But maybe you're on the fence. How does the new Mac compare to the Windows competition? Truth be told, there aren't as many direct competitors as you'd think. The recently upgraded Microsoft Surface Book, the 14-inch Razer Blade and the Dell XPS 15 are the main machines you'd probably buy instead -- if you're looking for a lot of processing power in a fairly thin frame.

Apple claims new MacBook Pros each have twice the graphical power of the ones it released in 2015. Still, that's only on the 15-inch model: most of these Windows machines will likely trounce the 13-inch MacBook Pro's integrated graphics in games and other graphically intensive tasks. And as you can see from the chart, the weight and size advantages also aren't as big as you'd think. Windows machines have made some major strides in the last few years while Apple was working on its big new update. On paper, battery life is definitely still the best reason to buy a Mac, unless you count the Surface Book -- but the Surface Book will likely have a dual-core processor. It's impressive that Apple is quoting 10 hours for the 15-inch quad-core. If you want a touchscreen or stylus, Windows is the way to go. Apple makes Thunderbolt 3 more versatile with USB-C charger Apple designs new ports for MacBook Pro with four Thunderbolt 3 ports; each one can also act as a charger. 2:20 Close Drag And there's always way more to any computer than you'll see in a spec sheet, even when it comes to specs: we're very curious how Apple's speedy new solid-state storage and improved display stack up, too.

The TV app combines all known video streaming services into one easy to use interface and you'll no longer need to switch apps for live TV or on demand content. The TV app always knows what you are watching and where you left the last time, follows your shows, and suggests new ones based on your library. The TV app supports all popular streaming services, but you have to have them installed on your device. You can do it within the app and once you authenticate within the service, TV adds all new content to its library, lists, and suggestions. With the TV app Apple wants to change the way you are watching TV and interacting with it. There is live Twitter feed support within the app, where you can see all relevant tweets real time without losing sight of what's happening. The app looks promising and can work on Apple TV, iPhones, and iPads. It will launch this December in the USA, with more markets to follow next year.

It killed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 series, and it killed a bunch of tried and true laptop features on the MacBook Pro as well. Don't worry though, the headphone jack isn’t one of them. DON’T MISS: The iPhone 7 has an exciting new feature that Apple is keeping secret It’s one thing to remove the aging headphone jack from the iPhone, and quite another to ditch features like the SD card slot that so many professional photographers use on a regular basis. Or the regular USB 3 port that so many people, including iPhone owners, use as frequently. Yes, you can’t make a thinner and lighter MacBook Pro without breaking a few ports. But it sure looks like at least the SD card reader could have stayed behind, at least for as long as SD cards are used by some of the people who’d be inclined to buy a MacBook Pro. So let's look at what Apple killed on the MacBook Pro: No SD support You will need an adaptor that can connect to a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port to use your existing microSD and SD cards. For some people, that’s not a problem. But I bet many people will disagree. Of note, the 12-inch MacBook doesn't have a built-in SD card reader either. No MagSafe charging Just like the 12-inch model, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros will not have a MagSafe charger. USB-C replaces that functionality, and we’re not surprised to see it gone. After all, Apple is all about uniformity in design — but the MacSafe will be sorely missed. No HDMI You can connect your MacBook to your TV using Apple TV, or you can use a dongle. If you don’t have one, then you won’t be able to use it with a good old HDMI cable because there’s no HDMI port on the 2016 MacBook Pro. No USB 3 You know those peripherals or smartphones that come with USB connectors? Well, you’re going to need dongles for them too. You can’t connect the iPhone, a hard drive, or any other accessory to the new MacBook Pro otherwise. BONUS: USB-C* This one isn't something Apple killed so we're not counting it in our tally, but it’s worth mentioning. Apple’s cheapest new MacBook Pro is a 13-inch machine that comes without a Touch Bar and is supposed to replace the MacBook Air. It only has two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of four. Fret not, though, because for $250 you’ll be able to buy the six dongles you need to bring back some of the features noted above.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) 1 sec. 2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec. Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Topics Apple Related Stories Apple owes up to $18.9B in back taxes: EU CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple unveiled long-awaited updates to its Mac computers Thursday, aiming to spark consumer interest in a product line often overshadowed by newer gadgets, such as the iPad and iPhone. The breakout feature is, as widely speculated, a new touch-sensitive panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple’s top-of-the-line laptop. The touch bar will offer functionality that’s familiar to many iPhone users. It shows word suggestions as you type and lets you scroll through libraries of emojis. When watching movies, the touch bar can offer playback controls. When editing photos, the touch bar changes to offer options to lighten or rotate. It adapts and offers different controls for whatever app or website you’re using. The Pro will also come with a fingerprint sensor, similar to one in the iPhone, to unlock the device. It can recognize different users and offer quick switching based on the fingerprint. The new Macs will also offer a dedicated key for the Siri voice assistant, a feature added with the MacOS Sierra update last month. In keeping with recent updates to other Apple products, the company will replace some computer ports with a new USB-C outlet. Connectors using USB-C technology can transmit data faster than older USB jacks. They’re also smaller and have a uniform shape, which means the USB-C jack can be inserted with either side facing up. Apple unveiled the new Macs at an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. During the event, Apple also said it wants to unify television viewing on its streaming TV device with a new app simply called “TV.” LAPTOPS VS. TABLETS The changes to the Mac are the first significant ones in years. Sales of the Mac have been in a slump this year, after a streak of growth in 2014 and 2015 that seemed to defy global trends. Consumers generally are buying fewer PCs and using smartphones or tablets instead. Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as a device capable of replacing the laptop for many users. And in contrast with the Mac’s earlier years — when Apple marketed its computers to people who saw themselves as creative professionals or just independent thinkers — Apple has begun promoting the Mac as a computer for business users, too. Microsoft, traditionally a software company, has begun selling its own line of high-end Surface laptops and this week introduced its first Surface desktop PC. Like the iMac in years past, analysts say the new Surface machine has a premium price and features that will most likely appeal to visual designers and other creative professionals. For Apple, the Mac line has been eclipsed financially by other products — first the iPod and now the iPhone — that have made far more money in recent years. Apple sold US$22.8 billion worth of Macs in its past fiscal year, although that was just 11% of the company’s total revenue. It sold $136 billion worth of iPhones. In the most recent quarter, Apple sold 9.3 million iPads and 4.9 million Macs, although the iPads accounted for just $4.3 billion in sales while the Macs contributed $5.7 billion. But the Mac has remained a significant product for Apple, and one that’s important to intensely loyal fans. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the first Macintosh in 1984 with the famous commercial of a woman hurling a hammer at a dystopian overlord, setting the tone for Apple’s corporate marketing strategy in the years to come. BABY STEPS IN TV Apple TV is a newer endeavour, and the new TV app could make it easier for viewers to find shows to watch, as it means they don’t have to check individual apps. Amazon’s Fire TV is taking a similar approach with a software update, though the unified experience will be part of the home screen, not an app. The app, though, is short of a full-fledged streaming-TV service, which reports say Apple has been pursuing. Rather, it brings together TV shows and movies viewers already get through individual subscriptions. The TV app will be synced with iPhones and iPads, so viewers can catch the next episode regardless of device. Apple said its Siri voice assistant will also direct viewers to live events, such as streaming sports. Apple said Apple TV already has 8,000 apps, including more than 2,000 games. The addictive building game Minecraft will come later this year. Separately, Apple said it’s delaying shipment of its wireless AirPod earphones, which had been scheduled for late October. In a statement, the company said, “We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Apple didn’t elaborate. A Nike edition of Apple Watch for runners will still go on sale on Friday as planned.

Times are a-changing. On Wednesday, Microsoft MSFT, -1.52%  unveiled the Windows 10 Creators Update that includes 3D imaging tools; new virtual-reality headsets that can be used through a HoloLens platform on Windows PCs; live broadcasting for Xbox; a $2,999 enterprise-grade desktop called Surface Studio that essentially folds into a table-sized tablet; the Surface Dial, which is an input device for Surface products that lets users toggle between different menu items by twisting it like a doorknob; and the Surface Book i7. Also Read: Microsoft’s new Surface Studio aims to compete with Apple’s iMac On Thursday, Apple AAPL, -2.51%  unveiled a new app for Apple TV that essentially is a glorified TV guide without the world’s two most popular streaming services on it — Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN, -2.70%  Prime Video and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.22%   — two new MacBook Pros that are marginally thinner and lighter than their predecessors, and a new input feature called Touch Bar that, similar to Surface Dial, lets users more easily interact with their screens from the top of their PCs and can adapt input options based on the software being used at the time. Live blog recap: Apple unveils new MacBook and TV app at underwhelming event While PiperJaffray analyst Gene Munster called Apple’s Mac updates “a solid evolution” to its Pro line of laptops, many other people argued it was hugely underwhelming when compared to Microsoft’s the day prior. That is an issue for Apple as it forecasts returning to sales growth this quarter after three straight quarters of declines. On Tuesday, Apple reported its first annual revenue decline in 15 years on the back of another week quarter. Fourth-quarter sales were down 9% year-over-year, weighed down by a 13% decline for the iPhone and a 17% decline for the Mac. The one bright spot was services, such as Apple Pay and Apple Care, which rose 24%. Sales from services surpassed $6 billion during the quarter, while revenue from the Mac declined to $4.9 billion. However, many analysts were hoping holiday sales for the Mac would help the company return to growth in the current fiscal quarter. Apple’s fiscal first-quarter revenue guidance between $76 billion and $78 billion brackets the Wall Street consensus of $77.4 billion, according to FactSet. The company’s Mac line has faced increased competition from the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -2.38% GOOGL, -2.40%   in recent years, particularly amid the rise of sophisticated two-in-one tablets, such as the Surface Book. The Mac performed poorly during back-to-school shopping compared with Google’s Chromebook Pixel. Thursday’s event likely did little to fuel optimism. Shares of Apple fell more than 1% to $114.35 shortly after the event ended Thursday afternoon. Its shares have outperformed in the past three months, rising 11% versus a 1.7% decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.11%   and a 1.5% decline for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.01%   . However, they’ve underperformed on the year, declining 0.2% in the past 12 months, compared with more than 3% increases for both the Dow 30 and S&P.

At an event in California, Apple spent considerable time showing off its newest innovation for its new MacBook Pro. The company called it the "Touch Bar," which replaces the long-standing function keys at the top of the keyboard with a tiny, long touch-screen. The Touch Bar changes depending on the program that is running on the computer. It offers quick typing suggestions in a word processor, emojis in a texting program, or volume and play buttons in a music program. Related Content With Surface Studio, the Microsoft-Apple rivalry is alive and well Apple leaks its own new MacBook Pro It also offers "Touch ID", enabling a user to unlock the computer with a fingerprint. Apple said the laptop had a 67 per cent brighter screen, a faster processor, and was slimmer and lighter than previous models. Advertisement The new MacBook Pro comes with either a 15-inch or 13-inch screen, with both models featuring four Thunderbolt 3-enabled USB-C ports, any of which can be used for power, video output or data transfer. Those wanting to plug in a traditional USB device will need an adapter. The MacBook Pro also retains its 3.5mm headphone jack. Both models of the laptop can be configured with up to a 3.3Ghz i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. Unexpectedly, Apple also introduced a 13-inch MacBook Pro that does not have the Touch Bar, only has two USB-C ports and can only run lower speed processors. Given that the 13-inch Pro now weighs in at just 1.37 kilograms, this lower-end model appears to be a replacement for the MacBook Air. The new Touch Bar will offer a range of customisable functionality depending on the situation. Photo: AP In Australia the 13-inch Pro, 13-inch Pro with Touch Bar and 15-inch Pro will start at $2199, $2699 and $2999 respectively. As is usually the case, each one can be upgraded with additional processing power, memory, storage or software for an additional cost. A 15-inch Pro with all the trimmings will cost $5259. Apple's Australian site shows the 13--inch Pro is ready to ship now, but the two models with the Touch Bar will be ready in two to three weeks. The new Pro comes in three versions and two colours. Photo: AP The Apple event comes just a day after Microsoft introduced two new expensive computers — the Surface Studio desktop PC and a new Surface Book.

Ryan Collins was sentenced to 18 months in prison for the hacks leading to the Sept. 2014 leaks of photographs of female celebrities known as "Celebgate." Collins pleaded guilty to a felony federal hacking charge before U.S. Middle District Senior Judge William W. Caldwell in May. According to U.S. Attorney Bruce D. Brandler, Collins admitted running a "phishing" scheme between 2012 and 2014 to obtain user names and passwords for the Apple and Google email accounts of his targets, who were primarily members of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. Collins employed a process called "phishing" in which he would send victims bogus requests from Apple and Google for account information. He would then use that stolen data to access their accounts, obtaining personal information including nude photos and videos. In addition to the phishing scam, Collins also ran a modeling scam in which he tricked victims into sending him nude photos. His arrest resulted from the investigation into the "Celebgate" leaks. No evidence has been found tying Collins to those leaks, however, nor is there evidence Collins shared or uploaded any information he illicitly obtained. Investigators found that Collins hacked into 50 iCloud and 72 Gmail accounts. More than 600 victims were identified.

Here are the most useful features and functions for business users. By Conner Forrest | October 27, 2016, 12:03 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Apple On Thursday, Apple refreshed its MacBook Pro product line by introducing the latest generation of its power user-focused laptops. The new MacBook Pro has a thin, sleek design with the familiar aluminum unibody design that the line is known for. The new MacBook Pro brings a plethora of updates that will appeal to most users and Apple fans, but there are a few specific features that professionals will be able to use to improve their productivity and get more work done. Here are the four most important things that enterprise users need to know about the newest MacBook Pro. SEE: Does the Mac still matter? (CNET) 1. Touch Bar Perhaps most anticipated feature of the new MacBook Pro was the Touch Bar, a retina display multi-touch bar that takes the place above the keyboard that was traditionally occupied by the function keys. The Touch Bar supports gestures and taps, and includes tools that are specific to each application or website.

In Apple's Mail app, it will present the buttons for actions such as composing a new message or flagging another message. In Safari, users can use Touch Bar to preview tabs and check favorites, which could help increase web productivity if you regularly work with web-based apps. The Touch Bar will also have quicktype suggestions as you are working in a document or email. Siri will have a dedicated key on the Touch Bar as well. If desired, the Touch Bar can be customized with new keys or control systems. Developers will be happy to know that Touch Bar has support for Terminal and Xcode, too. 2. Touch ID Touch ID is coming to the MacBook Pro as well, as a part of the Touch Bar. A fingerprint scanner is located on the right side of the Touch Bar where the power button would have traditionally been located, and it is covered with Sapphire crystal. The new Apple T1 chip supports Touch ID with Secure Enclave, so users can perform Apple Pay purchases with their finger on the MacBook Pro. Touch ID also allows for fast user switching between accounts on the device itself. If more than one user maps their fingerprint to the device, they can swap from one account to the account associated with their fingerprint by using Touch ID.

Ports Continuing the trend of eliminating certain ports that Apple set with the iPhone 7, the new MacBook Pro has ditched the MagSafe port for power. Instead, the computer can be charged using one of the four Thunderbolt 3 ports available on either the 13" or 15" core model. There is also a simpler 13" model with only two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The ports can also be used in a daisy-chain fashion to increase the number of peripherals and accessories. A new LG UltraFine 5K Display was also announced in a partnership between Apple and LG. The display was created specifically for MacBook Pro customers, and it connects via a single Thunderbolt 3 cable, and contains its own ports as well. The best part is that it will charge the MacBook Pro while it is connected to the display. 4. Specs There are three new versions of the MacBook Pro, as mentioned earlier. The core 13" and 15" models include the Touch Bar and four ports, while the lower-tier 13" model has no Touch Bar and only two Thunderbolt 3 ports. They are available in Silver or Space Grey. The new MacBook Pro also has a force touch trackpad that is twice as large as the previous generation. The core models both have a Superfast SSD, a new thermal architecture, and a new speaker design. The 13" model is available with an Intel i5 or i7 processor, while the 15" model is only available with an i7 processor. The 13" model without a touch bar starts at $1499, the 13" model with a touch bar starts at $1799, and the 15" model starts at $2399.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / Opinions / MacBook Pro 13 vs Dell XPS 13 New MacBook Pro 13-inch versus Dell XPS 13 by Michael Passingham 27 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Updated 11th November 2016: Since this original article was published, we've written our full review of the base model 13-inch MacBook Pro, and begun testing our 2016 Dell XPS 13. This gives us a much better idea of how the two compare, but we haven't yet seen one of the more expensive models. Things are slightly complicated here because there are two completely different versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro: A base model and a top-end device with Apple’s funky new Touchbar, more powerful processors and more ports. Watch: 13-inch MacBook Pro video review Related: Best laptop Full specification comparison (Based on Dell.com and Apple.com. Other retailers may vary. A previous version of this article incorrectly listed the XPS 13 as topping out at 8GB and 256GB SSD) Device Dell XPS 13 Base MacBook Pro 13 Top MacBook Pro 13 Weight 1.2kg 1.37kg 1.37kg Dimensions W: 304mm D: 200mm H: 15mm W: 304mm D: 212mm H: 15mm W: 304mm D: 212mm H: 15mm Processor choices 7th Gen Intel Core i5 and i7 6th Gen Intel Core i5 or Core i7 6th Gen Intel Core i5 or Core i7 Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Graphics 540 Intel Iris Graphics 550 RAM 8-16GB DDR3 8GB-16GB DDR3 8-16GB DDR3 Storage 128GB-1TBB PCIE SSD 256GB-1TB PCIE SSD 512GB-1TB SSD Screen Full HD to 3,200x1,800 2560x1600 2560x1600 Price £999-£1649 £1449-£2439 £1749-£2759 Design and build One thing that’s mostly the same between the two new MacBooks is the physical design, so this is a good place to start. The Dell XPS 13 wins off the bat in terms of weight, coming in 170g lighter than both 13-inch MacBook Pro models. The MacBook is slightly larger in terms of overall footprint, and side-by-side the Dell looks significantly smaller. Related: 5 things you need to know about the MacBook Pro Rounded up to the nearest millimeter, both the XPS 13 and MacBook are the same thickness. The materials used are different, of course. Apple has continued to use the tried and tested aluminium unibody design, while Dell has a metal body and lid with a wrist rest coated in carbon fibre. The MacBook is also available in a Space Grey material, like the 12-inch MacBook. The touchpad on the MacBook is substantially bigger than that on the XPS 13, which makes for much more comfortable gestures and swiping. The MacBook also gets Apple's Force Touch tech, which simulates a physical click using haptic feedback and allows for pressure-sensitive interactions. Apple’s Butterfly keyboard design makes a return and has been improved over last year's model. It won't be for everyone, but its a comfortable, accurate and responsive keyboard that's hard to beat. The more expensive 13-inch MacBook gets Apple’s clever Touch bar, which is a feature no other laptop on the planet has. We’ll go into more depth in a separate article, but based on our first impressions it looks incredibly useful. In terms of ports, the MacBook 13-inch gets four USB 3.1/Thunderbolt 3 ports for powering high-end peripherals such as monitors and storage arrays. No adapters are supplied in the box. You can plug the power adapter into any port and charge the device. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack. Dell gives you two regular USB 3.0 ports along with a USB 3.1/Thunderbolt 3 ports and an SD card reader. Performance This is where things get a little complicated. The cheaper 13-inch MacBook gets a Core i5 processor with a base clock speed of 2GHz, which is less powerful than the 2.5GHz base clock speed on the Dell XPS 13. Both cheapest models boost up to 3.1GHz. Moving up the range, the Dell XPS 13 offers a Core i7 processor with a maximum speed of 3.5GHz. The maximum speed on the top-end Core i7 in the 13-inch MacBook is 3.6GHz, which makes it slightly more powerful, but for a much greater price. Apple has the upper hand in terms of graphics. Intel's Iris brand of graphics is generally much better at 3D work and video playback than regular HD graphics, although we’ll have to run some benchmarks to make proper comparisons here. One thing to note is that the processors available with the Dell XPS 13 are newer, and part of Dell's 7th-gen 'Kaby Lake' line-up. But because Apple normally chooses bespoke Intel chips, direct comparisons are hard. We've tested the Core i7 XPS 13 and the base model i5 MacBook Pro, with a price difference of £150. Running an identical 3-minute video rendering task in Adobe Premier, the MacBook took seven minutes while the XPS 13 polished it off in a little over five. The difference is significant, and if raw processing performance is priority the XPS 13 is the better choice. All three devices come with a minimum of 8GB of RAM, while the most expensive specification of the MacBook gets a full 16GB. Models higher up the Dell XPS 13 range get 16GB of RAM. The cheapest 13-inch MacBook gets 128GB of PCI-E SSD storage, which is the same as the Dell XPS 13. From there, you can go up to 1TB depending on the model, but this increases the price substantially. The same applies to the Dell XPS 13, the most expensive version of which tops out at 1TB. Buy Now: Dell XPS 13 at Amazon.com from $1,070 Best Deals for Dell XPS 13 9350 Screen The cheapest Dell XPS 13 gets a 1,920x1,080-pixel Full HD display, while all the MacBooks get ‘Retina’ 2,560x1,600 screens. The top-end XPS 13 goes well beyond that with a 3,200x1,800-pixel panel that also gets a glossy touch layer. Pricing and conclusion Dell's XPS 13 starts out cheaper than the MacBook Pro and tops out at £1649 with the top-of-the-range model. The MacBook Pro goes well beyond that as you continue up the range, thanks to the more expensive storage and memory options at the top-end. This is in addition to the more powerful top-end processors that manage higher peak clock speeds than the processor available in the Dell XPS 13. At the bottom end, the XPS 13 is better value, but as you go up the MacBook range and gain access to the Touchbar and higher performance, the MacBook's price premium starts to make more sense. In the base model stakes, the XPS 13 holds the advantage, but we'll wait for our high-end MacBook Pro review before coming to a firm conclusion about the rest of the range.

The MacBook has DDR3. Also the XPS can get to 16 GB RAM, and a 1TB PCIe SSD. If you live in a different country that might be different. I'm in America, so that might be why it gets more powerful Gertjan October 28, 2016, 5:06 am I'm in Europe and i have an XPS 13 with 16gb of ram and 1tb ssd... So guess Nicolas is right in his comment... Also if i'm not mistaking the mac doesn't come with a touch screen while the uhd screen on the XPS does. Lars Jeppesen October 28, 2016, 8:00 am What a awful article. The Xps clearly kills the Mac in everything: battery, cpu, display, weight, price, ram What is wrong with you, author? Felipe Meyer October 28, 2016, 8:53 am How can we trust in TrustedReviews? So many errors!!! addicted4444 October 28, 2016, 10:17 am Intel's Skylake integrated graphics are not faster than their Kaby Lake graphics, irrespective of branding. Ahkey October 28, 2016, 10:44 pm The price of the base MacBook Pro 2016 is £1449 not £1249 - that price is for the 2014/15 model. Marco Lorenzo October 29, 2016, 4:26 am The top end XPS 13 with an i7 processor also comes with Iris graphics and 16GB RAM. Surprised you guys missed that. Rann Xeroxx October 31, 2016, 1:22 am Kinda just glossed over the fact that the XPS can come with a touch screen with Gorilla Glass. I mean who cares about some strip in place of the F keys when the who damn screen can be interacted with? And apps do not been special programing to work with this.

SHARE IT comments See All Slides Oct 27, 2016 2:30 PM Christina Bonnington At an event in Cupertino, CA, this morning, Apple unveiled the latest in its product lineup: a new MacBook Pro. And we can't lie — we're pretty excited about it. The MacBook Pro hasn't seen a major update in several years. Now, Apple's high-end notebook gets a much-needed redesign on the outside, but also has some serious upgrades on the inside, too. These should help you get things done faster and more efficiently, with fewer on-screen clicks. The biggest change with the new Pro though, is something called Touch Bar. Instead of those function keys above the keyboard, there's Touch Bar, a dynamic touchscreen strip that changes according what buttons you actually need to use. It's a little strange, but potentially very useful. Want to know more? Here are the five things you need to know about the new MacBook Pro. Begin Slideshow Photographed by Christina Bonnington.

Its new app, simply called “TV,” will house different content from all your favorite video-streaming apps in one place. “We want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television,” chief executive Tim Cook said. “It will completely change how you watch TV with your Apple TV, as well as with your iPhone and iPad.” Apple’s version of an interactive TV guide will sync digital catalogs and ongoing shows across all devices. A “Watch Now” pane gives curated top picks that users can browse. Once a show has been viewed, it’s added to an “Up Next” queue to make it easy to pick up where you left off with a series. You can also tell Siri to find and play a show or movie. During a demo on stage, a user asked Siri to play “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” and an episode immediately began to play, picking up at the exact point where the user last left off. Apple’s virtual assistant can also seek out live broadcasts on Twitter. The hub comes loaded with 8,000 apps—2,000 of which are games. Viral hits like Real Racing 3 and Minecraft (which is owned by Microsoft) will be available. "The future of TV is apps." Apple has 8,000 of them lined up for Apple TV. Over 2,000 games including Real Racing 3 and Minecraft! pic.twitter.com/r2KdQmvaBm — Ananya Bhattacharya (@Ananya_b94) October 27, 2016 TV will be available for free with a software update in December, but what you can view will be limited to the paid services you subscribe to. Users also have to individually sign into each of the various apps before Apple can start aggregating. Although the catalog’s look and feel is reminiscent of Netflix, the wildly popular video-streaming app isn’t part of TV. And unlike Netflix, which lets one account have multiple user profiles, Apple’s TV app did not announce any provision for shared devices. This TV app is way too personal. What about families that share laptops/iPads? Can you have multiple users like Netflix? — Ananya Bhattacharya (@Ananya_b94) October 27, 2016 New MacBook Pros The main focus of the event was the overhaul of Apple’s flagship laptops. There will be three models available, with very similar names: Here is Apple’s (confusingly named) new laptop lineup — an entry level 13” MacBook Pro that doesn’t have a Touch Bar, and one that does pic.twitter.com/SpbyQhYRrN — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) October 27, 2016 The two machines on the right will have a small touch screen where the function keys usually sit on a keyboard (more on that later), and the computer on the left will just have regular keys. They’re all called MacBook Pros, but the 13-inch model without the touch screen seems intended to be Apple’s replacement for its Air line of computers, which were not updated today. Design-wise, these laptops are not wildly different than the first high-resolution ones Apple released four years ago—apart from the two with the additional touch screens. They’re thinner and lighter than their predecessors, and early reports suggest that they won’t have illuminating logos on the back like the old ones had. Your future is dongles. So many dongles. pic.twitter.com/a1oanHD9xq — Joanna Stern (@JoannaStern) October 27, 2016 When Apple introduced the new MacBook last year, one of the main criticisms against it was that had far too few ports—other than a headphone jack, it had a solitary USB-C port that doubled as the only way to plug anything into the computer, and the way to power it. Thankfully, Apple’s war against ports seems to have been allayed with the new Pros, which have four USB-C ports, and, unlike the new iPhone 7, a headphone jack. The new low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro goes on sale today, and starts at $1,500. The versions with the touch screen will ship in 2-3 weeks, with the 13-inch starting at $1,800, and the 15-inch model starting at $2,000. With a small touch screen Apple’s biggest announcement for the new MacBook Pros was the Touch Bar, an OLED touchscreen that replaces the top row of function keys on the MacBook keyboard. Instead of having those static keys we know and love, the Touch Bar will show different buttons for different apps. You can also program the bar to show a custom set of commands, including a screenshot shortcut—much like editing a Mac’s Finder buttons. Tap away. (Apple) For any creative types potentially intrigued by yesterday’s Microsoft event, Apple showed off the Touch Bar’s use in editing video, photos, and mixing tunes for DJs. The bar will be supported by Adobe products by the end of the year, a big win for Apple as Adobe’s software collection is a mainstay of photographers, videographers, artists, and designers. The new Touch Bar. (Apple) The Touch Bar also brings Apple’s fingerprint recognition, TouchID, to the Mac. The feature will be built into the power button, located on the right side of the Touch Bar. For those who share their laptops with family members or friends, TouchID will automatically recognize different fingerprints and log in the associated user. Using fingerprints to log in and even make purchases can pose a security threat, so Apple installed a new T1 chip to manage its Secure Enclave. That feature, found on iPhones and iPads, separates encrypted keys used to unlock the device from the rest of the computer, keeping it safe from a myriad of hacks. An external display—not made by Apple The new LG screen. (Apple) Apple hasn’t released its own display in over five years, but Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing, quickly mentioned a new external display that Apple created in partnership with the Korean electronics manufacturer LG. The 27-inch display supports 5K video, has built-in stereo speakers, a camera and microphone, and three USB-C ports that can be used to power a new MacBook or MacBook Pro. The display costs $1,300 and will be available in December. A lot of questions Apple didn’t provide any information on when it might update any of its desktop computers, such as the iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac Mini—some of which haven’t seen refreshes in four years. It also wasn’t entirely clear whether Apple was killing off its most affordable line of laptops—the MacBook Air. So confirmed: the MacBook Air is still around, but not upgraded at all. I'm guessing not around much longer. — David Pierce (@pierce) October 27, 2016 The computers are still available to buy on Apple’s website, but they were not mentioned on stage (other than to compare against the new MacBook Pros, which are thinner and lighter). Apple also didn’t provide any updates on the iPad Pro, the larger tablet with a stylus that it unveiled over a year ago. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Apple’s ‘TV’ (Not Just Apple TV) Wants To Be Your One-Stop Streaming Shop Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple’s ‘TV’ (Not Just Apple TV) Wants To Be Your One-Stop Streaming Shop Image courtesy of Apple October 27, 2016 3:28 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc heard you like tv on your tv ios mac os tv apple apple tv iphone Today at a major press event, Apple announced TV. Not Apple TV, which already exists; nor iTV, which would be in line with their decade-old scheme but is a trademark held by someone else for something else entirely. No, neither of those, which would be less confusing. Just… TV. Don’t let the name confuse you into thinking of the Apple TV, which is a thing — like a Chromecast, Roku, or Amazon Fire device — that you plug into your TV set to access streaming content. TV is, instead, an app for any iOS platform or, indeed, the new approach to Apple TV. Yes: Apple heard you like TV on your TV, so you can run TV on your TV. iPhone owners may already be familiar with the principle; Apple’s used it in the Passbook and Wallet apps for years. The idea is that an Apple app, built into iOS, becomes a one-stop shop where all your [whatever] from all the sources you use can be put together for one-click access. It might be all your airplane and concert tickets, all your store rewards cards, all your credit cards — whatever. Apple does not own every kind of business, but it partners with them to bring their service onto its platform. So in that sense, TV is just another step down that road. “It will completely change how you watch TV with your Apple TV as well as your iPhone and iPad,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook, because that is the sort of thing Apple CEOs say. Basically, it’s a universal search app that draws in content from the services you subscribe to. Or, in Cook’s words again, “a unified TV experience, one place to access all of your TV shows and movies, one place to discover great new content to watch.” It’s got four parts: Watch Now, Library, Store, and Search. And each of them does exactly what it sounds like. Watch Now takes you back to whatever you were watching last, regardless of which service the content is piped through. Library takes you to your library of content you’ve purchased through iTunes. Up Next and Recommended are queue and recommendation features like basically every streaming app has, and store and search are store and search. That said, it’s not totally universal. The content you can get through TV is only as good as the partners that Apple has talked into working with them. It will be able to draw in streaming content you have TV-everywhere-style access to through your cable provider, though, and it will do it through a single-sign-on feature. You give the app your information once, and you shouldn’t have to log in individually to every single cable-based streaming service you have access to afterwards. At least, theoretically: in order for that to work, a pay-TV provider has to be on board. Starting in December, Dish Network and DirecTV (AT&T) customers should be able to make it work. Cable subscribers, like the roughly 50 million who have either Charter or Comcast at home, don’t have an ETA for when they’d be in luck just yet. Also out of luck: fans of the two biggest names in the streaming TV room, Netflix and Amazon. Amazon’s absence is understandable; its line of FireTV devices is in direct competition with the Apple TV (the hardware), and access to Amazon content is a selling point it can use. Netflix, however, is usually everywhere, on basically any device that will have it. It’s even in beta testing now on Comcast’s fancy X1 cable box. Its content has also in the past been accessible through the Apple TV’s search feature. But not now, a spokesperson for the company confirmed to Wired. In the end, then, TV almost seems to be doing exactly what the cable industry didn’t want the FCC to make universal: it’s a suitable cable box alternative for folks who have a whole lot of separate streaming logins to manage. Even if you do still have to switch apps to go from Game of Thrones to Orange Is The New Black.

Like last year's 12-inch MacBook, the new svelte pro laptops have fully adopted the USB-C port. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% TransDigm Group Inc TDG ▼ 252.94 -19.35 -7.11% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% Apple uses it for Thunderbolt 3, but USB-C is the Swiss Army knife of ports. It's capable of a bunch of other functions. Here's what you need to know about USB-C as it starts invading your Macs. It's backwards compatible For years, Macs have had USB ports. We plugged our mouses, our printers and other peripherals into them. That type of USB is called USB-A. USB-C is backwards compatible and will support devices that use USB-A. So that's a plus. The downside is that you'll need an adapter to do so. That's because USB-C is a much smaller port than USB-A. All the ports are both Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C Think of USB-C kind of like a duplex. It has a USB-side and a Thunderbolt 3-side. Thunderbolt 3 allows you to connect your Mac to dual 4K displays at the same time. It also allows for the fast transfer of data between computers and hard drives. One of the neat features of Thunderbolt 3 is the ability to daisy chain external devices and displays using one port. The new Macs have all these Thunderbolt 3 features packaged within the USB-C port. No need to worry about plugging it in upside-down How many times have you gone to plug in a USB cable and forgotten which side is up? Well, you won't have to do the USB flip dance any more. USB-C is reversible and there is no right side up! It's super fast If you don't have Thunderbolt 3 devices, that's okay. USB-C has transfer speeds of up to 5 Gbps. This means if you're using a USB-C equipped external hard rive, that your files will transfer faster. This is especially nice for all those photos and videos you're taking with your new iPhone 7 Plus. It can do a lot USB-C can connect to monitors, charge your Mac, charge your phone from your Mac, transfer data -- all in one physical port. While USB-C is undoubtably the future path for connectivity, there lies an awkward transition ahead. This transition involves adapters and dongles to connect older devices that don't have a USB-C port built-in. Though eventually over time, the convenience, power and versatility of USB-C will be widespread and everyone will be happy. See all of today's Apple news.

The new laptop features an all-metal design, a Touch Bar, and it comes in two sizes, 13-inch and 15-inch. It also comes in two colors, silver and space gray. 2:05 Close Drag Apple on Thursday revealed its newest MacBook Pro laptop, which includes a new interactive, customizable touch strip above the keyboard called Touch Bar. "The Mac is more than a product to us," CEO Tim Cook told the crowd at the Town Hall auditorium at the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters. "It's a testament to everything we do and everything we create at Apple." Instead of including a full-blown touchscreen like most new Windows computers, Apple offered up the Touch Bar. The bar lights up with a menu of buttons, control sliders, dials and tools, which change with the app you're using. Taking the place of function keys, the Touch Bar brings up autofill choices as you type, lets you edit videos in Final Cut Pro or straighten photos in the Photos app. Users can also customize the Touch Bar by dragging and dropping new tools into it. 60 Apple MacBook Pro swaps outdated function keys for Touch Bar The new MacBook Pro is also the first Mac to include Touch ID. That feature was added right into the Touch Bar where the power button has been located. It allows users to log into their devices with their thumbprints (you can also have multiple accounts for shared family computers) and securely pay for items online with Apple Pay. Apple is hoping these new MacBook Pros will reinvigorate its computer sales amid a bruising downturn in the PC market. The company is also facing new competition from Microsoft, which on Wednesday revealed the new Surface Studio all-in-one desktop computer and has bulked up its line of Surface devices. "Apple's laptops no longer enjoy the kind of big hardware advantage they've had in the past," said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research on Thursday. He said the big difference he sees now is the "philosophical approach" between Apple and Microsoft of offering a touchscreen PC or not. There are two sizes of the new MacBook Pro. The 13-inch model of the MacBook Pro is 14.9mm thick, weighs 3 pounds and starts at $1,799. The 15-inch model is 15.5mm thick, weighs 4 pounds and starts at $2,399. That's compared to 18mm for the previous 13- and 15-inch Pros, which were both about a half pound heavier than their replacements. More on Apple's event Apple's amazing strip show reinvents the laptop keyboard Photos from Apple's Hello Again Mac event See all of our Apple event coverage There is also another 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and Touch ID, priced at $1,499. While Apple will continue to produce the 13-inch MacBook Air, it positioned this lower-tier MacBook Pro as a potential replacement. Additionally, the new MacBook Pros include larger trackpads, refined keyboard designs, brighter displays that consume less energy, and redesigned speakers. Overall, the new MacBooks have about 10 hours of battery life, equal to the older 13-inch MacBook Pros and an hour longer than the older 15-inch machines. Ahead of Thursday's event, rumors circulated about a new MacBook Pro with an OLED touch bar above the keyboard. Apple's line of MacBook laptops and iMac desktops has faced double-digit declines in sales for most of the past year. Mac's weakness comes at a bad time for the company, since the iPhone -- Apple's biggest moneymaker -- has also seen three straight quarters of weaker sales and its iPad tablet business is struggling to keep up growth. Apple's last big change to the MacBook line came in March 2015, when the tech giant revealed the new MacBook, a super-slim laptop with a force-sensitive track pad and just two ports, a USB-C port and headphone jack. During that March product event, Apple also updated the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air with faster processors. While these devices failed to re-energize sales, the Mac line remains a very important one for Apple, not just because it was founded as a personal-computer company. Macs continue to generate billions of dollars in sales for Apple, helping the company diversify its revenue and avoid relying too heavily on the iPhone.

Here’s what you missed: New MacBook Pro Apple introduced a pair of new MacBook Pro laptops with what’s called the “Touch Strip.” It’s a touchscreen bar that sits above the keyboard and takes the place of the function keys. The strip offers different functionality depending on the software being used — when you’re using iTunes, for instance, you would see playback controls. The new laptops also have Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner, enabling Apple Pay as well as quick user-swapping on shared computers. Apple’s new MacBook Pro units with the Touch Strip start at $1,799 for the 13-inch version, up to $2,799 for the higher-end 15-inch model. There’s also a new MacBook Pro without the Touch Strip for $1,499. Apple TV Upgrades The Apple TV set-top box is getting a handful of upgrades, including a new app that helps users find video content across a range of services and providers. Notably, Netflix isn’t included on the app, which is called, simply, “TV.” Siri is also getting some new abilities on the Apple TV that will make it better able to handle requests like, “what football games are on right now?” The popular LEGO-like video game Minecraft is coming to the Apple TV by the end of this year, said Apple CEO Tim Cook. No New MacBook Air Apple’s still selling the 13-inch MacBook Air starting at $999, but it didn’t get a significant update today, signaling it may be killed off. (The 11-inch model has disappeared.) That’s a bummer for Apple fans looking for a lower-cost laptop. Apple is also still selling a non-upgraded 12-inch MacBook starting at $1,299. There was no news on the iMac, Mac Pro or Mac Mini fronts. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

But interestingly, they won’t actually be able to connect their brand new iPhone 7 to their brand new MacBook Pro without making an extra purchase. DON’T MISS: The iPhone 7 has an exciting new feature that Apple is keeping secret The MacBook Pro comes with between two and four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means they’re not compatible with the USB cable that ships with the iPhone 7. In other words, you’ll have to buy a USB-C to Lightning Cable from Apple, which retails for $25, to be able to charge your phone with your laptop, move files quickly and easily, or to install iOS updates using the MacBook Pro. Sure, you can always charge the phone from an outlet rather than the MacBook, which is a much better option. But laptops are, you know, portable and outlets aren't always available. And you can use iCloud and iCloud Drive to move photos and other files from the MacBook Pro to the iPhone 7 and back, but iCloud doesn't always work as it should and if you're on the go, that means using up precious mobile data. 2016-macbook-pro-portsMore And what about backups? Backing up the iPhone to a computer will let you encrypt the backup, a feature not available on iCloud backups. Moving photos is also the kind of task that’s best done with a cable, especially if there’s a lot of data to move back and forth. In the grand scheme of things, it’s understandable that Apple wants to simplify the way its products are designed. And wireless is definitely the future. But it’s one thing to remove the aging headphone jack from a phone and quite another to ditch a port that’s still very much in use. Of course, if you own a 12-inch MacBook and an iPhone 7, this is not news to you since you already have the same problem.

The new MacBook Pros feature a completely new design, faster components, and an innovative (and highly leaked) multi-touch screen-cum-controller. 13-inch and 15-inch models are set to be available within three weeks in the US, starting at $1799 and $2399. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID will be priced starting at Rs. 1,55,900 while the 15-inch model will start at Rs. 2,05,900. The most innovative feature is of course the multi-touch control strip which replaces the Fn key row. Apple has named it Touch Bar, and it is fully interactive and context-sensitive. It shows simple system-side commands including a dedicated Siri shortcut, but adapts to different apps and workflows within them. Demonstrations on stage at the event showed dozens of possible uses, including word autocomplete suggestions when typing, email composition and filing tools, Photoshop tool selection and manipulation controls, DJ scratching and mixing, and scrubbing a timeline while editing video. Applications can show content full-screen while controls are moved to the Touch Bar. Multi-touch gestures mean that things such as a waveform or timeline can be manipulated directly. For those who need the traditional Fn keys, they are still available too. For those who need the traditional keys or find the new models too expensive, there is also a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar, starting at $1499 or Rs. 1,29,900 in India. The new MacBook Pro models also feature Touch ID sensors integrated into the power button. Apple detailed a new chassis design which actually makes the 13-inch MacBook Pro smaller and thinner than the 13-inch MacBook Air. A new design for the speakers allows them to push more air, resulting in a claimed 2x improvement in dynamic range and better bass reproduction. The speakers are now placed on either side of the keyboard. Common minimum specifications include 6th-gen Intel Core i5 and i7 CPUs, 8GB or 16GB of RAM, and 256GB SSDs. The 13-inch model's screen has a resolution of 2560x1600, and it uses integrated Intel Iris 540 graphics. The 15-inch model has a native 2880x1800 resolution and features AMD Radeon Pro graphics. The models with Touch Bar feature four USB Type-C ports which support Thunderbolt 3 as well as USB 3.1 Gen 2 speeds, while the one without Touch Bar has only two ports. Apple also detailed a new Thunderbolt 3 5K monitor developed in partnership with LG, which will work as a dock to charge a MacBook Pro while also featuring breakout ports for other devices, plus a webcam, speakers and mic array. Apple has begun shipping the model without the Touch Bar immediately in the US, while the Touch Bar models are listed as shipping in 2-3 weeks. Availability in India is unknown, as all models are listed as "coming soon". Disclosure: Gadgets 360's travel and hotel for the event in Cupertino were sponsored by Apple.

While there was no mention of a MacBook Air update, Apple is still making the 13-inch MacBook Air available to purchase, which was last updated in 2015. The 11-inch, however, has been discontinued and can no longer be purchased from Apple. The 13-inch MacBook Air continues to start at $999 for the 1.6GHz/8GB/128GB configuration, which is probably why Apple is keeping it in the line. The MacBook Air’s entry price is $500 cheaper than the newly announced MacBook Pro by $500, and $300 cheaper than the entry level 12-inch MacBook.

Whether it’s almost-mythical stories about Steve Jobs picking fonts, or Apple’s demand for hardware free of unsightly seams, it’s often these little things that add up to make its customers feel like they’re in good, trustworthy hands. But with its latest MacBooks, Apple is starting to do away with one of those special touches: MagSafe — the magnetic charging connector that MacBooks have been using for a decade. MagSafe was one of those tiny but brilliant innovations that made you question how no one else had thought of it yet. Rather than having a power cable get locked into a laptop — leading to the possibility of someone tripping over the cable and yanking the computer onto the floor — Apple’s MagSafe cables attached magnetically; strong enough to hold on, but weak enough that they’d rip off instead of taking a computer with them. With the switch over to USB-C for charging, MagSafe is almost nowhere in sight. While it’s still present on the MacBook Air, it’s absent from both the MacBook and the new MacBook Pro. And it doesn’t seem likely that we’ll see it on any Apple laptops going forward. USB-C just isn’t meant for that kind of use. To underscore just how much people love MagSafe, just look around at all of the products copying it. Microsoft’s Surface line uses a magnetic charger, and there’s a whole ecosystem of accessories built around the concept of "but what if we did it with magnets?" There’s MagSafe for headphone jacks, MagSafe for iPhone docks — there’s even a MagSafe for USB-C cords (though it’s probably not elegant enough for Apple’s tastes). In exchange for MagSafe, MacBook Pro owners get the ability to charge their computer through any of the laptop’s four USB-C ports. There’s no arguing that that’s a kind of convenience. But losing the elegance of MagSafe makes this feel like one step forward, one step back. The first time I rip this new MacBook Pro off a table, I have no doubt I’ll wish MagSafe were still around.

It was a little more than two years ago that the company entered a groundbreaking partnership with Apple to enhance the mobile enterprise space. IBM executives, speaking at the company's World of Watson conference in Las Vegas, positioned the move as part of an overall rollout of enhancements to IBM Watson technology, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to support human interactions with intelligent bots at a scale rarely seen. "All of this means at its core we're working on Watson to make sure it can read at scale, reason with a purpose, learn with each outcome and interact with us naturally," IBM Watson General Manager David Kenny told attendees at the conference. On the Ground and in the Air The company has optimized several new technologies to work with the iOS 10 speech framework -- including IBM Natural Language Processing, Watson Conversation and other Watson APIs -- enabling millions of workers who use the MobileFirst technology to control apps with simple voice interactions. The improvements are meant to help companies gain more insight into customer behavior and interactions in the field. The extended relationship with Apple is the most interesting thing that IBM announced at the conference, according to Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "Given Watson's many powerful, often unique capabilities, the move will help MobileFirst apps stand out from the pack, and should entice developers focused on workplace and enterprise apps," he told the E-Commerce Times. "It also reflects another interesting point: that IBM is better at explicating and reinforcing the business value of Apple products than Apple is itself." One of the new apps that workers can use in the field is Find & Fix, which lets field technicians use an Apple iPhone or Apple Watch to select jobs based on proximity and priority. That's presumably more efficient than going by a preselected schedule to determine how they move from location to location without information on how complex each assignment will be. Workers also can use the app to get turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic and parking information. In addition, workers can use the Apple camera built into the phone to scan bar codes and communicate with off-site specialists via FaceTime. The relationship with IBM is going to be very important for Apple's enterprise business, observed telecom analyst Jeff Kagan. "Watson will help Apple modernize in advance," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Artificial intelligence is going to transform every industry, including wireless and devices, and that means Apple iOS." Other uses of Watson technology with MobileFirst include the opt-in Passenger + app, which lets flight attendants get deeper insights into passenger interests while they are in flight, IBM said. Retail salespeople can use the technology to gain insights into customer purchasing preferences, while financial advisors can use it to help make investment decisions. A Bank's Experience Since launching the Apple partnership two years ago, IBM and Apple have worked hard to expand the use of IBM technology to the mobile worker, and to get Apple devices into their hands. "A lot of us thought the real power of this relationship would result from IBM putting Watson behind Siri," noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "This isn't that, but it is showcasing the power of Watson on the iPhone, and that is certainly a big step in a similar direction," he told the E-Commerce Times. The companies earlier this year announced an agreement with Alior Bank, based in Poland, to use three MobileFirst apps -- for scheduling, sales and signing up new clients -- along with 1,300 Apple iPhones, iPads and MacBooks deployed to the bank's workforce. "We have been impressed by the incredibly fast and effective way Apple and IBM have teamed with Alior to design and build the apps, which boost the productivity of our private banking advisors," said Tomasz Motyl, chief innovation officer at Alior Bank. "They understood our business and easily turned ideas into working solutions -- making the decision to expand our collaboration an easy one," he told the E-Commerce Times. Our private banking advisors got a modern tool that enables secure insight into the customer portfolio in the way that is the most convenient for the customer -- accessible from anywhere on iPads. Using those apps, advisors provide customers with unique private banking advisory services and more varied offers, tailored to the individual preferences and financial plans of our customers," Motyl explained. "MobileFirst for iOS apps give to our employees and customers the service they desire, immediately and in context, simultaneously optimizing banking processes and making them more cost effective," he added.

The shortcuts change depending on what software application is being used, and are also customizable. The Touch Bar also features a Touch ID sensor for logging into the machine and authorizing Apple Pay payments.

 This is Apple's replacement for the MacBook Air Antonio Villas-Boas Oct. 27, 2016, 3:04 PM 31,678 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple on Thursday announced a new 13-inch MacBook Pro that's meant to replace the slim and portable MacBook Air. Though Apple is apparently killing the 11-inch Air, it will keep the 13-inch Air and double the RAM of those computers, from 4 GB to 8 GB. It is not updating the Air with other upgraded specs or features, though. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro said to replace the MacBook Air is "basic" compared with the other new MacBook Pros Apple announced. It's basic in the sense that it doesn't have the fancy new Touch Bar utility display bar above the keyboard, or the new Touch ID sensor that lets you unlock your computer and buy stuff online. It also has two Thunderbolt 3.0 USB-C ports compared with the four Thunderbolt 3.0 ports on the other new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros. The "basic" MacBook Pro doesn't have the Touch Bar above the number keys. Apple It also has less powerful specs than the other new MacBook Pros. At the same time, it's more powerful than the MacBook Air that Apple is offering. Despite being called a MacBook Pro, the new one is 12% thinner than the current MacBook Air at its thickest point. Apple It's also generally smaller: Apple The basic 13-inch MacBook Pro also has a higher price tag at $1,499 compared with the $999 MacBook Air. It's available to buy right now and will begin shipping on Thursday.

Three options for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and two for the 15-inch variant. (Image: Apple) At its October 27 'Hello Again' event, Apple has finally refreshed its MacBook Pro lineup. The thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro is here in 13-inch and 15-ich options. Not just that. The new MacBook Pro comes with an unique OLED Touch Bar which replaces the traditional function keys. The Touch Bar aims to bring the convenience of having a touch-based interface minus the huge touchscreen. There are five models of the MacBook Pro. Three options for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and two for the 15-inch variant. The cheapest MacBook Pro (13-inch) costs $1,499 and doesn't come with the Touch Bar with integrated Touch ID. To get the new Touch Bar, consumers will have to shed a minimum $1,799 . Also read: TV App for Apple TV Launched: What is it and What Can it do? "The Touch Bar places controls right at the user’s fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar, Numbers, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more," explained Apple in a release. Featuring an all-metal unibody body, the 13-inch variants are 17 percent thinner and 23 percent less volume than the previous generation, and weighs 1.3 kgs. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighs 1.8 kgs. The Touch ID is also integrated into the power button. Once you enroll your fingerprint in Touch ID on your MacBook Pro, you can quickly unlock your Mac, switch user accounts and make secure purchases with Apple Pay on the web with a single touch. The Retina display on the new MacBook Pro at 500 nits of brightness, is 67 percent brighter than the previous generation. Hardware options include sixth-generation dual-core Core i5 with eDRAM, dual-core Core i7 with eDRAM and quad-core Core i7 Intel processors. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro features powerful Radeon Pro discrete graphics delivering up to 2.3 times more performance than the previous generation. The 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics. All models feature SSDs with sequential read speeds over 3GBps and Thunderbolt 3, which consolidates data transfer, charging and twice the video bandwidth in a single port — allowing users to drive a 5K display and power their MacBook Pro with a single cable. How much does it cost? 13-Inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar starts at $1,499, features a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. 13-Inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at $1,799 offers 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. Apple just added a mini touch display on the keyboards of its new laptops — here's what it can do Jeff Dunn Oct. 27, 2016, 3:22 PM 144,259 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple has taken the wraps off its new MacBook Pro and ditched the row of physical function keys that's been on every personal computer for decades. In its place, there's the "Touch Bar," a thin touch display that provides different settings and shortcuts based on what you're doing. It'll be available in one of the two models of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which starts at $1,799, as well as the 15-inch version, which starts at $2,399. Both will ship in the next two to three weeks. It also looks pretty wild! So to give you a sense of how it works, here's a quick look at some of the things it can do: View As: One Page Slides The Touch Bar is an OLED, multitouch, high-def strip that adjusts dynamically, depending on what app you're using. If you're browsing the web, for instance, it can preview your open tabs. If you're checking Calendar, it can give you shortcuts for each day or week. It can still work like a usual set of function keys, too — so no, the escape key isn't gone completely. On a system level, you can use it to quickly adjust your volume and screen brightness. While you're web browsing (with Safari at least) you can quickly scroll through your saved favorite sites, then open them with a tap. You can also swipe through and preview whichever tabs you have open. It can also suggest words while you're typing, much like the on-screen keyboard on the iPhone and iPad. If your word corresponds to an emoji, one of those will pop up, too. In the Mail app, you can quick-select certain contacts, then add them to a message. You can also access typical commands for creating a new message, replying, trashing, and the like. You can scroll through emojis and slap them in an iMessage or Mail message. You could fast-forward and rewind videos without showing those controls on-screen. If you're editing photos, you can scroll through filters, rotate the photo, do some cropping, and so on. You can also quickly move through your camera roll. Or you could take a call. If you're editing a video in Final Cut Pro, you can zoom through frames. In a music-making app like Djay, you can do a little mixing and toy with a track. The settings you see aren't necessarily static. You can add other options and shortcuts in as well, at least on the system level. Next to the Touch Bar is a Touch ID fingerprint scanner, much like what you'd see on the iPhone. That means you can make payments on certain web sites, or quickly switch between user accounts. There's plenty more beyond that. For now, Apple's own apps will probably use the Touch Bar best, and there's no Web app support, but its functionality should only expand as more programs lend their support. We'll let you know in the coming days how well it works outside of a controlled demo environment.
