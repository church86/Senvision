But margins are nothing if you don’t sell enough products to actually accumulate hefty financial gains, and with the exception of the just-ended year, the Cupertino-based tech giant has managed to steadily increase its shipment numbers in addition to the bottom line. 2017 should not only mark a return of that all-winning Apple trend, according to Gartner’s latest industry projections, but “for the first time this century”, push iOS and macOS devices ahead of Microsoft’s Windows-powered products in global sales. If these predictions are correct, Apple will rack up 268 million unit shipments this year, up from 248 in 2016, and 252 for Windows, which will apparently sink yet again, from an already modest 260 million total. The gap between the new silver medalist and the bronze underachiever may grow to 24, then 28 million units in 2018 and 2019 respectively, as the combined iOS + macOS tally should continue to jump at a decent pace, while Microsoft is expected to stop the Windows bleeding, but settle for stagnation. Of course, Android will comfortably remain in the lead, although its own growth has considerably slowed down of late, with no apparent hopes of a short-term acceleration.

After all, if Apple only launches one smartwatch every year, how can Fossil and its brands expect to launch 100? The only problem with that logic, is that it’s a tech geek’s logic. Tech geeks are conditioned to expect a bevy of new features with every single product launch. The concept of design being a noteworthy feature that merits its own launch event is entirely foreign. But that’s just it — Fossil is a fashion company, not a tech company. Fossil thinks about design first and last with every wearable it makes. That’s why it releases new analog smart watches and Android Wear smartwatches every season. Fossil makes decisions based on color trends, materials, different dial designs, and other fashionable features. So what if the tech hasn’t changed between seasons? The styles and fashions have. More: Fossil could be the only company that really gets wearables right in 2017 While tech companies like Apple, Samsung, LG, and others think about wearables as one-size-fits-all devices; Fossil is innovating in the space and making wearables that are truly wearable. After all, wearables go on your body; you wear them publicly, so shouldn’t you be proud of the watch you’re rocking? Fossil thinks so, and that’s why its smartwatches are more likely to attract women, serious watch collectors, and anyone who cares about fashion. Different strokes for different folks Fashion is all about self-expression. It’s about what you want to project to the world. Everyone has a distinct sense of style that’s entirely original, and wearables have to reflect that. Not every man likes shiny watch casings; not every woman likes big statement watches, and it’s time tech companies saw the light. So far, Apple and Motorola have come closest in the tech world with their different strap options, casing colors, and personalization options; but neither one holds a candle to Fossil. fossil fashion first smartwatches are doing what tech companies never could ces atMore Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends fossil fashion first smartwatches are doing what tech companies never could ces atMore Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends fossil fashion first smartwatches are doing what tech companies never could ces atMore Read More Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends fossil fashion first smartwatches are doing what tech companies never could ces atMore Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends Fossil offers hundreds of watch straps, all of which work with its smart analog and Android Wear smartwatches. The breadth of customization based on straps alone is huge. Then you have the dozens of smart analog watches Fossil has released in a number of colors and styles, all of which have different watch dial designs. Fossil has something for everyone: women who like big watches, women who like slim watches, men who like chunky flashy watches, men who like subtle darker watches, and so on and so on. The array of colors is also a big deal. Fossil has rose gold, gold, silver, matte, shiny, dark blue, black, and other casings for the watch itself. More: Fossil launches 3 hybrid smartwatches that work with your Android phone If you don’t like Fossil’s design aesthetic, you can always get more smartwatches from its other brands, including Kate Spade, Skagen, Armani, and many more. Your choices are many and varied, because you’re buying a piece of jewelry. Tech geeks think about smartwatches in terms of utility, but there’s so much more to it than that. After all, you wouldn’t expect H&M to produce only one shirt in one color, would you? Watches are no different. The more colors and styles you have in store, the more likely you are to draw new customers. Size matters It’s not just color. While Fossil and other fashion brands are making gorgeous smartwatches for women almost more so than for men, tech companies seem to forget that half of the world’s population exists. Initially, tech companies only made “unisex” smartwatches that skewed male and were often uncomfortable to wear on small wrists. Then, after Apple started targeting women with fashionable straps and a smaller watch size, all the other tech companies began to make rose gold or sparkly (and sometimes both) smartwatches for women, which weren’t any smaller or more comfortable for smaller wrists. Fashion first Tech companies still don’t get it: Wearables are fashion. It’s time they look to fashion brands to learn how business is done in an industry that cares more about seasons than pixels. In spring, you may want to jazz things up with a bright, light, colorful design; but in winter, you may want something warmer and deeper in color. Spotting fashion trends is key if tech companies want to grab the attention of non-techy people who might not otherwise consider a smartwatch. Fossil and its brands are leading the charge, and they’ll reap the benefits. Fossil is just getting started. The watchmaker told us that the smart analog watches it sells are doing really well with traditional watch fans. Getting watch aficionados interested in Android Wear smartwatches may take more time, but Fossil is taking the long view. It takes time to change mores in the fashion industry, and even longer for watchmakers, which have honed their hallowed tradition for centuries. It’s hard to force innovation on these companies, but that makes it all the more exciting to see high-tech features infiltrating their portfolios. And there’s more to come. We expect to see many more smart analog watches and fashionable Android Wear devices at the watch industry trade show Baselworld in March. Fossil’s big bet on techie watches is just the beginning of a revolution in the watch industry.

Photo: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Move over, App Store: Startup looks for new way to distribute apps 1 / 3 Back to Gallery When iPhone users want to download apps, they mostly go to a single place: Apple’s App Store. The store is the gatekeeper for apps, ensuring they meet Apple’s standards for quality and ethics. But over the years, it’s been challenging for apps to get noticed among the millions in the store, and some people find it too cumbersome to spend minutes searching for and downloading new ones, only to delete them later due to lack of space on their phones. Venture capitalist Ernestine Fu aims to solve that problem. Her firm, Blackstorm Labs Inc. of Mountain View, sells technology that allows developers to distribute their apps without going through the App Store. Instead, the apps are available through links that consumers can send to their friends. “The time is right for the App Store to be disrupted,” said Fu, Blackstorm’s co-founder. Blackstorm Labs, which launched last year, has raised $33.5 million in funding. It is looking for alternative ways to distribute apps not just from the App store, but also from the Android equivalent, the Google Play store. The numbers are huge. Consumers spent $3 billion in December at the App Store, and Apple takes in as much as 30 percent in app sales for those that are distributed through its App Store. The App Store generated nearly double the amount of worldwide revenue compared with the Google Play Store in 2015, according to a report by App Annie, an app analytics firm. Photo: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Blackstone employees raise their hands to agree to do a "Secret Santa" during a meeting at the Blackstorm headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., on Wednesday, December 14, 2016. Mountain View-based Blackstorm creates software that it licenses to companies so that the firms can embed their apps within other popular apps like Facebook, without having consumers download an additional separate app though a cumbersome process through the Apple App or Google Play stores. Blackstone employees raise their hands to agree to do a "Secret... Blackstorm wants to get a cut of those sales, plus provide an avenue where developers can reach consumers faster because they don’t have to download an app. It plans to make money through its technology by either charging a licensing fee or a percentage of an app’s revenue. Apple and Google did not return requests for comment. Blackstorm in November released a game called EverWing on Facebook’s Messenger app, letting users challenge their friends by sending them an invitation. Users click on the invite within Messenger to play and don’t need to download the game through the App Store. EverWing was one of a handful of games allowed on Facebook’s platform and was noted by the company as being one of the best instant games in 2016. Blackstorm has a studio where it can create its own games, including EverWing. Amitt Mahajan, a managing partner at Presence Capital, said he believes this type of technology “has a lot of promise,” especially when it comes to games. It makes sense for people to release games in the places where they are talking about them, such as a chat message. “That’s more akin to the real world,” Mahajan said, adding that it’s natural to start playing a board game at someone’s house, as opposed to downloading a whole different app to start playing a game. Other companies are also preparing for a future beyond a store for apps. Chinese firm Tencent told media outlets this week that its popular messaging app WeChat has a new feature that allows people to search for programs and add them within WeChat without going through the App Store. Google last year discussed Android Instant Apps at its developer conference; these would allow consumers to click on links and pull the minimal amount of information they need from an app without having to download the whole thing. “The app should be available instantly,” as quickly accessible as a Web page, said Raheel Hasan, CEO of 1App, a Menlo Park startup that plans to distribute apps through links. 1App charges developers a fee for using its service that lets them distribute apps outside of the App or Google Play stores. Users click on a link that allows them to stream apps instead of downloading them. Hasan declined to say how much the cost to developers was, but said it is a percentage based on app purchases or use and is generally less than what Apple and Google charges developers. More by Wendy Lee Passwords on shared devices can be snooping spouses’ best ally Plenty of users sticking with Yahoo despite data breaches Amid Yahoo hacks, a churn of security officers Silicon Valley courts cord cutters But some analysts caution that these new distribution efforts by apps raise other questions, such as how strict the startups will be when it comes to security. When apps go through an approval process through Google or Apple, the companies make sure the apps meet their quality standards and policies. “I would be concerned about viruses, malware and adult content,” said Jordan Edelson, CEO at Appetizer Mobile, which develops mobile apps. Both 1App and Blackstorm say they take security very seriously. Hasan said 1App would approve apps that haven’t yet been sold at the Google Play or App stores by reputable developers. In a way, 1App could be a way for a developer to test an app in the market without having to go through a lengthy approval process. “You have to change how people get to apps,” Hasan said.

The firm argues that the issue encountered in the tests could only be found in a 'hidden' developer setting – which everyday consumers would likely never even run into. The initial test results caused the laptops to lose Consumer Reports' recommendation for the first time, but if the fix does in fact lead to 'consistently high' battery life scores, the MacBook Pros will be back in their good graces. Scroll down for video  Apple has fixed an 'obscure' bug in its new MacBook Pro laptops, prompting Consumer Reports to run new tests just weeks after publishing a report that slammed their inconsistent battery life WHAT APPLE SAYS CAUSED THE ISSUE  In response to Consumer Reports' recent evaluation, Apple investigated the results and found that a software bug triggered by a 'hidden Safari setting' was to blame. The developer setting turns off the browser cache.  And, they say consumers would never run into this same problem.  'This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage,' told Dailymail.com. 'Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab.' Consumer Reports is now running new tests after downloading the fix.   In the report published at the end of December, the Consumer Reports labs tested three new MacBook Pros, which launched this fall: a 13-inch model with Apple's new Touch Bar, a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model. The lab found inconsistent results across the trials, with battery life as long as 19.5 hours and as short as 3.75. After the Consumer Reports team shared the results with Apple, the firm has now fixed the bug through its Beta Software Program. And according to Apple, the issue stems from the test conditions themselves. 'We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results,' an Apple spokesperson told Dailymail.com 'We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. 'This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage.  'Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab.

Share this article Share In the report published at the end of December, the Consumer Reports labs tested three new MacBook Pros, which launched this fall: a 13-inch model with Apple's new Touch Bar, a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model 'After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.  'We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. 'This is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro.' Anyone who signs up for Apple's Beta Software program can access the fix on their website. But, it will also be rolled out in a few weeks as a part of a broader Software Update for all MacBook Pro users. The laptops scored well in other measures of display and performance, and Consumer Reports says the MacBook Pros will earn the Recommended rating if the new tests show the battery life has really improved. WHAT CONSUMER REPORTS' LABS FOUND IN THE INITIAL TESTS  On December 22, Consumer Reports published their findings from lab tests on three new MacBook Pros, which launched this fall: a 13-inch model with Apple's new Touch Bar, a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model. They found that the new line failed to meet battery life standards, and for the first time, Apple's MacBooks did not receive the recommended ratings. 'The MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next,' according to Consumer Reports. 'For instance, in a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. 'The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. 'And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours.' The laptops were subjected to repeated tests, Consumer Reports explains, and these are just a handful of the results.  In their tests, Consumer Reports researchers download a series of 10 web pages repeatedly, from the time the battery is fully charged, until it shuts down. These pages are stored on their lab's server, and transmitted across a WiFi network, and all tests are done in the computer's native browser (in this case, Safari). Certain default features which aim to extend battery life are turned off for the tests, such as screen auto-dimming and local caching of web pages. Apple says it's this last move that caused the problem, triggering a bug in the Safari browser. Once they turned caching back on, Consumer Reports found that the three MacBooks then had consistently high battery life results. The Consumer Reports labs are now rerunning the tests with the new fix, and are expected to release their findings later this week.     Read more: www.consumerrepo...

MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

"Mr. C," who was born female, was working at a health centre in Guiyang last year when he was fired. The court said he had been illegally dismissed, but said there was not enough evidence to rule he had been fired due to discrimination against transgender people. The plaintiff told AFP news agency that he was "quite happy" with the outcome. In India, a Delhi man was reportedly drugged, kidnapped and brutally rapedbut couldn't report the crimes because of the country's statutes, according to MensXP.com . Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code defines rape as "sexual intercourse with a woman against her will," and doesn't include men. Also, Section 377 criminalizes homosexuality, deeming even consensual sex between men unnatural. Apple CEO Tim Cook declined an invitation to appear at the Oireachtas finance committee to discuss the EU's ruling that the company owes Ireland more than13 billion euros in back taxes, Irish Times noted. In a reply received by the committee, Apple executive Claire Thwaites wrote on Cook's behalf to say that he had been advised not to appear. Sinn Fein finance spokesman Pearse Doherty expressed disappointment and anger at the decision by Apple. The Taiwanese government proposed a ban so-called "gay conversion" therapythe practice of attempting to make an LGBTI person straight, QNews.com .au reported. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has published a draft regulation that would list the harmful "conversion" therapy as a prohibited treatment. The ban could come into effect as early as March, after a 60-day public consultation on the draft. In Israel, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit told the High Court that he will reduce the naturalization requirements for the partners of gay Israelis to match that of straight spouses, The Times of Israel noted. The opposite-sex partners of Israelis undergo a four-year process to gain citizenship, while gay people currently have a seven-year path to naturalization. Yahoo7 News reported that a New Zealand man was thrown from a bridge and left for dead in a "gay hate crime" after rejecting the advances of a married straight man on New Year's Eve, the victim's husband claimed. Maioha Tokotaua, 33, found his husband's "mangled" body lying unconscious under a train bridge in the Queensland town of Gladstone. Joth Wilson, 25, was found with broken bones, burns, a brain hemorrhage and a severed spinal cord, and is unlikely to walk again; he remained on life support. Tokotaua initially thought it was a suicide attempt until he noticed his husband's wallet and hat were missing. The owner of LGBT nightclubs Heaven and G-A-Y has apologized after suggesting that people from Somalia are responsible for rising crime in London, PinkNews reported. Club owner Jeremy Joseph made the comments on a Facebook post after a string of attacks in the capital. In apologizing, Joseph said, "The fact that some of these gangs are Somali is irrelevant and I should never have highlighted that fact, even in the heat of the moment which it was." Speaking of London bars, Kazbar, which opened doors in 1995, has been forced to close because of rent increases, PinkNews noted. The bar's rent was due to be hiked up from 86,000 to 150,000 British pounds. Last summer, the infamous Royal Vauxhall Tavern was threatened with closure by developers who planned to knock the landmark down and build a strip club chain in its place. Former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, appearing on the Family Research Council's Washington Watch radio program, denounced the State Department for forcing foreign-government ministers to march in gay-pride parades, LGBTQ Nation reported. In part, she said, "The U.S. government is telling another government, 'You have to have gay pride parades?' That's unbelievable! 'You won't get your PEPFAR money, you won't get your USAID money, unless you follow our radical social agenda?'" PEPFAR is a US-initiative that gives money to combat HIV/AIDS around the world; USAID funds are used for poverty and disaster relief. The new mayor of Rio de Janiero, Marcelo Crivella, has unleashed some interesting theories, LGBTQ Nation noted. Crivella, of Brazil's Republican Party, has said Catholics "preach demonic doctrines," and that Hinduism and African religions shelter "unclean spirits." He has also said that failed abortions result in gay babies, according to NewNowNext. Brazil is currently facing an epidemic of violent crime against LGBTQ people, with a member of the community killed almost every day in the country, according to Grupo Gay da Bahia. A Saudi television channel apologized after a reality show in the strict Islamic kingdom featured a scene that critics denounced as "pornographic," Middle East Eye noted. Online users posted a purported clip from the Bedaya TV program that appeared to show men dancing. One stood closely behind another, held the man's hips, and appeared to mimic a sexual act. Bedaya apologized on Twitter, saying mistakes can happen during live broadcasting. In India, censor board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has let Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh's butt-naked shot in the movie Befikre stay, but has deleted kissing scenes featuring gay and lesbian couples in the film, Mid-Day.com reported. The kissing scenes in question are from the Befikre song "Labon Ka Karobaar," a track that celebrates diversity. The official video of the song, which was released online, shows at least two gay couples kissing. NBC News has chosen six LGBTQ events worth traveling for this year. They include the Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival ( Feb. 17-March 5 ), WorldPride Madrid ( June 23-July 2 ), World OutGames ( in Miami on May 26-June 4 ), Queer British Art ( Apri 5-Oct. 1 ), Outfest ( in Los Angeles July 6-16 ) and the Milkshake Festival ( in Amsterdam July 29-30 ). COMPILED BY ANDREW DAVIS A transgender man won his case for unfair dismissal at a court in China, BBC News reported. "Mr. C," who was born female, was working at a health centre in Guiyang last year when he was fired. The court said he had been illegally dismissed, but said there was not enough evidence to rule he had been fired due to discrimination against transgender people. The plaintiff told AFP news agency that he was "quite happy" with the outcome. In India, a Delhi man was reportedly drugged, kidnapped and brutally rapedbut couldn't report the crimes because of the country's statutes, according to MensXP.com . Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code defines rape as "sexual intercourse with a woman against her will," and doesn't include men. Also, Section 377 criminalizes homosexuality, deeming even consensual sex between men unnatural. Apple CEO Tim Cook declined an invitation to appear at the Oireachtas finance committee to discuss the EU's ruling that the company owes Ireland more than13 billion euros in back taxes, Irish Times noted. In a reply received by the committee, Apple executive Claire Thwaites wrote on Cook's behalf to say that he had been advised not to appear. Sinn Fein finance spokesman Pearse Doherty expressed disappointment and anger at the decision by Apple. The Taiwanese government proposed a ban so-called "gay conversion" therapythe practice of attempting to make an LGBTI person straight, QNews.com .au reported. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has published a draft regulation that would list the harmful "conversion" therapy as a prohibited treatment. The ban could come into effect as early as March, after a 60-day public consultation on the draft. In Israel, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit told the High Court that he will reduce the naturalization requirements for the partners of gay Israelis to match that of straight spouses, The Times of Israel noted. The opposite-sex partners of Israelis undergo a four-year process to gain citizenship, while gay people currently have a seven-year path to naturalization. Yahoo7 News reported that a New Zealand man was thrown from a bridge and left for dead in a "gay hate crime" after rejecting the advances of a married straight man on New Year's Eve, the victim's husband claimed. Maioha Tokotaua, 33, found his husband's "mangled" body lying unconscious under a train bridge in the Queensland town of Gladstone. Joth Wilson, 25, was found with broken bones, burns, a brain hemorrhage and a severed spinal cord, and is unlikely to walk again; he remained on life support. Tokotaua initially thought it was a suicide attempt until he noticed his husband's wallet and hat were missing. The owner of LGBT nightclubs Heaven and G-A-Y has apologized after suggesting that people from Somalia are responsible for rising crime in London, PinkNews reported. Club owner Jeremy Joseph made the comments on a Facebook post after a string of attacks in the capital. In apologizing, Joseph said, "The fact that some of these gangs are Somali is irrelevant and I should never have highlighted that fact, even in the heat of the moment which it was." Speaking of London bars, Kazbar, which opened doors in 1995, has been forced to close because of rent increases, PinkNews noted. The bar's rent was due to be hiked up from 86,000 to 150,000 British pounds. Last summer, the infamous Royal Vauxhall Tavern was threatened with closure by developers who planned to knock the landmark down and build a strip club chain in its place. Former U.S. Rep.

By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 10, 2017 at 4:41 pm | UPDATED: January 10, 2017 at 4:56 pm CUPERTINO — Apple plans to expand manufacturing at a facility in an Arizona foreign-trade zone, making more servers there to supply its data centers in the Bay Area and across the United States, it said in a new regulatory filing. The expansion plan in the foreign-trade zone in Mesa, Arizona could reduce its production costs for the servers. Foreign-trade zones provide relief from, or reductions for, tariffs and taxes that a company normally would pay to import items or components manufactured in other countries. “Production under foreign-trade zone procedures could exempt Apple from customs duty payments,” on a variety of materials and components that would be used in the server assembly, Apple said in its federal register filing. Apple intends to broaden its operations for final assembly of servers at the command center in Mesa. The tech firm has been assembling the servers at each of its four data centers, which are located in the East Bay city of Newark; Prineville, Oregon; Maiden, North Carolina; and Reno, Nevada. Apple uses these data centers to ensure that numerous Apple products and services operate properly, including iCloud, Apple Music, Siri and other well-known consumer services, the company said Tuesday. Apple isn’t planning the expansion in order to placate President-elect Donald Trump, who has pressured U.S companies, including Apple, to manufacture more products in the United States. “This is a logistical issue for Apple,” said Tim Bajarin, principal analyst with Campbell-based Creative Strategies, which tracks the tech sector. “It’s more efficient for Apple to make these in a single location rather than have that activity spread out all over the other data centers.” The company’s new filing is an application to renew its ability to operate in Arizona’s foreign-trade zone. Apple initially obtained that permission when it took ownership of the manufacturing complex from former supplier GT Advanced Technologies. Apple said the Arizona complex would serve as a Global Data Command Center for its four data facilities. It’s also possible the facility might have a secondary function as a data center at some point. The new filing filled in some details, saying the Mesa manufacturing site will handle numerous materials and components. It said the dozens of items that could qualify for duty-free, or low duty fees, include: electric motors, printed circuit board assemblies, magnets, lithium batteries, routers and network switches, microphones, CDs, software, solid state drives, semiconductor media, monitors, electronic circuits, server rack rails, along with tape and plastic bags. “Apple Inc. has re-purposed the site as a global data command center that will conduct high-tech manufacturing of finished data center cabinets for other data centers,” the city of Mesa stated in a document it filed in June. The jobs at the center, which the company said would be in “the tens,” are likely to be high-skilled positions. A notification issued by the city of Mesa said, “The proposed high-tech manufacturing is an expansion of Apple’s operations in the U.S. that will utilize personnel with extensive education and allow Apple to offer best-in-class data support.” Tags:  Apple Apple Music Technology George Avalos George Avalos is a business reporter for the Bay Area News Group.

(AFP Photo) Samsung may capitalise on the yet to be tapped smartwatch market in the country with the launch of its latest wearable iteration- Samsung Gear S3 - priced at Rs 28,900. “All smartwatch-makers such as Moto, Huawei and Asus have been struggling to get the product right. While some had issues with design, price and use-cases, all of them suffered from battery issues. The Gear S3 has got all of this right. With a battery of nearly 3 days, more use cases such as able to type on screen just like scribble on the Apple Watch and a cheaper price (Apple Watch 2 has a starting price of Rs 32,900), it might just be able to woo consumers,” Vishal Tripathi, research director at Gartner told HT. “The abandonment rate is quite high, relative to the usage rate. Wearables makers need to engage users with incentives and gamification.” “Nowadays, most expensive watches come at this price point and if Samsung can market it the right way, then consumers will choose a smartwatch over a regular watch,” Shobhit Srivastava, research analyst for Mobile Devices and ecosystem, told HT. He also said that the battle will mostly be with Apple, which seems to be the only other serious contender in the category followed by Moto. “Samsung also has an advantage now over the Apple Watch as it works on both iOS and Android devices,” Srivastava said, adding, that Samsung on Monday at Consumer Electronics Show had announced that its older Gear Fit 2, Gear S2 and the S3 will now work on iOS devices. Srivastava said Apple swatches only work with Apple iPhones and Apple will need a solid iPhone user-base in India to go toe-to-toe with Samsung. Read| Samsung launches Tizen-based Gear S3 at Rs 28,500, works on iPhones too Both Tripathi and Srivastava said that other Android watches lacked use cases and were slower with the new Android Wear Marshmallow update. “Smart watches market is yet to mature in India and thus we have seen lesser number of good devices. Samsung Gear S3 might be one of them,” Tripathi said. A recent report from Gartner also points to a similar trend. The abandonment rate of smartwatches is 29%, and 30% for fitness trackers, because people do not find them useful, said a report by research and advisory firm Gartner. This was a serious problem, said Angela McIntyre, research director at Gartner. “The abandonment rate is quite high, relative to the usage rate. To offer a compelling enough value proposition, the uses for wearable devices need to be distinct from what smartphones typically provide. Wearables makers need to engage users with incentives and gamification.” The report further said the adoption of smartwatch (10%) and fitness trackers was 19% and was still in the early stages. Also, only 8% of consumers have used VR glasses/head-mounted displays (excluding cardboard types). It also claims that people typically purchase smartwatches and fitness trackers for personal use, with 34% of fitness trackers and 26% of smartwatches given as gifts. “Continued growth in the adoption of smartwatches and fitness trackers will now be from mainstream consumers instead of early technology adopters,” said McIntyre. “The greatest hurdle for fitness tracker and smartwatch providers is the consumer perception that the devices do not offer a compelling enough value proposition.” While the US is the leading smartwatch market with 12% adoption, according to the report, UK and Australia are trailing behind with 9% and 7% adoption. “The key to creating a value proposition to interest mainstream consumers is lifestyle messages around health tracking and the convenience of receiving alerts on the wrist, instead of the phone,” said McIntyre. “The benefit will increase as these devices gain the capability to function more independently from the phone.” “Smartwatch usage is clearly higher among people 44 years old and younger. More than half of people who use a smartwatch (58%) use it every day, and those who don’t (33%) use it at least several times a week,” she said. tags Samsung Gear S3 Smartwatch Fitness tracker Apple watch Android more from tech Microsoft bringing ‘Game Mode’ to enhance PC gaming experience Jan 14, 2017 16:25 IST SpaceX 2015 accident cost it hundreds of millions: WSJ Jan 14, 2017 15:39 IST Dare to dream: 5 Indian entrepreneurs who are driving social change Promotional feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Lattner announced his departure Tuesday on a Swift.org forum, and Tesla published a blog post shortly after welcoming him to the company. Lattner has been at Apple since 2005, and is credited with building early versions of the Swift programming language in 2010, before a team was formed to further the project. Most recently, he held the title of Senior Director of the Developer Tools team. Here’s Lattner’s letter: I’m happy to announce that Ted Kremenek will be taking over for me as “Project Lead” for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org. This recognizes the incredible effort he has already been putting into the project, and reflects a decision I’ve made to leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space. This decision wasn’t made lightly, and I want you all to know that I’m still completely committed to Swift. I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list.  Working with many phenomenal teams at Apple to launch Swift has been a unique life experience. Apple is a truly amazing place to be able to assemble the skills, imagination, and discipline to pull something like this off. Swift is in great shape today, and Swift 4 will be a really strong release with Ted as the Project Lead.  Note that this isn’t a change to the structure – just to who sits in which role – so we don’t expect it to impact day-to-day operations in the Swift Core Team in any significant way. Ted and I wanted to let you know what is happening as a part of our commitment to keeping the structure of Swift.org transparent to our community. And here’s the blog post from Tesla: We would like to welcome Chris Lattner, who will join Tesla as our Vice President of Autopilot Software. Chris’ reputation for engineering excellence is well known. He comes to Tesla after 11 years at Apple where he was primarily responsible for creating Swift, the programming language for building apps on Apple platforms and one of the fastest growing languages for doing so on Linux. Prior to Apple, Chris was lead author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, an open source umbrella project that is widely used in commercial products and academic research today. As Chris joins Tesla, we would like to give a special thanks to Jinnah Hosein, SpaceX’s Vice President of Software, who has been serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla Autopilot Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time. We would like to thank Jinnah for the efforts needed to achieve excellence in both roles, David Nister, our Vice President of Autopilot Vision, and the team for their exceptional work in advancing Autopilot. We are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving. Lattner’s departure is of course a major blow to Apple—by all accounts he was a very talented and well-respected engineer—and the Tesla release definitely adds insult to injury. We couldn’t think of another time the company made such an announcement.

Apple disputed the testing done by Consumer Reports and worked with it over the holidays to track down the discrepancy between its testing and Consumer Reports’ results. Today, Apple released the following statement to a handful of outlets, including iMore and The Loop: "We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results," Apple told iMore. "We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. This is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro." There have been reports of battery life issues with the MacBook Pro that are unrelated to Safari, but this should put the Safari issues raised by Consumer Reports to rest.

In 2005, he joined Apple where LLVM was integrated into Apple’s developer tools. Beginning in 2010, Lattner designed and built much of Swift, which was introduced to the world by Apple at WWDC in 2014. Today, Lattner announced on the Swift mailing list that he is leaving Apple: Since Apple launched Swift at WWDC 2014, the Swift team has worked closely with our developer community. When we made Swift open source and launched Swift.org we put a lot of effort into defining a strong community structure. This structure has enabled Apple and the amazingly vibrant Swift community to work together to evolve Swift into a powerful, mature language powering software used by hundreds of millions of people. I’m happy to announce that Ted Kremenek will be taking over for me as “Project Lead” for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org.

"Mr. C," who was born female, was working at a health centre in Guiyang last year when he was fired. The court said he had been illegally dismissed, but said there was not enough evidence to rule he had been fired due to discrimination against transgender people. The plaintiff told AFP news agency that he was "quite happy" with the outcome. In India, a Delhi man was reportedly drugged, kidnapped and brutally rapedbut couldn't report the crimes because of the country's statutes, according to MensXP.com . Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code defines rape as "sexual intercourse with a woman against her will," and doesn't include men. Also, Section 377 criminalizes homosexuality, deeming even consensual sex between men unnatural. Apple CEO Tim Cook declined an invitation to appear at the Oireachtas finance committee to discuss the EU's ruling that the company owes Ireland more than13 billion euros in back taxes, Irish Times noted. In a reply received by the committee, Apple executive Claire Thwaites wrote on Cook's behalf to say that he had been advised not to appear. Sinn Fein finance spokesman Pearse Doherty expressed disappointment and anger at the decision by Apple. The Taiwanese government proposed a ban so-called "gay conversion" therapythe practice of attempting to make an LGBTI person straight, QNews.com .au reported. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has published a draft regulation that would list the harmful "conversion" therapy as a prohibited treatment. The ban could come into effect as early as March, after a 60-day public consultation on the draft. In Israel, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit told the High Court that he will reduce the naturalization requirements for the partners of gay Israelis to match that of straight spouses, The Times of Israel noted. The opposite-sex partners of Israelis undergo a four-year process to gain citizenship, while gay people currently have a seven-year path to naturalization. Yahoo7 News reported that a New Zealand man was thrown from a bridge and left for dead in a "gay hate crime" after rejecting the advances of a married straight man on New Year's Eve, the victim's husband claimed. Maioha Tokotaua, 33, found his husband's "mangled" body lying unconscious under a train bridge in the Queensland town of Gladstone. Joth Wilson, 25, was found with broken bones, burns, a brain hemorrhage and a severed spinal cord, and is unlikely to walk again; he remained on life support. Tokotaua initially thought it was a suicide attempt until he noticed his husband's wallet and hat were missing. The owner of LGBT nightclubs Heaven and G-A-Y has apologized after suggesting that people from Somalia are responsible for rising crime in London, PinkNews reported. Club owner Jeremy Joseph made the comments on a Facebook post after a string of attacks in the capital. In apologizing, Joseph said, "The fact that some of these gangs are Somali is irrelevant and I should never have highlighted that fact, even in the heat of the moment which it was." Speaking of London bars, Kazbar, which opened doors in 1995, has been forced to close because of rent increases, PinkNews noted. The bar's rent was due to be hiked up from 86,000 to 150,000 British pounds. Last summer, the infamous Royal Vauxhall Tavern was threatened with closure by developers who planned to knock the landmark down and build a strip club chain in its place. Former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, appearing on the Family Research Council's Washington Watch radio program, denounced the State Department for forcing foreign-government ministers to march in gay-pride parades, LGBTQ Nation reported. In part, she said, "The U.S. government is telling another government, 'You have to have gay pride parades?' That's unbelievable! 'You won't get your PEPFAR money, you won't get your USAID money, unless you follow our radical social agenda?'" PEPFAR is a US-initiative that gives money to combat HIV/AIDS around the world; USAID funds are used for poverty and disaster relief. The new mayor of Rio de Janiero, Marcelo Crivella, has unleashed some interesting theories, LGBTQ Nation noted. Crivella, of Brazil's Republican Party, has said Catholics "preach demonic doctrines," and that Hinduism and African religions shelter "unclean spirits." He has also said that failed abortions result in gay babies, according to NewNowNext. Brazil is currently facing an epidemic of violent crime against LGBTQ people, with a member of the community killed almost every day in the country, according to Grupo Gay da Bahia. A Saudi television channel apologized after a reality show in the strict Islamic kingdom featured a scene that critics denounced as "pornographic," Middle East Eye noted. Online users posted a purported clip from the Bedaya TV program that appeared to show men dancing. One stood closely behind another, held the man's hips, and appeared to mimic a sexual act. Bedaya apologized on Twitter, saying mistakes can happen during live broadcasting. In India, censor board chief Pahlaj Nihalani has let Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh's butt-naked shot in the movie Befikre stay, but has deleted kissing scenes featuring gay and lesbian couples in the film, Mid-Day.com reported. The kissing scenes in question are from the Befikre song "Labon Ka Karobaar," a track that celebrates diversity. The official video of the song, which was released online, shows at least two gay couples kissing. NBC News has chosen six LGBTQ events worth traveling for this year. They include the Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival ( Feb. 17-March 5 ), WorldPride Madrid ( June 23-July 2 ), World OutGames ( in Miami on May 26-June 4 ), Queer British Art ( Apri 5-Oct. 1 ), Outfest ( in Los Angeles July 6-16 ) and the Milkshake Festival ( in Amsterdam July 29-30 ).

It may still be months away, but speculations about Apple's iPhone 8 are sweeping the internet. The latest rumor came from an "upstream supply chain" that suggests the Cupertino company is ditching the aluminium back cover. Instead, it will be designed with a stainless steel forging process that brings together two reinforced glass panels supported by a metal frame. The latest rumor was first reported by Chinese newspaper DigiTimes, which revealed the new components would be ordered from Foxconn electronics US-based Jabil - firms who worked with Apple in creating the iPhone 4, reports 9To5Mac. "The metal bezel will be made of stainless steel using a forging process to enhance its sturdiness and reduce costs and manufacturing time," reports DigiTimes. Other than giving the iPhone 8 a sleeker design, this move will ensure the glass panels in the front and back hold together. And it should decrease costs by 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Using stainless steel could send the iPhone 8 back in time, as this metal alloy was originally used on the iPhone 4 variants. However, it would also mean that this will be one of Apple's strongest smartphones yet. Continued below. Related Content National election promise to create recreational fishing-only zones running behind schedule Your views: Readers' letters Cartoon: Another Kiwi classic - Household debt This speculation is consistent with a major rumor - the iPhone could feature a curved OLED, which lets Apple include an edge-to-edge screen. Aside from the rumors regarding the iPhone 8's body design, Apple received a new patent that also points to an edge-to-edge screen. The patent, titled 'Electronic devices having displays with openings' describes a method that places electronic components - such as cameras and speakers - underneath the screen. According to AppleInsider, the openings on the screen would be so small they would be "imperceptible to the human eye" - resulting in a "true edge-to-edge screen". This setup would also make it possible to add in various sensors inside of the phone that could transmit information across the display. "An electronic component may be mounted in alignment with the one or more openings in the display," reads the patent filed in February 2015. "Signals associated with the electronic component may pass through the openings. "The signals may include acoustic signals, electromagnetic signals such as radio-frequency electromagnetic signals, and light. "The electronic component may be a structure that uses light such as a camera, a light sensor, a light-based proximity sensor, a status indicator light, a light-based touch sensor array, or a secondary display that has display pixels that may be viewed through the openings." Apple could be moving forward with this design, as the firm is up against other smartphone makers to design the thinnest and compact smartphone. And the best way to do this is to remove all of the features from the outer areas and hide them underneath the screen. Just a month after the iPhone 7 hit the market, rumors began circulating about what to expect in 2017. One of these speculations was the handset could feature an all-glass casing. Experts say that the transition from metal to glass casing is key if Apple is to introduce a wireless charging feature in its next iPhone. The rumours were obtained by MacRumours, and come from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities. Mr Kuo is uncertain whether a wireless charger will be bundled with all new iPhones, but is convinced that the feature will appear in the iPhone 8. A metal alloy phone casing could potentially cause wireless charging speeds to be reduced, which is why a glass chassis could be used instead. iOS users may have also heard that there could be three iPhone 8 smartphones to choose from this year - oppose to the traditional two Apple releases every year. According to Nikkei, there will be one premium model with a curved edge-to-edge OLED display alongside two models that have standard LCD displays. Citing a supply chain source, Nikkei says Apple will release the three iPhones in the following sizes: 5.5 inches, 5 inches, and 4.7 inches. "Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones, and Biel and Lens are likely to be providing all the glass backs for the new iPhones next year," the source said. All three iPhone 8 models will use glass supplied by Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology in China for both the front and back. However, these rumors say all three of them will be held together with an aluminum frame. - Daily Mail Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

In other words, HomeKit accessory commands were being processed through the set-top box, but there was no way to allow the user to participate using the Apple TV itself. It took another year to come to fruition, but tvOS 10 brought interactive HomeKit support to the set-top box last fall, opening up not only the ability to control HomeKit accessories via Siri commands, but also support for third-party tvOS apps to access the HomeKit framework. Siri HomeKit commands can be used to adjust most accessories (e.g. “Turn off the living room lights”) and activate scenes (e.g. “Set the movie night scene” or even simply “It’s movie night”), and we’ve found they often work more quickly than issuing the same commands on the iPhone or Apple Watch. You can also set your thermostat (e.g. “Set the temperature to 24 degrees”) and inquire as to the status of various HomeKit sensors to check temperature and other information (e.g. “What is the temperature in the living room?” or even “Is there carbon monoxide in the basement?”). The only major limitation is that you can’t control security devices such as door locks; these types of devices require authentication — usually via Touch ID or an Apple Watch with Wrist Detection enabled. And since the Apple TV doesn’t have any way of authenticating you, it will simply refuse to let you do anything with these accessories, directing you to issue the command on your iOS device instead. You can still check the status of your door locks, however (e.g. “Is the front door locked?”). Third-party HomeKit apps have been a bit slower in appearing for tvOS, although options like Looming ($2) are starting to show up to provide additional options. In our opinion, we find it more practical to simply use Siri for the majority of HomeKit functions on the Apple TV, as it can be called up from anywhere rather than having to switch over to another app. That said, Looming offers support for the new category of HomeKit cameras, such as D-Link’s upcoming Omna 180, so we’ll probably have more to say about third-party HomeKit apps on tvOS as we start taking a look at these devices.

The company’s decline is being blamed on “lukewarm” demand from Apple, its biggest client, according to Nikkei. In 2016, Foxconn recorded revenues of $136.38 billion, down 2.81 percent compared to 2015. Apple accounts for over 50 percent of the company’s revenue. December, however, represented a month of growth for Foxconn as it reported 9.76 percent growth year-over-year thanks to the Chinese New Year holiday and strong demand for the iPhone 7 Plus. Investors and analysts are largely blaming Foxconn’s decline on Apple’s slow performance in 2016. Analyst Vincent Chen noted that while 2016 saw Apple and Foxconn’s first respective dips in over 15 years, 2017 looks strong for both, thanks in large part to the iPhone 8. In 2017, Chen anticipates that Foxconn could grow by as much as 5 percent to 10 percent: “Look forward to 2017, we think Foxconn’s revenue could grow by 5% to 10%,” said Chen. The growth drivers for the current year will come from healthier demand for the next iPhone 8 and a mild rebound in the PC market, according to Chen. Foxconn is also the world’s biggest desktop assembler. Speaking to the press recently, Foxconn’s founder Terry Gou also noted that despite speculation that Foxconn will move to the United States, the company will stay in China. Gou didn’t rule out, however, the possibility of an increased presence in the United States. After the announcement, Gou told reporters in Guangzhou in no uncertain terms: “Foxconn will not leave [China]. Foxconn will stay here.” Much has been made of Apple’s performance in 2016, with analysts and investors calling for change and the company continually defending itself. It was reported several times in 2016 that Apple was cutting iPhone production, most recently just a few weeks ago when a report claimed Apple was reducing production by 10 percent in 2017.  Tim Cook also saw his pay drop by $1.5 billion due to Apple’s failure to meet profit and revenue goals in 2016.

This recognizes the incredible effort he has already been putting into the project, and reflects a decision I’ve made to leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space. This decision wasn’t made lightly, and I want you all to know that I’m still completely committed to Swift. I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list. Working with many phenomenal teams at Apple to launch Swift has been a unique life experience. Apple is a truly amazing place to be able to assemble the skills, imagination, and discipline to pull something like this off. Swift is in great shape today, and Swift 4 will be a really strong release with Ted as the Project Lead. Tesla then posted this on its company blog: We would like to welcome Chris Lattner, who will join Tesla as our Vice President of Autopilot Software. Chris’ reputation for engineering excellence is well known. He comes to Tesla after 11 years at Apple where he was primarily responsible for creating Swift, the programming language for building apps on Apple platforms and one of the fastest growing languages for doing so on Linux. Prior to Apple, Chris was lead author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, an open source umbrella project that is widely used in commercial products and academic research today. Wowzers.

Advertisement Its only been a few weeks since the release of iOS 10.2 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and Apple’s showing no signs of slowing down. The company is planning at least one new iOS 10 update for iOS 10 users though it now looks like it could another upgrade more in the pipeline. An iOS 10.3 release is rumored for January. Apple is rumored to be working on a much larger update for the iPhone and iPad and it could sometime next week. An iOS 10.3 update is reportedly in the works and sources claim an early version of it could be out in January ahead of a wider release later this year. Advertisement With that in mind we want to take a quick look at everything you need to know about the rumored iOS 10.3 update. We’ll continue to update this with new details so check back for frequent updates. iOS 10.2.1 Update Coming First The iOS 10.3 update, if there is an iOS 10.3 update, won’t be the update that replaces Apple’s current version of iOS 10 (iOS 10.2). That honor goes to the iOS 10.2.1 update that’s currently in beta ahead of an unknown release date for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. We’re currently on the second iOS 10.2.1 beta and it still looks like the upgrade will be a minor bug fixer with under-the-hood improvements. Advertisement For more on the next iOS 10 update, take a look at our roundup. iOS 10.3 Spotted According to Sonny Dickson, a well-known leakster who’s produced accurate information in the past, the iOS 10.3 update is codenamed ‘Erie‘ behind the scenes. Gotta Be Mobile and several other sites have seen visits from devices claiming to run iOS 10.3. We’ve also seen a pickup in visits in the recent weeks, a sign that the update is real and could be heading to testers in the near future. iOS 10.3 Beta According to Dickson, Apple will release an iOS 10.3 beta in January though the update failed to land on his rumored date. @Andy_Corton Not to sure Andy — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) January 10, 2017 The first iOS 10.3 beta was originally rumored for roll out on January 10th. Instead, Apple released a new iOS 10.2.1 beta alongside new betas for watchOS, macOS, and tvOS. An iOS 10.3 beta release is now up in the air. Apple typically releases the first beta update to developers a day or two before it releases the software to those in the free Beta Software Program. All of Apple’s iOS 10 beta updates have been available to both groups and we’d expect the iOS 10.3 beta to be released for both groups. iOS 10.3 Release Date Dickson’s leak didn’t come with a specific iOS 10.3 release date for those outside of the beta programs though there’s some are speculating that it could arrive in the March-April window alongside new hardware. According to several reports, Apple is in the process of developing new Apple hardware and new iPad software including wider support for the Apple Pencil accessory. Apple is reportedly working on new iPads and new iPad software. Bloomberg claims “Apple may roll out the new iPad software features as part of an upgrade to the iOS 10 operating system in the first half of 2017.” It’s unclear if this update and the iOS 10.3 update are one in the same though the iOS 10.3 beta (though not necessarily the first seed) could shed some clues. iOS 10.3 Update According to Dickson’s source, the iOS 10.3 update might come with a new Theater Mode. iOS 10.3’s rumored Theater Mode could be an enhanced Dark Mode. It appears the new Theater Mode could be an enhanced version of iOS’ Dark Mode though that remains unconfirmed at this point. He also claims the iOS 10.3 update will come with a new Popcorn-shaped Control Center Icon which we assume will be for this new Theater Mode. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 12 known patches for potential exploits including one where an "attacker with an unlocked device may be able to disable Find My iPhone."  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.1.1 update and/or the iOS 10.1 update, know that iOS 10.2 brings their security patches with it. If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 One Response 01/10/2017 Stephen Reply Really a very terribly written article, with numerous grammar mistakes.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 11 January 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM New iPads rumoured to be releasing this spring Guessing game: It is predicted that Apple will release new iPad models in three different sizes: 9.7in, 10in to 10.5in, and 12.9in.— AFP Relaxnews According to The Verge the prediction comes from respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities, who made the prediction via 9to5Mac. Kuo has been predicting Apple releases for years and although he has made mistakes in the past, he is known for his accuracy. If he is right this time, Apple would release three new iPad models in three different sizes: 9.7in, 10in to 10.5in and 12.9in. The 9.7in iPad would be a cheaper option with an A9 chip, first used for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. The 10in to 10.5in will be a "high-end model equipped with a narrow bezel design" and an A10X chip, and the 12.9in model will be the second generation iPad Pro with an A10X chip. The Verge also reports that rumours suggest the 7.9in iPad mini could also be getting a new release this year after being last updated in 2015.  —  AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Smart Bluetooth locks on homes are surprisingly easy to pick Samsung Elec probe finds battery was main cause of Note 7 fires Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Brewer to hand out up to RM2mil worth of prizes for CNY Man burnt to death in Beluran house fire Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Smartphone, Internet use at record high in US: survey Mercedes wants to use robots for making goods deliveries Create your own website Two thumbs-up for Oculus Touch Sci-fi tech set for 2017 Most Viewed in Tech QLED vs OLED Create your own website PCs on the rise Mercedes wants to use robots for making goods deliveries Could your gadgets send you to jail?

According to Linio, a Latin America e-commerce company, U.S. consumers pay an average of  $625.88 for the product that generates more than 60 percent of Apple’s annual revenue. That ranks 39th in Linio’s rankings of iPhone costs in countries around the world, lagging China, Sweden, and Israel among others.  Many reasons account for the price disparities, including tariffs, taxes and local economic conditions. iPhones in Venezuela, for instance, are the most expensive because the country is being crushed by hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund thinks may reach 1,600 percent this year. But even in Angola, where iPhones are the cheapest, poverty is so widespread that few citizens can afford one. Even so, many U.S. tourists traveling abroad might want to add an iPhone to their shopping lists because they can enjoy considerable savings, in certain countries. Here are the 10 most expensive countries to buy an iPhone: 1) Venezuela - $97,813.82 2) Singapore - $969.04 3) Dominican Republic - $965.62 4) Argentina - $900.43 5) Guatemala - $889.56 6) Bangladesh - $870.11 7) Norway - $867.28 8) Indonesia - $865.06 9) Costa Rica - $852.94 10) Brazil - $843.40 The 10 least expensive: 1) Angola - $401.94 2) Japan - $413.58 3) China - $470.74 4) Finland - $475.94 5) United Arab Emirates - $498.25 6) India - $505.25 7) Romania - $513.42 8) Saudi Arabia - $513.86 9) Ukraine - $527.50 10) Malaysia - $532.06 © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

However, the iPhone maker could soon land the honor of a congratulatory tweet from the jumped-up telly celeb – after it revealed it is expanding its manufacturing in America. Two years ago, Apple announced it would build a $2bn data center in Mesa, Arizona, at a facility formerly owned by its erstwhile ally GT Advanced Technologies. Fast forward to this month and buried in the US government's Federal Register notices is a letter from the Foreign-Trade Zones Board. It details Apple's desire for permits to assemble its own servers at the Mesa site, rather than ship in completed boxes from overseas. This comes after Trump virtually commanded Apple and other industry giants to build more hardware on American soil – and has gloated on Twitter when corporations announced they are expanding manufacturing in the US, effectively taking credit for decisions he had no part of. Crucially, Apple wants a tax break on the server components it will import prior to assembling the data center boxes. “Production under [Foreign-Trade Zones] procedures could exempt Apple from customs duty payments on the foreign-status materials/components used in export production,” the notice reads. “On its domestic sales, Apple would be able to choose the duty rate during customs entry procedures that applies to finished server assembly cabinets (duty-free) for the foreign-status materials/components noted below and in the existing scope of authority. Customs duties also could possibly be deferred or reduced on foreign-status production equipment.” The products Apple would like to ship in at these reduced rates include servers, solid state drives, lithium batteries, routers and network switches, monitors, electronic integrated circuits, and metal furniture. Everything you need for an assembly plant of the kind called for by the next occupant of the White House. “We’re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,” Trump promised at a campaign stop last year. He threatened new taxes on Apple and other tech firms that didn’t start building their kit domestically. So we might be getting one of Trump’s trademark Twitter blasts proclaiming how his election is causing Silicon Valley to rethink shipping good American jobs abroad. The cream of the tech industry (and whatever else floats to the top) came to Trump Tower to metaphorically kiss the new leader’s ring. But as ever with these things, there’s slightly more to it than that, once you dig into the details. The half-life of jobs in the Black Mesa It appears unlikely that anyone’s going to be proudly sporting a Made in America sticker on their iPhones, iPads or Watches any time soon. Past filings detail a very different kind of manufacturing will be going on. Apple is a member of the Open Compute Project and builds its own servers locally at data centers in the US. But an anonymous source told Business Insider that the Mesa facility will be used to assemble all the servers Apple uses. This may lead to these regional assembly centers being closed down. Nevertheless, the move will create jobs in Mesa, which is good because high-tech employment has had a spotty record of late in the city. Although Apple’s expansion last year created 150 permanent jobs and between 300 and 500 construction jobs, things have been tough for others. In 2014, 890 people were laid off when GT's local factory building durable sapphire glass designed for smartphones went bust short years after purchasing a huge array of high-tech glass furnaces to do the job and setting up shop in the city. GT has since claimed that Apple ran it out of business. Apple loaned GT $350m to build glass-making factories in Mesa, Arizona, and Salem, Massachusetts, to secure a supply of glass for the iPhone. But in bankruptcy hearings, GT’s former COO Daniel Squiller claimed his company had fallen for a “classic bait-and-switch strategy" that had driven his company into the ground. As part of the loan agreement with Cupertino, GT had to commit to supplying glass almost exclusively to Cook & Co – although Apple had no obligation to buy any of it. GT would also have to pay a fine if it sold glass to anyone Apple disapproved of and the whole deal had a $50m charge if GT made the details of the contract public. When Squiller and the GT board complained, they were told to “put on your big boy pants and accept the agreement.” After they did so, Squiller claimed Apple micromanaged the plant, couldn’t get the glass they wanted, and then called in its loans and bankrupted the company. Apple seemingly still can’t get the sapphire glass problem right – early reports on the iPhone 7 indicate there are scratching issues with some components. But 890 jobs were still lost, although Apple vowed at the time to reuse the facility. Now it appears they will, and some of those lost jobs might be filled by the new assembly line. In the meantime, Apple can claim it is doing its bit and Trump can enthuse about his latest triumph. ® Stop press: Trump may have other things to worry about right now.

Apple already has authority to produce certain components for consumer electronics in a special zone that exempts it from customs duty payments, but now it’s looking for approval from the Foreign-Trade Zones Board to produce “finished products and foreign status materials and components” in the Mesa factory. “Apple Inc. has repurposed the site as a global data command center that will conduct high-tech manufacturing of finished data center cabinets for other data centers,” according to a document filed by Mesa on behalf of Apple. Servers in Apple’s data centers in Oregon and North Carolina are currently being built and tested on-site, but the company now wants to consolidate building and configuring servers in Mesa before they’re shipped to its other data centers. Production at the Mesa facility could include imported materials and components such as “server housing and enclosures” as well as “routers and network switches.” Located at Signal Butte and Elliot roads, the massive 1.3 million square feet facility was established as a sapphire-glass factory. It was supposed to churn out sapphire laminates in volume to help strengthen iPhone’s screen. Apple leased the plant to GT Advanced which operated it on Apple’s behalf. Tim Cook & Co. prepaid more than half a billion dollars to GT to buy equipment and kick off mass production of ultra-thin sapphire laminates. Unfortunately, major manufacturing challenges slowed progress significantly and deadlines were missed. Mounting debt soon prompted GT to file for bankruptcy, much to Apple’s surprise. The company eventually sold its expensive furnaces to pay debt. Despite its inexperienced partner going into Chapter 11 and shutting down sapphire production, Apple has kept the Mesa plant while GT’s creditors whined about getting “too little” in a settlement deal with the iPhone maker. Apple is currently using the Mesa facility as a $2 billion global command center to store and serve iCloud backups and host digital content on iTunes.

But perhaps more perplexing was the incredible inconsistency in the results, with battery life varying from 3.75 hours to 19.5 hours. Since then, Apple has been working with Consumer Reports to figure out what could be the source of this discrepancy and inconsistency with its own results. According to Apple's statement, the reason is two-fold, with the first being the way the notebooks were tested and the other being a bug in Safari. The first one is not much of an issue but rather the way Consumer Reports runs battery life tests on its computers. They open a set of locally stored websites on the default browser, set the display to 100 nits brightness, and let the battery run dry as the computer cycles through the websites. The goal here is to mimic the real world usage and opening and closing websites is a pretty reliable way to do it. But to make sure all the machines are comparable, Consumer Reports also disables some of the features on them, which includes caching of website data. Apple identified this as one of the problems, since the figures that the company provides are taken into account caching of webpages, which is the default behavior in Safari and Consumer Reports did deviate from the default behavior, not just for Safari but for users in general, in order to run their tests. The other issue was caused due to the first, as Consumer Reports' disabling of cache in Safari triggered a bug in reloading icons. Apple has since patched the bug and the fix will be released to customers soon. After enabling the cache for the browser and using the patched software, Consumer Report' battery life tests for the MacBook Pro models were on par with Apple's claims. They will be publishing the full results soon. The following is Apple's statement on the situation. We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. This is the best pro notebook weve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and were glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro. Source Related articles Today only, Apple's latest MacBook Pro is $150 off Latest MacBook Pro is the first Apple laptop without Consumer Reports recommendation New MacBook Pro faces Thunderbolt 3 connectivity issues iFixit tears down the new entry-level 13" MacBook Pro, deems it very hard to repair Reader comments Boldy 9xnB 12 Jan 2017 If I wanted a better machine than the macbook pro 15, I would buy the razer blade 2016.

That time seems to have passed, however, for recently we've seen quite a few such deals. Following the reduced price iPad Pro 9.7 we told you about yesterday, here are two more Apple devices that you can buy for less than usual. First up, the current 13-inch MacBook Air. Normally starting at $999, you can snag one for just $799.99 from Best Buy. Or, if you want to save $50 more, there's the option of going for an open-box unit too. The laptop comes with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of flash storage. If you'd like a small tablet instead, there's the iPad mini 4 with LTE connectivity to consider. This is being sold by Best Buy for only $279.99 with 16GB of storage, or $379.99 with 64GB of space. In all of these cases, you're saving a cool $200 compared to the recommended retail pricing for these devices. The problem is that there's no telling how long these deals will last, so if you want to buy a MacBook Air or iPad mini 4 for cheap, don't miss out on this opportunity.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Galaxy S8 release date leaked and jacked Chris Burns - Jan 10, 2017 13 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit A report this week suggests that the Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship smartphone is well on its way. After an introduction in part at Mobile World Congress 2017 at the tail end of February, the next Galaxy smartphone would be released soon thereafter. If the device sticks with the schedule laid out by this report, it’d match those of the previous couple of smartphones before the Samsung Galaxy S7. Heading back to the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Samsung Galaxy S6 scheduling for the Galaxy S smartphone line would put the device closer to the release of Apple’s next flagship. At this point we’d be surprised if anyone was still debating between the two, but there it is. The war between Samsung and Apple seems to be forever unending. SEE: Galaxy S8 detailed leaked in top-end renders The Samsung Galaxy S8 has been tipped to be coming in a bit later than the schedule inflicted by the Samsung Galaxy S7. As mentioned by Android Authority, it would make sense for Samsung to spend some extra time on quality assurance checks for the next Galaxy S smartphone given the calamity that was the Galaxy Note 7. With the Samsung Galaxy S8 comes the response to the call of the iPhone’s most recent ditching of the headphone jack. If Samsung keeps the headphone jack, there’s a far greater chance that the rest of the smartphone universe would keep their jacks too. If Samsung gets rid of the headphone jack, the rest of the Android smartphone world would quite likely follow suit. Word from Korean business newspaper The Investor, an anonymous tip from an industry insider says Samsung’s release date for the Galaxy S8 will come during the third week of April. If we see one more smartphone without a headphone jack before then, I swear, I’ll cry tears made of pure concentrated acid. Cross your fingers that April 18th will come with even more features on the Galaxy S8 than were released on the Galaxy S7 – not less!

An employee at famous German lens maker Carl Zeiss confirmed the partnership at last week's CES tech show in Las Vegas, according to well-known tech blogger Robert Scoble. AR differs from virtual reality in that it overlays digital graphics on top of a real-world view. The most well-known example of AR is the Pokemon Go mobile game, which enables players to catch virtual critters in real-world settings. The best known AR headset currently on offer is Microsoft 's HoloLens - although the discontinued Google Glass also made use of the technology. Microsoft's HoloLens Ar headset enables the wearer to fix a real-world review with overlaid computer graphics In a Facebook post published this week, Scoble noted that there was no augmented reality tech on display at Zeiss' CES both, despite being situated in the show's AR zone. Read More Apple boss Tim Cook says he's got the 'best job in the world' - but admits he's no Steve Jobs After quizzing employees as to why this was the case and suggesting that it was because "Tim Cook didn't let you", he said that Zeiss employees around him "smiled nervously". "A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year," wrote Scoble. "I thought it was next year but now that I saw this I believe it will happen this year. Google Glass made use of augmented reality technology "And that explains why there was no augmented reality in Zeiss's booth even though it was right in the middle of the AR area." While it may be a bit of a stretch to treat this as a solid confirmation of a partnership with the Cupertino brand, it was reported in November that Apple was working on a pair of AR smart glasses. Read More Apple's next product could be a pair of Google Glass-style augmented reality specs “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook . “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” Zeiss launched the One Plus virtual reality headset last year (Photo: Zeiss) A finished device was not expected until 2018, but Scoble now believes that Apple may reveal a product in collaboration with Zeiss this year.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple fixes Safari bug that distorted Consumer Reports battery life tests Apple fixes Safari bug that distorted Consumer Reports battery life tests By Joel Hruska on January 10, 2017 at 4:02 pm Comment Last month, Consumer Reports declared it would not recommend the new MacBook Pro, on account of its poor and highly erratic battery life. This report followed weeks of controversy that has dogged the latest refresh of Apple’s mobile hardware — many users also haven’t been happy with Apple’s reliance on dongles or its minimum improvements to the platform (the cost increases generally don’t offset the addition of new features like the Touch Bar). Apple initially refused to acknowledge that the platform might have battery issues, preferring to sweep the problem under the rug by removing macOS’s “Time Remaining” estimate, but the Consumer Reports review was ugly enough that the company was forced to investigate. It turns out Consumer Reports’ battery life tests were being impacted by a Safari bug, as we had hypothesized was the case. Apple has resolved the bug in the latest beta version of macOS (10.12.3) and will push the solution out to all users when that flavor of the OS is ready for prime time. Apple’s statement on the matter reads: “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results… We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache…. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test.” The reason Consumer Reports disables its browser cache is because the publication is trying to test battery life, which means it wants its benchmark to hit the Wi-Fi radio rather than repeatedly loading web pages from the browser cache. This is the sort of configuration change a publication might make when trying to isolate something as complex as battery life — there’s an intrinsic tension between the need to automate a test to complete it in a reasonable time frame and the need to design a test that reflects real-world usage. Since most people don’t spend hours refreshing a single page, forcing the browser to reload one page repeatedly is a better way to capture web browsing than reloading the same page from the browser cache. Here’s how CR describes its laptop testing practices: We download a series of 10 web pages repeatedly, starting with the battery fully charged, and ending when the laptop shuts down. The web pages are stored on a server in our lab and transmitted over a dedicated WiFi network. We conduct our battery tests using the browser that is native to the computer’s operating system—Safari, in the case of the MacBook Pro laptops… We also turn off the local caching of web pages. In our tests, we want the computer to load each web page as if it were new content from the internet, rather than resurrecting the data from its local drive. This allows us to collect consistent results across the testing of many laptops, and it also puts batteries through a tougher workout. According to Apple, this last part of our testing is what triggered a bug in the company’s Safari browser. Indeed, when we turned the caching function back on as part of the research we did after publishing our initial findings, the three MacBooks we’d originally tested had consistently high battery life results. Apple, of course, is hinging its rather testy reply on the idea that this test doesn’t reflect ‘real world conditions,’ and that may be true. But it doesn’t explain why many users have reported terrible battery life before the CR tests. According to Apple, Consumer Reports’ unusual testing scenario “also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab.” No explanation is given for how an obscure icon-reloading bug can cause laptop battery life to vary between 3.75 and 19 hours, and no explanation has been offered for why some users have seen battery life decline from 9-10 hours on previous MacBook Pros to 6-7 hours that many users have reported with the newer models. Given that Apple already had an obscure bug that was triggering in this specific case, it’s entirely possible that other obscure bugs have caused issues with other battery life scenarios. And while the CR bug may be specific to its testing practices, it’s also a useful demonstration of why publications publish results corporations aren’t going to like in the first place. Previous Apple laptops didn’t have this bug, which means Apple introduced the flaw at some point. When a company isn’t willing to work with you prior to publication, publishing results is often the only way to get a company to investigate a problem.

Written by Amitav Ranjan | New Delhi | Published:January 11, 2017 4:04 am Apple’s rationale for used equipment is that multinationals capitalise on efficiencies in the allocation of resources throughout their supply chain and shift equipment between manufacturing lines and locations. Apple has submitted a formidable wish list of pre-requisites — the prime being a 15-year Customs duty holiday on import of iPhone kits, new and used capital equipment, and consumables — to establish an iPhone production facility in India. Its application seeks “full duty exemption on manufacturing and repair inputs (raw materials), yield loss on inputs, components, capital equipment (including parts), and consumables for smartphone manufacturing and services/repair for a period of 15 years for both domestic and export markets”. Apple’s “desired model for entry” shows that it does not intend to source locally, as it has sought duty cuts on components, completely knocked down (CKD) and semi knocked down (SKD) units of iPhones, for re-assembly at the finished goods manufacturing line to be set up in spring this year. Watch What Else Is making News Commerce Ministry officials said the demanded duty break would require a trade policy change for the entire industry as it would need to be extended to other companies, including Samsung, who have set up phone manufacturing units in India. Last week, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government was yet to take a view on Apple’s demands. “We are discussing that… no other mobile manufacturer has sought any extra concessions… we have not taken any decision,” she said. Her ministry would have to usher another policy level change in the Export Promotion Capital Goods scheme as Apple wants inclusion of “used” capital goods, spare parts and components under the scheme for duty free imports. The EPCG scheme currently forbids import of second-hand capital goods or spares. Apple’s rationale for used equipment is that multinationals capitalise on efficiencies in the allocation of resources throughout their supply chain and shift equipment between manufacturing lines and locations. “This requirement translates into our request to include new and used capital equipment in the scope of both EPCG and MSIPS (Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme),” says its application with the ministry. The MSIPS is meant to attract large investments in electronic manufacturing through capital subsidy and also provides reimbursements of central taxes and excise duties for capital equipment for 10 years from the date of approval. The Cupertino giant has said that it plans to place “initial emphasis” on iPhone finished goods manufacturing based in Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) with some elements of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) or Export Oriented Units (EOUs), to serve both domestic and export markets equally. It has, therefore, requested that its DTA unit be allowed the same provision as is available in SEZs on import, repair and re-export of defective units without any constraint on the age of the defective units. Currently, production units in DTA can only repair products exported from India up to a three-year period. “Since these units are destined to be re-exported, it is necessary to remove the time constraint imposed on the age of the product,” it said, assuring that the exemption would not be misused to abuse the environment regulations. Apple does not want the government to levy extra taxes or impose fresh barriers on import of finished goods in the proposed Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime either. “As GST would subsume all indirect taxation and the government will be looking at keeping a differential to provide an advantage to domestic manufacturers, we would strongly advocate for the government not to impose any additional hurdles or taxes on the importation of finished products.” Other requests are: · Expeditious processing of Apple’s Advance Pricing Agreement in the Income Tax Department to achieve certainty on the arm’s length pricing applied to international transactions between the Indian company and its overseas affiliated companies. · Aligning Customs procedures to provide less intrusive inspections, “always open” clearance process, combined declarations on a periodic basis rather than declaration at each transaction, suspension of paying integrated goods and service tax at the point of importation so as to avoid actual tax payments, followed by claims for refunds so that administrative and cash flow costs could be evaded. Apple’s earlier request to exempt it from adhering to domestic sourcing norm of 30 per cent as rider for investing in single brand retail was approved by the Prime Minister’s Office last June. Apple was then asked to send its consent so that its proposal could be further processed for grant of approval. It is yet to send a response to it, says a ministry letter. Till date, Apple sells iPhones and other Apple gadgets through its licensed re-sellers and distributors in the country. It is betting big on the India market, where it currently holds a minuscule 2 per cent market share, what with slowing growth numbers in the developed markets like the US and China.

Reuters/Charles Platiau Note: This is the second of a two-part story celebrating the 10th year anniversary of the iPhone. To read the first, go here: 10 fun facts about the iPhone’s first 10 years (Part 1 of 2) No. 6 - Apple iPhone 10th anniversary fun facts According to Steve Jobs, the iPhone started out as an iPad venture. The Apple CEO said in a 2010 interview that he initially instructed his engineers to explore several tablet designs with a virtual keyboard. When they presented him with a device that had a multi-touch display, Jobs decided to shelve the tablet project and apply the technology to a phone instead. No. 7 - 10 fun facts about the Apple iPhone’s first 10 years The latest iPhone incarnation, the iPhone 7, is more powerful than ever thanks to Apple’s cutting-edge A10 Fusion chipset. The iPhone 7 is 120 times faster when it comes to processing performance and 240 times faster graphics performance-wise compared to the first iPhone. No. 8 - Apple iPhone 10th anniversary fun facts iPhones always clock in at 9:41 in its ads, and for good reason. “We design the keynotes so that the big reveal of the product happens around 40 minutes into the presentation. When the big image of the product appears on screen, we want the time shown to be close to the actual time on the audience’s watches,” explained former Apple chief Scott Forstall. “But we know we won't hit 40 minutes exactly.” The first iPhone and the iPhone 7 both clocking in at 9:41.  Apple No. 9 - 10 fun facts about the Apple iPhone’s first 10 years iPhones used to feature the silhouette of U2 frontman Bono on the Artists icon of its music app up until mid-2015. Apple’s iOS 8.4 update eventually replaced the singer with a generic microphone. No. 10 - Apple iPhone 10th anniversary fun facts Apple owns about 200 iPhone-related patents, which is why the Cupertino-based company is so protective of its smartphone’s technology. Apple has had several legal battles over the years due to patent violations by rivals like Samsung.

It doesn’t really make the watch into a functional Macintosh Classic computer fully – it doesn’t give the watch an 8 MHz Motorola 68000 processor or anything. But it does make the watch look like it’s a display for the Mac Classic while it charges. That’s what’s most important in this case, anyway. The Elgato W3 stand works with both the original Apple Watch and the Apple Watch 2. This stand is made from scratch-free silicone which does several things. First, silicone makes the stand and the Apple Watch avoid damaging one-another. Second, silicone has a bit more slip-resistance than smoother plastic, so the stand won’t be sliding around on the surface of your desk. Once the standard Apple Watch charger is attached to this stand and the Apple Watch is placed, Apple Watch Nightstand Mode will appear. This will happen only if WatchOS 2 or the latest version of the OS thereafter is installed. It’s only right then that the stand should be placed next to the user’s own most current Apple computer for charging. This stand is extremely simple – it does not include the charging cable or the Apple Watch. As such, the stand is relatively inexpensive, too. The Elgato-made W3 Stand for Apple Watch 1 & 2 will cost users a cool $13.99 USD when it becomes available from the Elgato Store. UPDATE: It’s been made available and can be found through Elgato as such.

Lattner announced his decision to leave Apple on the swift-evolution list. He will remain an active member of the Swift Core Team and Ted Kremenek will take over as project lead. ----- Since Apple launched Swift at WWDC 2014, the Swift team has worked closely with our developer community. When we made Swift open source and launched Swift.org we put a lot of effort into defining a strong community structure. This structure has enabled Apple and the amazingly vibrant Swift community to work together to evolve Swift into a powerful, mature language powering software used by hundreds of millions of people. I’m happy to announce that Ted Kremenek will be taking over for me as “Project Lead” for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org. This recognizes the incredible effort he has already been putting into the project, and reflects a decision I’ve made to leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space. This decision wasn't made lightly, and I want you all to know that I’m still completely committed to Swift. I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list. Working with many phenomenal teams at Apple to launch Swift has been a unique life experience. Apple is a truly amazing place to be able to assemble the skills, imagination, and discipline to pull something like this off. Swift is in great shape today, and Swift 4 will be a really strong release with Ted as the Project Lead. Note that this isn’t a change to the structure - just to who sits in which role - so we don’t expect it to impact day-to-day operations in the Swift Core Team in any significant way. Ted and I wanted to let you know what is happening as a part of our commitment to keeping the structure of Swift.org transparent to our community. -Chris ----- Update: Tesla has hired Chris to lead their Autopilot engineering program.

Consumer Reports Says a Web-Cache Setting May Have Been to Blame for Inconsistent Results in Testing By Bryant Frazer   /   Jan 10, 2017 Update 01/13/17: Consumer Reports says Apple's fix has solved the problem it found with the new MacBook Pro line-up and has re-rated the systems as "recommended." CR said the units it tested averaged 15-19 hours of operation under a single charge with the fix applied. (Results were as low as 3.75 hours in the previous round of tests.) The update is not yet available to all Mac users. Apple says a flaw in its new line-up of MacBook Pros that impacted expected battery life in tests by Consumer Reports — battery life was so inconsistent that CR declined to recommend any of the new systems —  was a bug in Safari that "does not reflect real-world usage." Nonetheless, Apple has provided a fix for the issue that is available now to beta software users, and CR is re-evaluating the systems. The bug was said to be revealed as CR described its testing methodology to Apple, which includes turning off local caching of web pages, so that when CR hits the same page multiple times, it is reloaded from an internal server as though it's being accessed for the first time. Apple said that setting "triggered an obscure and intermittent bug" that has been fixed. "This is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro," Apple said in a statement published by CR. For its own part, CR promised to update its findings once it has a chance to do a comprehensive retest of the MacBook Pro's battery life. But the company did note that MacBook Pro users have complained about short battery life in user forums, and it's unclear whether any problems outside of the testing labs will be addressed by Apple's current fix. (For a summary of the issue, see ExtremeTech's coverage from early December.) The new software update is available now to Mac users in Apple's Beta Software Program, and should be made available to the broader universe of users in the coming weeks.

Missed Last Fiscal Year newsfeedback@fool.com (Evan Niu, CFA) Updated Jan 12, 2017 0 CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple. Ahead of its annual shareholder meeting at the end of next month, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has gone ahead and filed its proxy statement with the SEC. As usual for proxy statements, Apple is disclosing executive compensation levels for its most prominent executives, along with how it arrives at those levels. Following a relatively tough 2016 that included the first ever decline in iPhone unit sales, all executives including CEO Tim Cook saw pay reductions last year. Apple's compensation committee sets out two critical performance targets each year to gauge the company's performance, and Apple fell short for 2016. Top line and the almost-bottom line More specifically, the two targets relate to top-line revenue and operating income, which is right above the bottom line before miscellaneous income and expenses as well as taxes are taken out. For each metric, Apple sets a threshold goal that must be exceeded for executives to receive their annual cash incentives. At that threshold, the cash bonus is equal to 100% of their respective base salaries. There is also a target goal that earns them 200% payouts, as well as a maximum goal that triggers a generous 400% payout. Both revenue and operating income hit their threshold goals, but fell short of target goals. In the case of operating income, Apple only barely fell short. The company generated revenue of $215.6 billion in fiscal 2016, compared to the target goal of $223.6 billion. Operating income came in at $60 billion, just a hair shy of the target goal of $60.3 billion. Image source: 2016 proxy statement.  For context, Apple utterly hit it out of the park in 2015, exceeding its maximum goals for both metrics -- triggering those hefty 400% payouts in the process. Fiscal 2015 Performance Revenue Operating Income Threshold Goal $188 billion $52.5 billion Target Goal $199 billion $55.1 billion Maximum Goal $210 billion $56.3 billion Actual $233.7 billion $71.2 billion Data source: 2015 proxy statement. However, keep in mind that Cook got a $1 million raise to $3 million last year in terms of his base salary, which represented a 50% boost from 2015. That certainly softened the blow a bit. All told, Cook brought home $8.7 million last year, down from $10.3 million in 2015. The rest of the executive team's base salaries remained unchanged at a cool $1 million per year, although they all received $20 million equity grants in October 2015 (which is part of fiscal 2016). It's all relative Many of the equity grants that Apple executives receive are performance-based, being tied to how Apple shares perform relative to the S&P 500. This is measured in relative total stock return (TSR). In a shareholder-friendly move a couple years ago, Cook chose to voluntarily modify his 2011 CEO grant to swap out time-based shares for performance-based RSUs. A year ago, I noted that Cook was facing a deadline in August 2016 and had a lot to lose if Apple continued to lag the broader market. Fortunately for Cook, shares bounced back and Apple's relative TSR scored well enough (78th percentile) for 280,000 RSUs to vest, the maximum allowed. For the rest of the executive team and their October 2015 grants, here are the necessary relative TSR tiers and respective payouts. Relative TSR vs. S&P 500 Companies Performance-based RSU Vesting as % of Target 85th or above 200% 55th 100% 25th 25% Below 25th 0% Data source: 2016 proxy statement. As of the beginning of 2017, three executives had shares vest after Apple's relative TSR ranked it in the 83rd percentile. Overall, Apple's compensation practices are quite aligned with shareholder interests. Not only does management have to deliver on fundamental performance, but Apple shares also need to fare well in order for executives to claim all of their eligible performance-based RSU grants. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The latest rumor came from an ‘upstream supply chain’ that suggests the Cupertino company is ditching the aluminium back cover. Instead, it will be designed with a stainless steel forging process that brings together two reinforced glass panels supported by a metal frame. Scroll down for video  The latest rumor to hit the web comes from an ‘upstream supply chain’ that says the Cupertino company is ditching the aluminium back cover. Instead, it will be designed with a stainless steel forging process .Pictured is an iPhone 8 concept render IPHONE 8 RUMORS  Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have: - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) models - A new 'pure white' model - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  The latest rumor was first reported by Chinese newspaper DigiTimes, which revealed the new components would be ordered from Foxconn electronics US-based Jabil – firms who worked with Apple in creating the iPhone 4, reports 9To5Mac. 'The metal bezel will be made of stainless steel using a forging process to enhance its sturdiness and reduce costs and manufacturing time,' reports DigiTimes.  Other than giving the iPhone 8 a sleeker design, this move will ensure the glass panels in the front and back hold together. And it should decrease costs by 30 percent to 50 percent. Using stainless steel could send the iPhone 8 back in time, as this metal alloy was originally used on the iPhone 4 variants. However, it would also mean that this will be one of Apple's strongest smartphones yet. This speculation is consistent with a major rumor – the iPhone could feature a curved OLED, which lets Apple include an edge-to-edge screen.

Share this article Share 123 shares Aside from the rumors regarding the iPhone 8's body design, Apple received a new patent that also points to an edge-to-edge screen. The patent, titled ‘Electronic devices having displays with openings’ describes a method that places electronic components – such as cameras and speakers – underneath the screen. The patent, titled ‘Electronic devices having displays with openings’ describes a method that places electronic components – such as cameras and speakers – underneath the screen. The openings would be so small they would be ‘imperceptible to the human eye’ According to AppleInsider, the openings on the screen would be so small they would be ‘imperceptible to the human eye’ – resulting in a ‘true edge-to-edge screen’. This setup would also make it possible to add in various sensors inside of the phone that could transmit information across the display. ‘An electronic component may be mounted in alignment with the one or more openings in the display,’ reads the patent filed in February 2015. ‘Signals associated with the electronic component may pass through the openings.’ Apple could be moving forward with this design, as the firm is up against other smartphone makers to design the thinnest and compact smartphone. And the best way to do this is to remove all of the features from the outer areas and hide them underneath the screen ‘The signals may include acoustic signals, electromagnetic signals such as radio-frequency electromagnetic signals, and light.  ‘The electronic component may be a structure that uses light such as a camera, a light sensor, a light-based proximity sensor, a status indicator light, a light-based touch sensor array, or a secondary display that has display pixels that may be viewed through the openings.’ Apple could be moving forward with this design, as the firm is up against other smartphone makers to design the thinnest and compact smartphone.

This will allow for an edge-to-edge screen, which is another rumor that has been floating around the web (pictured are artists impressions of the iPhone 8) Just a month after the iPhone 7 hit the market, rumors began circulating about what to expect in 2017. One of these speculations was the handset could feature an all-glass casing. Experts say that the transition from metal to glass casing is key if Apple is to introduce a wireless charging feature in its next iPhone. The rumours were obtained by MacRumours, and come from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities. Mr Kuo is uncertain whether a wireless charger will be bundled with all new iPhones, but is convinced that the feature will appear in the iPhone 8. A metal alloy phone casing could potentially cause wireless charging speeds to be reduced, which is why a glass chassis could be used instead. iOS users may have also heard that there could be three iPhone 8 smartphones to choose from this year – oppose to the traditional two Apple releases every year. IPHONE 7 IN JET WHITE?  When Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 in September, its brand new 'jet black' design sold out in a matter of hours. But it appears that a new 'jet white' version could soon be hitting stores. A video has emerged online which hints at what the white version could look like, if Apple does release such a device. Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7? pic.twitter.com/pHoDiZ63ON— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 27, 2016 Reports of a new white version first appeared in November, when Japanese site, Mac Otakara, suggested that Apple would add a sixth color option to its iPhone 7 line-up. Sources speaking to the website said: 'Apple seems to have a plan to add a pure white model to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus.' The website cited the source as a 'supplier'. 'But this information may be unreliable,' the site added. While no official 'jet white' iPhone has emerged yet, a video has appeared on Twitter which hints at what the device may look like. The post, by Sonny Dickson, a technology leaking site, says: 'Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7?' alongside a video showing an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus, both with white casings.  According to Nikkei, there will be one premium model with a curved edge-to-edge OLED display alongside two models that have standard LCD displays. Citing a supply chain source, Nikkei says Apple will release the three iPhones in the following sizes: 5.5 inches, 5 inches, and 4.7 inches. 'Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones, and Biel and Lens are likely to be providing all the glass backs for the new iPhones next year,' the source said. All three iPhone 8 models will use glass supplied by Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology in China for both the front and back, However, these rumors say all three of them will be held together with an aluminum frame.    Read more: Apple new iPhone to use forging process for stainless steel frame; adding Jabil as supplier New report supports glass design for iPhone 8, with iPhone 4-style stainless steel frame | 9to5Mac Apple patent paves way for iPhone with full-face display, HUD windows Share or comment on this article e-mail 123 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Jobs introduced the first iPhone a decade ago. Jobs’ “magical product” reshaped culture, shook up industries and made it seem possible to do just about anything with a few taps on a screen while walking around with the equivalent of a computer in our pocket. — AP SAN FRANCISCO: Few people realized it at the time, but the world shifted fundamentally a decade ago when Steve Jobs pulled the first iPhone from Apple’s bag of technological tricks. “Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything,” Jobs declared as he paced across a San Francisco stage. It obviously wasn’t an empty boast. We all know now that Jobs’ “magical product” has reshaped culture, shaken up industries, put computers in billions of pockets and made it possible to do just about anything with a few taps on a screen. Besides its then 3.5-inch touch screen, the first iPhone featured a browser for on-the-go web surfing and built-in apps to check email and get directions. GOING MOBILE Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since its debut, spawning millions of mobile applications and prodding other technology companies to make similar smartphones that have become like phantom limbs for many of us. We use iPhones and their copycats to instantly share video and pictures with friends and family from almost anywhere. We use them to figure out where we are going. We use them to find the best deals while shopping in stores and to pay for stuff at the checkout stand. We use the phones to a hail ride, to tune instruments, to monitor our health and help find our next jobs. Phones have gotten so smart that they even talk back to us via helpful digital concierges such as the iPhone’s Siri and the recently introduced Assistant on Google’s Pixel phone. “IPhone is an essential part of our customers’ lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live,” Apple’s current CEO, Tim Cook, boasted in a retrospective that the Cupertino, California, company posted on its website. ROADKILL IN ITS WAKE The iPhone’s revolutionary touch screen doomed the BlackBerry, another once-popular internet-connected phone. Mobile phones and their tablet cousins triggered a downturn in personal computer sales that is still unfolding. An estimated 219 million desktop and laptop computers shipped worldwide last year, down from 264 million in 2007, according to the research firm Gartner Inc. Meanwhile, nearly 1.9 billion mobile phones shipped last year, up from 1.15 billion in 2007. All told, Gartner estimates about 5 billion mobile phones are currently in use around the world compared to 1.3 billion PCs. The eroding popularity of PCs spurred shake-ups at powerful tech companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, none of which adapted nimbly to the mobile world unleashed by the iPhone. Then-Microsoft’s CEO Steve Ballmer scoffed at Apple’s glass-and-metal gadget, telling USA Today in April 2007 that “there’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.  No chance.” Microsoft wound up squandering the $7.6 billion that it spent to buy phone maker Nokia in a futile attempt to catch up to the iPhone. Ballmer stepped down as CEO three years ago and was replaced by Satya Nadella, who introduced versions of Microsoft’s popular Office programs that worked on Apple’s iPad – a tablet based on the iPhone. A HUGE HIT … AND THEN A STALL The iPhone’s success helped make Jobs a revered figure for many, and one whose October 2011 death was mourned around the world. The device has established Apple as the world’s most profitable company with earnings of $45.7 billion on sales of $216 billion during its latest fiscal year. (Prior to the iPhone’s release, Apple posted an annual profit of $2 billion on sales of $19.3 billion.) Its stock-market value is hovering around $635 billion, thanks to a split-adjusted stock price that’s risen by nearly a factor of 10 since the iPhone’s debut. Lately, though, the iPhone appears to be losing some steam. People are keeping older models for longer before upgrading or switching over to competing phones that run on Google’s Android software. Apple suffered its first-ever decline in iPhone sales in its last fiscal year, causing the company to miss its revenue projections and hitting Cook with a 15 percent pay cut . Most smartphones now run on Android, partly because Google gives away the software.  That has helped iPhone rivals woo price conscious consumers, especially outside the US, with phones that are much cheaper than the iPhone, whose latest models now cost more than $649 to $849. In his statement, though, Cook promised the iPhone is “just getting started. The best is yet to come.” -AP This article was published on 10/01/2017 Most Read Human Rights Watch's World Report 2017: Kuwait Kuwait marks 11th anniversary of Sheikh Jaber's passing Ministry questions gay sex video's authenticity Kuwait’s domestic labor law: One year later Construction of new airport terminal on schedule: MPW 15th Jan Accident mystery solved; bedoon held for murder Horeca Kuwait 2017 kicks off tomorrow 14th Jan Inauspicious Predictions Business Cartoon E-Paper Health Kuwait Legal Clinic Lifestyle Opinion Sports Technology Top Stories World About Us Contact Us Rate card 2016 RSS © 2017, ↑ Kuwait Times

Drones that automatically follow you around. Self-driving cars. A TV as thin as a credit card. But while most of the show is about looking forward to what’s next in tech, I had a lot of trouble staying in the present. I’m in the market for a new laptop, and I was hoping the biggest showcase of gadgets in the world would give me some good guidance. Unfortunately, I left the show disappointed. As a Mac user since 2004, I had high hopes last fall for Apple’s redesigned MacBook Pro. I still think it’s probably the best laptop around, but not without some serious caveats, most notably its battery life issues. After giving it some more thought, I decided that was a dealbreaker and my search continued. Hollis Johnson/Business InsiderThe new MacBook Pro’s battery life problems turned out to be a deal breaker. I’d still like to avoid making the jump to Windows or one of Google’s Chromebooks, but the rest of the MacBook lineup is horribly flawed. The MacBook Air is great, but it still has that old, low-resolution screen and the same basic design from over six years ago. Ouch. Then there’s the newer, super-thin MacBook. While I’m in love with the design and ultra-portability, it’s slightly underpowered for my needs, and I’m not confident it will last me more than a couple of years before I need to upgrade again. I just don’t feel confident buying a new MacBook today. So, what else is there? I suddenly find myself Windows-curious. After a disastrous run with Windows 8, Microsoft has redeemed itself with Windows 10, which finally feels like a mature operating system and an enticing alternative for Mac lovers like me. Over the last year, laptops running Windows 10 feel a step ahead of what we’re seeing in the MacBooks. Touchscreens. Thoughtful, opinionated designs. And plenty of power under the hood. The MacBook Pro’s new Touch Bar has some clever uses, but it falls short of what’s possible with a full touchscreen. (Apple remains steadfast in its position that laptops shouldn’t have touchscreens.) Business Insider/Jeff DunnThe new Dell XPS looks interesting, but it doesn’t have enough power. But even the newest Windows 10 laptops don’t cut it for me. Dell introduced a new version of its XPS 13 laptop with a touchscreen that folds over into a tablet mode, but like the MacBook, it doesn’t have enough power for me. I’m intrigued by HP’s Spectre laptops, but the design doesn’t exactly blow me away. Same with the latest stuff from Lenovo. I’ve also been testing Microsoft’s latest Surface Book, which seems like the best of the bunch to me, except I’m not wild about the detachable screen. Plus there are still a few quirks with Windows 10 that bother me, like the lack of touch-friendly tablet apps. What about Chromebooks? Chromebooks are the wild card. They’re great for doing just about everything you want to do on a computer, but still have some limitations when it comes to running traditional apps. Samsung had the biggest Chromebook announcement of CES, releasing two touchscreen models that can run Android apps. But Chromebooks and ChromeOS, Google’s operating system for these laptops, are in a weird transition period right now. Google is gearing up to radically change ChromeOS and merge it with Android into one super operating system for laptops, codenamed “Andromeda.” As enticing as some Chromebooks may be, I think it’s worth waiting to see what Google announces this fall before investing in a Chromebook. Business Insider/Jeff DunnSamsung’s newest Chromebook. What now? Buying a laptop used to be relatively easy. As a Mac loyalist, I’d just get the best MacBook and be good to go for several years. But that won’t work today. There are too many compromises with every model in the MacBook lineup, and I can’t buy any of them with confidence. Making the leap to a new platform like Windows or ChromeOS comes with its own problems. ChromeOS is still half-baked and it will be several months before we see Google’s grand vision for it. And while some Windows 10 laptops are intriguing, there’s no perfect laptop, and it’s going to be a while before we get some more options. For now, the hunt continues.

The book is available to purchase now through Apple.com and also through some of its retail stores. The countries getting access to the book today join Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US where the book launched initially late last year. In addition to being available online through Apple.com, the company is also selling it in select retail locations where available. The hardbound book is available in two sizes— a 10.2 x 12.8-inch edition that sells for $199 US, and a larger 13 x 16.3-inch version that sells for $299 US— and features 450 photographs of Apple products from older Macs to new product lines including iPhone, iPod and Apple Watch. And the book itself was created by Jony Ive and his design team at Apple responsible for many of the products it highlights. The company released the video below detailing the book’s creation, which it notes is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with silver edges. With the book appearing to be somewhat of a passion project for Apple and the design team, it’s unclear if it will be a limited release or how long the company plans to produce and sell it directly to customers.

The outlet expectedly blames “lukewarm demand” from Foxconn’s biggest client Apple and the “saturated smartphone market” for the 2.81 percent drop in annual sales. For context, Foxconn earns more than half of its revenue from doing business with Apple. The Taiwanese company is also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry and assembles iPhones and other gadgets like PlayStation consoles, notebooks, wearable devices and so forth on a mass scale. It isn’t all bad news for Foxconn. For instance, “robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus” along with orders for the approaching Chinese New Year holidays have helped Foxconn report a 9.76 percent rise in December 2016 revenue. Foxconn’s total revenue in 2016 was 4.356 trillion New Taiwan dollars, or about $136 billion. Given Foxconn’s reliance on orders from Apple, it’s not surprising the manufacturer was unable to increase revenue and profits from 2015. Location of Foxconn’s “iPhone City” in Zhengzhou, a province in northern China. Apple, too, is experiencing a revenue decline of its own amid iPhone’s first-ever annual drop in sales since its inception ten years ago. Analyst Vincent Chen estimates that 207 million iPhones shipped this year versus 236 million shipments in 2015. Foxconn’s 2017 revenue should grow 5-10 percent due to the next iPhone. Dubbed by the media Tenth Anniversary iPhone, the device is widely expected to pack in a buck of slick technologies and provide a seamless edge-to-edge appearance, curved OLED screen, all-new industrial design with glass front and back, wireless charging and more. Apple’s patent calls for hiding components behind iPhone’s display assembly. One of Apple’s OLED suppliers for the device should be Sharp. Acquired by Foxconn earlier this year, Sharp is reportedly gearing up to set up an OLED production line at Foxconn’s massive iPhone manufacturing facility. Foxconn also continues to replace assembly line workers with sophisticated industrial robots in order to reduce manufacturing costs and increase efficiency. Plus, it’s been attempting to diversify its businesses for quite some time now to countering the evident downturn in the global smartphone market. On top of all this, it is no secret that iPhone 6s wasn’t as successful as Apple hoped it would be. Taking it all in, it’s understandable that Foxconn’s bottom line is now affected. Pegatron, another contract manufacturer which mainly assembles 4.7-inch iPhone 7 models, saw its December revenue dip 27.43 percent from a year ago. Should iPhone 8 prove a hit, I’m expecting its manufacturers Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron to report a rise in 2017 earnings. On the other hand, any revenue boost for these guys stemming from iPhone 8 launch may not be huge, at least not initially. That’s because Foxconn will cope with increased costs associated with major factory retooling and production processes stemming from iPhone 8’s all-new glass design, OLED screen and adoption of other new technologies. Which is to say, yield issues are to be expected as Foxconn most likely won’t be able to ramp up iPhone 8 production quickly enough to meet the expected pent-up demand for a brand new iPhone design.

Apple has found suppliers for a design featuring two reinforced glass panes connected by stainless steel forging in the middle, technology blog DigiTimes reported on Tuesday. The design, supplied by Foxconn and Jabil Circuit, would replace its conventional aluminum-backed iPhone chassis, Digitimes reported. To be sure, Apple is tight-lipped about its future products, and rarely gives hints at its future plans. Indeed, a report from The Wall Street Journal in late November indicated that Apple may be considering up to 10 prototypes of its next iPhone. Still, a glass iPhone has been widely speculated to be a possibility for the company. Here are some reasons that have been tossed around. Visual appeal Glass is shiny and commonly mass-produced — and that could help extend the popular glossy look of the iPhone 7 Plus to all colors of the iPhone lineup, top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities wrote in September, according to 9to5Mac. Apple's new "jet black" finish," debuted in September, was billed by Apple's design chief as "seamless from the glass to the back" and the flashy color sold out of initial quantities before it even hit stores. But the finish also has a special manufacturing process and scratches easily, compared to glass. Pressure to innovate Wall Street is betting that Apple will bounce back from its sluggish 2016 iPhone sales. Analysts from Nomura, Credit Suisse and others have predicted a revolutionary new iPhone will spur a "supercycle" for the company. In May, Pacific Crest analysts wrote that "differentiation" of iPhones through marketing and a glass-like appearance "are more sustainable differentiators than technology, in our view, because they appeal to consumers' vanity and desire for status." More screen space and shapes Thanks to innovations in screen technology, phones can now have wraparound screens, like the OLED screens used by the Samsung Galaxy Edge series. Several reports have indicated that Apple may move toward these more colorful screens. Samsung and Apple may eventually move to new form factors like scrolls, or foldable devices, and may experiment with different shapes, wrote Gene Munster, now a venture capitalist but then a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. Glass could help accommodate new shapes and provide a clear casing for a wraparound screen. A push toward augmented reality Apple CEO Tim Cook has already indicated his interest in augmented reality. Glass is see-through — which means a glass iPhone could potentially have transparent panels to augment reality, in combination with some of Apple's new camera technology. This idea may seem out there, but Apple has already patented covers that leave both the front and back panels of an iPhone exposed. show chapters CNBC puts the first-generation iPhone to the test    Monday, 9 Jan 2017 | 8:09 PM ET | 01:35 Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change IGM --- AAPL --- Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous    To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Lattner made the earliest versions of Swift in 2010. By Jake Smith for iGeneration | January 10, 2017 -- 20:40 GMT (12:40 PST) | Topic: Mobility (Image: File photo) Chris Lattner, creator and head of Apple's new Swift programming language, announced on Tuesday he's leaving the company for an unspecified new venture. ​Java and JavaScript rule but use of Apple's Swift language skyrockets Just a few months after Apple released Swift for iOS, the language has become one of the most popular for developers. Read More Swift was launched at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in 2014. As noted by Daring Fireball, Lattner developed the earliest versions of Swift by himself in 2010. Past Swift, Lattner was also responsible for leading Xcode at Apple. "Working with many phenomenal teams at Apple to launch Swift has been a unique life experience," Lattner wrote in a statement. "Apple is a truly amazing place to be able to assemble the skills, imagination, and discipline to pull something like this off." Ted Kremenek, currently a senior manager at Apple, will be taking over as "Project Lead" for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org, said Lattner. "Swift is in great shape today, and Swift 4 will be a really strong release with Ted as the Project Lead," Lattner continued. Lattner is headed to Tesla to serve as vice president of Autopilot. Developers are in mid-migration to Swift. According to Stack Overflow research, Swift is the second most-loved programming language, behind Mozilla's Swift, for the second year in a row. In related Apple news, TechCrunch reported Tuesday that Daniel Gross of Apple's machine learning division will leave the company for Y Combinator. CES 2017: The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops...

Business Segment This segment is not only growing rapidly, but it also accounts for a much larger portion of Apple's total sales than it did a year ago. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 10, 2017 at 2:01PM When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports its results for its first fiscal quarter of 2017 on Jan. 31, many investors will likely turn immediately to iPhone sales. After all, the important product accounts for a whopping 60% of its revenue. Investors, however, shouldn't overlook Apple's services segment. As the tech giant's second-largest and fastest-growing product segment, it is crucial to its business. Apple's services revenue is increasing, driven primarily by soaring App Store revenue. Image source: Apple. A bright spot amid growth challenges In Apple's fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, the services segment stood out as an exception to the rest of the company's product segments' flat or declining sales. Its services revenue, which includes revenue from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services, increased an impressive 24% year over year. Meanwhile, revenue for the iPhone, Mac, and other product segments declined, and iPad revenue was flat year over year. CEO Tim Cook was particularly pleased with the company's record-setting services revenue during the quarter. "App Store revenue continued to skyrocket, while Music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music," he said. He also noted that Apple is seeing "very strong growth in transaction volume through Apple Pay."  Going forward, Cook explained the high expectations for the segment: We remain very confident about the future of our Services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last 4 years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017. What would it look like for its services segment to be the size of a Fortune 100 company? Currently, the company with the lowest revenue on Fortune's top 100 list of companies has annual revenue of $28 billion -- about $4 billion more than Apple's services revenue in fiscal 2016. So, Apple believes its fiscal 2017 services revenue will exceed $28 billion. Impressively, beyond being Apple's only segment that grew in the fiscal fourth quarter, the segment also posted a meaningfully higher growth rate than it did in the quarter before it. Fourth-quarter services revenue increased 24% year over year. This is up from 19% growth in Q3 and 20% growth in Q2. To help drive greater interest to its streaming music service, Apple overhauled the design of its Music app in 2016. Image source: Apple. What to expect from services in Q1 For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, it's likely Apple can at least maintain its current 24% year-over-year growth in services revenue. CFO Luca Maestri said the company's App Store growth rate has accelerated for five consecutive quarters, hitting a rate of 43% year over year in the company's September-ended fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Furthermore, Maestri emphasized that its services growth isn't just coming from the App Store. It's "several categories that are growing very well for us," Maestri said. With these optimistic trends in mind, the overall service segment should continue to grow robustly. At about 13.5% of Apple's total revenue (up from 9.9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter), and considering the segment's recent rapid growth, the services segment is more important than ever for the company, especially as Apple's other product segments struggle to grow.

The product-review magazine in December confirmed what MacBook Pro owners had been complaining about since November, when new versions of the laptop became available. Consumer Reports said tests on three different models showed inconsistent battery life. As we reported then, some customers had complained about batteries running down in as little as three hours instead of Apple’s promised 10 hours. Apple told Consumer Reports, which has written about the fix, that the magazine’s tests triggered a bug in Safari. “We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache…. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test,” Apple told the magazine, adding that “this is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage.” Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president for worldwide marketing, tweeted in December that Consumer Reports’ “results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.” The magazine says it is now doing some retesting of the MacBook Pro and will be reporting its findings at a later date. It explains that its tests of laptops by different manufacturers are done in a comparable way, and that “we look to control as many variables as possible.”   Photo: Photographers take pictures of the new Apple MacBook during a product launch event Oct. 27, 2016 in Cupertino.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple to expand manufacturing of servers in Arizona By George Avalos / January 10, 2017 at 11:48 AM Apple plans to expand manufacturing at a facility in an Arizona foreign-trade zone, making more servers there to supply its data centers in the Bay Area and across the United States, it said in a new regulatory filing. The expansion plan in the foreign-trade zone in Mesa, Arizona could reduce its production costs for the servers. Foreign-trade zones provide relief from, or reductions for, tariffs and taxes that a company normally would pay to bring into the United States items or components manufactured in other countries. “Production under foreign-trade zone procedures could exempt Apple from customs duty payments,” on a variety of materials and components that would be used in the server assembly, Apple said in its federal register filing. Apple intends to broaden its operations for final assembly of servers at the command center in Mesa. Previously, the tech firm had assembled the servers at each of its four data centers, which are located in the East Bay city of Newark; Prineville, Oregon; Maiden, North Carolina; and Reno, Nevada. Apple uses these data centers to ensure that numerous Apple products and services operate properly, including iCloud, Apple Music, Siri and other well-known consumer services, the company said Tuesday. The Cupertino-based company’s new filing is an application to renew its ability to operate in Arizona’s foreign-trade zone. It first obtained that permission when it took ownership of the manufacturing complex from former Apple supplier GT Advanced Technologies. Apple had previously said the Arizona complex would serve as a command center for its data facilities. But the new filing filled in some details, saying the Mesa manufacturing site will handle numerous materials and components. It said the dozens of items that could qualify for duty-free, or low duty fees, include: electric motors, printed circuit board assemblies, magnets, lithium batteries, routers and network switches, microphones, CDs, software, solid state drives, semiconductor media, monitors, electronic circuits, server rack rails, along with tape and plastic bags. “Apple Inc. has re-purposed the site as a global data command center that will conduct high-tech manufacturing of finished data center cabinets for other data centers,” the city of Mesa stated in a document it filed in June.   Photo illustration: An iPhone held up in front of the Apple logo.

As of this month, Apple's websites and retail stores in the following countries carry the book: Canada, Brazil, Singapore, New Zealand, and Ireland. Introduced in November, "Designed by Apple in California," showcases 20 years of Apple products, highlighting Macs, iPhones, iPods, iPads, and accessories released between 1998 and 2015. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The book is text-free, featuring 450 large, high-quality images of Apple products, highlighting the company's design process. Apple says it took eight years to design the book, which features specially milled custom-dyed paper with "gilded matte silver edges" and low-ghost ink. Because "Designed by Apple in California" is positioned as an art book, it costs $200 for the small version and $300 for the large version in the United States. Prices are higher in other countries like Brazil due to import taxes and other fees. Update: Apple has released the book in even more countries, including Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, and Norway.

Glad to see it's being made available more widely. I'm sure this book would be a fascinating read. But I can't just justify the price tag on this.

Photo: Sunseap mail print View all comments Tweet By Siau Ming En - siaumingen@mediacorp.com.sg - Published: 4:00 AM, January 11, 2017 Updated: 6:16 AM, January 11, 2017 SINGAPORE — Solar energy retailer Sun Electric has taken Sunseap, believed to be the biggest market player in the solar industry here, to court over a patent infringement related to an aggregation and metering system used at tech giant Apple’s facilities here. Sunseap, however, has responded by challenging the validity of the patent, and countersuing Sun Electric. The patent suit stems from a landmark contract between Sunseap Group and Apple last year, where the solar firm would supply Apple with clean energy, making the latter the first firm in Singapore to be fully powered by renewable energy. Part of the energy comes from the solar panels installed on the rooftop of Apple’s Ang Mo Kio office, while the rest comes from offsite solar energy that is harnessed from multiple sites installed with solar systems. Sunseap currently installs and manages solar photovoltaic systems on the rooftops of more than 800 government, residential, commercial and industrial buildings. According to Sunseap, it currently has about 80 megawatts of built solar capacity, or about 70 per cent of the market share. In court documents obtained by TODAY, Sun Electric claimed that Sunseap was using meters that measure the amount of electricity imported from the national grid to these buildings, and the solar energy exported by these buildings to the grid, among others. The meters installed at Apple’s facilities at Knightsbridge mall and Ang Mo Kio also determine the tech firm’s power consumption. Sun Electric claimed that these meters infringed its meter patent, and asked for unspecified costs. In its defence, Sunseap argued that Sun Electric’s patent was invalid and has also countersued, noting that the latter’s threats had affected Sunseap’s chances of landing new contracts. Sunseap noted that in its agreement with Apple, it supplies energy to the tech firm by buying electricity from the National Electricity Markets of Singapore, and resells it at agreed tariff rates. Sunseap claimed that it neither owns nor operates a meter that measures power imported from, or exported to, the national grid. It also does not own or operate a consolidation unit to determine the solar power supplied by the buildings to the grid. Instead, it is informed of the amount of solar energy supplied by the buildings to the grid through a third-party provider such as SP Services, Sunseap said in its defence. In its counter-suit, Sunseap noted that Sun Electric had made threats of infringement proceedings to the former’s clients and potential customers. Citing a tender called by Keppel Infrastructure Holdings around last August, Sunseap said that it was initially awarded the project. But before the details of the project could be finalised, Sun Electric’s chief executive officer Matthew Peloso allegedly told Keppel that Sunseap had infringed his company’s patent, and that the tender award would be vulnerable, claimed Sunseap. This led to Keppel eventually deciding not to award the tender to Sunseap. Sunseap, in its counter-suit, also claimed that Sun Electric had committed the “tort of unlawful interference with trade”, including defaming Sunseap’s subsidiaries by making and publishing statements that were “calculated to disparate the plaintiffs”. The resulting losses included loss of contracts from existing and potential customers, and damage to its reputation and market standing, Sunseap added. In response to TODAY’s queries, Dr Peloso noted that Sun Electric’s lawyers are examining the counter-suit and will be filing an appropriate defence in due course. On the patent suit against Sunseap, he added: “We are confident of our position. We continue to press on with our research projects in Singapore, which have already yielded several additional patent applications in Singapore.” Separately, Sunseap founder Frank Phuan said: “We are confident that there is no merit in Sun Electric’s claims. We will be defending the claim vigorously, and will also look to Sun Electric for all damage caused to us.” mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Singapore READ COMMENTED “Good progress” made in containing oil spillage after recent collisions “Bedding-in” period of several months to be expected for DTL2: Khaw ‘You have made Singapore very proud today’: PM Lee to Yip Pin Xiu ‘Wrecked dorm’ videos an isolated incident: SCDF ‘Wind corridors’ for future Marina South residents Works of art to help fight works of crime Warmer, drier weather in S’pore over the weekend Universal design should leave nobody out, says disabled architect Two new High Court judges appointed Two cases of strollers dislodging escalator steps since last year: BCA TODAY's morning briefing for Jan 16 TODAY's morning briefing for Jan 13 TODAY's morning briefing for Jan 11 TODAY's morning briefing for Jan 10 TODAY's morning brief for Jan 9 Inside Today World Malaysia may ban ‘kap chai’ motorcycles from KL roads Turkish Airlines cargo jet crash kills 16 in Kyrgyzstan South Korea political crisis escalates as Samsung chief awaits fate Japan firm under investigation after suicide of employee who worked 200 hours of overtime a month Trump says NATO is obsolete but still 'very important to me' Business Australia government, Alcoa say making progress in aluminum smelter talks Asia banks seeking tech hires over `rock-star’ bankers this year Japan firm under investigation after suicide of employee who worked 200 hours of overtime a month Samsung Electronics probe finds battery was main cause of Note 7 fires: source Luxottica, Essilor in 46 billion euro merger deal to create eyewear giant: sources Sports High-flying pro wrestling star Jimmy ‘Superfly’ Snuka dies at 73 Ibrahimovic's late goal earns Manchester United 1-1 draw vs Liverpool Meet Nicol David, the Serena Williams of women's squash Nadal determined to fight against the pain Williams seeks Grand Slam greatness at Australian Open Entertainment 2016 was a bad year for celebrity deaths, by these measures High-flying pro wrestling star Jimmy ‘Superfly’ Snuka dies at 73 It’s curtains for ‘World’s Greatest Show’ after 146 years No plans to digitise Fisher in future Star Wars films Artwalk pays homage to Little India’s heritage About TODAY Apps RSS Sitemap Syndication Contact Us Advertise with Us Terms & Conditions About MediaCorp Copyright 2017 © Mediacorp Press Ltd.

Apple Image: Yan bo - Imaginechina/ap By Lance Ulanoff2017-01-10 19:46:02 UTC Analysis Apple will do something with Augmented Reality. That’s not rumor or innuendo. Apple CEO Tim Cook repeatedly expressed his strong interest in the technology over the more isolating virtual reality over the last 12 months. Apple  acquired an AR company over a year ago. And 2017 promises to be a very big year for the iPhone. Why wouldn’t Apple bring its own brand of mixed reality to its flagship product? That all makes sense. Robert Scoble’s report does not. SEE ALSO: These are the iPhone 8 rumors you need to know Scoble is a tech industry expert and veteran who knows everyone and, as of late, has been nestled deep in the world of virtual reality. Like me, he was at CES in early January looking for new and inspiring technologies. When you walk the floor, go to parties and rub elbows with old contacts, you hear things. Scoble heard something a few days ago. A little tech birdie at the Carl Zeiss booth sidled up to him and whispered (yes, I’m guessing here), “We’re working with Apple…APPLE!...on a pair of augmented reality glasses."  As Scoble reported on Monday: “A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year. (I thought it was next year but now that I saw this I believe it will happen this year). I hear Meta is getting ready to announce same with Lumus, the optic folks. And that explains why there was no augmented reality in Zeiss's booth even though it was right in the middle of the AR area.” It’s the hottest scoop since, well, the last time Scoble wrote that Apple was working with the highly-regarded optics company on AR. Back then, he cited two unnamed sources. Now it’s one unnamed Zeiss employee (who soon may no longer be one if he did, in fact, spill the beans.). Apple is not speaking on the record about this. Nor is Carl Zeiss. I contacted both for comment.  Even so, there's a host of problems with this theory. The primary one being that I just don’t think Apple wants to build Google Glass 2.0. AR on the radar When I spoke to industry experts last year about Apple’s 2017, Augmented Reality was high on the list of possibilities. Creative Strategies president and long-time Apple watcher Tim Bajarin confirmed that Apple “has a lot of work going on in this space.” Bajarin, though, was less certain about whether 2017 would be the year of product delivery or simply one where they, say, signal their AR intentions at the World Wide Developers Conference in June. Gartner analyst Brian Blau was even more bearish on the prospects of Apple AR and VR. telling me last year that the market was still too unsettled to deliver the kind of “mass market volumes” Apple prefers. When I spoke to Blau via email on Tuesday about this new report, he told me he has no doubt Apple is working on some kind of future AR technology. However, he was less confident in Scoble’s story and was surprised that a Zeiss employee would just let that kind of info slip on the show floor. “I don’t think Robert is being untruthful, but [it] sure seems like what he has is information that is out of context enough that we don’t know if this is a real effort at Apple now or one that is on their pathway to something real in the future,” wrote Blau. The new thing and the wrong place It’s obvious what’s happening here. Augmented Reality is the new thing, that thing that Apple is definitely hot on and that, when they do build it, will completely disrupt one or more industries. Previous new things include TVs and cars. No one believes Apple is going to build a TV anymore and confidence is waning in Apple Cars, as well. AR, though, is a much surer thing. However, since it’s sort of stateless – AR can be applied to any number of existing pieces of hardware and software – people are spinning interesting and increasingly wild ideas for Apple’s AR implementation. A pair of Apple AR glasses is the wildest of them all.  Here’s what Apple does well: It watches competitors try and sometimes succeed, but more often fail, to introduce new categories, products and technologies. It cherry picks others' good ideas and marries them with its own. It waits for a market or market demand to ripen and then strikes. It is rarely, if ever, too early to a market. The closest Apple ever came to doing that, at least in recent years, was the Apple Watch. That, too, arrived long after the dust had settled on a wave of uninteresting Android Wear devices, but the market interest for smart watches was still comparably small. We still don’t know how many Apple Watches Apple has sold, but it has risen to the #2 spot on the luxury watch market. Apple AR Glasses won't find much support within Apple, either. In a 2015 New Yorker interview, Apple Chief Design Office Jony Ive was highly critical of Google Glass: When he later saw Google Glass, Ive said, it was evident to him that the face “was the wrong place.” Cook said, “We always thought that glasses were not a smart move, from a point of view that people would not really want to wear them. They were intrusive, instead of pushing technology to the background, as we’ve always believed.” He went on, “We always thought it would flop, and, you know, so far it has.”  AR is everywhere and was the belle of the ball at CES, but there was no killer app or single product that signaled a shift in the AR universe. People know mixed and augmented reality has real potential, but consumers are just wrapping their heads around the idea of virtual reality (which had a strong holiday season and should have a stellar 2017). Apple’s choices I think Robert Scoble is right about one thing: 2017 will be the year we see Apple AR in a product. It just won’t be glasses. Here are the best bets: The iPhone 8 A splashy new Apple product that transforms your mundane world when you put it on your face sounds exciting. The problem is that it’s not using the interface Apple cares about most. Apple’s AR will be an iPhone affair. Here’s why: Ten years after the introduction of the first iPhone, Apple is planning something big. It still believes its flagship product and one of the world’s most popular smartphones is the center of our tech universe.  In a recent interview, Apple Worldwide Marketing Manager Phil Schiller reminded Back Channels’ Steve Levy that the iPhone screen is still king, “People are forgetting the value and importance of the display,” he told Levy, “Some of the greatest innovations on iPhone over the last ten years have been in display.” Apple would also cringe at the thought of delivering sub-par AR. Google Glass wasn’t truly augmented reality. There was simply a translucent display virtually floating in front of your face. The device did not interact with the real world. Why? Because it’s almost impossible to squeeze the necessary AR technology inside a device as small as Google Glass (the frame wrapped around your head, but the computer and battery were confined to two small compartments on the front and one on the back of the device). Microsoft’s HoloLens offers a much clearer picture of what it takes to fit consumer-grade AR inside one wearable. These are sizable goggles that require some cushion so they don’t feel uncomfortable when you wear them. The iPhone is a much, much better vehicle for Apple’s AR ambitions. The processing power is already there, the 4.7-inch (or larger) screen is large and sharp enough and there’s already an excellent camera for capturing the reality part of the equation. What Apple must add is an IR camera that can read the 3D topography of the environment, so the iPhone 8 can effectively blend artificial objects and landscapes or even information and data with the real world. Carl Zeiss, if it is in fact a partner, can provide the lens for the IR camera and/or for Apple’s latest iSight camera. Bajarin, by the way, agrees with me, though he doesn’t rule out the possibility of glasses in a distant future. “I think that AR will be a cornerstone of what they do with next generation iPhones beginning later this year," he said. "And build on that over the next few years by implementing it on an iPhone itself and where possible, add things like glasses to augment the experience. In car Apple’s plans to build an Apple Car may have gone up in smoke, but its interest in transportation is likely undiminished.  I’ve long assumed that Apple’s strongest vehicular interests reside in interfaces. What if the new iPhone uses its AR to change your perspective on the road, so you can see the name of the highway and your direction laid out in front of you? If Apple squeezes a laser projector inside the iPhone 8, it could project the AR information onto your windshield.  Wild? Yes. Unlikely? Sure, but probably more likely than Apple AR Glasses.

In fact, three news organizations sued the FBI in September for just this information. And because of that lawsuit, the agency released 100 pages of documents Friday. The problem is they're heavily censored, according to the Associated Press. The documents don't reveal who the FBI hired to hack into the phone or how much it paid that vendor. The FBI labeled those files "secret" before they were released. The iPhone was at the center of a legal back-and-forth between the government and Apple last year after the December 2015 attack that left 14 people dead. The government wanted Apple to write new software that would unlock the phone and make its data readable. Apple refused, saying that weakening the encryption would potentially leave other iPhone users at risk. Related stories How did FBI hack terrorist's iPhone?

However, the agency wouldn't disclose how the hacker got into the phone. The lawsuit against the FBI was filed by the Associated Press, Vice and Gannett, the parent of national newspaper USA Today. The three news organizations sought details about the hacker the FBI used and associated costs. The FBI reportedly refused to provide that information to the organizations under the Freedom of Information Act. In the lawsuit complaint, the news organizations argued the public has a right to know how the government spent taxpayer funds to obtain the hacking technique. They also argued the existence of a secret flaw in the iPhone could leave the public in danger. While the most critical information remains unknown, the FBI's released documents do reveal that the agency received three submissions from companies to hack into the phone and that it signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor it chose, according to the Associated Press. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is not commenting beyond what was released to the three news organizations.

For us, it’s now about accelerating and leading. I can look ahead and see the role of Sonos, with the right experiences, partners, and focus, with a healthy future. In short, the future of the home music experience and the opportunity for Sonos has never been better. Never. The Times report says MacFarlane will “remain an employee to help mentor colleagues and work on other projects” “I don’t want to be that founder who’s always second-guessing,” Mr. MacFarlane said. MacFarlane’s replacement acknowledges that Amazon Echo and Google Home have changed their wireless speaker business. “With what Amazon and Google are doing, the world has changed completely,” he said. “We’re part of that new world.” I had a chance to speak with John MacFarlane back in September 2015 when the company launched its current flagship Play:5 speaker. Before today’s leadership shift, Sonos and Apple have partnered on a number of occasions on different projects. Back in September, Apple Stores began carrying Sonos speakers for the first time both in stores and online. Apple didn’t participate in discounting Sonos products for the holidays like other retailers did, but customers buying Sonos speakers from Apple could redeem Apple Music credit. Sonos and Apple also worked together to bring Apple Music integration to Sonos speakers in late 2015 and early 2016. Sonos streams music directly over the Internet to its wireless speakers which required special support outside of Apple’s Music app and iTunes. In recent months, Sonos has also integrated directly in Spotify’s music streaming app and announced plans to integrate with Amazon Echo speakers after previously issuing a wave of layoffs and refocusing on smart home control. Sonos still requires a dedicated Controller app to work with Apple Music, but a recent app update delivered lock screen access that was previously not supported.

LLVM Founder, Swift Creator Chris Lattner Is Leaving Apple: Joins Tesla Written by Michael Larabel in Compiler on 10 January 2017 at 02:50 PM EST. 52 Comments Chris Lattner who is known most recently for starting the Swift programming language while most profoundly he is the original creator of LLVM/Clang, is leaving his job at Apple. Lattner had been the director of the Developer Tools department, including Xcode and similar compiler efforts around Swift/LLVM. Chris joined Apple in 2005 due to his work on LLVM/Clang. His wife is the president of the LLVM Foundation. Coming as a surprise today is that he's leaving Apple and no longer the Swift Project Lead, per this mailing list post. This is a big loss for Apple but will be interesting to see where he ends up next and what he's planning to tackle in the compiler space. More details when they become available. Update: Tesla has announced Chris Lattner is joining the company as VP of Autopilot Software. 52 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

However, it turns out the 'wildly unpredictable' battery life issues - anything from 3.75 hours to 19.5 hours - that prompted the damning verdict may have been caused by a bug unlikely to affect the vast majority of users. Apple is putting the issue at CR’s door, claiming the methodology used to test the MacBook Pro utilised a hidden developer setting in Safari which unearthed the bug, causing the discrepancies in battery life. Related: Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch w/ Touch Bar review In a statement, Apple said: “We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache... We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test." Consumer Reports admitted as such today, but also pointed out this is a method it uses to test all laptops, beyond those running macOS. The idea is to ensure all laptops are tested equally while web browsing, rather than certain models coincidentally benefitting from some websites being visited more than others. As for that Safari bug Apple mentioned, it has been addressed by a new beta version. Apple said: “[Consumer Reports’] use of this developer setting… triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. “After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.” Consumer Reports says it will retest the MacBook Pro and update its findings.

"You're not testing it right"... mode11 January 11, 2017, 11:10 pm It's an obscure bug in Safari whose effects are only apparent when testing in a very specific way (i.e. reloading the same page for 10 hours without letting the browser cache previously downloaded data). The bug could have been introduced at any time since MacBook Pro's were last released / tested (i.e. May 2015). Jan Mejlgaard Bliddal January 12, 2017, 9:19 am It is a case of both parties being right. When Apple says it wouldn't affect the average user then they are right. When CR says the need to turn caching off to create equal testing conditions across various platforms and models then they are right. A bug that wouldn't affect the vast majority of users was found do to the procedure, but i am pretty sure that the people who do need that setting turned on are glad it was found.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Chris Lattner, the creator of and project lead for Apple’s Swift programming language, today announced in a mailing list email that he will be leaving Apple later this month. He will be joining Tesla as the car company’s vice president of Autopilot autonomous driving software, Tesla said in a blog post. Lattner has been at Apple since 2005 and is currently senior director of the company’s development tools department, which works on, among other things, Swift, the Swift Playgrounds iPad app that teaches Swift, and the Xcode integrated development environment (IDE) inside of which developers can use Swift. He’ll be passing on the project lead role to his colleague Ted Kremenek, Apple’s senior manager of languages and runtimes. Lattner is leaving in order to “pursue an opportunity in another space,” he wrote in the email. Although he won’t be inside the company going forward, Swift is after all an open-source project, unlike its predecessor, Objective-C, and as such Lattner will be able to and in fact will keep participating, specifically as a member of the Swift core team, he wrote in the email. Still, the company is losing a key figure who has headed up the company’s most prominent open-source project in recent memory. Swift is the 24th most popular project on GitHub based on number of stars. Apple first introduced Swift in 2014 and open-sourced it in late 2015. With Swift, developers can build iOS, macOS (formerly OS X), tvOS, and watchOS apps. Lattner first started working on Swift in 2010. “I implemented much of the basic language structure, with only a few people knowing of its existence. A few other (amazing) people started contributing in earnest late in 2011, and it became a major focus for the Apple Developer Tools group in July 2013,” he wrote on his website. Swift Playgrounds became available on the App Store in September. “I hope that by making programming more approachable and fun, we’ll appeal to the next generation of programmers and to help redefine how Computer Science is taught,” he says on his website. “Swift Playgrounds for the iPad is a crucial piece of this: it uses real Swift code to teach programming fundamentals, while also providing a full featured native iOS development experience that allows access to almost the entire iOS SDK. Swift Playgrounds includes high production value assets and curriculum produced by Apple, which provides a appealing and safe introduction to programming concepts for everyone.” Before arriving at Apple, while at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Lattner started the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM), which is now part of the wider LLVM umbrella project that contains compilers and other software development tools. In 2012 Lattner, along with Vikram Adve and Evan Cheng, received the prominent ACM Software System Award for LLVM. Update at 2:01 p.m. Pacific: Added information about what Lattner will do next.

Lattner didn't give a reason for his exit, simply saying he's leaving later this month "to pursue an opportunity in another space." (We've put some feelers out and if we uncover anything interesting about his departure, we'll update this post with the details.) Lattner joined Apple in 2005 after leading the creation of another developer tool, known as "LLVM" for his PhD. LLVM was integrated into Apple's developer tools and Lattner went on to build much of Swift. Swift is Apple's language for building Mac and iOS apps. Apple released it at its Worldwide Developers Conference in 2014, and since then it has soared to become one of the most popular programming languages around. In a recent survey on Stack Overflow, a site where developers answer each others questions, Swift landed as the No. 2 most-loved language, beaten out only slightly by one called Rust (a language led by Mozilla Research). Ted Kremenek, another power player in the Swift world, will be taking over as the lead developer for Swift at Apple, but Lattner's shoes will be big ones to fill. As one person noted on Hacker News, a site where programmers chat about stuff, "He is leaving Swift in an excellent position and has set up an outstanding structure where Swift is way more than just one person. He spent more than 5 years building Swift inside Apple, so I can definitely understand he is ready for his next challenge. Can't wait to see what it is!" Other developers are also saluting him on Twitter. Chris Lattner (@clattner_llvm) was a positive force for Apple developer tools even before Swift. Good luck to him! https://t.co/ma3ZLvOzw8&mdash; Daniel Jalkut (@danielpunkass) January 10, 2017 Whoa, Chris Lattner leaving Apple?! https://t.co/ZvqAsXDQzo&mdash; Greg Heo (@gregheo) January 10, 2017 A big loss today as Apple loses Chris Lattner— Wesley Dyson (@WesleyDyson) January 10, 2017 This article was originally published on Business Insider.

A couple weeks after Consumer Reports failed to recommend the latest MacBook Pro due to inconsistent battery life, Apple has announced that it worked with the publication to identify the problem: a bug in Safari. However, if you are experiencing poor battery life with your new machine, don't assume you have the bug as well, because apparently, this is a problem mostly specific to Consumer Reports. When Consumer Reports recently experienced low and wildly inconsistent battery results on the upgraded laptops during testing, Apple stood by its advertised battery claims. But it has now discovered the results were due to a software bug that occurs in Safari’s developer mode. It affected Consumer Reports’ test, which “uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache". Apple noted most consumers don't use this setting and therefore shouldn't be impacted by the bug - nor should they be experiencing variable battery life in general. Still, after it finally found something to blame, Apple asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, and the publication told Apple that its MacBook Pro systems "consistently delivered the expected battery life". Here is Apple's full statement on the matter, which an Apple spokesperson gave to Pocket-lint:  "We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro" So, Apple is releasing a software patch. The update, which will root out the Safari bug going forward, is available to those in the Apple Beta Software program. It will be also part of a broader update released in a few weeks. Consumer Reports said it will conduct another round of battery life tests with the update installed. It will also recommend the new MacBook Pros if the battery problem is resolved. The publication explained that it had disabled caching in Safari for consistent testing across platforms. But keep in mind Pocket-lint also noticed reduced battery life of around 10 hours (compared to 12 for last year's model), and we tested the machine with normal settings.

The company only increased the screen size on the iPhone when it thought it could do it “right,” and the same can be said about increasing the number of megapixels in its iPhone cameras. The iPhone 8 might introduce a new design that is expected to incorporate some smartphone features that are already available on other devices. But Apple might do it “right” and create a smartphone that has no match. Don't Miss: Apple’s courage is driving me insane Multiple reports have been saying the same thing for months: Apple will release an all-screen, “glass sandwich” iPhone 8 that features a large OLED screen, curved edges, and a virtual home button that incorporates the fingerprint sensor. Some of these rumored features are already available on existing smartphones. The Galaxy S6 edge first introduced a dual edge design that people loved, and Samsung is the champion of OLED screens. LG, on the other hand, has been increasing the screen-to-body ratio like nobody else — well Xiaomi Mi Mix actually came out earlier this year with an even better screen-to-bezel ratio. But then there are features unavailable on any widely available smartphones, like the rumored placement of the fingerprint sensor under the display. Apple patents have already offered clues as to where the iPhone maker is heading, and the iPhone 8 might be a phone that has no match even if some of its features and design elements are found on the Galaxy S8 and other 2017 Android flagships. To come up with a device whose front side is made entirely of a functional display, Apple would have to place everything found on the front side of the phone underneath the screen. The fingerprint sensor might be the easiest thing to do (and Apple has a patent for that). And speaking of doing things right, the side volume and mute buttons might also be placed under the screen (according to this patent). But the home button is hardly the only element there. There’s also a front-facing camera, sensors, and a speaker that need to be placed on the front of a mobile device. Other companies might leave some of these must-have components as they are while trying to reduce the bezels. Here’s how Xiaomi did it – the camera is placed on the bottom bezel: xiaomi-mi-mix-bezel-thickness-1More And here’s a rumored Galaxy S8 prototype: galaxy-s8-first-photo-leakMore Read More Side bezels might be minimal in these pictures, but these phones clearly feature top and bottom bezels that still take up plenty of space. A new patent discovery further explains what doing it “right” might mean for Apple. The company is looking to place the selfie camera and all the sensors under the screen. That way, the front side would be just a massive display that would still retain all the features that are typically found to the front side of a phone. Found by Apple Insider, USPTO Patent No. 9,543,364 describes Electronic devices having displays with openings. iphone-patent-display-openings-1More The patent explores technology that would let Apple place a variety of components under the screen that you wouldn’t expect. The screen would have perforations so small that the human eye could not perceive them. Yet they would be able to accommodate a speaker or a front-facing light sensor. Even cameras, antennas, and other components could be placed under the screen. They would continue to receive input through the display without hindering any functionality. iphone-patent-display-openings-3More The openings would be formed between pixels, and that’s why an OLED screen would be preferred — it requires no backlight. The image above, from the patent, suggests the device would still have top and bottom bezels, complete with an opening on top of the display. Interestingly, the patent also mentions one other feature that’s not available on any smartphone — and this one will probably not make it to the iPhone 8. A future iPhone could incorporate a head-up display system where transparent regions in the front and back of the device would let the user see both real-world objects and virtual images on top of them. This would be a novel way to integrate AR into an iPhone. iphone-patent-display-openings-4More At the end of the day, this is still only a patent that describes technology that might not be immediately available on the iPhone 8. But this patent also seems to bring over the missing piece of the wraparound iPhone puzzle, the kind of innovation that would allow Apple to make an iPhone that’s all screen.

The findings in Greenpeace USA's report, Clicking Clean: Who is Winning the Race to Build a Green Internet? outlines the energy footprints of large data center operators and nearly 70 of the most popular websites and applications. Apple has remained among the most aggressive in the sector in its efforts to power its online platform with renewable energy. Apple continues to play an important role in opening access to renewable energy new markets where it has located its data centers, such as the company’s most recent data center in Arizona. Apple has also played a catalytic role within its IT supply chain, pushing other IT data center and cloud operators who help deliver pieces of Apple’s corner of the internet to follow their lead in powering their operations with renewable energy, though with slower success than its own data centers thus far. In a press release Greenpeace calls out Amazon and Netflix to work harder towards becoming renewably powered. "Amazon continues to talk a good game on renewables but is keeping its customers in the dark on its energy decisions. This is concerning, particularly as Amazon expands into markets served by dirty energy," said Greenpeace USA Senior IT Analyst, Gary Cook. "Like Apple, Facebook, and Google, Netflix is one of the biggest drivers of the online world and has a critical say in how it is powered. Netflix must embrace the responsibility to make sure its growth is powered by renewables, not fossil fuels and it must show its leadership here" continued Cook. Netflix has one of the largest data footprints of the companies profiled, accounting for one third of internet traffic in North America and contributing significantly to the worldwide data demand from video streaming. The company announced in 2015 that it intended to fully offset its carbon footprint, but a closer examination reveals it is likely turning to carbon offsets or unbundled renewable energy credits, which do little to increase renewable energy investment For the first time, this year's report also evaluates Asian companies including tech giants Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, and Naver, which are steadily expanding globally. The region is well behind the US market in renewable commitments, due in large part to fewer clean energy options from monopoly utilities. "Leading tech companies in the US have shown that clean power can be both good for the environment and for business. East Asian companies must step up to embrace that reality as well," said Jude Lee, Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia. Nearly 20 IT companies have committed to 100% renewable energy use now. Among all data centres evaluated, Switch - a new entry to this year's report - is making the best progress to transitioning its data center fleet to renewables through both procurement and aggressive advocacy. The IT industry's energy footprint accounted for 7% of global electricity in 2012, a number set to grow as global internet traffic increases, and even exceed 12% by 2017. Video streaming accounts for 63% of global internet traffic in 2015, and is projected to reach about 80% by 2020, according to Cisco Network Traffic Forecast, 2016.

A Zeiss employee allegedly confirmed the partnership during CES 2017 last week, Scoble said in a Facebook post. The AR glasses may be announced as soon as this year, according to Scoble. His post says: “Exclusive news: Apple and Zeiss working together on augmented reality optics. A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year. (I thought it was next year but now that I saw this I believe it will happen this year).” Related Stories Apple Could Release MacBook Pro With IGZO Panels This Year iPhone 10 Year Anniversary: Relive Steve Jobs' Captivating 2007 Presentation It seems like Apple wanted Zeiss to keep the AR plans under wraps, according to Scoble. “Carl Zeiss is in the AR part of CES,” said Scoble in another post. “But it is NOT showing off its mixed reality optics. Why not? I said "Tim Cook didn't let you" and the employees around me smiled nervously.” Apple has previously said it was interested in AR. In an interview with ABC’s Good Morning America last September, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he saw preferred augmented reality over virtual reality, since AR allows people to be more "present." "There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality -- both of these are incredibly interesting," Cook said in the interview.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of augmented reality glasses. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Tuesday. Augmented Reality: A new rumor claims that Apple is working on a pair of augmented reality glasses, reports 9to5Mac. According to this rumor, the tech company is working with Carl Zeiss to create the glasses. The new device has been described as a “light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses.’ The release date for these glasses is still unknown, but the source of the rumor claims they could come out this year or in 2018. iPhone 8 Chassis: Rumor has it that Apple will use a stainless steel chassis for the iPhone 8, MacRumors notes. This stainless steel chassis would be used with the glass case that rumors claim the iPhone 8 will have. The last time AAPL used stainless steel for an iPhone chassis was with the iPhone 4s. This smartphone also had a glass case. This rumor claims that the stainless steel chassis will come from Foxconn and Jabil Circuit, Inc. (NYSE:JBL). MacBook Pro Battery: Consumer Reports has tested the MacBook Pro battery again following issues with the first test, reports AppleInsider. Apple worked with the publication on the test and discovered that a hidden developer setting for Safari was active during the initial test and that it caused a bug. It says that this is what resulted in the batteries not lasting as long in the first round of testing. Once this feature was turned off, the batteries were able to match AAPL’s estimates. The tech company will be releasing an update for macOS to fix this issue.

Anytime. Anywhere. Apple To Manufacture Data Server Cabinets in Mesa, Arizona Facility By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: JANUARY 10 2017 Tech giant Apple took a big step toward expanding its production facility in Mesa, Arizona last month when it requested permission from the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ) Board to expand the types of devices it can build and components it can import to the facility, according to a report on the Federal Registry. The company is looking to repurpose the site to build data server cabinets for use in enterprise data centers, according to the Mesa city government. Since Apple does not currently sell such cabinets, the company may plan to use the machines in its own data centers or may be looking to expand its offerings. Expanded Authority The Mesa production facility that Apple is looking to expand originally belonged to GT Advanced, a defunct manufacturer that used to supply Sapphire glass for Apple devices. When the company declared bankruptcy, Apple took ownership of the plant. If the FTZ Board approves Apple's request for permission to import components and build new devices at the site, the company's production costs could fall significantly. Production under FTZ procedures could exempt Apple from customs duty payments on the foreign materials/components used in export production. "On its domestic sales, Apple would be able to choose the duty rate during customs entry procedures that applies to finished server assembly cabinets (duty-free) for the foreign-status materials/components noted below and in the existing scope of authority," the filing stated. "Customs duties also could possibly be deferred or reduced on foreign-status production equipment." Like many modern manufacturers, Apple's products include a wide variety of components, many of which are sourced from countries around the world. Everything from fiber optic cables to lithium batteries to LEDs are sourced from manufacturers located overseas. The company's iPhone models and other devices are assembled in countries like China, where labor costs are significantly cheaper. Political Pressure If Apple goes through with the plan, the move would be a rare case of a U.S. tech company moving production and manufacturing operations stateside, although Apple does already build some servers in Oregon and elsewhere in Arizona. The expanded FTZ authorization would effectively consolidate that production into the Mesa facility, which the company said will provide the local job market with some 150 high-paid positions. Several manufacturers have come under scrutiny recently for decisions to expand their operations in other countries while closing factories in the U.S. In particular, President-elect Donald Trump has called out companies such as Toyota, Carrier, and Ford over Twitter after they announced plans to open plants in Mexico. Trump specifically mentioned Apple and its products by name during the presidential campaign, saying that if he were elected, the company would be encouraged to assemble the iPhone in the U.S. Trump reportedly called Apple CEO Tim Cook after the election to discuss the company moving more of its manufacturing operations to the States.

Heart Device Security Flaw Seen Next Article > Backpage Execs Refuse To Testify at Sex-Trafficking Hearing By Matthew Daly PUBLISHED: JANUARY 10 2017 Executives at the advertising website Backpage.com refused to testify before Congress Tuesday following a Senate report that accuses the site of systematically editing its "adult" ads to remove words that indicate sex trafficking. Four top executives and the company's lawyer told a Senate subcommittee they were invoking their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report Monday charging that Backpage has created a lucrative marketplace that makes child sex trafficking easier. The report cites internal documents showing that up to 80 percent of the site's ads are edited to conceal the true nature of the underlying transaction. Backpage has denied the allegations, and the site shuttered its "adult" section in the U.S. Monday night to protest what it calls government censorship. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the subcommittee's chairman, said Backpage's actions validated the panel's report, adding that Backpage has "put profits ahead of vulnerable women and children." Backpage has shown it is "intent on profiting from human trafficking -- and human misery -- and profit they have, at the expense of countless innocent victims," Portman said as the Backpage executives sat stone-faced in front of him. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the panel's top Democrat, called Backpage "a $600 million company built on selling sex -- and importantly, built on selling sex with children." Rather than turn away ads that sell girls as young as 12 for sex, Backpage executives "just tried to make it less obvious," McCaskill said. The committee's report said the company used a computer program to find and delete words such as "Lolita," ''cheerleader," ''teenager" and "young." The editing practices amounted to "coaching" traffickers and pimps in how to make their ads appears legitimate while continuing to sell girls and boys into prostitution and modern-day slavery, McCaskill said. "That, ladies and gentlemen, is the definition of evil -- simply evil," she said. The Senate hearing comes a day after the Supreme Court said it won't hear an appeal from three sex trafficking victims who accuse Backpage of helping to promote the exploitation of children. The justices left in place a lower court ruling that said federal law shields Backpage from liability because the site is just hosting content created by people who use it. The women say they were sold as prostitutes in Massachusetts and Rhode Island through advertisements for escort services on the site when they were as young as 15. A federal judge threw out the lawsuit and the federal appeals court in Boston upheld that ruling. In a separate case last month, a California judge rejected pimping charges against Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer and former owners Michael Lacey and James Larkin, citing federal free speech laws. California officials have said they intend to pursue new charges against the company based on new evidence. Prosecutors have alleged that more than 90 percent of Backpage's revenue -- millions of dollars each month -- comes from adult escort ads that use coded language and nearly nude photos to offer sex for money. The Senate report says that despite public claims to the contrary, Ferrer, Larkin and Lacey are the "true beneficial owners of the company." The report says Larkin and Lacey loaned Ferrer $600 million to buy the company from them, and the men concealed their ownership interest through "a complex chain of domestic and international shell companies." Ferrer, Lacey, Larkin and chief operating officer Andrew Padilla all refused to testify Tuesday, as did Elizabeth McDougall, the company's general counsel. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Apple Inc. said Tuesday it has fixed a bug that led to poor battery life in some of its newer MacBook Pro laptops, prompting Consumer Reports to launch a review that may reverse its decision not to recommend the device for the first time in the product category’s history. After reviewing the new laptop in December, Consumer Reports said it could not recommend the product, claiming the battery life, which ranged widely between just four hours for one of the models it tested to as high as 19 hours for another model, was too erratic. See also: Steve Jobs made history on this day 10 years ago However, Apple AAPL, -0.18%  said the problem can be attributed to a hidden Safari setting for developing websites that is not used by consumers and doesn’t reflect real-world usage. The setting, which turns off the browser cache, triggered an “obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons,” which contributed to the inconsistent results, Apple said in a statement. The company has since fixed the Safari bug, and Consumer Reports is now retesting under the new conditions. Here's what Trump means for the tech industry(1:34) The incoming Trump administration has given Silicon Valley a headache, mainly due to potential plans to penalize companies that manufacture goods in China. But not all of Trump's proposed policies may have a harmful effect on the tech sector. “After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life,” Apple said. Consumer Reports said it is reviewing its tests and will make a decision as soon as Thursday on whether it can reverse its initial decision and recommend the latest MacBook Pro. While Apple said the tests were skewed by Consumer Reports not using the caching function on Safari, the reviews site said it typically turns caching off because it wants the computer to load each webpage as if it were new content from the internet, rather than just resurrecting it from its local drive. Consumer Reports tests laptop batteries by downloading a series of 10 webpages repeatedly, starting with the battery fully charged and ending when it shuts down. The tests are conducted in the browser native to the computer’s operating system, which for the Mac is Safari. Once caching was turned back on, Consumer Reports said battery life for the MacBook Pro improved substantially. The laptop otherwise performed well in tests of display quality and performance, it said. “If the battery life results are consistently high, the ratings score for MacBook Pros would rise, and those laptops will then receive Consumer Reports’ Recommended rating given their performance in all our other evaluations,” a spokesperson said. The Mac was Apple’s second-biggest revenue generator behind the iPhone for years, but decelerating global PC sales in recent years and increased investment by Apple into its faster-growing software and services segment have caused the product category to fall behind. Shares of Apple rose 0.1% to $119.13 in afternoon trade Tuesday. They have increased 23% in the past year, versus a 22% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  , which includes Apple.

Image Credit: Illustration by Harrison Weber for VentureBeat It looked nothing like an iPhone, or anything Apple might dare to make. On September 10, 2013, the day Apple unveiled the iPhone 5S, Dutch designer Dave Hakkens uploaded a video to YouTube to promote his college graduation project: Phonebloks, “a phone worth keeping.” Hakkens imagined a smartphone made of interchangeable blocks, and each block — the screen, the battery, the processor, and so on — could be easily upgraded or repaired, so it wouldn’t end up in a landfill after two years. “In the beginning, we were asking for like 500 supporters,” said Hakkens, but 48 hours later, the video went viral, racking up millions of views — and delivering a jolt to a small technology incubator called ATAP, Motorola’s Advanced Technology and Projects group. “Phonebloks was announced, and the world went berserk. If Dave Hakkens hadn’t had this viral video, we wouldn’t have announced Ara probably for at least another year,” said former ATAP design lead Dan Makoski in a VentureBeat interview. “We were outed by Dave, inadvertently.” The ATAP studio had worked in secret for more than a year on a similar device: a phone made of infinitely customizable parts they called modules. It wasn’t supposed to be a phone you’d queue up in line every year to buy. It was something radically different. Block by block, this was to be a phone you could create. “Ara Knaian of NK Labs, who the project’s named after, he and his crew had figured out how to actually make it work,” recalls Makoski. The team had already finalized the initial industrial designs for it. “If we [waited] to tell the world that we’ve been working on this, everybody’s going to think that we copied Dave. So we said, ‘Shit, OK, what should we do?'” “So,” Makoski said, “we just called Dave.” 48 days later, Motorola revealed it: Project Ara.     “Thinking back, I never called it a modular phone,” said Hakkens in an interview with VentureBeat. “I had an old camera that I broke and I couldn’t really fix it. So I took it apart and I noticed all the components were still pretty good, except for one thing.” “I thought: Isn’t that weird that we throw everything away just because one part is broken?” said Hakkens. “At first, I wanted to make a phone that lasts 100 years. But then I realized, I kind of like technology — that it evolves, that it gets better. The only downside is that after it gets better, we throw everything away. I started looking into it, and it generates a lot of e-waste … I mean now we have some devices, but in the future it’s thermostats, fridges, microwaves — everything will be connected. So what if a chip breaks in your fridge? Do you just throw the entire thing away?” The Phonebloks story spread like wildfire. Gadget blogs covered it en masse, hordes of supporters signed up to support, tweet, and share the idea with a viral marketing tool called Thunderclap, and developers fired back, saying it couldn’t be done — that it was impossible to build. Perhaps they had a point. “He was just getting destroyed by engineers on Reddit saying ‘There’s no way this could work, right? This is just a pipe dream.’ The way he had designed it was totally unrealistic because he’s an industrial designer and doesn’t, you know, understand the complexity,” Makoski said. “I didn’t really put a lot of effort into how the thing would look, because I didn’t really care about that. So I sort of stripped it down to the most basic version, which would be blocks,” said Hakkens. “I figured, maybe it’s a good thing to just put it out online to gather people that support it. Then, if you had a lot of support, companies would make it.” The idea struck a nerve. Only Hakkens needed someone to build it. Then ATAP called. When Google’s $12.5 billion Motorola Mobility acquisition closed in May 2012, the maker movement looked like the dawn of a manufacturing revolution. Food trucks swarmed Motorola’s new Sunnyvale, California campus because the cafeteria was still under construction. Incoming CEO Dennis Woodside sought someone to run innovation at the new, Googly Motorola, and the job went to former DARPA director Regina Dugan. “Regina was the soul of ATAP,” recalls Makoski. Makoski joined with a ticking clock: He had just two years at ATAP because of a rule inspired by Dugan’s time at DARPA, where newcomers were handed a name tag with an expiration date. “When Regina hired me, I had no idea what I’d work on. You know, I had some thoughts — I had some interests — and I actually sketched out on my first week six different possible ways to go. One of those little sharpie marker sketches, it was kind of a question.” “And I thought she was insane. But you know, that was the beginning” “When I look at the highest form of admiration in the smartphone space it was for the iPhone. I love Apple’s design, but I had seen the maker movement, and Maker Faire, and Tech Shop, and these beginning glimmerings of a very different model than what Apple was celebrating. Apple was celebrating the craftsmanship of the perfect object. To me, it was like the ultimate expression of the Henry Ford vision of making one object a million times perfectly.” “So my question was, What if we did the exact opposite?” said Makoski. Above: Regina Dugan Image Credit: Facebook “We started thinking about this idea of extreme personalization. Is there evidence that this is working? We looked at everything from Etsy — we actually did some interesting research on the tattoo space, because that’s evidence of extreme personalization.” That’s how Project Ara got its first name; before it was Ara, a name inspired by the project’s eventual electrical, mechanical, and software engineering lead, Ara Knaian, Makoski had called it Esprimo — Esperanto for “expression.” In ATAP’s earliest months, Dugan and Makoski often walked to lunch together, traversing the parking lot to reach the best food truck: Sam’s Chowder Mobile. And during one of these lunch breaks, in line at Sam’s, Dugan had an epiphany. “‘A food truck,'” Makoski recalls Dugan exclaiming. “‘We should make a factory food truck. Like you customize your meal right here, we should put 3D printers and hackable electronics into a truck, and that’s how we’re going to make this idea.'” “And I thought she was insane. But you know, I thought about it more, and that was the beginning. It was all about how to create electronics that are malleable and adaptive and personal, and where every one is different,” said Makoski. Above: The Moduino. One of Project Ara’s earliest prototypes, made out of a Razr phone and an Arduino developer board. It is also credited as the origin of Motorola’s semi-modular Moto Z. Image Credit: Ryan Lowry, Wired The slog began. “We were working on both aesthetic customization and functional customization. I was leading a lot of those design and psychology experiments around, ‘how do we overcome the paradox of choice?'” recalls Makoski. Ali Javidan, a Tesla engineer Dugan poached to run ATAP’s prototyping shop, was charged with developing it. “His part was much harder than my part, quite honestly. But he got to the point where we took these Razr phones and we took the main application processor and took the leafs off of that, connected it to an Arduino board.” They nicknamed this early prototype Moduino. It was an omen of things to come “We, from that August for the next six months, really struggled, quite honestly, because it’s just so freakin’ hard.” Javidan — charged with developing dozens of projects at ATAP, from touch-sensitive fabric to mobile 3D mapping — was stretched incredibly thin. And Makoski, a designer at heart, did not consider himself technically capable of getting Ara off the ground. Something had to give. Above: Left: Ali Javidan, Right: Dan Makoski Image Credit: Dan Makoski “At that point, Ali and I, quite honestly, we didn’t feel like we were equipped to shepherd the project.” “Regina liked this idea so much. And she just believed in people so much, she said, ‘Dan, hire the people, you can be the technical project lead.’ And I honestly — I sometimes regret making this decision — but I just said, ‘Regina, I’m not capable of shepherding this project to life.'” So Dugan found someone else: Paul Eremenko, who worked on rapid manufacturing at DARPA, joined ATAP in April, 10 months into Makoski’s time at the studio. The project, not even a year old, was under new leadership. And it was an omen of things to come. The sheer audacity that brought Ara to life — a phone you could create, block by block — made it impossible for Makoski, or anyone else, to succeed. But Eremenko would get close.     Javidan assumed responsibility for managing the shop. Makoski, meanwhile, partnered with Eremenko on the design, cultural, community, and psychological facets of Ara. “I was in charge of the soul. Paul was in charge of body. That’s how we divvied our time.” “Paul was always the one with red eyes, hadn’t gotten any sleep, and was always super focused with what he did,” recalls Hakkens. “It was Paul, for me, who was really pushing the project forward.” “Paul was really ambitious. And he was actually hoping that we’d have something we could get out in people’s hands in early 2014, I guess, initially. That was back in the early days,” said Makoski. Above: A factory on wheels. The team hired another key contributor: Jason Chua. He was a Stanford graduate who had cofounded SparkTruck — a project to connect students with maker-movement supplies, like 3D printers and electronics. Chua and Makoski set out to build Dugan’s factory on wheels to test the team’s early experiments at scale. That summer, as Makoski and Chua drove 12,683 miles across the U.S. in a Velcro-clad van testing Dugan’s food truck epiphany with real people, Eremenko stayed home, creating the technical infrastructure for a malleable smartphone.     Even as Makoski and Chua drew crowds testing the thesis behind Ara, back home in Sunnyvale, the audience was far from enthusiastic. According to Makoski, Motorola’s then-CEO Dennis Woodside was rather unimpressed by Ara’s initial prototypes. Before Phonebloks went viral, “He was like, ‘Yeah, cool guys, that’s interesting, but you know this maker thing is kind of niche. No one’s really going to care,'” said Makoski. “Holy shit, you guys have actually been working on it. Like, this could be real” Motorola’s engineering VP, Iqbal Arshad, had advised on the project early on, and his team helped Javidan and Makoski put together their first prototypes. But Ara would be shrugged off as a side project by Motorola. “[Arshad’s] a really good guy, but when Google had taken over Motorola, he was trying to focus his engineering resources on just a couple of things that were really going to move the needle. I mean, his whole focus was on the Moto X at that point,” recalls Makoski. “He was like, ‘I don’t have time for your crazy modular thing. That’s totally insane, architecturally.'” Above: Another early Ara prototype Image Credit: Phonebloks After a summer of working cheek by jowl, Makoski and Chua’s cross-country tour came to an end and Eremenko finished laying out the core technical details of Ara — a “packet-switched network on a device,” printed on 3D printers and held together by experimental EPM magnets under development by Ara Knaian. Then Hakkens went public with Phonebloks. His bold idea took off like a rocket. Flooded with interest, Hakkens spoke with several companies, but Google, in particular, got his attention. “Google was really persistent,” he said, “and they mentioned that ‘we’ve been working on a project like this — would you like to come and see and maybe we can do something together?'” ATAP flew Hakkens from Rotterdam to Motorola’s Sunnyvale campus. “We just walked him through what we were working on, and he was just like, ‘Holy shit, you guys have actually been working on it. Like, this could be real,'” said Makoski. It was September 2013, and Makoski had less than ten months remaining in his two-year tour at ATAP. “I know Google doesn’t necessarily care about the environment, but still I liked what they were doing. So instead of working for Google, it seemed to make sense to stay independent from them,” said Hakkens. “In the end, [I] wanted to support other modular phones. Not just Google.” “I’ll just say we left those two days of meetings with Dave suggesting a [consulting] price that was just ridiculous to us, and us offering Dave to join Motorola,” said Makoski. Hakkens turned them down. That seemed like it would be the last ATAP would hear from him. “He just wanted to stay independent. And we said ‘good luck.’ It was friendly, but not finding a way to collaborate,” said Makoski. Then, “literally 48 hours before the Thunderclap [marketing push] was to go out, Dave called us and said, ‘Hey guys, I have a proposal: How about you guys just pay me for my time to tell your story, and I use the Phonebloks community as a place where you guys can get feedback on what you’re trying to do’,” said Makoski. “And that was acceptable to us. So we said great.” On October 28, 2013, Motorola unveiled Ara.     In Motorola’s announcement, Eremenko posed a gutsy question: “How do we bring the benefits of an open hardware ecosystem to 6 billion people?” Six billion — a very, very large number. He painted the project in brilliant, broad strokes on the company’s blog. “Our goal is to drive a more thoughtful, expressive, and open relationship between users, developers, and their phones. To give you the power to decide what your phone does, how it looks, where and what it’s made of, how much it costs, and how long you’ll keep it.” Above: The first public designs of Project Ara, released with Motorola’s announcement. Makoski originally opposed showing the seams of each module — that was Eremenko’s idea. Image Credit: Google ATAP “We all went home after we announced,” recalls Makoski, “and then we all came back two hours later and the world just went psycho. I don’t think we expected the amount of interest. Even Woodside — who was lukewarm … when we had showed him stuff before we announced publicly — the week after we announced, Dennis was like: ‘We’ve been proudly working on this…'” Ara had appeared out of nowhere — just 48 days after Phonebloks’ viral hit — and the optics couldn’t be stranger. From outside ATAP, the arrangement was incredibly opaque. Motorola appeared to have copied Hakkens, even as Eremenko said otherwise. But Hakkens had never contributed to Ara, the phone — neither the hardware nor the software. “He basically became a journalist,” said Makoski. “He would come in every couple of months and update his readership and the broader world about what we were doing. He’s a storyteller.” Hakkens hoped other companies would partner with Phonebloks, but the surrounding confusion muddied his vision. “One of the things we did wrong, or could have done better, was that everybody thought Ara was Phonebloks,” said Hakkens. “I think everybody thought we were bought out by Google … so we kind of lost our independent image. And companies wouldn’t get in touch that much anymore.” But Hakkens did something crucial for Ara; he dragged it out of the shadows and forced ATAP to develop the project in the open. Within the tech industry, all eyes fell on Ara and ATAP. More remarkable was Project Ara’s starting price When Google sold Motorola to Lenovo that January, it held onto ATAP and Ara — a shining light of innovation at an advertising behemoth. As one might expect, Google’s absorption of ATAP had side effects. “In some ways, it let us preserve our charter,” said Makoski. “And actually, there were some internally that said it was this project, Project Ara, that was the one that ended up keeping us [at Google], because it generated so much enthusiasm in the technical world.” Others say Google held Ara back. “The pace and scale of contracting that we did all of the sudden really slowed down [after the acquisition],” said one source, who requested anonymity. “The model of ATAP is based on really rapid contracts, like DARPA. There were 150 people working on Ara before we transitioned into Google. And only 3 of them, or 4 of them, were Google employees. All the rest were external contractors,” said the source. “To us, it just felt like we had just kinda hit molasses. And I think, to Google, it felt like they were being uncomfortably sped up,” the source said. When Ara was announced in October 2013, Eremenko told the world that ATAP would release Project Ara’s Module Developer’s Kit (MDK) early the next year. And in February, in a lengthy Time profile, he promised a basic commercial release for the first quarter of 2015. Eremenko imagined doing “for hardware what the Android platform has done for software,” but more remarkable was Project Ara’s starting price: $50. Eremenko sought to build a phone that was customizable beyond any electronic device ever created. You could pick the features, decide when and what to upgrade, and (within reason) pay whatever you wanted. For $50, the starter phone would ship with only the most basic features — not even a 3G modem. But that same phone could be enhanced and evolve to incorporate technological improvements over time. Premium modules, like a bigger battery or a high-quality camera, could transform that smartphone from an obsolescence timebomb into a worthwhile investment. “We had a philosophy that this phone was not for the iPhone-carrying, latest Samsung Galaxy-carrying smartphone owner in the U.S.,” said Makoski. “We wanted to bring access to the internet, to the smartphone space, to those who previously didn’t have it. And part of the ways to do that is to create a platform where an India telecom could put customized radios into Ara for a $50 price point or a $100 price point, or it could scale all the way up to something for Latin America or the U.S.” ATAP released Project Ara’s developer kit one month behind schedule, in April 2014 — the same month Google teased its legion of fans with a prototype of Ara’s main Endo module. Two months later, ATAP started accepting applications for Ara developer boards. The team was in full swing, determined to make Ara real. And Ara’s biggest supporters were certain it soon would be. And then Ara lost one of its founders: Makoski’s two years were up. Meanwhile, Eremenko had 13 months to go. On October 29, 2014, Google released a video of its first working Ara prototype. Soon after, in January, the company shared a second clip, this one showing Ara with a 3G modem and a swath of modules across every category, from miniature piano keyboards to heart rate monitors, all clad in vivid colors and personalized with photos. Another goodbye brought Ara’s myriad designs within reach. Eremenko cut ties with one of Ara’s earliest supporters, 3DSystems, scrapping the project’s dependence on rapid 3D printing for a dye sublimation process. 3DSystems’ printers were too slow, and the new system could adorn modules with selfies and pets. Eremenko fought to release Ara into the world before his final days at ATAP, but he lost faith as the project’s timeline shifted stubbornly into the future. “I remember from the beginning that Phonebloks was like a 10-year vision or something like that. And then Google said, ‘Alright, we are going to do it in two years,’ which seemed super ambitious,” said Hakkens. “Once we had figured out that we could pull it off technically, we just needed to line up all of the silicon providers, etc., to get it all working. And then there were all different types of roadblocks,” said Makoski. “Everything from the EPM magnets not going to the strength we wanted to some of our partners requiring all kinds of business relationships that maybe we weren’t ready to give. I can’t really comment on that stuff, partly because I don’t know it that well.” ATAP planned to launch a market pilot outside the U.S. first — in a South American country that shared a timezone with Google’s headquarters, like Ecuador or Argentina. The pilot, as promised by Eremenko in the pages of Time magazine, was slated for release for sometime in 2015 — ATAP never said when exactly, but the studio eventually settled on a location, Puerto Rico. “We just said, “Let’s use Puerto Rico’ because it has a similar regulatory regime as the U.S., and if we can do something in Puerto Rico than we kind of check the box that, if we wanted to, we can scale in the U.S. market (and also in Latin America),” explained Makoski. But the phone wasn’t stable or sturdy enough; the project needed yet more nurturing, and Ara once again missed a shipping window. In June 2015, Eremenko left ATAP. His two years were up, and Ara faced more uncertainty than ever. The next month, Google canceled the Puerto Rico pilot and promised an Ara release in 2016. “It’s difficult for a project like this to have a good estimate of where you’re going and when it’s ready. I remember telling them a couple of times that they really shot themselves in the foot by mentioning something like that,” said Hakkens. And Project Ara, without a leader, changed hands again. This time, Dugan took charge, with Motorola veteran Rafa Camargo, and the team went quiet to rework Ara, leaving many developers, and Hakkens, in the dark.     At the start of 2015, Eremenko’s dream of a $50 phone had evaporated. “The evolution of what Ara was supposed to be had changed so much because of the big question mark around what consumers actually wanted,” a source who worked on Ara told VentureBeat. “And a $50 [smartphone] is just not technically possible. That’s the truth. Anybody who makes smartphones can tell you that.” So Ara pivoted. “I felt like it was the biggest opportunity that I had ever been presented” Under Dugan and Camargo, Ara morphed into a high-end phone with all the essentials built in. Ara lost its ability to serve different price points, but the project gained focus. It was designed to push the limits of what a smartphone could be with modules that add entirely new features, like super-powered Lego blocks. Imagine the modules developers might dream up. There were the obvious ideas, like specialized cameras and high-end speakers. But modules could get stranger, wilder, too. One module idea, in particular, frequently derailed meetings inside ATAP’s walls, as studio leaders strained to picture a module gold rush akin to Apple’s App Store. “One of the modules that we were working on was basically like a tiny aquarium for your phone,” said the source. “It was a little tiny biome that would go inside of a module and it would have a microscope on the bottom part, and it would have live tardigrades and algae — some people call them water bears. They are the tiniest living organism. We had this idea to build a tardigrade module and we’d build a microscope with it. So you’d have this app on your phone and you could essentially look at the tardigrades up close and watch them floating around.” Brooklyn-based art, design, and technology agency Midnight Commercial conceived the idea, and was commissioned by Google to build it, demonstrating the depth of what developers could create. Enthusiasm inside ATAP climbed as 2015 advanced. “It was very much balls to the wall, let’s go. Let’s make this happen. It was very fast. It was super exciting. Really, really exciting,” said the source. “The way [Dugan] presented it and the way she talked about it, I felt like it was the biggest opportunity that I had ever been presented.” But while Ara’s team grew, Larry Page and Sergey Brin sought to slim Google down. The pair created a parent company named Alphabet, split most of Google’s wild bets, like internet balloons and smart thermostats, into separate companies, and put Sundar Pichai in charge of Google. ATAP remained at Google, closely guarded by Dugan, and Pichai hired Motorola president Rick Osterloh to make sense of Google’s fragmented hardware projects. Increasingly known for duds like Glass and the bowling-ballish Nexus Q, Google had to get serious about hardware. Then in April 2016, one month before Ara’s biggest-ever reveal, planned for Google I/O, Dugan suddenly left. She was hired to lead Building 8, an undefined company created by Facebook with “hundreds of people and hundreds of millions of dollars” at her disposal, Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page announcing the appointment. “When she left, there was essentially a leadership vacuum,” a source said. “Because there wasn’t a champion for Ara, someone who could really go to bat for it, I think it just fell down the priority list. And if you look at the LG [G5] phone, it just didn’t do very well. If you look at the other attempts at modularity and try to get a feel for the market, there’s just not a lot of good signals out there.” In August, the Ara team was tracking to ship Ara to developers in late 2016 and to the public in 2017. Then Osterloh’s axe fell. Ara was “suspended.” News of the cull rang out like a sudden alarm in the ears of Ara’s staff, who had continued to toil in Dugan’s absence. And Ara’s remaining loyal fans, worn out by years of delays, mourned the news on Twitter. Perhaps more than anyone else, the news pierced the heart of Dan Makoski, who walked the streets of Palo Alto that night in disbelief that Ara was really, truly gone.     Ara has laid dormant for five months — the prototypes locked away from developers as a fraction of Ara’s remaining team stayed to wind down the project. Some later rejoined Dugan at Building 8. Others went on to other projects at Google. Google may someday license or sell Ara. The company has hinted it might, yet throughout Ara’s evolution there was always a missing piece. “Consumers don’t care about modularity,” said the source who worked on Ara. “And even today, I’m still not sure that it’s something that consumers want.” Makoski thinks otherwise. “I feel like Project Ara, if it does get shelved, it’s a shame that they didn’t have the courage to go all the way and fail a couple of times at a commercial release to get it over the hump. But I think the industry will. And hopefully I’ll be alive to see that. I’m only 42 … I still believe.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Baig , USA TODAY Published 1:33 p.m. ET Jan. 10, 2017 | Updated 2:24 p.m. ET Jan. 11, 2017 MacBook Pro (Photo: Apple) NEW YORK — Maybe there's enough juice after all? Consumer Reports is rerunning battery life tests on Apple’s MacBook Pros after Apple issued a software fix that it says addresses the issue that led the publication to hold off on recommending one of Apple’s laptops for the first time. During its initial tests on three MacBook Pro models late last year, Consumer Reports cited widely inconsistent battery life results, ranging between 3.75 hours and 19.5 hours. The magazine says the newest test results will be available Thursday. In its own advertising on its website, Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life for the MacBook Pros. USA TODAY It's not just you: 'Consumer Reports' has battery problems with new MacBook Pro I know firsthand the impact a Consumer Reports recommendation — or lack thereof — can have. Just the other day, a friend in the market for a new laptop said she was nervous about purchasing new MacBook Pros because of the apparent shortcomings associated with the battery Consumer Reports reported on. Apple fully expects a more positive outcome when the latest test results are in. “We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage,” Apple said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY. “Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab," the statement continued. "After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test.” Apple posted the fix for the Safari bug as part of their free Beta testing program; it is available to new MacBook Pro owners who sign up to test early versions of its software. Once enrolled, the fix is then pushed to users through the Mac’s Software Update function. Apple says the fix will be a part of a broader Software Update available to all MacBook Pro users in a few weeks, regardless of whether they sign up for the beta. The most expensive of Apple’s newest MacBook Pros start at $1,799 for a 13-inch model and $2,399 for 15 inches and feature the TouchID fingerprint sensor and a multiglass strip of virtual shortcut keys known as the Touch Bar that's above the traditional QWERTY keyboard.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 10, 2017: 12:40 PM ET Happy 10th birthday, iPhone The iPhone may have just celebrated its 10th birthday. But for Apple investors, this is the only number that matters: $134.54. That is the all-time high for Apple's stock -- which it last hit nearly 21 months ago back on April 28, 2015. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) has been mostly stuck in a rut since then, even as investors embraced fellow tech stocks, most notably the FANG of Four. Facebook (FB, Tech30), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30) have all hit new records more recently than Apple. But there are several reasons to believe that Apple might finally be back on track. The stock has had a nice run lately, gaining about 8% since the presidential election. Although tech investors were initially nervous about Donald Trump's win because of some antagonistic tweets about Silicon Valley leaders, Apple and other tech stocks have since enjoyed a strong rally. Part of that is due to the more general hope that Trump's policies will boost corporate and consumer spending. That obviously would help Apple and other gadget makers. Related: This was Apple's prototype for the iPhone But there are also growing hopes that the Trump administration may lower some corporate taxes, which could entice Apple and other tech giants hoarding cash overseas -- like Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) and Google -- to bring that back to the U.S. Apple currently has $237.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet. CFO Luca Maestri said during Apple's most recent earnings call with investors in October that $216 billion of that iMountain was being held overseas. If Apple is able to repatriate -- i.e. bring back -- that cash to the U.S., the company could potentially use it on acquisitions, stock buybacks or higher dividends. Investors would probably approve of that. Another cause for optimism? Growing hopes that the recent iPhone 7 will continue to sell well, especially due to the massive problems facing Android rival Samsung in the wake of its fire-prone (and now defunct) Galaxy Note 7. There is also growing excitement about the 10th-anniversary version of the iPhone that will be unveiled later this year. Will Apple call it the iPhone 8? The Ocho? Skip 8 and 9 altogether and call it the 10? Or maybe name it the iPhone X if Apple wants to mimic the NFL and start using Roman numerals? Whatever the newest iPhone is called, investors are hoping that there will be enough new bells and whistles to live up to the hype -- and help dispel the notion that Apple has lost its innovative edge since Steve Jobs died and Tim Cook has led the company. Related: Apple cut Tim Cook's pay after missing internal sales goals UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a report earlier this week that patience is still required with Apple's stock. But he thinks that the stock should start gaining momentum as optimism builds about the next iPhone. And Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty is even more optimistic. She just named Apple as her top large hardware stock pick for the year, citing expectations of Apple bringing back cash from overseas as well as broader tax reform under Trump. But Huberty argues that perhaps the biggest catalyst for Apple will be iPhone sales in China. Even though Apple has faced tough competition from Chinese smartphone rivals like Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo and Oppo, Huberty thinks that those companies are catering more to the lower-end of the market. She believes that once Apple does unveil a major upgrade to the iPhone, the company's market share in China will tick higher again. "Investors worry Apple has lost its edge in China. We don't believe this is the case," she wrote. "High-end Chinese users are committed to Apple but are waiting for a more meaningful change...to upgrade." Huberty thinks that Apple will hit a new all-time high over the next year. Her 12-month price target is $148 --nearly 25% higher than current levels. In her extremely bullish case for the stock, which calls for much higher earnings growth than expected, the stock could hit $190. That's a more than 60% increase. And at that price, Apple's market value would wind up topping the mythical $1 trillion level -- a first for a U.S. company.

By Krista Camille Esguerra www.twitter.com/kcamellion on January 11 2017 02:36 AM Share Tweet Share Share Email Looks like fans will be enjoying yet another fun-filled musical ride in the Apple Music Carpool Karaoke. As per Rolling Stone, artists like Metallica, Will Smith, Alicia Keys, John Legend, and Ariana Grande will take a ride on the famous Carpool Karaoke series. But they won’t be seeing James Corden near the steering wheel. At least not as often as before. Apple Music Carpool Karaoke The success of Carpool Karaoke with James Corden was followed by the production of two different series. Apple Music then announced in July 2016 that the company will be distributing series based on the segment. The difference between Corden’s Carpool Karaoke and the Apple Music’s Carpool Karaoke is that the latter won’t be having a single host driving anymore. The executive producers, including James Corden, decided to have different hosts for each of the episodes. The show will have 16 episodes, with different pairs every episode. Fans can expect Billy Eichner driving Metallica around Hollywood, while John Legend drives with Alicia Keys. Variety also reported that Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler will also be carpooling around LA. Additionally, Ariana Grande will be expected driving with Seth McFarlane. Even more, Rolling Stone reported that say that James Corden will be driving around town with Will Smith. So fans wouldn’t miss James Corden in Apple Music’s Carpool Karaoke for too long. James Corden in Carpool Karaoke Carpool Karaoke is a segment in James Corden’s late night talk show, the Late Late Show at CBS. The segment features Corden and his musical guests driving and singing on the roads of Los Angeles. Corden used to say that a Gavin & Stacey-themed sketch inspired the production of Carpool Karaoke. He explained that he participated in the Special Red Nose Day 2011, where he sang in the car with George Michael. Carpool Karaoke with James Corden featured famous musical artists such as Sia, One Direction, Stevie Wonder, and more. He even carpooled with Adele and Mariah Carey! Apple Music’s Carpool Karaoke will be a standalone series, and will run for 30 minutes. On the other hand, there hasn’t been any official announcement about the release date of the show.

It’s the reason my primary Mac is still a 17-inch MacBook Pro, and why I have that hooked up to a 27-inch Apple Thunderbolt Display when I’m in my home office. When travelling, though, I have fewer pixels to play with. Sure, I could get a 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro, but I favor physical screen space over smaller screen elements. There are existing apps out there, like Air Display, that let you use an iPad as a second monitor for a Mac, but they work via WiFi, which poses two problems. First, they often don’t work on WiFi hotspots, which you’re likely to be using when away from home. Second, even when they do work, there is an annoying amount of lag. Which is where Duet comes in. Instead of using WiFi, it feeds the video signal from your Mac to iPad using a standard Lightning or 30-pin cable. Built by ex-Apple engineers, I figured it ought to be work well, so put it to the test …  Setup Setup is very straightforward. Install the Duet iOS app on your iPad, then install the companion menu bar app on your Mac. You need to restart your Mac after installing the companion app, and then you’re done. You can also run it on an iPhone. On an iPhone 6, it would be pointless, and I’m not convinced it would be that much more useful on an iPhone 6 Plus, but the option is there if you want it. Connecting your iPad To use your iPad as a monitor, simply connect it to your Mac using a standard Lightning or 30-pin cable (I use an Amazon Basics one, mostly because it’s black …) and launch the Duet app on your iPad. Within 2-3 seconds, the Mac will automatically detect the iPad and start using it as a second monitor. I found the first time I connected it, it set the iPad screen to be the main one, with the dock and menu bar over on the iPad. This looked rather funky, giving a sense of what an iPad running OS X would look like, but isn’t the most useful setup. Reversing that works the same as any other external monitor: just click the Arrangement tab and drag the menu bar back to the Mac display. In subsequent launches, Duet remembered this setting, so it was a simple, one-off task. You can also use it as a third monitor alongside a conventional one if desired. In use I have two Macs: a heavily-upgraded late-2011 MacBook Pro 17, and a 2013 MacBook Air 11. Duet says that the app works only with 2013 Macs and later (running OS X 10.9 or later), and this is pretty much correct–but not the whole story. With my MacBook Air, performance is silky smooth. It’s indistinguishable from a conventional external monitor, even when playing video. I was incredibly impressed, and think you will be too. Judge for yourself: Updated: My usage on my MacBook Pro 17 was carried out with pre-release software, in which cursor-lag was horrible. But with the latest version installed, responsiveness is–while still compromised–is still perfectly usable. Touchscreen OS X One really nice, uh, touch with Duet is that you can choose to control the apps on the iPad monitor using your Mac touchpad/mouse, or the touchscreen display on the iPad–switching back-and-forth between the two methods as you like. It’s really quite fun to explore what OS X would be like on a touchscreen device. Obviously it’s not designed as a touchscreen OS, so a lot of the user interface elements are rather small for a finger, but for things like weblinks, it makes for a convenient additional means of control. Issues Generally when using an external monitor, it will be larger than your Mac display. In this case, it’s smaller, which means any large windows you drag across to the iPad will need resizing. It’s easier to make them small before you drag them and then resize them as desired once positioned on the iPad. I found that if I let my Mac go to sleep, it wouldn’t always automatically reconnect to the iPad. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn’t. When it didn’t, not even relaunching Duet on my iPad worked: I had to quit both iOS and Mac apps, disconnect the Lightning cable–then relaunch both apps and reconnect the cable. Conclusion: set your Mac not to sleep when using the app. Things were fine at the iPad end: I could switch off the iPad when I didn’t need the second monitor, and it would reconnect to the Mac within a few seconds of switching it back on again. Same thing when disconnecting and reconnecting the cable. You can also use other iPad apps and just pick up where you left off when resuming Duet. Conclusions I love it. Used on a recent Mac, it’s as good as a conventional monitor (albeit a small one). Those who use chat apps for work will find it especially useful, enabling you to keep an eye on the chat while still retaining full use of your Mac screen for your actual work. Even on older, theoretically incompatible Macs it is still useful for some applications. Granted, there is extreme pain involved in getting the app window positioned on the iPad in the first place, which could literally take several minutes when using my MacBook Pro 17, but once it’s there, it works just fine for things like Hipchat. It claims to work fine on older iPads. At $14.99, it’s one of the more expensive iOS apps around, but given the boost it will give to your mobile productivity, I think it’s excellent value for money. Duet requires a modern Mac running OSX 10.9+, and an iPad running iOS 7+. The Duet iOS app costs $14.99 from iTunes, while the companion Mac app is free.

Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago Reply Or $0.00 if you already have one :-) Willy (@Willy_tr) - 2 years ago *14.99$ Abhishek Harge - 2 years ago Reply It’s only a solution if you already own an iPad. Jerry Cox (@jcox_bitwiz) - 2 years ago Reply In that case the joke would be on you for letting a salesman pitch you on a iPad only to use as a monitor for your MacBook. Cory Hixson (@nosxih) - 2 years ago Reply Regarding resizing large windows.. combine Duet Display with the free app BetterTouchTool (http://www.bettertouchtool.net) and you can automatically resize the windows by dragging to different parts of the screen. If you’ve ever used Windows OS, it works just like that. For example, if I drag a windows completely to the right of my screen it automatically sizes it to the right half of my screen. To go full screen I drag the window to the top of my screen. This is just the surface of what BTT can do. Personally, regardless of whether you use Duet Display or not.. you should get BTT. g0bez - 2 years ago Reply Or, use Divvy app, which lets you bind key-combos to resize windows and snap them to pre-defined positions. I have a key-combo for full screen, which automatically snaps it to the largest possible size… and then lots of different positions around the screen. It has been incredibly valuable for me with 2x 27″ thunderbolts and my 15″ rMBP. Gonçalo Correia (@gon414) - 2 years ago Reply BTT is the best thing on a Mac, by far!!! Johnny Larocque - 2 years ago Reply I tried Air Display for drawing on my Mac via the iPad, and was not impressed with the lag. Does Duet handle drawing in Photoshop well? Duet Display (@duetdisplay) - 2 years ago Reply Hey Johnny, We have illustrators using Duet successfully in their work. Duet will be much more responsive and reliable than Air Display since it’s a wired connection. FYI, we don’t support pressure sensitivity yet though, if that’s a deal breaker for you. Johnny Larocque - 2 years ago Thanks for the reply. It is a deal breaker for now, but that “yet” gives me hope. Duet Display (@duetdisplay) - 2 years ago Certainly something we are interested in :) Michael Walton (@michaelpwalton) - 2 years ago Reply Is it possible to use this as a 3rd monitor. i.e. MacBook, Thunderbolt Display and iPad? Jason Vance (@vancejason) - 2 years ago Reply I have it connected to a mid-2010 MB-Pro with no issues. Currently it is set-up as a third monitor. Again no issues and no lag. Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago Reply Yes, it is. donnybeattie - 2 years ago Reply I wonder if using USB 3.0 via a Thunderbolt dock would be smoother on a 17″ Macbook Pro. Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago Reply Hmm, worth a try – I do have one PMZanetti - 2 years ago Reply Giving this a try now and really liking it. At first I was shocked as the default mode was non-Retina, but a quick change in settings made it a Retina display. Works perfect with Better Snap Tool also. csmarkham (@csmarkham) - 2 years ago Reply Primary display on a Mac Mini? Mine’s headless, I usually screen share to a macbook. Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago Reply I don’t think so, but Chrome Remote Desktop would seem to do the job: https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/12/google-release-chrome-remote-desktop-for-ios-to-access-your-computer-from-your-iphoneipad/ segamaster - 2 years ago Here’s an idea… What about using a classic Mac case, use an iPad as monitor and an Mac mini inside so you can relive the classic Mac experience? Duet Display (@duetdisplay) - 2 years ago Reply Yes, the iPad (or iPhone) can act as the only display for a Mac. To do so please install Duet’s Mac application with another display first. Then disable your account login screen so that Duet will be able to load on OS X to display on your iPad during startup or a restart. (You can also change to list login and type your username and then press tab and type your password then enter, no screen would be displayed until you were logged in though) Also make sure you keep “Launch at Login” enabled in Duet’s menu bar app preferences. Raphaël Freeman - 2 years ago so I just bought the app and now I have my iPad 3 as a screen for my Mac mini which solves a problem that I had brilliantly. However, my Mac mini doesn’t have a camera on it, but my iPad does. Is there anyway that the software could received FaceTime video chats on my Mac Mini using my iPad camera? Ali Ayāzi - 2 years ago I might add that you’d probably need a dummy dongle too (check this link: http://blog.macminicolo.net/post/33839671756/build-a-dummy-dongle-for-a-headless-mac-mini) frommel (@frommel) - 2 years ago Reply Who makes that stand and desk set shown in the top picture?

Alfredo Lazcano (@alazcanoo) - 1 year ago https://www.evernote.com/market/feature/pfeiffer incredibilistic - 2 years ago Reply If I wasn’t using an Early 2008 MBP I’d jump on this but I’m afraid I’ll spend $15 and realize that it either doesn’t work or has so much lag it’s not worth using. William Robinson - 2 years ago Reply Another requirement, apparently, is having a lightning equipped iPad. I assume a 30 pin connector version isn’t going to cut it. mochachaiguy - 2 years ago Reply The front page of Duet’s web site claims it works with both lightning and 30 pin connectors. Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago Reply 30-pin is fine – sorry, I should have said that, will add a note. antoninygaard (@antoninygaard) - 2 years ago Reply On duets website they state all Macs 10.9 + so where do they say it only works with 2013 macs? Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago Reply Edit: The software I had was a pre-release version. With the latest version, it’s still a little laggy on my MBP17 but perfectly usable, even for video. Duet Display (@duetdisplay) - 2 years ago Hey Ben, Would you mind amending that quote “Duet says that the app works only with 2013 Macs and later (running OS X 10.9 or later), and this is pretty much correct–but not the whole story.” Duet is compatible with All Macs running 10.9+, performance will improve based on the speed of your Mac’s processor. An older Macbook Pro, Mac Pro or Mac Mini with a faster processor than a post-2013 Mac will perform just as smoothly if not better. Sorry to ask, but we’ve had some confused customers emailing us. antoninygaard (@antoninygaard) - 2 years ago Cool, thx for info hungarianhc - 2 years ago Reply This article really made me want a 17″ MacBook Pro again… I’m officially a two computer guy. I have my 11″ MacBook Air, and I use that for most of my travel. My 15″ rMBP is usually plugged into a monitor, but I take it with me from time to time. Would love to do the same with a 17″ rMBP!!! Colby Landwehr - 2 years ago Reply This will be perfect for doing homework on the go Compucolor II (@compucolorii) - 2 years ago Reply This should really be a built-in feature of iOS and OS X – it’s the sort of seamless connectivity that Apple is known for! (And when you plug your iPad in you should also automatically get audio/video/MIDI connectivity between both systems.) William Robinson - 2 years ago Reply Apple might build this in, but only if they could require the iPadAir 3 as the base hardware. Or whatever the next bit of hardware they want us to upgrade to.. Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago Reply Yes, it does seem like a missed opportunity by Apple. Michael Dryja - 2 years ago Reply I’m a 17″ MBP owner myself. I’m guessing the reason why you’re having the performance letdown is that the MBP 17 uses USB2 instead of USB3. But . . . . there are lightning to USB3 adapters. I have the Kanexx one. Will need to test this solution! hijaszu - 2 years ago Reply I wasn’t able to have it without a lag, after two updates as well. Ended up requesting a refund. I have other things to do than trying to wait for the developer to trying to make it work. It was not with minor issues, it was non-working at all. PT o'Baileys (@Usr_NeXT) - 2 years ago Reply For those of you, like me, that use Airplay Mirroring to Apple TV a lot, these 3rd display apps are not currently compatible. I use Duet but need to uninstall it when streaming from my Mac to my Apple TV. Rupert Behrmann (@rupertbe) - 2 years ago Reply I already work with a second screen. Will this app let me use my iPad as a third screen? Ben Lovejoy - 2 years ago Reply Yes Ntopix Blog (@NTOPIX) - 2 years ago Reply If you don’t need the touch capability of the iPad you’re better off with a cheap monitor. This is basically a novelty item for people who have a Mac and an iPad. I DO use air display but it’s for remote control of my system from a distance. Yes there’s lag but I deal with it because of the functionality it gives me. If Apple was really behind touch they would release a 27 inch touch screen companion monitor for the iMac line of computers. Albert Rosenbrand (@arosenbrand) - 2 years ago Reply Just bought the app. Disappointing that it cannot be used as a monitor while editing in Adobe Premiere. Once I move the Program window into my iPad it turns black. Ali Ayāzi - 2 years ago Reply I have similar experience with Photoshop. It crashes shortly after I open it while iPad is the only display. Jose Maria Lopez (@pechito37) - 2 years ago Reply Hi there, I have a 3 monitor Pc for gaming. I tried to use the Duet with my ipad as a 4th monitor to put a dash for my racing game. Before running the game all looks ok but as soon as I run the game the monitors (the 3 on the pc and the ipad) goes black and can not do anything. Anyone can help me with this? Thanks Steven Benson - 12 months ago Reply I’ve been using something quite similar for a few years now called “Air Display”. Something absolutely required for our leverage of the application is using the iPad as a mobile extension of the workstation it is attached to. For us that means I take the iPad with me throughout the building and can leverage the horsepower of my workstation with the iPad, driving the workstation via my fingertips on the screen of the iPad. Air Display is available for the Mac but I have never tried using it at home. We happen to have three iPads at home not doing much. I should be using them as second and third displays. Thanks for the reminder! Ryan Hughes (@Ryan_Hughes34) - 9 months ago Reply I have been using my iPad pro as a portable second screen for my macbook and it works great. I especially like to to position the iPad in landscape mode to make reading documents easier (the UAG case is awesome btw). Sometimes starting duet display can take a few seconds, but when it connects there is very little lag. Is there a way to connect a second iPad pro to my laptop to have 3 screens on the go? I often work remotely and would love to maximize desktop space. Wandering Conleys - 6 days ago Reply I work remotely and am often away from my home office setup. I really love using Duet with my iPad to add a little extra screen real estate to my 15″ rMBP. It works really smoothly.

But for Apple investors, this is the only number that matters: $134.54. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The iPhone may have just celebrated its 10th birthday. But for Apple investors, this is the only number that matters: $134.54. That is the all-time high for Apple's stock -- which it last hit nearly 21 months ago back on April 28, 2015. Apple has been mostly stuck in a rut since then, even as investors embraced fellow tech stocks, most notably the FANG of Four. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet have all hit new records more recently than Apple. But there are several reasons to believe that Apple might finally be back on track. The stock has had a nice run lately, gaining about 8% since the presidential election. Although tech investors were initially nervous about Donald Trump's win because of some antagonistic tweets about Silicon Valley leaders, Apple and other tech stocks have since enjoyed a strong rally. Part of that is due to the more general hope that Trump's policies will boost corporate and consumer spending. That obviously would help Apple and other gadget makers. But there are also growing hopes that the Trump administration may lower some corporate taxes, which could entice Apple and other tech giants hoarding cash overseas -- like Microsoft and Google -- to bring that back to the U.S. Apple currently has $237.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet. CFO Luca Maestri said during Apple's most recent earnings call with investors in October that $216 billion of that iMountain was being held overseas. If Apple is able to repatriate -- i.e. bring back -- that cash to the U.S., the company could potentially use it on acquisitions, stock buybacks or higher dividends. Investors would probably approve of that. Another cause for optimism? Growing hopes that the recent iPhone 7 will continue to sell well, especially due to the massive problems facing Android rival Samsung in the wake of its fire-prone (and now defunct) Galaxy Note 7. There is also growing excitement about the 10th-anniversary version of the iPhone that will be unveiled later this year. Will Apple call it the iPhone 8? The Ocho? Skip 8 and 9 altogether and call it the 10? Or maybe name it the iPhone X if Apple wants to mimic the NFL and start using Roman numerals? Whatever the newest iPhone is called, investors are hoping that there will be enough new bells and whistles to live up to the hype -- and help dispel the notion that Apple has lost its innovative edge since Steve Jobs died and Tim Cook has led the company. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a report earlier this week that patience is still required with Apple's stock. But he thinks that the stock should start gaining momentum as optimism builds about the next iPhone. And Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty is even more optimistic. She just named Apple as her top large hardware stock pick for the year, citing expectations of Apple bringing back cash from overseas as well as broader tax reform under Trump. But Huberty argues that perhaps the biggest catalyst for Apple will be iPhone sales in China. Even though Apple has faced tough competition from Chinese smartphone rivals like Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo and Oppo, Huberty thinks that those companies are catering more to the lower-end of the market. She believes that once Apple does unveil a major upgrade to the iPhone, the company's market share in China will tick higher again. "Investors worry Apple has lost its edge in China. We don't believe this is the case," she wrote. "High-end Chinese users are committed to Apple but are waiting for a more meaningful change...to upgrade." Huberty thinks that Apple will hit a new all-time high over the next year. Her 12-month price target is $148 --nearly 25% higher than current levels. In her extremely bullish case for the stock, which calls for much higher earnings growth than expected, the stock could hit $190. That's a more than 60% increase. And at that price, Apple's market value would wind up topping the mythical $1 trillion level -- a first for a U.S. company. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Don't Miss: Apple’s courage is driving me insane While testing the 13-inch MacBook Pro for example (the non-TouchBar model), Consumer Reports found that battery life fluctuated between 4.5 hours on the low-end and 19.5 hours on the high-end. Clearly, something was amiss. Shortly thereafter, Apple said that it was working closely with Consumer Reports in an effort to figure out why CR’s battery testing results didn’t correspond to Apple’s own internal tests. After looking into the matter, Apple earlier today relayed that it has finally identified the root of the problem. As it turns out, Consumer Reports conducted their MacBook Pro testing with a “hidden Safari setting turned on” which served to turn off Safari’s cache. Apple’s statement on the matter, via Consumer Reports, reads: We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro. Why Consumer Reports opted to test Apple’s new MacBook Pros with the aforementioned setting switched on remains a point of interest, though the cynics among us might posit that CR never misses an opportunity to generate a controversial headline. For what it’s worth, CR had this to say about its testing procedures: We also turn off the local caching of web pages. In our tests, we want the computer to load each web page as if it were new content from the internet, rather than resurrecting the data from its local drive. This allows us to collect consistent results across the testing of many laptops, and it also puts batteries through a tougher workout. In any event, Apple has issued a software fix via its Beta Software Program that should help any affected MacBook Pros deliver more consistent battery life.

Andrew Cunningham - Jan 12, 2017 10:48 pm UTC Enlarge / The new MacBook Pro. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 217 Share this story Further ReadingExplaining the battery life problems with the new MacBook Pros Update: Consumer Reports has given the new MacBook Pros a "Recommended" rating after re-testing them. The publication does note that the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar does significantly outperform the Touch Bar model despite Apple's claims that the two have the same battery life, which is in line with the findings in our reviews. Original story: In late December, review publication Consumer Reports made headlines by failing to provide a "Recommended" rating to Apple's latest MacBook Pros. It was the first time any of Apple's MacBooks had failed to earn the rating. In the publication's testing, the laptops' battery life varied wildly, sometimes lasting as long as 19.5 hours and sometimes as little as 3.75 hours. The publication didn't have these problems with older MacBook Pros or with any of the 140 other laptops it has rated. After working with Apple over the holidays, Consumer Reports now says that the problem was caused by an "obscure" Safari bug specific to page caching, which the publication disables when it runs its battery tests. To test battery life, Consumer Reports sets laptop screens to a specific brightness level and then loads a series of webpages in the laptop's default browser (Safari in this case) in a loop until the battery dies. Apple suggests that disabling browser caching for a test like this doesn't reflect real-world use, but it does make sense for a synthetic test—users will continually read new pages rather than visiting the same static pages over and over again, so Consumer Reports wants to make sure that its test is actually downloading data over the network rather than simply reading cached data from the disk. Apple says it has fixed the bug in the latest macOS Sierra beta that it released to testers yesterday, the third beta of version 10.12.3. The 10.12.2 update "fixed" inaccurate battery life estimates in the new Pros by disabling the battery life estimate entirely across all Mac laptops that run Sierra. Browser bug or no, Consumer Reports hasn't been the only publication to report disappointing battery life from the new MacBook Pros. We covered some of the reasons why the new laptops' battery life is more usage-dependent than in the previous model and how the GPU and the new Touch Bar could be affecting battery life. It was also reported that Apple originally planned to use a different kind of battery in the MacBook Pros, one that was contoured to the case to maximize its size a la the 12-inch MacBook. Problems reportedly found during the development process forced Apple to use a more conventional battery with less capacity. Consumer Reports says it will re-test the laptops' batteries and revisit its rating depending on what it finds.

Apple, Facebook and Google top Greenpeace’s clean energy report Posted Jan 10, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Elon Musk plays Overwatch, thinks storytelling is neglected in modern games Apple has earned the title of greenest tech company in the world for the third year in a row, according to a new report from environmental organization Greenpeace. In a new report, “Clicking Clean: Who is Winning the Race to Build a Green Internet,” Apple lead the pack with an “A” grade and a clean energy index score of 83 percent. Facebook and Google also did well, with scores of 67 and 56 percent, respectively, along with data center provider Switch, which scored 100 percent. However, Netflix, Amazon Web Services and Samsung were found to be lagging. Greenpeace’s clean energy index accounts for how much clean energy the companies use from renewable resources, as well as other factors, such as their willingness to make their energy consumption publicly available, and their commitment to powering their data centers with renewable energy, for example. Because of these companies’ size, they have the power to influence others in the industry when it comes to the use of clean energy. As the report noted, Apple plays a “catalytic role within its IT supply chain, pushing other IT data centers and cloud operators who help deliver pieces of Apple’s corner of the internet to follow their lead in powering their operations with renewable energy.” Facebook also received accolades for being the first major internet company to commit to be 100 percent renewably powered, and it continues to play a leadership role in the sector. Its five latest data centers were renewably powered, Greenpeace pointed out.   Google, too, has been taking steps toward a renewably powered Google Cloud, and is improving its deployment of renewable energy in new markets, but was dinged for being less transparent than others, including Apple, Facebook and Switch, in terms of providing facility level energy demand data. The report called out major tech companies Netflix, Amazon, Samsung, and others. It also for the first time analyzed Asian tech giants, like Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and Naver, which are expanding to become global businesses. That region is “well behind the U.S. market in renewable commitments,” said Greenpeace, citing fewer clean energy options from monopoly utilities. This is of particular concern for environmental organization, given these companies’ ongoing growth and expansion. “We must see East Asian internet companies exhibiting the will to commit to 100 percent renewable energy, particularly as they expand to markets around the world,” said Greenpeace East Asia Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner Jude Lee, in a statement. “Leading IT companies in the United States have already shown that the majority of the industry recognizes that clean power is both good for the environment and good for business. East Asian companies must step up to embrace that reality as well,” Lee added. Meanwhile, Netflix, which accounts for one-third of North America’s internet traffic and contributes to data demand worldwide, had announced in 2015 it planned to fully offset its carbon footprint. However, Greenpeace said that it’s likely that it’s turning to carbon offsets or unbundled renewable energy credits, which “do little” in terms of increasing the company’s renewable energy investment. “Like Apple, Facebook, and Google, Netflix is one of the biggest drivers of the online world and has a critical say in how it is powered. Netflix must embrace the responsibility to make sure its growth is powered by renewables, not fossil fuels and it must show its leadership here,” said Greenpeace USA Senior IT Analyst, Gary Cook, also in a statement. The company earned “F’s” in energy transparency, renewable energy commitment and advocacy. Amazon’s overall Clean Energy Index percentage fell from last year, thanks in part to its nearly doubling of its data center capacity in Virginia – a region with little to no renewable energy options, the organization said – which outstripped Amazon’s addition of renewable energy capacity. Amazon was also awarded an “F” for its energy transparency. “Amazon continues to talk a good game on renewables but is keeping its customers in the dark on its energy decisions. This is concerning, particularly as Amazon expands into markets served by dirty energy,” said Cook. However, Greenpeace did give it a nod for its increased clean energy and climate advocacy over the past year. Amazon’s advocacy with both policymakers and utility companies saw it supporting tax credits for clean energy, pushing for repeal of laws that restrict wind development, and negotiating an innovative energy management deal in Virginia, which saw the Dominion Virginia Power agreeing to integrate energy produced by Amazon’s wind and solar farm projects on the grid serving its AWS data centers. Greenpeace noted that nearly 20 internet companies have now committed to 100 percent renewable energy. But the fight isn’t over, as the sector itself continues to rapidly expand. “Thanks to the leadership and advocacy of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Switch, we are seeing the tech industry make major strides toward powering the internet with clean energy,” said Cook. Update, 1/13/17: Following the release of the report, Greenpeace began a social campaign to raise awareness about those companies who received poor grades for their use of non-renewable energy. For example, the organization released the video below which targets Netflix: 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Greenpeace Founded 1971 Overview Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organization acting to change attitudes and behavior, to protect and conserve the environment.

The news comes after Consumer Reports made waves around the internet several weeks ago when it chose not to recommend Apple’s new laptops after experiencing wildly variable battery life on the updated models, making them the first MacBook computers to not receive a Consumer Reports recommendation. Apple is still standing by its advertised battery claims and said that the low battery results were due to a software bug in Safari’s developer mode that specifically affected Consumer Reports’ test methodology. The test apparently “uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache,” which Apple claims most consumers would never use (and therefore, never encounter the battery life affecting bug). Additionally, Apple said that once it had identified the issue, “We asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings,” and “they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.” Apple is also issuing a software update to Safari to fix the bug. Meanwhile, Consumer Reports says that it will be re-running its battery life test with the software update in place and update its recommendation upon completion. Consumer Reports notes that it disabled caching in Safari for consistent testing across platforms. However, even if Apple’s update does solve Consumer Reports’ battery life issues, there are still unanswered questions regarding battery life on the new MacBook Pros. Despite Apple’s claims that its own data hasn’t shown any problems, numerous users and reviewers — including The Verge — have experienced variable battery life on the new laptops that the developer mode cache issue doesn’t seem to explain.

[Shutterstock - pawinpummarin]    5414549 Apple filed a proposal in December to further manufacturing in Arizona, possibly signaling its intention to vamp up production activity in America. President-elect Donald Trump said during a meeting with The New York Times in November that he had a productive conversation with Apple CEO Tim Cook about manufacturing concerns. “I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here,'” Trump explained. “I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible,” Trump continued. It is not exactly clear if Apple’s latest decision to increase production activity in the U.S. is due to the political climate and the impending ascension of Trump. The notice, though, details Apple’s intent to grow its manufacturing capacity in Mesa, Arizona. “Apple already has authority to produce certain components for consumer electronics” in the area, reads the notice published Monday in the Federal Register. “The current request would add finished products and foreign status materials/components to the scope of authority.” The proposal provides a lengthy list of foreign materials (in total 71) likely to be manufactured into finished products at the facility, including plastic bags, fan blades, electric motors, magnets, lithium batteries, microphones, power strips, optical fiber cables, metal furniture, and many other items.(RELATED: Try Not To Feel Old: The iPhone Just Turned 10) Apple expanding manufacturing in the U.S. may become a pattern in years to come, after a report released in November by a Japanese financial newspaper said that the tech conglomerate is considering moving iPhone production to the States.

Laptops by Dan Ackerman January 10, 2017 9:42 AM PST @danackerman Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Battery tests run by CNET Labs fell within our acceptable parameters across multiple runs.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Last month, venerable product testing publication Consumer Reports said it couldn't recommend Apple's latest MacBook Pro models because of inconsistent battery life results. On the 13-inch model, CR got battery runs that ranged from 16 hours down to less than four hours. After working with Consumer Reports to figure out why its tests we not giving the expected results, Apple and the publication on Tuesday announced a possible culprit. For its battery testing in MacBooks, Consumer Reports used a developer mode in Safari that turned off the browser cache. By itself, that wouldn't have made the battery life so wildly inconsistent. But that developer mode also contained a previously unknown bug that Apple says affected the battery score. In a statement Tuesday, Apple said the publication's previous tests didn't reflect consumer usage and that developer bug has now been fixed. "We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. This is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro." While some consumers have also complained about battery life that fell short of Apple's promised 10 hours on the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models, the tests run by CNET Labs fell within our acceptable parameters across multiple test runs. (Every publication and testing organization, including CNET Labs, uses its own proprietary battery test methodology). At the time, I wrote: "Battery life is the big question here. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar ran for 10:07 on our streaming video playback test, which matches up with Apple's predicted 10 hours of battery life. The lower-end 13-inch Pro without the Touch Bar ran for an even more impressive 11:36 in same test, beating Apple's estimates." In an updated blog of on its website, Consumer Reports said, "Once our retesting of the MacBook Pro's batteries is complete, we will report back with our update and findings." 53 Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Does the Mac still matter?

Register for an Exam Today> Apple Proved a Phone Can Change the World in Just 10 Years By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: JANUARY 10 2017 Few people realized it at the time, but the world shifted fundamentally a decade ago when Steve Jobs pulled the first iPhone from Apple's bag of technological tricks. "Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything," Jobs declared as he paced across a San Francisco stage. It obviously wasn't an empty boast. We all know now that Jobs' "magical product" has reshaped culture, shaken up industries, put computers in billions of pockets and made it possible to do just about anything with a few taps on a screen. Besides its then 3.5-inch touch screen, the first iPhone featured a browser for on-the-go web surfing and built-in apps to check email and get directions. Going Mobile Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since its debut, spawning millions of mobile applications and prodding other technology companies to make similar smartphones that have become like phantom limbs for many of us. We use iPhones and their copycats to instantly share video and pictures with friends and family from almost anywhere. We use them to figure out where we are going. We use them to find the best deals while shopping in stores and to pay for stuff at the checkout stand. We use the phones to a hail ride, to tune instruments, to monitor our health and help find our next jobs. Phones have gotten so smart that they even talk back to us via helpful digital concierges such as the iPhone's Siri and the recently introduced Assistant on Google's Pixel phone. "IPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live," Apple's current CEO, Tim Cook, boasted in a retrospective that the Cupertino, California, company posted on its website. Roadkill in Its Wake The iPhone's revolutionary touch screen doomed the BlackBerry, another once-popular internet-connected phone. Mobile phones and their tablet cousins triggered a downturn in personal computer sales that is still unfolding. An estimated 219 million desktop and laptop computers shipped worldwide last year, down from 264 million in 2007, according to the research firm Gartner Inc. Meanwhile, nearly 1.9 billion mobile phones shipped last year, up from 1.15 billion in 2007. All told, Gartner estimates about 5 billion mobile phones are currently in use around the world compared to 1.3 billion PCs. The eroding popularity of PCs spurred shake-ups at powerful tech companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, none of which adapted nimbly to the mobile world unleashed by the iPhone. Then-Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer scoffed at Apple's glass-and-metal gadget, telling USA Today in April 2007 that "there's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance." Microsoft wound up squandering the $7.6 billion that it spent to buy phone maker Nokia in a futile attempt to catch up to the iPhone. Ballmer stepped down as CEO three years ago and was replaced by Satya Nadella, who introduced versions of Microsoft's popular Office programs that worked on Apple's iPad -- a tablet based on the iPhone. A Huge Hit ... and then a Stall The iPhone's success helped make Jobs a revered figure for many, and one whose October 2011 death was mourned around the world. The device has established Apple as the world's most profitable company with earnings of $45.7 billion on sales of $216 billion during its latest fiscal year. (Prior to the iPhone's release, Apple posted an annual profit of $2 billion on sales of $19.3 billion.) Its stock-market value is hovering around $635 billion, thanks to a split-adjusted stock price that's risen by nearly a factor of 10 since the iPhone's debut. Lately, though, the iPhone appears to be losing some steam. People are keeping older models for longer before upgrading or switching over to competing phones that run on Google's Android software. Apple suffered its first-ever decline in iPhone sales in its last fiscal year, causing the company to miss its revenue projections and hitting Cook with a 15 percent pay cut . Most smartphones now run on Android, partly because Google gives away the software. That has helped iPhone rivals woo price conscious consumers, especially outside the U.S., with phones that are much cheaper than the iPhone, whose latest models now cost more than $649 to $849. In his statement, though, Cook promised the iPhone is "just getting started. The best is yet to come." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Apple: Phone Can Change the World Next Article > Apple To Manufacture Data Server Cabinets in Mesa, Arizona Facility By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: JANUARY 10 2017 Tech giant Apple took a big step toward expanding its production facility in Mesa, Arizona last month when it requested permission from the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ) Board to expand the types of devices it can build and components it can import to the facility, according to a report on the Federal Registry. The company is looking to repurpose the site to build data server cabinets for use in enterprise data centers, according to the Mesa city government. Since Apple does not currently sell such cabinets, the company may plan to use the machines in its own data centers or may be looking to expand its offerings. Expanded Authority The Mesa production facility that Apple is looking to expand originally belonged to GT Advanced, a defunct manufacturer that used to supply Sapphire glass for Apple devices. When the company declared bankruptcy, Apple took ownership of the plant. If the FTZ Board approves Apple's request for permission to import components and build new devices at the site, the company's production costs could fall significantly. Production under FTZ procedures could exempt Apple from customs duty payments on the foreign materials/components used in export production. "On its domestic sales, Apple would be able to choose the duty rate during customs entry procedures that applies to finished server assembly cabinets (duty-free) for the foreign-status materials/components noted below and in the existing scope of authority," the filing stated. "Customs duties also could possibly be deferred or reduced on foreign-status production equipment." Like many modern manufacturers, Apple's products include a wide variety of components, many of which are sourced from countries around the world. Everything from fiber optic cables to lithium batteries to LEDs are sourced from manufacturers located overseas. The company's iPhone models and other devices are assembled in countries like China, where labor costs are significantly cheaper. Political Pressure If Apple goes through with the plan, the move would be a rare case of a U.S. tech company moving production and manufacturing operations stateside, although Apple does already build some servers in Oregon and elsewhere in Arizona. The expanded FTZ authorization would effectively consolidate that production into the Mesa facility, which the company said will provide the local job market with some 150 high-paid positions. Several manufacturers have come under scrutiny recently for decisions to expand their operations in other countries while closing factories in the U.S. In particular, President-elect Donald Trump has called out companies such as Toyota, Carrier, and Ford over Twitter after they announced plans to open plants in Mexico. Trump specifically mentioned Apple and its products by name during the presidential campaign, saying that if he were elected, the company would be encouraged to assemble the iPhone in the U.S. Trump reportedly called Apple CEO Tim Cook after the election to discuss the company moving more of its manufacturing operations to the States.

Apple: Phone Can Change the World Next Article > Apple Veteran and Swift Creator Heads to Tesla By Ina Fried PUBLISHED: JANUARY 11 2017 The head of Apple's Swift programming language is leaving the company, according to an email he posted to a community forum. Chris Lattner said that he was stepping aside as project lead for Swift as he prepares to leave the company later this month for an unspecified new venture. Ted Kremenek will take over his duties, Lattner said. (Update: Tesla announced Tuesday afternoon that Lattner was joining to head its autopilot software efforts.) Apple introduced Swift in 2014 as an all-new way to write apps for Apple devices and then released the software into the open-source community in 2015. Lattner has been at Apple since 2005 and most recently has been a senior director heading its developer tools organization. Before Apple he created LLVM, another set of open-source programming tools. Lattner's post on Swift.org was highlighted earlier Tuesday in a post on Daring Fireball. Here is Lattner's full note: Since Apple launched Swift at WWDC 2014, the Swift team has worked closely with our developer community. When we made Swift open source and launched Swift.org we put a lot of effort into defining a strong community structure. This structure has enabled Apple and the amazingly vibrant Swift community to work together to evolve Swift into a powerful, mature language powering software used by hundreds of millions of people. I'm happy to announce that Ted Kremenek will be taking over for me as "Project Lead" for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org. This recognizes the incredible effort he has already been putting into the project, and reflects a decision I've made to leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space. This decision wasn't made lightly, and I want you all to know that I'm still completely committed to Swift. I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list. Working with many phenomenal teams at Apple to launch Swift has been a unique life experience. Apple is a truly amazing place to be able to assemble the skills, imagination, and discipline to pull something like this off. Swift is in great shape today, and Swift 4 will be a really strong release with Ted as the Project Lead. Note that this isn't a change to the structure -- just to who sits in which role - so we don't expect it to impact day-to-day operations in the Swift Core Team in any significant way. Ted and I wanted to let you know what is happening as a part of our commitment to keeping the structure of Swift.org transparent to our community. -- Chris © 2017 Re/Code under contract with NewsEdge.

Apple has reportedly cut its iPhone build plans -- again. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 10, 2017 at 12:00PM In the fall of 2016, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its next-generation iPhones, branded iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These phones included a number of significant enhancements, such as more colorful and color-accurate displays, faster processors, improved cameras, stereo speakers, a solid-state home button, and faster wireless connectivity. Image source: Apple.  Indeed, aside from the fact that the look and feel of the devices were very similar to the prior two generations of iPhone models, the new devices represented significant upgrades from the prior-generation ones. The new iPhone models seemed to be off to a good start, with Apple CEO Tim Cook saying on an October earnings call that the company, at the time, had yet to reach supply demand balance for its new phones. Nevertheless, a recent report from BlueFin Research Partners, by way of Barron's, says that Apple has yet again cut its iPhone products plans, suggesting the new devices might not be able to keep sales momentum up until the company launches its next-generation iPhones in the fall. Slashing estimates some more BlueFin's initial iPhone unit shipment estimates for the March quarter sat at 59 million. That figure, if Apple were still on track to that goal, would have represented solid year-over-year growth from roughly 51 million units shipped in the March-ending quarter of the prior year, though still down from the roughly 61 million units that Apple shipped in the March-ending quarter of its fiscal 2015. However, the analysts cut their estimates to 53 million last month, according to Barron's, and they're now taking those estimates to just 50 million units. If the analysts are right, then Apple might be looking at another -- albeit modest -- year-over-year decline in unit shipments during the March-ending quarter. Considering that some of Apple's chief rivals, particularly in China, are posting substantial year-over-year smartphone unit growth -- and it's not all happening at the low end of the market -- it's starting to look as though this product cycle isn't going to be a particularly good one for Apple, either. All eyes on the next cycle Apple may have made a mistake in not significantly changing the look and feel of the iPhone models that launched in the fall. There had been rumors before the launches of those devices that Apple was looking to slim down the iPhone models significantly from the ones launched in the prior two cycles, but this ultimately didn't come to pass. Image source: Apple.  Apple is known to test out multiple different potential models before deciding on the final designs and putting them into mass production. Perhaps Apple found that it would have had to make too many technical sacrifices -- perhaps on battery life, processing power, or something else -- to slim down the phones, ultimately going with devices with a similar look and feel to the iPhone 6 series and iPhone 6s series. It'll be interesting to see what Apple ultimately launches later this year, but consumers aren't responding to the numerous "under-the-hood" changes that the company introduced with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 series devices. A fresh look and feel for its iPhone devices could be just what Apple needs to get its iPhone business back on a solid growth path. Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

An essential MacBook user battery condition guide Why did Apple take the ‘ding’ out of the universe? Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell If you have a memory that stretches back further than the last week you may recall the barrage of ‘bad Apple’ publicity generated when Consumer Reports said it could not recommend Apple’s all-new MacBook Pro because: #battery life. Problem solved Well, it turns out that Apple has found a way to fix the problem – and that the problem really shouldn’t be a problem for most Mac users. [To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page.] Consumer Reports confirms this in its latest report: “Apple Releases Fix to MacBook Pros in Response to Consumer Reports' Battery Test Results.” Apple has identified that during the MacBook Pro tests, Consumer Reports used the Safari Develop Menu to disable caching in Safari. This invoked a now identified browser flaw that would only impact a small number of users. Apple is addressing the problem (it is testing a patch) and Consumer Reports is rerunning the tests. “Once our retesting of the MacBook Pro’s batteries is complete, we will report back with our update and findings,” they said. Apple moved fast Shortly after publication of the original results in the week before Christmas, Apple’s Marketing chief, Phil Schiller, said these problems had not been visible in the company’s own tests. He vowed to work with Consumer Reports to get to the bottom of things.  That's what the company has done. Apple’s statement on the matter (partially published by Consumer reports): “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing websites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro.” Food for thought It is interesting that Apple’s MacBook Pro was judged so harshly on the basis of an obscure Safari Developer setting most Mac users won’t ever use. It is also interesting that Consumer Reports chose to publish its report based on these tests only days after informing Apple of the results in the week before Christmas. I have been using a new model MacBook Pro since mid-November and have not experienced anything like the inconsistency that was being claimed in battery life on the system. Instead, I found battery life to remain consistent even while I left the Mac aside while indulging in festive celebrations (sic) for a few days. That’s a subjective opinion, of course, and should be taken with a pinch of salt. It remains to be seen if the criticism that followed publication of the report will still be seen as valid once new test results are published. I’d hazard the guess that at least some members of Apple’s Macintosh teams kind of wish they’d been able to enjoy a Christmas break, rather than entering damage control on this problem.  I also imagine Consumer Reports is now likely to end up recommending Apple's new Macs after all, once testing is complete. I wonder if that story will spread as wide as the criticism? Google+?

Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-01-10 17:53:13 UTC Consumer Reports sparked controversy late last month when it put out a report saying it couldn't recommend Apple's new MacBook Pros on account of inconsistent battery life. Naturally, Apple sprang into defense mode with Phil Schiller, the company's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, taking issue with the non-profit organization's testing methods. Schiller said Apple would work with Consumer Reports to understand their battery tests. Well, it looks like Apple's figured out why Consumer Reports' MacBook Pro battery tests didn't match its own. SEE ALSO: Apple responds to damning MacBook Pro battery test "We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing websites which turns off the browser cache....," Apple said in a statement to Consumer Reports. "We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test." According to Consumer Reports, turning off the web browser's cache (a feature that stores website snippets on a computer's hard drive for quicker loading times later) is a standard part of its all of its laptop battery tests. "We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results," Apple told Mashable. "This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. [Consumer Reports’] use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.... This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro." Though the bug has been patched in the latest Beta Software Program release, Consumer Reports has not concluded new battery tests yet. The non-profit says it'll run its tests again with the bug fix (and presumably with Safari's cache still turned off) and if the new battery results are "consistently high" it'll change its rating for the new MacBook Pros to "recommended."  "Consumer Reports is rerunning its battery life tests on the MacBook Pros with Safari's cache setting switched off, as per our normal protocol," a Consumer Reports rep told Mashable over email. "After downloading Apple's fix, we no longer expect this to cause wildly inconsistent battery life. If that's the case, the MacBook Pros will receive our recommendation. We'll have final results by the end of the week."

Read more on Electrek. Veteran Apple employee Chris Lattner shared publicly today that he is leaving the company after more than a decade. Lattner is widely known in the Apple development community as dev-friendly force within the company and the leading figure behind Apple’s Swift programming language. Lattner is also the creator of the LLVM project and worked at Apple since 2005 where he headed up developer-focused projects including Xcode. As Project Lead, Lattner has been the voice of Swift for Apple until now. He writes that Ted Kremenek will become the new Project Lead for Apple’s Swift programming language following his exit from the company. I’m happy to announce that Ted Kremenek will be taking over for me as “Project Lead” for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org. This recognizes the incredible effort he has already been putting into the project, and reflects a decision I’ve made to leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space. This decision wasn’t made lightly, and I want you all to know that I’m still completely committed to Swift. I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list. As for the future of Swift, Lattner adds that Swift 4 is currently in development and will ship with Kremenek’s lead. Back in December, Apple reiterated its plans to release Swift 3.1 in Spring 2017; we’ll likely hear more about Swift 4 at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference typically held in early June. Lattner’s departure comes one year after Swift officially went open source which was promised from the start. Aside from modern developer iOS apps, Apple’s programming language has been the focus of the company’s Playgrounds iPad app which offers a fun introduction to the programming language. Apple has promoted Swift at free workshops at its retail stores using the Playgrounds app as well.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Jef Cozza. Updated January 10, 2017 9:47AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple Servers Data Centers Enterprise IT Donald Trump Government Technology News Tech giant Apple took a big step toward expanding its production facility in Mesa, Arizona last month when it requested permission from the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ) Board to expand the types of devices it can build and components it can import to the facility, according to a report on the Federal Registry. The company is looking to repurpose the site to build data server cabinets for use in enterprise data centers, according to the Mesa city government. Since Apple does not currently sell such cabinets, the company may plan to use the machines in its own data centers or may be looking to expand its offerings. Expanded Authority The Mesa production facility that Apple is looking to expand originally belonged to GT Advanced, a defunct manufacturer that used to supply Sapphire glass for Apple devices. When the company declared bankruptcy, Apple took ownership of the plant. If the FTZ Board approves Apple's request for permission to import components and build new devices at the site, the company's production costs could fall significantly. Production under FTZ procedures could exempt Apple from customs duty payments on the foreign materials/components used in export production. "On its domestic sales, Apple would be able to choose the duty rate during customs entry procedures that applies to finished server assembly cabinets (duty-free) for the foreign-status materials/components noted below and in the existing scope of authority," the filing stated. "Customs duties also could possibly be deferred or reduced on foreign-status production equipment." Like many modern manufacturers, Apple's products include a wide variety of components, many of which are sourced from countries around the world. Everything from fiber optic cables to lithium batteries to LEDs are sourced from manufacturers located overseas. The company's iPhone models and other devices are assembled in countries like China, where labor costs are significantly cheaper. Political Pressure If Apple goes through with the plan, the move would be a rare case of a U.S. tech company moving production and manufacturing operations stateside, although Apple does already build some servers in Oregon and elsewhere in Arizona. The expanded FTZ authorization would effectively consolidate that production into the Mesa facility, which the company said will provide the local job market with some 150 high-paid positions. Several manufacturers have come under scrutiny recently for decisions to expand their operations in other countries while closing factories in the U.S. In particular, President-elect Donald Trump has called out companies such as Toyota, Carrier, and Ford over Twitter after they announced plans to open plants in Mexico. Trump specifically mentioned Apple and its products by name during the presidential campaign, saying that if he were elected, the company would be encouraged to assemble the iPhone in the U.S. Trump reportedly called Apple CEO Tim Cook after the election to discuss the company moving more of its manufacturing operations to the States.

Next Article > Backpage Execs Refuse To Testify at Sex-Trafficking Hearing By Matthew Daly. Updated January 10, 2017. Executives at the advertising website Backpage.com refused to testify before Congress Tuesday following a Senate report that accuses the site of systematically editing its "adult" ads to remove words that indicate sex trafficking. Four top executives and the company's lawyer told a Senate subcommittee they were invoking their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report Monday charging that Backpage has created a lucrative marketplace that makes child sex trafficking easier. The report cites internal documents showing that up to 80 percent of the site's ads are edited to conceal the true nature of the underlying transaction. Backpage has denied the allegations, and the site shuttered its "adult" section in the U.S. Monday night to protest what it calls government censorship. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the subcommittee's chairman, said Backpage's actions validated the panel's report, adding that Backpage has "put profits ahead of vulnerable women and children." Backpage has shown it is "intent on profiting from human trafficking -- and human misery -- and profit they have, at the expense of countless innocent victims," Portman said as the Backpage executives sat stone-faced in front of him. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the panel's top Democrat, called Backpage "a $600 million company built on selling sex -- and importantly, built on selling sex with children." Rather than turn away ads that sell girls as young as 12 for sex, Backpage executives "just tried to make it less obvious," McCaskill said. The committee's report said the company used a computer program to find and delete words such as "Lolita," ''cheerleader," ''teenager" and "young." The editing practices amounted to "coaching" traffickers and pimps in how to make their ads appears legitimate while continuing to sell girls and boys into prostitution and modern-day slavery, McCaskill said. "That, ladies and gentlemen, is the definition of evil -- simply evil," she said. The Senate hearing comes a day after the Supreme Court said it won't hear an appeal from three sex trafficking victims who accuse Backpage of helping to promote the exploitation of children. The justices left in place a lower court ruling that said federal law shields Backpage from liability because the site is just hosting content created by people who use it. The women say they were sold as prostitutes in Massachusetts and Rhode Island through advertisements for escort services on the site when they were as young as 15. A federal judge threw out the lawsuit and the federal appeals court in Boston upheld that ruling. In a separate case last month, a California judge rejected pimping charges against Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer and former owners Michael Lacey and James Larkin, citing federal free speech laws. California officials have said they intend to pursue new charges against the company based on new evidence. Prosecutors have alleged that more than 90 percent of Backpage's revenue -- millions of dollars each month -- comes from adult escort ads that use coded language and nearly nude photos to offer sex for money. The Senate report says that despite public claims to the contrary, Ferrer, Larkin and Lacey are the "true beneficial owners of the company." The report says Larkin and Lacey loaned Ferrer $600 million to buy the company from them, and the men concealed their ownership interest through "a complex chain of domestic and international shell companies."

It seems like yesterday -- not 10 years ago -- that Steve Jobs took the stage at MacWorld to debut Apple's latest new gadget: the iPhone. The iPhone was three devices in one, he declared at Moscone West in San Francisco. It was a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough Internet communications device. Apple's "three-in-one device" has gone on to become a critical contributor to the company's success, accounting for more than half its revenues annually, as well as a can't-live-without tool for many people. "iPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live," said Apple CEO Tim Cook. "iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started," he continued. "The best is yet to come." Fundamental Change What made the iPhone different from what passed for a mobile phone before Jobs introduced it that fateful day 10 years ago? "What we've realized over the last few years is that the iPhone fundamentally changed how we thought about phones," said Jack E. Gold, principal analyst at J.Gold Associates. "Before the iPhone, we looked at phones as primarily communications devices," he explained to TechNewsWorld. "iPhone changed that to 'we've got a computer in our hands that happens to be a phone as well.'" Prior to the iPhone's arrival, most vendors believed there was scant need or demand for a palm-sized "smart" device supporting search, media consumption and other Internet-based functions, recalled Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "The iPhone put an end to those assumptions and transformed the marketplace," he told TechNewsWorld. It also flipped forever how mobile phones were used. "Before iPhone, we talked on phones 90 percent of the time," Gold said. "Now we talk 10 percent and do other stuff 90 percent of the time." App Colossus Apple brought something else to mobile phones that hadn't been there before: usability. "In the early days of smartphones, they were awful to use," Gold noted. "The iPhone wasn't perfect, but it fundamentally changed how people perceived these things as fun and easy to use." Another notable change the iPhone pioneered was the use of mobile applications. "A big innovation was the introduction of a development kit for creating apps and making apps a key part of the iPhone design," said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies. "That allowed them to create a broader ecosystem that included hardware, software and services," he told TechNewsWorld. There is no doubt that the iPhone created a good monster with its app-centric approach. Since Apple began selling software from its App Store in 2008, it has returned more than US$50 billion to developers. "The app economy opened the floodgates for the transformation of many industries -- streaming music, mobile banking, mobile video, mobile retail and mobile games," Reticle Research Principal Analyst Ross Rubin told TechNewsWorld. A Few Bad Blemishes Perhaps what has distinguished the iPhone above all else during its 10 years of existence has been its design. "Some of the technology in the iPhone was around before the iPhone, but the iconic design wasn't seen before," noted David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research. "There've been a lot of copycats, but none have come up to the beauty of the iPhone's designs," he told TechNewsWorld. Ironically, one of the iPhone's biggest flubs was connected to the design of the iPhone 4. The so-called Antennagate problem occurred because the phone's antenna was placed on the edge of the phone where a user's hand could interfere with the call signal. The introduction of Maps created another blemish on the iPhone's record that Apple would like to forget. The app was embarrassingly inaccurate when it made its debut. Those mistakes were just bumps in the road for the iPhone, though, with little impact on its popularity or sales. That is attributable in part to Apple's service, which is "fantastic," according to McQueen. Another factor is customer loyalty. "People who love Apple love Apple," Gold observed. "There aren't a lot of people leaving Apple." Bright Future If Apple can maintain the iPhone's premium status, it should continue to thrive. "Apple has done really well by staying at the high end, where margins are good, and by selling additional services," Gold explained. "If they can maintain those margins, they'll do fine." Apple is also making investments in artificial intelligence, which should help the iPhone keep pace with competitors. "The prospects are good for the future iPhone as long as Apple continues to perfect next-generation use cases like AR, VR, MR and modularity," Moor Insights and Strategy Principal Analyst Patrick Moorhead told TechNewsWorld. Short-term prospects look good for the iPhone, too. "I believe Apple will set sales records with the iPhone 8," Bajarin said, "and start a new super cycle for upgrades that will drive strong revenue at least through 2019."

But for Apple investors, this is the only number that matters: $134.54. That is the all-time high for Apple’s stock — which it last hit nearly 21 months ago back on April 28, 2015. Apple has been mostly stuck in a rut since then, even as investors embraced fellow tech stocks, most notably the FANG of Four. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet have all hit new records more recently than Apple. But there are several reasons to believe that Apple might finally be back on track. The stock has had a nice run lately, gaining about 8% since the presidential election. Although tech investors were initially nervous about Donald Trump’s win because of some antagonistic tweets about Silicon Valley leaders, Apple and other tech stocks have since enjoyed a strong rally. Part of that is due to the more general hope that Trump’s policies will boost corporate and consumer spending. That obviously would help Apple and other gadget makers. But there are also growing hopes that the Trump administration may lower some corporate taxes, which could entice Apple and other tech giants hoarding cash overseas — like Microsoft and Google — to bring that back to the U.S. Apple currently has $237.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet. CFO Luca Maestri said during Apple’s most recent earnings call with investors in October that $216 billion of that iMountain was being held overseas. If Apple is able to repatriate — i.e. bring back — that cash to the U.S., the company could potentially use it on acquisitions, stock buybacks or higher dividends. Investors would probably approve of that. Another cause for optimism? Growing hopes that the recent iPhone 7 will continue to sell well, especially due to the massive problems facing Android rival Samsung in the wake of its fire-prone (and now defunct) Galaxy Note 7. There is also growing excitement about the 10th-anniversary version of the iPhone that will be unveiled later this year. Will Apple call it the iPhone 8? The Ocho? Skip 8 and 9 altogether and call it the 10? Or maybe name it the iPhone X if Apple wants to mimic the NFL and start using Roman numerals? Whatever the newest iPhone is called, investors are hoping that there will be enough new bells and whistles to live up to the hype — and help dispel the notion that Apple has lost its innovative edge since Steve Jobs died and Tim Cook has led the company. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a report earlier this week that patience is still required with Apple’s stock. But he thinks that the stock should start gaining momentum as optimism builds about the next iPhone. And Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty is even more optimistic. She just named Apple as her top large hardware stock pick for the year, citing expectations of Apple bringing back cash from overseas as well as broader tax reform under Trump. But Huberty argues that perhaps the biggest catalyst for Apple will be iPhone sales in China. Even though Apple has faced tough competition from Chinese smartphone rivals like Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo and Oppo, Huberty thinks that those companies are catering more to the lower-end of the market. She believes that once Apple does unveil a major upgrade to the iPhone, the company’s market share in China will tick higher again. “Investors worry Apple has lost its edge in China. We don’t believe this is the case,” she wrote. “High-end Chinese users are committed to Apple but are waiting for a more meaningful change…to upgrade.” Huberty thinks that Apple will hit a new all-time high over the next year. Her 12-month price target is $148 –nearly 25% higher than current levels. In her extremely bullish case for the stock, which calls for much higher earnings growth than expected, the stock could hit $190. That’s a more than 60% increase. And at that price, Apple’s market value would wind up topping the mythical $1 trillion level — a first for a U.S. company.

"Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything," Jobs declared as he paced across a San Francisco stage. It obviously wasn't an empty boast. We all know now that Jobs' "magical product" has reshaped culture, shaken up industries, put computers in billions of pockets and made it possible to do just about anything with a few taps on a screen. Besides its then 3.5-inch touch screen, the first iPhone featured a browser for on-the-go web surfing and built-in apps to check email and get directions. Going Mobile Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since its debut, spawning millions of mobile applications and prodding other technology companies to make similar smartphones that have become like phantom limbs for many of us. We use iPhones and their copycats to instantly share video and pictures with friends and family from almost anywhere. We use them to figure out where we are going. We use them to find the best deals while shopping in stores and to pay for stuff at the checkout stand. We use the phones to a hail ride, to tune instruments, to monitor our health and help find our next jobs. Phones have gotten so smart that they even talk back to us via helpful digital concierges such as the iPhone's Siri and the recently introduced Assistant on Google's Pixel phone. "IPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live," Apple's current CEO, Tim Cook, boasted in a retrospective that the Cupertino, California, company posted on its website. Roadkill in Its Wake The iPhone's revolutionary touch screen doomed the BlackBerry, another once-popular internet-connected phone. Mobile phones and their tablet cousins triggered a downturn in personal computer sales that is still unfolding. An estimated 219 million desktop and laptop computers shipped worldwide last year, down from 264 million in 2007, according to the research firm Gartner Inc. Meanwhile, nearly 1.9 billion mobile phones shipped last year, up from 1.15 billion in 2007. All told, Gartner estimates about 5 billion mobile phones are currently in use around the world compared to 1.3 billion PCs. The eroding popularity of PCs spurred shake-ups at powerful tech companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, none of which adapted nimbly to the mobile world unleashed by the iPhone. Then-Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer scoffed at Apple's glass-and-metal gadget, telling USA Today in April 2007 that "there's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance." Microsoft wound up squandering the $7.6 billion that it spent to buy phone maker Nokia in a futile attempt to catch up to the iPhone. Ballmer stepped down as CEO three years ago and was replaced by Satya Nadella, who introduced versions of Microsoft's popular Office programs that worked on Apple's iPad -- a tablet based on the iPhone. A Huge Hit ... and then a Stall The iPhone's success helped make Jobs a revered figure for many, and one whose October 2011 death was mourned around the world. The device has established Apple as the world's most profitable company with earnings of $45.7 billion on sales of $216 billion during its latest fiscal year. (Prior to the iPhone's release, Apple posted an annual profit of $2 billion on sales of $19.3 billion.) Its stock-market value is hovering around $635 billion, thanks to a split-adjusted stock price that's risen by nearly a factor of 10 since the iPhone's debut. Lately, though, the iPhone appears to be losing some steam. People are keeping older models for longer before upgrading or switching over to competing phones that run on Google's Android software. Apple suffered its first-ever decline in iPhone sales in its last fiscal year, causing the company to miss its revenue projections and hitting Cook with a 15 percent pay cut . Most smartphones now run on Android, partly because Google gives away the software. That has helped iPhone rivals woo price conscious consumers, especially outside the U.S., with phones that are much cheaper than the iPhone, whose latest models now cost more than $649 to $849. In his statement, though, Cook promised the iPhone is "just getting started. The best is yet to come." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Safe Yet To Fly with a Galaxy Note 7? Next Article > Exploding Phone Update: Is It Safe Yet To Fly with a Galaxy Note 7? By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: JANUARY 11 2017 The U.S. Department of Transportation announced yesterday that it has rescinded its requirement that airlines make specific announcements regarding the dangers of flying with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 prior to boarding. But despite the department’s decision to end the announcement requirement, the device is still banned from all U.S. flights, according to a statement released yesterday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Nevertheless, the announcement, which brings an end to the requirement that has been in place since October, comes as a welcome development for both Samsung and Galaxy Note 7 owners. The Department of Transportation initiated the announcement requirement at the same time that the FAA banned the devices from both passenger carry-on and checked luggage following reports that the devices were spontaneously exploding, sometimes while in flight. Blame the Batteries Shortly after the Note 7 launched last summer, owners began complaining that the batteries in their phones would either catch fire or explode. Samsung was forced to initiate a product recall in September, and even took the unusual measure of asking all Note 7 owners to immediately power down their devices and exchange them for replacement units. The problem with the phone stemmed from a faulty battery that had a tendency to overheat. In some cases, the batteries exploded, injuring consumers. The fault was eventually attributed to a problem in the phone's lithium-ion battery, one which the company said affected an estimated 2.5 million units. "Lithium-ion batteries pack a lot of power into a small package. When these batteries overheat and burst, the results can be serious. This is why the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is urging all consumers who own a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to power them down and stop charging or using the device,” the CPSC said in a statement issued in September. Most Note 7s Now Off the Market The crisis generated both embarrassing headlines for the company, along with a costly recall as it struggled to get the potentially dangerous devices out of consumers' hands as quickly as possible. It now appears that Samsung has succeeded in removing the vast majority of affected devices from circulation as an estimated 96 percent of the units that had been flagged as vulnerable have been returned. Initially, the company offered to replace the faulty models with a new version of the same model. But in December, Samsung expanded the recall program by offering to replace every Note 7, including the replacement models, with different phones or provide consumers with refunds. The company’s success rate in replacing those units led the Department of Transportation to cancel its notification requirement. "Together with our wireless carriers, we have taken aggressive action to limit the remaining phones' ability to work as mobile devices, further enhancing participation in the recall," the company said in a statement yesterday. Consumers who still own Note 7s are urged to return them for refunds or different models.

First filed for in February 2015, this newly granted patent reveals more ways iPhone 8 will outclass Android rivals. The invention would basically put some common components typically found on the front face of the phone behind the display assembly. What components are we talking about? Well, stuff like the earpiece, forward-facing cameras, Touch ID and various sensors. Integrating such parts behind the display assembly would help design a truly edge-to-edge device. Apple is thought to be working on such designs for its upcoming OLED-based iPhone 8 refresh. As mentioned, some of the components including the front-facing camera, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, microphone and more could be hidden below the cover glass or in an inactive portion of the display. The holes may have different shapes and positions relative to the actual pixels. A series of holes formed between the individual pixels would allow the underlying sensors to gather image (camera) and light data (ambient/proximity sensor), radio waves (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/NFC antenna) and acoustic signals (microphone and ear speakers). These microscopic pores would need to be unobtrusive and near-invisible to the human eye as to not degrade the clarity and sharpness of the screen. No matter how you look at it, Apple’s solution would definitely require an OLED-based display because the traditional LCD technology requires uninterrupted backlighting layer underneath the screen, where Apple’s patent envisions hiding the sensors and other components. Sub-screen speakers, cameras, sensors and more. One or more openings in the display may also form a window through which a user of the device may view an external object. Display pixels in the window region may be used in forming a heads-up display or window of sorts. This heads-up display system may be formed from a glass panel on the rear of the device and the main transparent OLED display. This sounds a lot like the augmented reality feature the next iPhone is rumored to provide. The heads-up system might leverage the rear-facing camera to capture scene imagery, then the system would project computer images containing useful information about surrounding objects onto the sub-display window. For what it’s worth, Apple is rumored to be considering an entry into the augmented reality market within the next one to two years, with initial solutions potentially integrated into iPhone and possibly an Apple-branded digital glasses with Carl Zeiss optics. Apple’s patent credits engineers Benjamin M. Rappoport, Jeremy C. Franklin, Fletcher R. Rothkopf, Scott A. Myers, Richard P. Howarth, Julian Hoenig, Christopher J. Stringer, John P. Ternus and Stephen Brian Lynch as its inventors. I’m more excited for the thru-holes in the display than any AR applications. Putting the components behind the display would help either completely eliminate or drastically reduce the size of the phone’s “forehead” (the bread above the screen) and “chin” (the area below the screen where the Home button is located. As a result, iPhone 8’s screen-to-body ratio should help engineer a device with a large screen that wouldn’t feel massive in one’s hand as iPhone 7 Plus does while being more comfortable to grip like Samsung’s curved-screen Galaxy lineup of smartphones are. For instance, Xiaomi’s recently launched Mi Mix fits a 6.4-inch AMOLED panel in a 5.7-inch body by using piezoelectric ceramic acoustic system for phone calls, replacing the proximity sensor with some cool tech, using an in-screen Home button and more. What do you think about Apple’s latest patent grant and does it pave the way for a next-generation iPhone with a full-face display, do you think?

Excited to see some components in the future. Ara Rezaee The camera quality will surely degrade considerably, other sensors should work fine. Rowan09 How do you come to this conclusion? Ara Rezaee There won’t be enough light going through the lens. Fanboy  Omg you should work for Apple, since you’re so smart and have it all figured out. Or let the Apple Engineers do their job, which obviously taking into consideration not degrading the camera quality. Ara Rezaee It’s physics my dear Fanboy, you can’t do against physics. The only way they can pull it off is either have multiple cameras and develop a good stacking algorithm (which introduces artificial shapes and stuff and cost more), or use a very large sensor which not only costs a lot it will make the phone thicker and we both know Apple hates that. Fanboy  People once thought we couldn’t fly objects with people in the sky because of “physics”. That’s what they pay engineers for, to figure things out. If Apple is testing in these fields it’s because they know there’s a way to do it, and they know something you don’t. Ara Rezaee Yeah, no. Kaptivator I was gonna…but I removed my comment. Just take the thumbs down. lol Martynet The rules and facts of physics are changing every day. It’s called progress. And if everyone was thinking like you do, we would still live in the caves… Ara Rezaee Trying very hard not to come off d*uchey, but if I were king of the world you’d be living in a far more advanced society. (really!) Any how, should Apple decide to hide the front cam using this patent, I’ll be here and one of us will be eating crow. BTW the rules and facts of physics will never ever change, our understanding of it will, and our understanding of it has not advanced all that much in the past half century specially in the optics front. Rowan09 It gives the camera specs. Mike M. Powell So what ya think. 7 vs 7s(8) when it comes out based on rumors. Worth paying off early based on these rumors? Ara Rezaee Performance wise you’d be better off skipping the 8, feature wise its going to be a doozy. I personally would definitely get the 8. Rowan09 Why? Ara Rezaee Why what? Rowan09 You said performance wise it’s better to skip the 8. I’m trying to figure out how you come to that conclusion? Ever iPhone performance wise has always been better than the phone before it. Ara Rezaee I never said it’s going to have the same chip, it will obviously be faster, but the iPh7 is quite fast enough so the difference will be negligible Rowan09 My point is you made it seem as if performance wise it’s going to be a step back is all I’m saying. There is no such thing as fast enough with technology, it can always be faster, especially after months of usage. Ara Rezaee If what I said was not clear then I thoroughly apologize, that was not what I intended. That being said though I can’t help but disagree, while there will be performance improvements, it IMHO will not justify forking over 800 bucks, the features will, but the performance alone wont, not since the 5S anyways. (I could make the same argument for Intel CPUs and Macs) Eliijah Moss Apple doesn’t typically use products that have been recently filled for a green light. I can see this type of technology being produced next year. If they do pull it off for production this year, then kudos to them. I just wouldn’t bet all of my money on it as to how most of what the media knows is nothing but rumors. SpideyRules I was going to say the same. I’m sure the next iteration has been in development for a while, and just now getting these patents pretty much guarantees we won’t see them this time around. Jon20 That’s true but Apple needs a “Hail Mary” right now because they basically have had the same form factor for 3 years now and even your average iPhone user is starting to notice the decline in innovation and not willing to upgrade as often because it’s not really worth it to them. I hope all this stuff shows up on this next one but we’ll see. Bacillus Typical Applrogance. They don’t have an OLED process.

Apple took notice of the report and said that it was going to work with Consumer Reports to understand why they’re not getting the claimed battery life in their tests. Apple today detailed just how Consumer Reports MacBook Pro battery tests were flawed and it’s glad that they’ve revisited their findings on its latest notebook. In a statement provided to AppleInsider, Apple said that it sat down with Consumer Reports over the holidays to find out how its testing methods for the new MacBook Pro were flawed. “We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache,” the company said in its statement, adding that “This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab.” Once Apple asked them to run the same tests again using normal user settings, Consumer Reports told the company that their notebooks were consistently delivering the expected battery life. Apple also adds that it has fixed the bug that was uncovered in these tests. “This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro,” the company concludes in its statement. Apple has made the Safari bug fix available to beta testers right now in the current beta build of macOS. It’s going to release the fix to the public in the next full update.

 Apple just issued an official explanation why its new MacBook Pros failed Consumer Reports’ battery tests Kif Leswing Jan. 10, 2017, 12:08 PM 9,872 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Right before Christmas, Consumer Reports, one of the most famous product review publications, announced that it could not recommend Apple's latest MacBook Pro because of inconsistent battery life. But shortly after the review was published, questions about Consumer Reports' testing surfaced, such as how it claimed to get both 3.75 hours of battery life and 19.5 hours from the same laptop — which is obviously a huge disparity.  Turns out, it was a software issue, Consumer Reports said in a blog post on Tuesday. Consumer Reports now says the MacBook Pro is poised to receive a recommended rating again if battery life remains consistently high.  "We communicated our original test results to Apple prior to publication on Dec. 22 and afterward sent multiple rounds of diagnostic data, at the company’s request, to help its engineers understand the battery issues we saw in our testing," Consumer Reports wrote in a blog post. "After investigating the issue, Apple says that the variable battery performance we experienced is a result of a software bug in its Safari web browser that was triggered by our test conditions." Apple said that the issue was related to a setting that Consumer Reports uses on its testing. "We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage," an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider.  You can read Consumer Reports' latest blog post here. Apple provided this statement to Business Insider:  “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results.

It is believed that a team of Apple officials would meet ministries senior officials, including the finance and IT people on January 25, where in discussions regarding the logistics for putting up the manufacturing unit will take place. In case all goes as planned by Apple, then India might see an iPhone manufactured by April 2017. According to a report, there will be a host of officials from places like DeITY (electronics and information technology), DIPP (industrial policy and promotion), environment and forest that will discuss the plans and logistics, by which Apple could set up its manufacturing plant in India. Taiwanese OEM makers and Wistron are two major partners that manufacture iPhones, along with Foxconn. Apple along with Foxconn were in talks with the Government of India last month, in which they pitched in to plant a manufacturing hub in Bengaluru’s Industrial area, Peenya. Considering the options, Apple has asked the Government to consider some incentives and duty exemptions, which could help them establish in the manufacturing sector of India, and looking at the company’s track record of building the best in the class products, Apple supposes the Indian government to grant the added incentives. With the talks underway, there still is no confirmation if Indian ministry would consider the duty and incentive exemptions. More so, in an attempt to sell refurbished smartphones in India, the Government had already rejected the idea since it would end up causing an e-waste situation in the country.

In their initial tests of the new MacBook Pro, Consumer Reports measured battery life as long as 19.5 hours and as short as 3.75 hours across three models. Following an joint investigation with Apple, it appears a Safari bug was to blame for the inconsistent results. As part of its testing protocols, Consumer Reports disables browser caching so each webpage reload is a full one. This uncovered a Safari bug that Apple was not aware of. “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results,” Apple said in a statement. “We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache.... We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test." Apple notes that most users would not have encountered this bug as typically browser caching is enabled. “This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage,” Apple said in its statement. “[Consumer Reports’] use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life.... This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro.” Consumer Reports says that once their retesting of the MacBook Pro’s batteries is complete, they will report back with the findings.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Greenpeace gives Apple, Google, Facebook good marks on clean energy By Levi Sumagaysay / January 10, 2017 at 8:45 AM The tech industry’s biggest and most famous companies are also its greenest. Apple, Google and Facebook have again scored the highest marks in Greenpeace’s annual renewable-energy rankings. “We are seeing the tech industry make major strides toward powering the internet with clean energy,” Greenpeace Senior IT Analyst Gary Cook said in a news release about the report Greenpeace released Monday night. Greenpeace, which has tracked the energy performance of leading tech companies since 2009, this year scored the renewable-energy efforts of about 70 websites and apps in the United States, and, for the first time, China and South Korea. Apple, Google and Facebook had the highest marks for the third year in a row, with Apple and Facebook getting an “A” in energy transparency, renewable-energy commitment and sitting policy, energy efficiency and mitigation and renewable procurement. Both companies got a “B” in advocacy. Google got an “A” in all the categories except energy transparency. The three companies also ranked high on Greenpeace’s clean-energy index, which is based on the electricity demand of each company’s data centers (in megawatts) and the amount of renewable electricity that’s used to power it. Apple scored highest, followed by Facebook and Google. In 2015, Apple used 93 percent renewable energy, according to its website. Google last month said it expects to power its offices and data centers worldwide with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2017. Facebook’s website says it aims to get to 50 percent renewable energy in 2018. Netflix, Amazon, Twitter and Oracle are among the tech companies with marks that need improvement, according to Greenpeace. The environmental group dinged Netflix and Amazon for their lack of transparency on renewable energy. Both are in the business of video streaming, which Greenpeace said is “a tremendous driver of data demand” that’s projected to reach 80 percent of internet traffic by 2020, according to Cisco’s latest network traffic forecast. The Greenpeace report also calls Amazon Web Services among the least transparent companies. New: AWS emailed a comment to SiliconBeat, saying that it has “many exciting initiatives planned” on its way to getting to 100 percent renewable. “In November 2014 AWS made a long-term commitment to achieve 100 percent renewable energy and in just two years we’ve made strong progress towards that goal,” an AWS spokesman said. “By April 2015 we hit 25 percent renewable, closed 2016 at 45 percent renewable, and have set a goal to reach 50 percent by the end of 2017.” End new. Of Netflix, Greenpeace said: “The company announced in 2015 that it intended to fully offset its carbon footprint, but a closer examination reveals it is likely turning to carbon offsets or unbundled renewable energy credits, which do little to increase renewable energy investment.” SiliconBeat has emailed Netflix for comment but has yet to receive a response.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has reportedly fixed a bug that caused massive battery life issues with the new MacBook Pro. Consumer Reports said on Tuesday that Apple released the patch to beta testers and that it should address many of the concerns brought up in Consumer Reports‘ battery life tests. The outlet is going to run its tests again and will report back on whether anything has indeed changed. In any case, it turns out that the performance measurements taken by Consumer Reports actually revealed a flaw that caused the MacBook Pro’s battery life to decline at a quicker-than-normal rate. “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results,” Apple told Consumer Reports. “We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache…. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test.” Right now it appears that the patch only fixes that bug, which means folks that are experiencing other issues related to battery life might not see an improvement. We’ve noticed our own problems on a fully-loaded MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, for example, that don’t seem to be necessarily related to Safari. Everyday use of the computer, not just benchmark tests, tends to drain the MacBook Pro of its juice much faster than Apple advertises. Apple clearly took issue with the Consumer Reports tests, however, since it was the first time ever that the outlet had ever withheld a recommendation from a MacBook. The good news is that this fix seems to be more than Apple’s last attempt to solve the problem. Last month, Apple released a patch that simply turned off the indicator showing how much longer the battery was going to last, seemingly sweeping the problem under the rug. My hope is that additional patches are on the way, and that Consumer Reports confirms this software update fixes part of the problem.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple was recently granted a patent titled “Electronic Devices Having Displays With Openings.” At its core, the patent describes a way of allowing a device with a large display surface area to fit extra components inside. If an iPhone or iPad’s front was entirely screen, for example, where would the speaker, earpiece, and other components go? That’s what this patent tries to overcome. It also discusses the possibility of seeing through a display while viewing information on it, this is a sort of heads-up display (HUD) implementation. “Cellular telephones and other portable devices often contain displays,” Apple says in the patent. “Displays often occupy relatively large portions of an electronic device. For example, in an electronic device cellular telephone or tablet computer, a display may occupy the entire front face of the device. In many device configurations such as those in which displays occupy large portions of a device, it can be challenging to accommodate device components within the device. For example, a display may present an obstacle to the installation and operation of device components. Unless care is taken, a designer may be forced to make aesthetically unappealing design choices or may need to install device components using awkward or bulky arrangements. It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved arrangements for electronic devices with displays.” HUDs and zero-bezels Apple discusses the sorts of components that might need to get access through a display that takes up the entire front of a smartphone or tablet. Those sorts of parts include antennas, light sensors, cameras, proximity sensors and even notification LEDs. Typically, those sorts of electronics are built right into the housing of a phone, or just below the glass, but not behind the actual viewing screen. Apple doesn’t dive too deep into the topic, but does discuss a HUD, which is particularly compelling. “One or more openings in the display may form a window through which a user of the device may view an external object,” the patent says. “Display pixels in the window region may be used in forming a heads-up display.” Here, one can imagine a sort of iPad with a clear window portion on it, allowing you to see through the actual device but also still view information floating on the glass. Apple has discussed its interest in augmented reality, and this could enable a bit of that, though the camera could also be used as a sort of pass-through viewing device. You can take a loser look at some of the images above to understand a bit more about what Apple’s trying to do here. The takeaway is that it’s most likely working to figure out the best approach to embedding electronics in devices with zero-bezels, which is pretty darn exciting.

The patch, which is being released to the macOS beta channel today and will eventually be included for all users of the software, focuses on a buried setting in Safari, the browser which Consumer Reports used for its controversial testing back in December. Back then, the organization found that despite Apple’s claims of around 10 hours of battery life for the new notebooks, the MacBook Pro models it bought would sometimes deliver just a fraction of that. Indeed, the issue led Consumer Reports to not officially recommend the new MacBook Pro, the first time it had withheld such a recommendation from Apple’s notebooks. Unsurprisingly, Apple wasn’t too impressed, launching an investigation with the organization to try to figure out what was the problem. Meanwhile, owners and Apple fans weighed in with their own suggestions and experiences, particularly around the comment from the testing site that their battery experiments ran much better in Google’s Chrome browser than it did in Apple’s own Safari. It now seems that it’s how Consumer Reports set up the test, and in particular the settings it established for Safari at the start, which likely led to the confusing battery results. As part of its test process, Consumer Reports explains, it turns off the local caching of webpages. “In our tests, we want the computer to load each web page as if it were new content from the internet, rather than resurrecting the data from its local drive,” the site says. “This allows us to collect consistent results across the testing of many laptops, and it also puts batteries through a tougher workout.” That, Apple argues, isn’t how the vast majority of MacBook Pro owners use Safari. Meanwhile, in the process it also apparently “triggered an obscure and intermittent bug” around how icons were reloaded; that, Apple says, led to the inconsistency in runtimes overall. A new patch has been released to address that icon bug. “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. Their use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test. This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro” Apple With the caching turned on, Consumer Reports says that “the three MacBooks we’d originally tested had consistently high battery life results.” The organization plans to re-run its entire battery testing process and issue an update. It’s unclear when the beta patch will graduate to the full macOS channel. If, though, as Apple suggests the setting that led to it having an impact is so little used, it may indeed not be required by most owners. The controversy does raise the question of how accurate and relevant battery testing is in today’s electronics, especially given the ways that hardware and software manufacturers are trying to coax out longer runtimes by optimizing both. In smartphones, for instance, chipset and device manufacturers I’ve talked to recently have taken issue recently with battery tests that deactivate the various optimization tweaks. Their argument is that those efficiency steps are now integral to the way hardware and software works together, and that “raw” performance – such as locking processors into their most power-hungry mode, or preventing things like data caching – is no longer an accurate representation of how devices will run in everyday life. Indeed, with improvements in battery chemistry thin on the ground, finessing how software and hardware makes use of what energy is available is the primary area where chipset vendors like Qualcomm and Intel, and device manufacturers, are able to improve things. Undoubtedly, the controversy over how long a new MacBook Pro can last will linger. After Consumer Reports’ testing was made public, some owners chimed in with complaints of their own; whether they too had deactivated the caching and thus also potentially fallen victim to the icon reloading bug is unclear.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 8:48 am Tue Jan 10, 2017 Apple Store employees fired after accusations of snooping on customers' devices for sexual selfies and sharing them From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Last October, an Apple Store in Brisbane, Australia terminated some of its employees after they were accused of searching customers' devices for sexually explicit selfies and sharing them with colleagues, rating them on a scale of 1-10. report this ad The employees were also accused of covertly photographing female customers and co-workers, including "upskirt" photos. Though Apple fired the employees, it denied that they engaged in these activities. The Australian privacy commissioner is investigating the allegations. The privacy invasions were possible, in part, because Apple has a policy of requiring customers to unlock their phones when putting them in for service (this is common among many kinds of device repair services, and unquestionably makes repair and testing simpler). This works fine, but fails badly: all it takes is one unethical technician to make the whole thing go very badly indeed. Alternatives to this would include asking customers to back up their devices to Apple's cloud servers (which are accessible to fewer, better-vetted technicians) and wipe them -- even better would be to use end-to-end encryption in cloud backups, so that customers' data would be private except in the case of bad passwords, malware, or defects in the software. "This is an important reminder that all organisations that collect and manage personal information need to embed a culture of privacy and ensure employees understand their responsibilities," he said. "Organisations must also take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure."

Working in conjunction with Apple over the holiday, the two have worked together to better understand the battery test results as promised and new testing is taking place this week… The controversial battery findings posted just before the Christmas break from Consumer Reports received a response from Apple SVP Phil Schiller who said Apple would begin working with the publication to understand what caused their lab testing to report sporadic battery life. Even though the publication’s test results seem far-fetched at the time, Consumer Reports stood by their findings and didn’t believe another test was warranted. Today’s development leads us to believe that Apple has potentially found a bug that may have negatively impacted CR‘s testing. Battery life issues tend to be common as new devices are set up, which may be the reason a large number of 9to5Mac readers reported lower than expected battery life issues. Apple responded in part by removing the time remaining estimate from the battery status indicator which didn’t reflect accurately with modern software like iCloud. Once test results and diagnostics had been sent to Apple at their request, the engineers began looking into understanding the battery issues that arose. Apple stated that the battery life concerns Consumer Reports unearthed arose from a software bug within Safari, something that was triggered by CR’s testing methodologies. In a statement given to Consumer Reports, Apple said: “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache…. We have also fixed the bug uncovered in this test.” As a part of CR’s laptop testing, they turn off caching within the browser. The goal is to have the system load each web page anew, rather than relying on a cached page saved on the computer. According to CR this “allows us to collect consistent results across the testing of many laptops, and it also puts batteries through a tougher workout.” In regards to the caching issue, Apple’s statement said: “We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage. [Consumer Reports’] use of this developer setting also triggered an obscure and intermittent bug reloading icons which created inconsistent results in their lab. After we asked Consumer Reports to run the same test using normal user settings, they told us their MacBook Pro systems consistently delivered the expected battery life…. This is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we’re glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro.” Consumer Reports is now re-running their tests this week to determine whether or not the expected fix will resolve their original issues which could potentially change their Do Not Recommend verdict. We’ll keep you posted as the situation develops. The aforemtioned bug fix in Safari should be found in macOS Sierra 10.12.3’s latest beta.

Apple says Consumer Reports MacBook Pro battery testing used flawed methods Posted Jan 10, 2017 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Europe proposes expanding telco data privacy rules to WhatsApp, Facebook et al Last month, Consumer Reports came up with some interesting battery test results with the latest MacBook Pro models. Results ranged from 3.75 hours to 19.5 hours. Many in the Apple community thought that something was off, either a software bug or a benchmarking issue — it turns out it was both. Apple worked with Consumer Reports over the holidays to find out why the battery test results varied so much. It’s hard to get the exact same battery life every time. That’s why benchmark lovers run a test multiple times to find the average result. And yet, battery life shouldn’t vary from 1x to 5x. Many early buyers have already been complaining about the battery life of the new MacBook Pro. That’s why Apple removed the “battery time remaining” estimate in a macOS update. But it doesn’t explain Consumer Reports’ benchmark. It turns out that Consumer Reports turns off Safari’s local cache for their browsing test. It means that the browser will fetch a website’s data from the internet every time. When the cache is on, Safari stores images on your hard drive so that you don’t have to load them up every time. “Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage,” Apple said in a statement. This seems deliberate, and Consumer Reports explains why in a new post today. The publication turns off the cache settings on the default browser for all laptops — not just Mac laptops. This way, it’s like Consumer Reports is browsing thousands of different websites, and not just the same ten websites over and over again. Apple has also discovered that there was a bug in Safari affecting icon fetching. This bug has been fixed — this should improve benchmarks. But it makes you think about Consumer Reports’ methodology here. Using web browsing for battery benchmarks seems like a great idea. It imitates real life usage as most people use their computer to browse the internet, play music, write documents and spreadsheets and play movies. But deactivating default settings that positively affect battery life seems curious. Maybe Consumer Reports should consider leaving the cache on for future Mac and PC laptop benchmarks. Apple sent the following statement to TechCrunch: “We appreciate the opportunity to work with Consumer Reports over the holidays to understand their battery test results. We learned that when testing battery life on Mac notebooks, Consumer Reports uses a hidden Safari setting for developing web sites which turns off the browser cache. This is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage.

Image: jhila farzaneh/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-01-10 16:53:16 UTC With 10 years of iPhone iterations under its belt, there's immense pressure for Apple to deliver an iPhone 8 with a new design and revolutionary features that'll truly blow people away. One persistent rumor that we keep hearing about is a redesign. The latest supply chain checks from DigiTimes suggest Apple might "adopt a stainless steel forging process" for the iPhone 8's frame to go with its new glass back. SEE ALSO: Everything we think we know about the next iPhone "The metal bezel will be made of stainless steel using a forging process to enhance its sturdiness and reduce costs and manufacturing time," the report reads. Though not confirmation by any means, the report seems to corroborate previous rumors that claimed the iPhone 8 will hark back to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S's iconic "glass sandwich" design. Increased durability is cited as the main reason Apple might switch from one metal to another. In late September, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has reliable track record when it comes to Apple rumors, said he believed the iPhone 8 could sport a glass back to match the front display and incorporate a stainless steel frame to hold them together. Lower-end models, however, could stick with aluminum. Increased durability is cited as the main reason Apple would make the switch from one metal to another.  Other potential iPhone 8 features that have bubbled up include a new model with a 5-inch screen that'll sit between the 4.7- and 5.5-inch models, an OLED screen for increased brightness and better color reproduction and a display with curved edges that might resemble the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. But there's more. Apple might also introduce a new red finish, some type of wireless charging (possibly over the air) and maybe an augmented reality element to round out the iPhone 8. As always, it's too soon to nail down which rumors are real and which ones are not. We'll know for sure in the fall, but until then, take all rumors with a grain of salt.

Apple has reportedly cut its iPhone build plans -- again. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 10, 2017 at 12:00PM In the fall of 2016, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its next-generation iPhones, branded iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These phones included a number of significant enhancements, such as more colorful and color-accurate displays, faster processors, improved cameras, stereo speakers, a solid-state home button, and faster wireless connectivity. Image source: Apple.  Indeed, aside from the fact that the look and feel of the devices were very similar to the prior two generations of iPhone models, the new devices represented significant upgrades from the prior-generation ones. The new iPhone models seemed to be off to a good start, with Apple CEO Tim Cook saying on an October earnings call that the company, at the time, had yet to reach supply demand balance for its new phones. Nevertheless, a recent report from BlueFin Research Partners, by way of Barron's, says that Apple has yet again cut its iPhone products plans, suggesting the new devices might not be able to keep sales momentum up until the company launches its next-generation iPhones in the fall. Slashing estimates some more BlueFin's initial iPhone unit shipment estimates for the March quarter sat at 59 million. That figure, if Apple were still on track to that goal, would have represented solid year-over-year growth from roughly 51 million units shipped in the March-ending quarter of the prior year, though still down from the roughly 61 million units that Apple shipped in the March-ending quarter of its fiscal 2015. However, the analysts cut their estimates to 53 million last month, according to Barron's, and they're now taking those estimates to just 50 million units. If the analysts are right, then Apple might be looking at another -- albeit modest -- year-over-year decline in unit shipments during the March-ending quarter. Considering that some of Apple's chief rivals, particularly in China, are posting substantial year-over-year smartphone unit growth -- and it's not all happening at the low end of the market -- it's starting to look as though this product cycle isn't going to be a particularly good one for Apple, either. All eyes on the next cycle Apple may have made a mistake in not significantly changing the look and feel of the iPhone models that launched in the fall. There had been rumors before the launches of those devices that Apple was looking to slim down the iPhone models significantly from the ones launched in the prior two cycles, but this ultimately didn't come to pass. Image source: Apple.  Apple is known to test out multiple different potential models before deciding on the final designs and putting them into mass production. Perhaps Apple found that it would have had to make too many technical sacrifices -- perhaps on battery life, processing power, or something else -- to slim down the phones, ultimately going with devices with a similar look and feel to the iPhone 6 series and iPhone 6s series. It'll be interesting to see what Apple ultimately launches later this year, but consumers aren't responding to the numerous "under-the-hood" changes that the company introduced with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 series devices. A fresh look and feel for its iPhone devices could be just what Apple needs to get its iPhone business back on a solid growth path. Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Apple iPhone 8 to Feature iPhone 4-like Design with Stainless Steel Frame GO The cost of the forging process is considerably cheaper Jan 10, 2017 16:45 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple is more than half a year away from unveiling the next iPhone, but that doesn’t mean that information on the upcoming phone won’t leak. A new report by Digitimes reveals that Apple will make some design changes in the new iPhone. Specifically, the iPhone 8 will feature a stainless steel frame, similar to the one found on the iPhone 4. Apparently, Apple will abandon the aluminum panel in favor of a glass back and front. The stainless steel will be used for holding the two glass panels together. The stainless steel frame will be the result of a forging process that’s aimed at enhancing sturdiness and reducing manufacturing costs and time. It seems that the cost of forging the stainless steel frame is between 30 and 50% lower compared to the current CNC machine process. Moreover, the quality control is also more stable. A new design for the iPhone 8 The report also mentions that Apple will contract Foxconn and Jabil, the same companies that supplied components for the iPhone 4. The new design won’t affect any existing deals that Apple may have with its current chassis suppliers, since the new stainless steel bezel would still need to be refined by CNC machining. Rumors from the past few months have indicated that Apple might make some major design changes in the new iPhone 8. Specifically, the phone might come with a home button and Touch ID sensor embedded directly into the display. The Jet Black variant of the iPhone 7 has been very popular among consumers, which means that Apple might bring back the color with the iPhone 8. A glass design for the iPhone 8 would surely facilitate wireless charging, a feature that has been long rumored to be supported in the new phone. Moreover, some have suggested that the new iPhone 8 might come in two variants, one with a flat screen and a high-end version with a curved display. #Apple#iPhone 8#iPhone 4#Foxconn#Stainless Steel Frame subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone X Concept Imagines the Anniversary iPhone Launching Next Year The Jet White iPhone 7 Looks Stunning in This Mockup - Video 5-Inch iPhone to Launch Next Year with Vertical Dual-Camera System Top 2017 iPhone Codenamed “Ferrari,” Featuring OLED and New Internal Design It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs    iPhone concept image new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Was World’s Most Innovative Company in 2016, BCG Survey Shows more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

To celebrate the anniversary, Zhang posted 2007 iPhone launch photos — just as WeChat’s parent company Tencent was rolling out a new suite of web apps for smart phones users. “Tencent was conveying that they want to play a leading role in the next decade,” said Jia Mo, an analyst at Canalys. Though that role will be hard fought, as Tencent is stepping into the ring with some of the biggest — and richest — corporations on Earth. It’s a big challenge. But WeChat has climbed big mountains before, having gone from being a relatively simple chat app to being something of a digital commerce “Swiss Army Knife” that also now allows users to pay bills, order cabs, read news, do their banking and buy movie tickets.  And it’s brought those capacities to a massive audience — 846 million uses at last count. The new apps function is called Mini Program. These apps are cloud-based — meaning users can access them without downloading them. Apple did not respond to requests for a comment — Google did respond, with the words “no thanks.” Apple’s iOS accounted for 17 percent of smartphones sold in China in the third quarter of 2016, versus Android’s 82.6 percent, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia. Apple said last week that sales of its apps in China rose 90 percent in 2016. Tencent does not consider the new collection of cloud-based apps to be an app store — and has actually dropped the word “App Accounts” since Apple wouldn’t let them use that. However, as Tencent Chairman Pony Ma wrote on his WeChat account in September, that might have been a good thing that forced them to differentiate their offering some — by calling it Mini Program, among other things. Dong Xu, an analyst at research firm Analysys, said these mini apps are suitable for functions used frequently that are not terribly complex. “Any tool should help the user increase efficiency,” Mr. Zhang said in a speech last month. “That is the goal of a tool, the mission of a tool.” But whether these tools will be robust enough remains to be seen. “For heavy users, the experience on apps is still better, so I don’t think this would threaten the status of app stores,” said Zhu Xiaohua, product supervisor of online question-and-answer platform Fenda. “Mini Program is not a simple substitute,” said Hong Bo, a Beijing-based tech analyst. “It will take a fairly long time for developers and users to get used to it.” Related Items:wechat, What's Hot Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Recommended for you Hacker Tracker: Neutralizing ATM Jackpotting IPOs May Mark 2017 Unicorns How Wellington’s 20 Percent Advantage Is Fueling Tech Growth Get our hottest stories delivered to your inbox.

The company regularly pushes the envelope even when it knows that people will take time to adjust. In fact, we covered one such change earlier today. People likely don’t remember the early responses to the first-generation iPhone. They don’t remember how many journalists, bloggers and consumers laughed at the idea of a smartphone without a keyboard. But Apple had a better solution, and the company’s executives knew it was better. They just had to wait for users to experience it and realize how much better it was. Apple would never have become the company it is today had it not been willing to push the envelope like this. It truly has been courageous, time and time again. But the company’s most recent act of courage is unlike the paradigm shifts it has spurred in the past. This time around, Apple did a terrible job of ensuring the solution it offered in place of the industry standard it eliminated is actually a better solution. Don't Miss: All the reasons people are ditching Android and switching to iPhones I really wish Apple would stop trolling me. Back in November, I wrote about a frustrating problem that I’m having with my iPhone 7 Plus. Many other people have been having the same problem, and there is no fix. You can read about the issue in that post. In a nutshell, many iPhone 7 models have a serious problem with Bluetooth audio. The sound from music and streaming videos constantly gets choppy, rapidly cutting in and out. It’s unbearable, and it’s incredibly frustrating since using wireless headphones is the only way a person can listen to music and charge an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus at the same time without carrying a clunky third-party dongle. Why am I writing about this again? I recently penned another piece titled “I really hate how much I love Apple’s AirPods.” That article focused on how much I disliked the look of Apple’s AirPod since the moment I saw them. But then I warmed up to them because the technology is so impressive and the sound quality is so surprising. Long story short, AirPods are awesome. If only I could connect them and listen to music on my iPhone 7 Plus without wanting to throw my phone through a wall. Overall, I’ve never been happier with a smartphone than I am with the iPhone 7 Plus. The display is gorgeous, the battery life is beyond impressive, and the speed and power are unrivaled. There’s just nothing else out there that can compete with the iPhone 7 Plus. But this audio problem is widespread and Apple hasn’t even acknowledged the issue publicly, so we have no idea when or even if this serious problem will ever be fixed. Is it a software issue? Is it the Intel modem in the AT&T iPhone models? We don’t know, so we’re left to assume that this problem will never be fixed, despite the fact that it completely ruins a key area of the iPhone experience. Courage is important and Apple has been more courageous in recent years than any other consumer tech company. It has pushed the envelope constantly, leaving rivals scrambling to copy Apple’s every move. But Apple has historically abandoned a legacy feature only when it has something that is truly an improvement to replace it with, and that’s simply not the case with the 3.5mm headphone jack.

Trello's app offers digital post-it notes and whiteboards to organise tasks and priorities. It has 19 million users, a number that almost doubled in the past year. The start-up sells free and paid versions and the products will remain standalone offerings after the deal.

In 2012, Atlassian purchased HipChat, a corporate messaging program that competes with Slack. Atlassian shares are up 18 per cent from its $US21 IPO price. "Over half of Trello's users are in business teams, and we've been on this journey of expanding over the last five years from technical teams to get deeper into business teams," Mr Simons said. For Atlassian's own products, the number of users outside of technical teams is more like 35 per cent, he said.

It's raised $US10 million from backers including venture capital firms Index Ventures and Spark Capital. Chief executive Michael Pryor will join Atlassian and report to co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes. Trello's software is more structured and formal than Atlassian's Confluence product, but less so than Jira.

For example, he said a marketing team would use Trello to brainstorm priorities for a campaign, Confluence to create and revise a specific piece of marketing content and Jira to manage a really specific plan for the campaign's web development.

This is perhaps not surprising for someone brought up in Xinjiang, an area known for the quality of its fruit. Apples used to be one of the fruits plentifully available to me as a child. My mother used to work for a farm affiliated with a bingtuan (production and construction corps), which grew, among others things, apples. In hindsight, those apples were modest in size, varied in shape, but gave off such a sweet smell that, walking into my home, I could tell at once there were apples stowed away somewhere. The uniformly big, red apples we occasionally receive as gifts today are pleasing to the eye, picture-perfect; but to be honest, I would consume them more out of obligation than enjoyment. I knew something about the pruning of fruit trees, had once successfully experimented with grafting, but did not realize the limits of my knowledge until watching this documentary about the Hu family, who live off about 300 apple trees in a village in Wafangdian, near Dalian, Liaoning Province. It is quite a phenomenon today for cameras to train on the lives of rustic villagers, and for long periods of time — in this case, from winter to autumn. The film chronicles the backbreaking toil of the family in their effort to extract a livelihood from the soil, and the admirable tenacity and optimism they show in the process. When flowers emerge, they have to be thinned, and fertilized, artificially, as well as by colonies of bee billeted to the trees. After the flowers fructify, most of them have to be nipped to ensure that only those capable of growing to marketable size are left. Then the fruits have to be clad in paper pockets to avoid being chapped or bruised. One hundred days later these paper containers have to be removed, so that the apples can redden. Tinsel film is then spread under the trees to reflect sunlight, so that the apples will become red evenly on all sides. In this endeavor, the complexion of the Hu couple, both 47, is heavily tanned. But their labor is not enough. They have to hire temporary helpers. A strong gale just ten days before picking time dashes many villagers’ hopes for a good harvest, but the Hu family is spared the worst. The Hus expects a production of 30,000 kilos, which, if prices are as good as the previous year, would earn them 90,000 yuan (US$12,981). Ironically, as a result of the harvest and overproduction, prices drop well below those of last year. The Hus work long and hard, but they are failures in economic terms — and we no longer know how to characterize persons otherwise in such circumstances. Our ancestors used to have a strong respect for living off the land, with some observing that after grain taxes were paid, a farmer’s care-free independence was the envy of all, even an emperor. But when prices become so unpredictably volatile, farming is more like a gamble. In the film, Mr. Hu remains optimistic and earnest about his work. As he reflects, “If you eat off this tree-growing business, you cannot well afford to be perfunctory about it, otherwise the consequence would be serious.” In all rationality, the Hus should not continue this risky business, but they have two grown-up children — both mentally ill — to attend to. That’s why they choose to rough it rather than mend their fortunes in cities as migrants. Some of my friends, attracted to the dignity of the hand-to-mouth rural existence, occasionally dream of one day retreating to a tract of farmland and subsisting off the sweat of their own brows. Well, this is probably not impossible for a pensioner who can afford to ignore cost-efficiency considerations. But it is too risky to suggest to an aspiring rural young man standing on the threshold of life, in need of cash to build a house, attract a spouse, and start a family. It certainly makes more sense for him to go to the nearest city and work as a deliveryman. Considerable accolades have been paid to the world of connections, trade and globalization. That’s only fit for some who have mastered the game of steering money their way — but at whose expense? The plight of the Hus, those who try to make a living producing something real, is no trifle. It dramatizes the urgency of making the economy work for everyone, but especially for those who toil. According to a recent interview published by The Paper, Zong Qinghou, a billionaire entrepreneur, cited three factors behind the country’s lackluster economy: high taxes, runaway growth of the virtual economy, and the devastating effect of the soaring housing sector. Zong made his fortune on children’s snacks; but China’s apple-growers are, by comparison, inarticulate and invisible. Their invisibility dramatizes the imperative of resuscitating our faith in honest work as a source of wealth, respect and happiness.

Apple and other top tech companies reconsidered taking operations abroad after President-elect Donald Trump blasted automakers for moving production to Mexico, CNBC's Jim Cramer said on Tuesday. "When the auto companies are targeted, I think they pretty much said, 'You know what, we're going to rethink taking things to Mexico,'" Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street."

Trump has previously pushed Apple to bring manufacturing in the U.S. Trump recently stepped up his criticism of the auto industry, attacking General Motors and Toyota. The president-elect had previously blasted Ford Motor as well for its plans to move small car production to Mexico.

 Now is the the worst time to buy a new laptop Steve Kovach Jan. 10, 2017, 11:08 AM 56,885 facebook linkedin twitter email print A guest points to a new MacBook Pro during an Apple media event in Cupertino. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach LAS VEGAS — CES was full of wild stuff. Drones that automatically follow you around. Self-driving cars. A TV as thin as a credit card. But while most of the show is about looking forward to what's next in tech, I had a lot of trouble staying in the present. I'm in the market for a new laptop, and I was hoping the biggest showcase of gadgets in the world would give me some good guidance. Unfortunately, I left the show disappointed. As a Mac user since 2004, I had high hopes last fall for Apple's redesigned MacBook Pro. I still think it's probably the best laptop around, but not without some serious caveats, most notably its battery life issues. After giving it some more thought, I decided that was a dealbreaker and my search continued. The new MacBook Pro's battery life problems turned out to be a deal breaker. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider I'd still like to avoid making the jump to Windows or one of Google's Chromebooks, but the rest of the MacBook lineup is horribly flawed. The MacBook Air is great, but it still has that old, low-resolution screen and the same basic design from over six years ago. Ouch. Then there's the newer, super-thin MacBook. While I'm in love with the design and ultra-portability, it's slightly underpowered for my needs, and I'm not confident it'll last me more than a couple of years before I need to upgrade again. I just don't feel confident buying a new MacBook today. So, what else is there? I suddenly find myself Windows-curious. After a disastrous run with Windows 8, Microsoft has redeemed itself with Windows 10, which finally feels like a mature operating system and an enticing alternative for Mac lovers like me. Over the last year, laptops running Windows 10 feel a step ahead of what we're seeing in the MacBooks. Touchscreens. Thoughtful, opinionated designs. And plenty of power under the hood.  The MacBook Pro's new Touch Bar has some clever uses, but it falls short of what's possible with a full touchscreen. (Apple remains steadfast in its position that laptops shouldn't have touchscreens.) The new Dell XPS looks interesting, but it doesn't have enough power. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn But even the newest Windows 10 laptops don't cut it for me. Dell introduced a new version of its XPS 13 laptop with a touchscreen that folds over into a tablet mode, but like the MacBook, it doesn't have enough power for me. I'm intrigued by HP's Spectre laptops, but the design doesn't exactly blow me away. Same with the latest stuff from Lenovo. I've also been testing Microsoft's latest Surface Book, which seems like the best of the bunch to me, except I'm not wild about the detachable screen. Plus there are still a few quirks with Windows 10 that bother me, like the lack of touch-friendly tablet apps. What about Chromebooks? Chromebooks are the wild card. They're great for doing just about everything you want to do on a computer, but still have some limitations when it comes to running traditional apps. Samsung had the biggest Chromebook announcement of CES, releasing two touchscreen models that can run Android apps. But Chromebooks and ChromeOS, Google's operating system for these laptops, are in a weird transition period right now. Google is gearing up to radically change ChromeOS and merge it with Android into one super operating system for laptops, codenamed "Andromeda." As enticing as some Chromebooks may be, I think it's worth waiting to see what Google announces this fall before investing in a Chromebook. Samsung's newest Chromebook. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn What now? Buying a laptop used to be relatively easy. As a Mac loyalist, I'd just get the best MacBook and be good to go for several years. But that won't work today. There are too many compromises with every model in the MacBook lineup, and I can't buy any of them with confidence. Making the leap to a new platform like Windows or ChromeOS comes with its own problems. ChromeOS is still half-baked and it'll be several months before we see Google's grand vision for it. And while some Windows 10 laptops are intriguing, there's no perfect laptop, and it's going to be awhile before we get some more options. For now, the hunt continues.

Apple already has authority to produce certain components for consumer electronics; however, the current request would add finished products and foreign status materials/components to the scope of authority. It appears as though the first product Apple plans to make with this expansion is finished server assembly cabinets (duty-free) for its data centers. Materials Apple wants to source from abroad include: Tape; plastic boxes; polyethylene bags; plastic bags; plastic packing; plastic washers; rubber washers; rubber spacers; steel screw hooks; steel screws; steel nuts; steel standoff; steel spring washers; steel washers, not spring/lock type; steel rivets; steel cotter pins; steel springs; steel springs, of wire; steel baffles; copper washers; copper boss; copper nuts; nickel fasteners; aluminum screws; aluminum hooks; metal hinges; metal brackets; fans; fan blades, fan unit housings; servers; input/output units; storage units; smart cables; card readers; server housing/enclosures; printed circuit board assemblies; electric motors; transformers; static converters; inductors; magnets; lithium batteries; lithium polymer batteries; routers and network switches; microphones; CDs, software; solid state drives; semiconductor media; monitors; capacitors; fuses; circuit breakers; power strips; relays; switches; electrical connectors; optical fiber cable connectors; terminals; power strips with rack mounts; diodes; transistors; thyristors; LEDs; electronic integrated circuits; infrared LED strips; data server cables; copper and power cables; cables; optical fiber cables; metal furniture; and, server rack rails (duty rate ranges from duty-free to 8.6%). Rumor has it that Apple has asked Foxconn and Pegatron to investigate the feasibility of making iPhones in America following a push to bring manufacturing back to America by President-Elect Trump.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Gadgets Apple, Carl Zeiss working on a pair of smart AR glasses: Report Apple, Carl Zeiss working on a pair of smart AR glasses: Report Apple could be working on a pair of augmented reality glasses in collaboration with optics major Carl Zeiss. By: Tech Desk | Published:January 10, 2017 9:39 pm Apple and Carl Zeiss are working on a “light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year. Apple is working on a pair of augmented reality glasses and it is working with optics major Carl Zeiss for these. The news comes from a Facebook post by tech evangelist Robert Scoble, who claims a Zeiss employee has stated that Apple and Carl Zeiss are working on a “light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.” This is not the first time that reports have hinted that Apple is working on a pair of smart glasses, which could be geared towards an Augmented Reality experience. Back in November, Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on a pair of AR glasses that would pair with the iPhone. It cited a source who said that the device won’t be ready before 2018. Another Financial Times report in March 2016 had claimed Apple has a secret team working on AR and VR headsets. According to Scoble’s Facebook post, which has gone viral, Zeiss’ booth was located in the augmented reality section, despite having no presence in the booming category. Scoble’s claims doesn’t hint at anything major, but it looks like Apple glasses could have built-in AR/VR features, instead of a Google Glass-type advanced smart glass As pointed by Scoble, Zeiss being Apple’s alleged partner is less surprising. Zeiss has expertise in VR headsets and cameras. Back in 2014, Zeiss launched the VR One, the company’s own virtual reality headset to uses with smartphones. Also read: Apple looking to integrate Augmented Reality into iPhone camera app: Report We’ve seen some interesting takes on the idea of smart-glasses. The most fun take has come from Snap Inc, Snapchat’s parent company, which introduced Spectacles. These pair of sunglasses might look like a quirky toy, but they can record videos which can then be shared on social media or directly to Snapchat. Snap Inc might consider these as a fun toy, but there’s massive interest in these glasses, and on ebay these limited edition specs are selling for $1000, much more than the original price of $130. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that he thinks AR will big, and the company is investing in it. “My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two (AR vs VR), probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see,” Cook had said last year in an interview to Washington Post. During one of the company’s earnings call, Cook had confirmed the company was investing in AR as well. The Apple CEO was quoted as saying that Apple is betting ‘high on AR for the long run’, adding “We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Best of Express Behind Bihar boat tragedy: No security review, patrol boats diverted EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party EntertainmentHappy Birthday Sidharth Malhotra: As Sidharth Malhotra turns 32, here are facts about him we bet you didn't know.

But none of this technology will be available for the public Source: http://www.youredm.com/2016/01/10/over-200000-people-have-petitioned-to-stop-apple-from-removing-the-iphones-headphone-jack/ According to a report from the Business Insider, Apple is looking for permission to begin “high-tech manufacturing” in order to build data-center server gear. And a notice that was published by the US federal government confirms Apple’s new plans. The facility for the productions is located in Mesa, Arizona. But don’t expect to see iPhones and iPads to be manufactured in the U.S. The notice reads: “Apple Inc has repurposed the site as a global data command center that will conduct high-tech manufacturing of finished data center cabinets for other data centers.” If this actually happens Apple would be one of the few US tech companies that build and assemble a finished product inside the country. Many companies have some of their products manufactured outside the United States, in order to cut down costs on labor. Also, back in October the company hired services technicians, managers, engineers, and other professionals to start working at the Arizona facility. Also the finished product will be available only for internal work and not for the consumers. According to the notification: “The nature of the product is not for end users but for other global data centers what will be supported from the site.” As for the product itself, the servers, will be manufactured and shipped from Mesa, Arizona to other data centers. And that is confirmed by the document which reads that the product will be shipped domestically and exported and that the manufacturing facility will “utilize personnel with extensive education and allow Apple to offer best in class data support.” In addition the production could add some other parts and materials such as “server housing and enclosures” and “routers and network switches.” “On its domestic sales, Apple would be able to choose the duty rate during customs entry procedures that applies to finished server assembly cabinets (duty-free) for the foreign-status materials/components noted below and in the existing scope of authority.” According to a report from The Information, Apple spent some time on the design of its own servers, because the company wanted to make sure that the hardware is secure. Maybe Apple is thinking about domestic productions on other products too, but wouldn’t this plan raise up the prices? Is it better to keep things in a distance or keep them close to home?

James Martin/CNET Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Apple is focusing its rumored interest in the augmented reality space on creating a new pair of AR glasses with Carl Zeiss, according to a new report. The tech titan is working with the German optics manufacturer on a pair of lightweight AR/mixed reality glasses, according to tech evangelist Robert Scoble. The project, which could be announced as early as this year, was confirmed by a Zeiss employee, Scoble wrote in a Facebook post Monday. Unlike virtual reality, which promises to immerse goggle-wearing users in new and exciting digital worlds, AR overlays images and data atop the real world. The best-known example of AR today is Pokemon Go, in which Pokemon characters appear on players’ phone screens amid the streets or parks they’re exploring. Play Video CBS This Morning What's next in virtual reality technology? Revenue from virtual and augmented reality could reach $120 billion by 2020, but what will the future of this advanced technology look like? CBS ... Apple’s hinted before it was more interested in augmented reality than virtual reality. In September, Apple CEO Tim Cook told ABC News that he saw bigger possibilities for AR than VR, since AR allows people to be more “present.” “There’s virtual reality and there’s augmented reality -- both of these are incredibly interesting,” Cook said in the interview. “But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.” The company has filed several patents with the the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that deal with augmented reality. For example, an Apple patent application published in 2014 called “Transparent electronic device” envisioned a way of overlaying images over real-world viewable objects.

 Apple patented a full-frontal, edge-to-edge display for iPhones Hannah Roberts Jan. 10, 2017, 10:42 AM 1,614 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's patent is for electronic devices with openings and it references smartphones with a borderless display.United States Patents Office Apple has been awarded a patent specifically referencing devices which have ''a display [that] may occupy the entire front face," the patent's document says. Specifically, the patent (which we first spotted on Apple Insider) is for "electronic devices having displays with openings," behind which electronic components — such as a camera, a speaker, or a microphone — are mounted, forming a window. This would allow Apple to design a smartphone with a borderless display, a feature rumoured to be part of the re-designed premium "iPhone 8," potentially named the iPhone 10, expected to launch later this year. The patent also adds to the rumour that the next-generation iPhone, which leaked manufacturing documents suggest is internally codenamed "Ferrari," will feature a glass-sandwich design (glass at the front and back of the phone). The patent says: "For example, the rear of device 10 [shown in the top image] may be formed from a planar housing structure such as a planar glass member." It also discusses a new potential feature — that one or more of these display openings "may form a window [circled in the image below] through which a user of the device may view an external object [objected 134]," and that "display pixels in the window region may be used in forming a heads-up display." That would mean the user would see a digital image on top of the physical object [134] when looking through the window, which Apple Insider says: "If implemented into a future iPhone ... could be Apple's first foray into augmented reality [AR] ... the system could theoretically go beyond AR and into mixed reality." United States Patent Office   It's important to note that Apple files and is granted patents regularly and this does not confirm it will implement any of the technology it has patented. The images it uses in its patent applications are merely illustrative.

The Finder for Airpods app was one way to lend a hand, but after a short stay in the App Store it is no longer available. Whenever Apple releases a new product, it’s a big deal despite a gadgets size or price. The Airpod launch got folks excited, and for good reason as they are pretty damned slick. At $160 bucks, they aren’t too expensive either although losing one of the wireless earbuds is going to leave folks in a lurch. It did not take long for the Finder for Airpods app to appear, which used Bluetooth to help users locate their missing Airpod. Well, there are going to be a lot of consumers getting refunds today. Apple has pulled the Finder for Airpods app from the App Store. There has been no reason given at the time of this writing although it isn’t super surprising considering Apple has gone down this road before. They could have a solution in app for gearing up to launch in the future or they may have just not liked the way the app worked. While we didn’t test it ourselves, the Finder for Airpods app is only good if you are within Bluetooth range of the earbud, and it isn’t exactly cheap. The Finder for Airpods app was listed at $3.99 in the App Store before it was pulled. Again, considering the price of the headphones, we imagine Apple already has their own official solution in the works, which could be the reason for the move. If you purchased the app, a refund will now be available although we imagine folks are bummed by the news. While it wasn’t insanely accurate, it’s cheaper than shelling out $70 bucks for a replacement Airpod.

Gizmodo reports that it’s not an isolated issue, either, with customers complaining about finding loose change inside their Apple machines since 2010. Workers at Apple’s Genius bar responded to a Reddit post, claiming that it might be children pushing coins inside the laptops’ optical drives. One user who claimed to have worked for Apple’s Genius Bar commented, ‘We’d find stuff like this all the time. Ninety per cent of the time, it was the result of kids shoving things in the Optical Drive. ‘We’d find coins, paperclips, SD cards, you name it. If it was slim enough to fit in the slot, we’d find it in there.’ MORE: Clever fox balances on a 5ft high bird feeder to get a free meal MORE: Hyperloop One will conduct its first full-size test in a matter of months But could there be another explanation? A few years ago, a ‘tip’ from a Japanese Twitter user was widely shared online – about using copper coins to cool overheating components in Apple laptops. Japanese Twitter user akinori_suzuki said that stacking copper coins on his MacBook means that the coins ‘soak up’ the heat, as they’re more conductive than the casing.

The report praises the company’s on-going leadership in matching its growth with an equal or larger supply of renewable energy. Apple led all other companies in its sector, with “A” ratings in energy transparency, efficiency and policy. Despite Greenpeace touting Apple “using [its] influence to push vendors, utilities, and governments to create access to renewable energy where previously there was none,” the company fell to a “B” rating this year in the advocacy department. Still, its total score of 83 percent was still enough to place Apple well-ahead of its nearest competitor, Facebook, at 67 percent. The report raised some concerns over Apple’s concentration of data center power demands in one location, worried that the high power need in such a small space might not align with the company’s renewable power goals. While the expansion of green tariff products — offered by utility companies to large customers looking to obtain certified renewable energy — is allowing Apple to supplement, the report raises concerns that the move doesn’t lead to new renewable energy development, instead relying on existing infrastructure.

Missed Last Fiscal Year At least the Mac maker killed it in 2015. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 10, 2017 at 9:47AM CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple. Ahead of its annual shareholder meeting at the end of next month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gone ahead and filed its proxy statement with the SEC. As usual for proxy statements, Apple is disclosing executive compensation levels for its most prominent executives, along with how it arrives at those levels. Following a relatively tough 2016 that included the first ever decline in iPhone unit sales, all executives including CEO Tim Cook saw pay reductions last year. Apple's compensation committee sets out two critical performance targets each year to gauge the company's performance, and Apple fell short for 2016. Top line and the almost-bottom line More specifically, the two targets relate to top-line revenue and operating income, which is right above the bottom line before miscellaneous income and expenses as well as taxes are taken out. For each metric, Apple sets a threshold goal that must be exceeded for executives to receive their annual cash incentives. At that threshold, the cash bonus is equal to 100% of their respective base salaries. There is also a target goal that earns them 200% payouts, as well as a maximum goal that triggers a generous 400% payout. Both revenue and operating income hit their threshold goals, but fell short of target goals. In the case of operating income, Apple only barely fell short. The company generated revenue of $215.6 billion in fiscal 2016, compared to the target goal of $223.6 billion. Operating income came in at $60 billion, just a hair shy of the target goal of $60.3 billion. Image source: 2016 proxy statement.  For context, Apple utterly hit it out of the park in 2015, exceeding its maximum goals for both metrics -- triggering those hefty 400% payouts in the process. Fiscal 2015 Performance Revenue Operating Income Threshold Goal $188 billion $52.5 billion Target Goal $199 billion $55.1 billion Maximum Goal $210 billion $56.3 billion Actual $233.7 billion $71.2 billion Data source: 2015 proxy statement. However, keep in mind that Cook got a $1 million raise to $3 million last year in terms of his base salary, which represented a 50% boost from 2015. That certainly softened the blow a bit. All told, Cook brought home $8.7 million last year, down from $10.3 million in 2015. The rest of the executive team's base salaries remained unchanged at a cool $1 million per year, although they all received $20 million equity grants in October 2015 (which is part of fiscal 2016). It's all relative Many of the equity grants that Apple executives receive are performance-based, being tied to how Apple shares perform relative to the S&P 500. This is measured in relative total stock return (TSR). In a shareholder-friendly move a couple years ago, Cook chose to voluntarily modify his 2011 CEO grant to swap out time-based shares for performance-based RSUs. A year ago, I noted that Cook was facing a deadline in August 2016 and had a lot to lose if Apple continued to lag the broader market. Fortunately for Cook, shares bounced back and Apple's relative TSR scored well enough (78th percentile) for 280,000 RSUs to vest, the maximum allowed. For the rest of the executive team and their October 2015 grants, here are the necessary relative TSR tiers and respective payouts. Relative TSR vs. S&P 500 Companies Performance-based RSU Vesting as % of Target 85th or above 200% 55th 100% 25th 25% Below 25th 0% Data source: 2016 proxy statement. As of the beginning of 2017, three executives had shares vest after Apple's relative TSR ranked it in the 83rd percentile. Overall, Apple's compensation practices are quite aligned with shareholder interests. Not only does management have to deliver on fundamental performance, but Apple shares also need to fare well in order for executives to claim all of their eligible performance-based RSU grants.

However, the report mentions that these computers might not be the ones that it sells to the average customer. Apple is believed to be consolidating in-house server production at a single production facility in Mesa, Arizona. Some documents have been spotted which reveal that the company has applied for approval of designation as a “foreign trade zone.” This suggests that Apple is interested in manufacturing and assembling its own server and data center machines. It’s not like this move wasn’t expected. A report last year revealed that Apple was gradually moving data center operations in-house as it wanted to increase the security of these products. “Apple Inc has repurposed the site as a global data command center that will conduct high-tech manufacturing of finished data center cabinets for other data centers. The nature of the product is not for end users but for other global data centers that will be supported from the site,” the company’s filing states. Whether or not Apple is going to take a similar step for products meant for average consumers remains to be seen. The company has often been criticized for building its popular products like the iPhone and MacBooks in China. While U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has often said that Apple should start making iPhones in the United States, that’s easier said than done. Filed in Apple..

A study by Greenpeace said the company was making the best use of renewables. In a fresh report called "Clicking Green," environmental organization Greenpeace on Tuesday picked Apple for the third year in a row as the tech company that had made the biggest effort to reduce its ecological footprint. According to the report, Apple was credited with playing "a catalytic role within its IT supply chain, pushing other IT data center and cloud operators … to follow its lead in powering operations with renewable energy." Greenpeace said the energy footprint of the global IT sector currently accounted for only 7 percent of global electricity needs.  But it hastened to add that global internet traffic was expected to rise threefold by the end of the current decade, meaning a larger energy footprint, and meaning that commitments by tech companies to energy sustainability would become even more important in the years ahead. Heterogeneous picture The Greenpeace study said Apple's clean energy index - based on power demand estimates and the use of renewables to meet this demand - was now 83 percent, putting it ahead of the pack. Facebook came in second, with an energy index of 67 percent, followed by Google (56 percent). Watch video 00:46 Share Happy tenth birthday iPhone!

Follow TechnoBuffalo When Apple launches the iPhone 8 later this year, we might have a design that looks relatively familiar. DigiTimes said on Tuesday that Apple is working with its suppliers to provide stainless steel frames for the iPhone 8. That’s a move away from the aluminum unibody design used by Apple and much of the industry flagship smartphones today. DigiTimes said Apple plans to sandwich the stainless steel frame with two glass panels, one on either side. That’s very similar to the design we had with the iPhone 4, which also used stainless steel and had glass on the front and back. If you remember, this phone was particularly prone to cracking, no surprise given it had so much glass, so we hope Apple has worked with suppliers to grab even stronger panels. “Sources from the upstream supply chain pointed out that the cost of the forging process is 30-50% cheaper than the current unibody CNC machine process, while quality control is also more stable,” DigiTimes added, noting that Wistron will join Pegatron and Foxconn in assembling the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 needs a fresh look The report lines up with earlier rumors that also suggested Apple is moving away from the current design, which has been in use for three years since the introduction of the iPhone 6. The glass design may help Apple add bonus features, like wireless charging, which doesn’t work well with aluminum unibody designs. We’ll start to learn more as September approaches.

Business & Tech 14:50 10 Jan 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 5 days ago Greenpeace has declared Apple to be the most environmentally-friendly tech company in the world in its latest Clicking Clean report. It secured the top spot for the third year on the bounce, fending off strong competition from Facebook and Google, who also scored 'A' grades. Apple came out with a clean energy index score of 83%, compared to Facebook's 67% and Google's 56%. Greenpeace's index measures the amount of energy that firms use from renewable sources and hydroelectric power. On top of this, it assesses the company's transparency when it comes to energy sourcing and planning and the clean energy advocacy work they put in. With data centre energy currently using roughly 7% of the world's electricity, the iPhone maker has been at the forefront of ensuring that its facilities are running completely on renewables. The report stated: “We actually are seeing a significant increase in the prioritisation of renewables among some of the largest internet companies. "We have witnessed leaders such as Google, Apple, Facebook, eBay, and now Switch using their influence to push vendors, utilities, and governments to create access to renewable energy where previously there was none.” Greenpeace had previously publicly slammed the likes of Apple, Amazon and Facebook for the use of “dirty coal” at their data centres, but give a more approving, optimistic tone in the latest report: “The past year has seen a significant jump as fifteen data centre operators and major internet companies have embraced the importance of powering their rapidly growing operations with renewable energy. "“The race to build a renewably powered internet started with digital platform leaders such as Facebook, Apple, and Google who first made 100% renewable commitments four years ago and have now been joined by nearly 20 internet companies, including global cloud and colocation companies who had previously been lagging far behind.” Conversely, Greenpeace singled out East Asian internet companies as a cause for concern. Apple in Athenry In December, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that the company ran its "business on 100% renewable energy". Google is aiming to hit that target this year. Apple's planned – and much-delayed – €850m data centre in Athenry, Co Galway, is set to follow that totally clean model if it gets the go-ahead. The company has also agreed to a number of conditions, committing to planting hundreds of acres of deciduous trees to offset the environmental impact of the construction and establishing a €1m fund for ocean energy testing in Galway. One of the people objecting to the proposals, a Wicklow landowner, had raised concerns about the effect on the forestry at the Coillte-owned lands at Derrydonnell. Peter Feeney, a Fine Gael councillor and 'Athenry for Apple' member, told Newstalk Breakfast last November: "Ironically, there'll be more trees and better quality trees when Apple is finished than when they started, because it is a cutaway forest – effectively more than half of the 500 acres is cut away at this stage." 14:50 10 Jan 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 5 days ago 3 Related articles Apple's Tim Cook will not appear before Oireachtas Finance Committee Ireland is more ready for a cashless society than you might think Apple pulls New York Times from China App Store most popular latest sport The most expensive street in Ireland has been named "I was pissed off": Dublin club footballer fuming that GAA player-coach contract was leaked onto social media Senegal beat Tunisia 2-0 in the African Nations Cup Brendan Rodgers aiming to keep Celtic progressing in 2017 site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Now, it appears the company won't be doing it alone. According to a new report, Apple is teaming with optics company Carl Zeiss to work on a high-tech pair of glasses. Carl Zeiss AR Glasses from CES 2016/Credit: Sherri SmithMore Carl Zeiss AR Glasses from CES 2016/Credit: Sherri Smith The news comes by way of noted blogger Robert Scoble, who claims a Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that "Apple and Carl Zeiss are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year." As Scoble points out, Zeiss' CES 2017 booth was located in the Augmented Reality section of the show, despite the company not having any new AR products on hand. Scoble's report doesn't offer many details, though the fact that he makes specific mention of a "light" pair of glasses suggests that Apple's goggles may be a mainstream-friendly lifestyle product, much like Snap's Spectacles. Snap Inc.'s new wearable became an instant hit when it launched late last year, thanks to its ability to record first-person Snapchat videos and the fact that it more or less looks like a normal pair of sunglasses. MORE: The Best New Tech From CES Zeiss, Apple's potential partner, is no stranger to high-tech glasses and cameras. The company's products include a line of lens add-ons for smartphones, as well as Zeiss VR One, the company's own mobile VR headset. At least year's CES, we went hands-on with a prototype pair of glasses from Smart Optics, a startup venture from the Carl Zeiss Group. It had a small, strategically-placed OLED display and a fresnel lens (a flat lens comprised of a series of concentric circles), creating a non-obtrusive augmented data delivery system. During the demo, the glasses received data from a nearby phone. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been championing AR for quite some time, calling it a "core technology" in an interview last year with the Washington Post. Cook also hinted that AR is "something we're doing a lot of things on behind [the] curtain." Apple isn't the only major player apparently looking to bring augmented reality to the masses. Scoble notes that Meta, a company whose AR glasses have blown us away in the past, are working on a similarly mainstream product with optics company Lumus. Bloomberg's original report from last November suggested a possible 2018 launch for Apple's AR glasses. But based on Scoble's new info, it appears that Apple's specs may be ready for a 2017 reveal. With the 10th-anniversary iPhone likely launching this September, perhaps Apple is looking to make an extra-big splash with its milestone handset by pairing it with a set of glasses that blend iOS apps with the real world.

The newly released Gear S app for iOS works with the Gear S2 and Gear S3 smartwatches. The Gear Fit app works with Samsung's Gear Fit 2 fitness tracker. The free apps, which are available now in Apple's App Store, mean anyone with an iPhone will be able to download the app, set it up, and finally pair their Samsung Gear smartwatch with Apple's handset. The apps let you manage Gear apps, change battery settings, and handle notifications. You can also access most of the same fitness features. MORE: Best Smartwatches - Top Picks for Android and iOS It's not always common for companies that compete against each other to support the other firm's platforms. Apple, for instance, has long avoided the practice of sharing its apps and other products with third-parties, hoping instead that customers will invest in its own ecosystem of hardware and software to get what it says is the best experience. Apple Music is one recent exception. Still, Apple's policy has been criticized by those who say it should be more open to other platforms such as Android and make it easier for fans of other platforms to access its products. Apple has, in the vast majority of cases, ignored those requests. Take the Apple Watch, for instance, which only pairs with iOS devices. Meanwhile, Samsung has promised iOS support for its smartwatches over the last few years, but failed to deliver in 2016. That's changed with these new apps, giving smartwatch owners who don't want to use Android another option at their disposal. Both the Gear S and Gear Fit apps require iOS 9 or later in order to allow two-way communication between the devices.

A new report from China is saying the Cupertino giant is borrowing design elements from the iPhone 4 to make its upcoming smartphone. On Tuesday, Chinese newspaper Digitimes reported that Apple is reviving the stainless steel frame of the iPhone 4 and using it to perfect the design and look it is going for with the iPhone 8. The iPhone 4 used stainless steel frames from Foxconn and U.S. company Jabil. With the nearing launch of the iPhone 8, Apple is said to be ordering the same component from the same companies.  The steel frame has a major function aside from complementing the aesthetic of the device; it will be the one responsible for holding together the glass panels Apple is using on the front and the back of the next-generation iPhone.  Related Stories Apple Rolls Out iOS 10.2.1 Beta 3 Amid iPhone's 10th Anniversary Apple Releases New watchOS 3.1.3, tvOs 10.1.1 Betas Apple Rolls Out macOS Sierra 10.12.3 Beta 3 The inclusion of the stainless steel frame in the design of the iPhone 8 could only mean that Apple is abandoning its usual aluminum iPhone back design and will instead focus on keeping the two glass panels together while also ensuring that the costs of manufacturing would not be that expensive.  The idea that Apple is preparing a mostly-glass iPhone for this fall season was first raised by KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is already a reliable insider when it comes to all things Apple. Kuo announced in April of last year that the iPhone 8 will be having glass panels on its back and front with a metal band to hold these two together. According to 9To5Mac, Apple’s Jony Ive has long been planning to come up with a smartphone that’s just a “single slab of glass.” Somehow, Samsung’s biggest rival is moving toward that goal since the iPhone was previously reported to just embed the Home button and Touch ID scanner into the display to ensure the almost edge-to-edge design of the device.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Comments Contents Release date Name Design New features When will the iPhone 7s be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus handsets for 2017? Welcome to our iPhone 7s rumour roundup, in which we gather and analyse the latest clues and speculation about the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, new features and more. If you've come here in search of information about the current iPhone range, allow us to direct you to our iPhone 7 review, iPhone 7 Plus review, iPhone buying guide 2016/2017 and best iPhone deals UK. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7, alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus, during a special event on 7 September last year. But we're already looking ahead to the next iPhone in 2017. In this article we sift through the clues and evidence pointing to Apple's iPhone 7s launch later this year, and predict the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, design and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information emerges, so check back regularly for the latest iPhone 7s rumours. Updated, 10 January 2017, with predictions of a stainless steel chassis; on 8 Dec, with reports of a new red colour option for the iPhone 7s; on 4 Dec, to add further detail to reports that the iPhone 7s will feature wireless charging, as well as claims (from Donald Trump) that Donald Trump is pressuring Tim Cook to build iPhones in the US; and on 17 Nov, to report on a source's claim that Apple is integrating augmented reality into its next iPhone Read more: iPhone 8 rumours | iPhone 9 rumours | Best cheap iPhone deals UK iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Release date The iPhone 7 was announced on 7 September, and pre-orders began on 9 September; it went on sale on 16 September. (Read our list of the Best cheap iPhone 7 deals.) Which gives us some pretty strong hints about when to expect the iPhone 7s. Ever since the launch of the iPhone 4s, Apple has consistently updated its iPhones once a year, in autumn (with one exception: the smaller iPhone SE was launched in March 2016), so we're expecting the iPhone 7s to appear some time in September 2017. Here are our predictions of upcoming iPhone release dates over the next few years: Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Mind you, it's possible that Apple might bring the iPhone 8 forward... as we discuss in the next section. iPhone 7s release date rumours: Donald Trump 'pressuring Apple to build iPhone 7s in the US' As part of his recent presidential campaign, Donald Trump complained about Apple's offshore manufacturing operations, and boasted that he would make the company build its iPhones in the US (and employ a bunch of Americans in the process). Now, as president-elect, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump described a call he had with Tim Cook about the issue, and appeared to think he had been extremely persuasive. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, where labour costs are lower (and the relevant skills are more plentiful, according to Cook). But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'" What Trump does not claim is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. And Tim Cook doesn't strike us as someone who could easily be cowed into taking a course of action that isn't in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. Other Apple products made in the US The idea of US manufacture isn't totally alien to Apple, although it is unusual and restricted to far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, but this is a niche product - a flagship niche product, to be sure, but one that is made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Arizona. (The plant was going to be used for sapphire screens, but that fell through.) Rather boringly, Apple will be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but any increase in the company's US manufacturing footprint will add to speculation that Donald Trump's very public pressure is beginning to have an effect. (The President Elect is quite canny at taking credit for things that are unrelated to - and sometimes precede - the actions he claims to have caused them, as the US automotive industry is currently discovering.) iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Name Apple habitually follows what is known as a 'tick-tock' release cycle with its iPhones. One year it will release a full-number upgrade, featuring a significant physical redesign (iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6); then the next year it will release an 'S' upgrade which has the same physical design as its predecessor but adds new features and spec boosts (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s). For this reason many Apple fans choose to upgrade their phones once every two years. Given that the iPhone 7 appeared in 2016, the obvious conclusion is that Apple will unveil an iPhone 7s (and accompanying iPhone 7s Plus) in autumn 2017. But there have been increasingly widespread murmurs that it's about time for Apple to retire its tick-tock cycle, which deprecates the importance of its S releases and discourages regular updates. What's more, 2017 is the iPhone's 10th-anniversary year, and the iPhone 7 had a surprisingly similar physical design to the iPhone 6 and 6s (headphone port aside). For these reasons, quite a few of us suspect that Apple will go all-out with a blockbuster release, branded as the iPhone 8, next year. Indeed, a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory in early October 2016. Business Insider reports that an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". Poll: what will Apple call the next iPhone? iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Design What physical changes can we expect in the iPhone 7s? Logically, an S upgrade would imply a lack of a physical redesign, but Apple has kept largely the same chassis for three iPhones in a row now and we'd be shocked if the company doesn't pull some kind of major revamp out of the bag. No more Home button Some while back Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, reasoning that the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s could largely take its place and allow Apple to use the space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. (A corollary of Munster's theory is that the Touch ID fingerprint scanner would need to move - perhaps being built into the screen itself.) Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true - indeed, Munster has made a few famously misjudged predictions in the past, along with some decent calls - but may yet happen on the iPhone 7s.  Technology that could help with this development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company, Sonavation. Its tech would enable Apple to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that seems relevant to this concept. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the illustrations: (The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept itself, not to show what it would look like in practice or the way other elements of the product would change to adapt to it.) What's more, Apple has been granted another patent that also refers to a fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more pertinently to this discussion, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". Glass front and back 9to5Mac cites a report, from the generally reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, that predicts - based on the popularity of the (scratch-prone) Jet Black iPhone 7 -  that the next iPhone will have a glass front and back that mimic that device's glossy looks but are better able to resist scratch damage. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests," the site predicts, "an all-glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design." Stainless steel chassis DigiTimes (a Chinese-language site which Apple Insider describes as a "hit-or-miss publication", with polite savagery), is predicting that the chassis of the iPhone 7s will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than favoured manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing the usual anonymous sources in the supply chain. This would be a surprise, to be honest, given Apple's overwhelming recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s were designed with steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium for the iPhone line ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time around: whereas the iPhone 4-gen handsets were milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that creates stronger components. Colour options The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in five colour options: silver, gold, Rose Gold (pink), (matt) black and Jet Black. The iPhone 7s will probably be available in the same colours, but it's believed that there will be a sixth red option as well. The (generally pretty reliable) Japanese-language site Macotakara has posted a report that cites a source in the Taiwanese supply chain and says it is highly probably red will be added to the colour line-up. (A slight complication here is that Apple has historically made red products as part of the Product Red HIV/AIDS charity, rather than as a cosmetic preference. Macotakara doesn't comment on whether this will be tied in with that charity.) Mockup illustration courtesy of Macotakara Before the launch of the iPhone 7 there were rumours about a Deep Blue colour option, but we've not heard much about that since then. iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: New features Pundits are increasingly looking ahead to 2017 for a big iPhone launch. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse forecast that the 10th-anniversary iPhone released in 2017 (which they predict will be called iPhone 8 in recognition of its major updates, incidentally) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Here are some more features we could see in the iPhone 7s. Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), but was introduced to the Apple Watch in the form of inductive charging... and this is significant. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate - but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This came too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but the technology may appear in the 7s generation. Foxconn, a huge iPhone manufacturer, is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones. (Apple likes to have at least one major feature that sets the Plus model apart, and so it would makes a certain sense to limit this to the large model only.) The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in a report that Apple will indeed bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the various Apple Watch models. Perhaps the iPhone 7s Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 7s buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers a little more detail from Ming-Chi Kuo's report on wireless charging; one aspect it mentions - which appears to contradict earlier rumours that Foxconn was leading the way in this area - is that Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of this component.  Augmented reality and VR According to a source cited by Business Insider (described only as "a person familiar with the matter"), Apple is currently working on a new augmented reality feature for the 2017 iPhone update. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised," said the site. "Another early feature for Apple's AR integration into the camera app could be to recognise and manipulate people's faces." This fits with earlier predictions raised in a far-ranging and fascinating Facebook post by Robert Scoble which discussed the way VR and augmented reality will figure in Apple's upcoming iPhones. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming... and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts that users will "pop [the new iPhone] into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it... The clear iPhone will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does. "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand."

Our pick this week is HyperDrive, an add-on for the new 2016 MacBook Pro that gives you all the ports the otherwise excellent laptop should have had in the first place. And our one to avoid? We dig up a gem of a retro religious games console that puts the 'fun' in Christian fundamentalist. Related: Eve V slays the Surface Pro 4 on specs What is the HyperDrive? It's a connectivity hub for the MacBook Pro that gives you a lot more options when it comes to charging and accessories. Plug it in, and you'll get an HDMI, two USB 3.1, an SD/microSD card slot and two Thunderbolt/USB-C combo ports. Why is it interesting? Because lately, Apple has been dropping ports from its laptops like they're going out of fashion. Following in the footsteps of the 2016 12-inch MacBook and its predecessor, the 2015 MacBook, the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro only features USB-C ports. There's no regular USB options, no SD card slot, and no video inputs, putting many of us off the notebooks. It means that if you want to use or juice up accessories that don't rely USB-C, you'll need a variety of dongles, which gets a bit messy. Or you could just buy the HyperDrive. Related: What is USB-C? All you need to know It basically fixes everything Apple managed to mess up with the MacBook Pro. Not only does it add all kinds of connections to your machine, it runs faster than most USB-C dongles, which are based on the USB 3.0 standard and max out at about 5Gb/s. The HyperDrive claims to be 10-times faster, because it uses two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C connections to snuggle up to your laptop. With a 50Gb/s bandwidth, your file transfers will go in the blink of an eye, plus you get seven ports in one fell swoop, unlike most dongles. It's highly portable, too. Some dongles are the size of a brick and seriously weighty, but the HyperDrive is small enough to fit in your pocket, or stash away in your bag without bogging you down. Plus, it matches the colour schemes of the new MacBook Pros, and the same model fits both the 13 and 15-inch models. In terms of specs, here's how the ports stack up. The HDMI gives you 1080p video @ 60Hz and up to 4K @ 30Hz. It also replaces the two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports it takes up; the Thunderbolt 3 gives you up to 5K or two 4K videos @ 60Hz, and provides up to 40Gb/s data speed with a maximum power delivery of 100W, while USB-C gives you data speeds of up to 5Gb/s. The SD/microSD ports provide UHS-I 104MB/s, and there are two good old-fashioned USB 3.1 ports with 5Gb/s data speeds. That should cover your needs. Related: Bixi adds gesture controls to any smart device on the cheap What are the challenges? As we've explained before, crowdfunding is a risky business. When you back a project, you're not ordering a product from Argos or Amazon, but rather pledging your support for an idea and the team/company that wants to make it. All things being well, you'll receive your product as advertised, but in a small minority of cases, the project flounders and backers get nowt – even established companies like former Kickstarter darling Pebble (RIP) have run into trouble for various reasons. That said, the firm behind the HyperDrive has made four previous USB-C hubs, so it has plenty of prior experience. It's already started mass production of the HyperDrive, and says it's raising money through Kickstarter in order to achieve economies of scale and keep costs down.

Related: Remix IO is a 4K HDR Android media box that does it all Is there anything similar available? Apple sells a range of dongles, but they mostly only serve one port each, which means if you want to bring back the full range of ports offered on its previous MacBook Pro, you'll need to spend a fortune on dongles – and then remember to carry them around with you. There are others that have more connections, like this Satechi one, but they're only powered by one USB-C port, giving them less bandwidth. On paper at least, the HyperDrive really stands out compared to the competition. Related: The MVR Ascend is a British-made Gear VR rival Should I crowdfund this? If you're the owner of a new MacBook Pro and you're after more connections, extra bandwidth, and less hassle, look no further. The HyperDrive has already smashed its funding goal, with prices starting at $69 (£57). But, act fast as the campaign ends on Tuesday, January 17 and there's a limited supply of many backer rewards – some are already sold out. Shipping should start in March this year. Back the HyperDrive on Kickstarter here And one to avoid this week... The Arkade. It's a classic console plug-and-play, in the same vein as the Nintendo Classic Mini, but there's one rather large caveat – it only comes preloaded with Christian games. That's right, every title is made by Christian game developer Wisdom Tree, previously behind smash hits like Super Noah's Ark 3D for the SNES. Here, your $45 (about £37, which is only a shade cheaper than the Classic Mini's £50 RRP) gets you a whopping eight pre-loaded 8-bit God games. With names like Sunday Funday and Bible Adventures, they aim to instil bible teachings through interactive gameplay, which is fine if you like that kind of thing, but we'll stick with Mario and Mega Man, thanks.

Business What Powers Your Cloud? Greenpeace Jan. 10, 2017 02:07PM EST LIKE ECOWATCH ON FACEBOOK Get our Newsletter A new Greenpeace report, Clicking Clean: Who is Winning the Race to Build a Green Internet?, finds that Apple, Google, Facebook and newcomer Switch are leading the charge to build a renewably powered internet. These companies are coupling transitions of their data centers to clean energy with strong advocacy for access to renewable options. But while nearly 20 internet companies have now committed to 100 percent renewable energy, the reality is that much of the sector continues to grow rapidly in Asia and U.S. markets like Virginia, both of which have little to no renewable energy options. "Thanks to the leadership and advocacy of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Switch, we are seeing the tech industry make major strides toward powering the internet with clean energy," said Greenpeace Senior IT Analyst Gary Cook. "A growing number of companies now recognize the need to transition to renewables, but we must see greater urgency and transparency across the board. Amazon Web Services is a prime example of a company that talks up its renewable projects, but keeps customers in the dark on its energy performance while expanding into markets served by dirty energy like Virginia." Despite some movement, the lack of transparency by some of the largest players in the sector remains a critical barrier, masking both their current size and whether the renewable deals they are claiming are actually changing the power mix in the markets they are expanding into. Much clearer reporting, like we now see from industry leaders Apple, Facebook and Switch, must be embraced by the massive cloud companies and colocation operators that most of the internet is powered by. While Amazon Web Services has revealed some detail on its energy demand for the first time, much greater transparency must be expected of it and others that are making decisions about how the internet is powered. The report also evaluates emerging East Asian internet companies for the first time, finding that the region is well behind the U.S. market in renewable commitments due in part to fewer clean energy options from monopoly utilities. East Asian internet giants, including Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba, have not committed to 100 percent renewable energy and lack basic transparency around their energy performance. Increased advocacy efforts for key renewable policy changes are needed from East Asian internet companies as they look to expand globally. "We must see East Asian internet companies exhibiting the will to commit to 100 percent renewable energy, particularly as they expand to markets around the world," said Greenpeace East Asia Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner Jude Lee. "Leading IT companies in the United States have already shown that the majority of the industry recognizes that clean power is both good for the environment and good for business. East Asian companies must step up to embrace that reality as well." Netflix has one of the largest data footprints of the companies profiled in the report, accounting for one third of internet traffic in North America and contributing significantly to the worldwide data demand from video streaming. The company announced in 2015 that it intended to fully offset its carbon footprint, but a closer examination reveals it is likely turning to carbon offsets or unbundled renewable energy credits, which do little to increase renewable energy investment. Like Apple, Facebook and Google, Netflix is one of the biggest drivers of the online world and has a critical say in how it is powered. Like its peers, Netflix must embrace the responsibility to make sure its growth is powered by renewables, not fossil fuels. This year's report scores the renewable efforts of nearly 70 websites and applications popular in the U.S., China and South Korea. For the third year in a row, Apple, Google and Facebook rank among the highest performing companies, while newcomer Switch takes the top spot. Along with Google, Apple continues to match its growth with the equivalent or greater supply of renewable energy. Switch scored the highest of all operators for its efforts to transition its data center fleet to renewables through both procurement and aggressive advocacy. "Sustained and vocal advocacy by corporations that recognize the ecological and economic imperative of an aggressive transition to renewable sources of electricity has never been more important in the United States given the election of Donald Trump, who has promised to roll back climate policies and revive the use of coal," Cook concluded. Greenpeace The energy footprint of the IT sector as a whole is currently estimated to consume 7 percent of global electricity, with an anticipated threefold increase in global internet traffic by 2020. Greenpeace has benchmarked the energy performance of leading IT companies since 2009. Facebook, Apple and Google were the first companies to make 100 percent renewable commitments five years ago. Companies evaluated in this report have signed more than 5GW in renewable deals globally since 2010.

Partners University of Western Australia provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation AU. View all partners Republish this article Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Steve Jobs introduces iPhone. YouTube Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn It is 10 years this week since Steve Jobs walked onto a stage and said “Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything”. He was referring to the iPhone, launched on January 9th 2007. Like many products, it could be argued that it wasn’t until version 3 in 2009 and the iPhone 3GS when everyone else started to really share Jobs’ vision. The App Store had been available for a year by then and the notion of the smartphone as a truly portable general purpose computing device was born. Since 2007, Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones, generating about US $650 billion in revenue for the firm. In addition, Apple’s App Store generated US $28 billion of revenue last year alone. Of course, Apple’s sales in smartphones are now only 13% of smartphone sales globally, but Apple takes nearly all of the profit. Apple didn’t invent the smartphone and has to share honours with Google’s Android in driving the development of smartphone technologies and in particular the development of the mobile app environment. Certainly there would be nowhere near the adoption worldwide if Android had not enabled the development of inexpensive handsets. Smartphone adoption now stands at 43% of adults globally but goes up to as much as 77% in Australia and 72% in the US. This is now greater than the number of adults who own computers. There is not a facet of life that hasn’t been changed by the advent of the smartphone, with most of these changes occurring within the last 5 years. Australians spend on average an hour a day on mobile devices, with the majority of that time being spent on social networks. This is not as much as the nearly three hours a day spent by Americans on TV, but as TV itself moves increasingly to streaming, more of that time will be on mobile platforms. Irrespective of the total amount of time spent on smartphones, what they have given us is freedom and control in our lives. In health, education, politics and social discourse, smartphones have provided the universal accessibility for an almost fully democratic participation. On a more practical level, we have the freedom to buy products from anywhere at any time and not be constrained by what is on offer in our physical location. We can consult with health providers anywhere or even check on their advice. We have the freedom to share our opinions and thoughts with anyone at any time. The mobile phone played a significant role in the last US election and is now the primary means by which the US president will communicate with the country and the rest of the world. We have the wisdom of the world at our fingertips and even the ability to converse with our devices to allow them to guide and advise us. Most importantly, we can communicate and relate with our family, friends and colleagues at all times from anywhere in the world. We can use the phone to document our lives and share whatever portion of it with whichever audience we choose. None of this was really viable or possible before the advent of the smartphone, and certainly not before Apple and Google created the platforms to enable this to happen. Of course, the world had to change to adapt to the possibilities created by the smartphone. Businesses like Uber would not have been possible but they had to put the technology together with the idea and drivers to enact them. Technologies like Bluetooth have been developed alongside the smartphone to enable the connection of devices to the phone that have made possible wearables, headphones and other devices. The smartphone itself would have been worth nothing if the Internet had not existed and the world wide web and browsers hadn’t created the means to communicate and interact on a global scale. So many different technologies have been brought together in the past 10 years that it is wrong to think that it was simply Apple or Google that brought the world we live in to bear. What Apple did however was to create the vessel in which these other technologies were able to work together to achieve what they have done. They would not have worked in a world of desktop or even laptop computers, or other devices. Although we don’t know the exact details of what the smartphone will look like in 10 years time, we know it will still be here and the main device we interact with. As the TV has not gone away but simply got smarter, the same is likely to be the case with the smartphone. The artificial intelligence capabilities of the phones will be far greater and the technologies that interact with the phone will catch up to match its capabilities. Apple may not have invented the smartphone but it certainly made them the life transforming devices that we have now.

By Steffen Reich, Jan 10, 2017 Tweet 22 Comments There is no debate that a large contingent on the internet has been holding out for less Pokémon Go news in 2017, but it is equally clear that this sentiment will not be echoed by the people at Niantic. No matter the side of the fence you are on, the fact that Pokemon Go is hands down one of the most successful apps in the history of the App Store (breaking first-week download and revenue records) is a big deal, and the augmented reality laced game will continue to rake in millions of users and dollars in the year ahead. It’s not all rosy though, as the daily player count is continuously pointing south and engagement data crumbling. As much as this is Niantic’s battle to fight, Apple too has a vested interest in the preservation of Pokemon Go’s winning streak and will want to benefit financially from the game throughout the current fiscal year. The question both business entities therefore are going to have to find answers to is what’s next for Pokémon Go strategically, and what is Apple’s role in facilitating Niantic’s continued success with the app? Not so much content wise but rather in terms of product strategy, I have sized up a few moves that Niantic, The Pokémon Company and Apple could have up their sleeves over the next 12 months. Based off what we have seen Niantic do so far in the wake of the release, more likely than not a fair bit of their strategy is going to carry over to the new year. Aside from the predictable elements, it is of course conjecture to forecast what else is in store, but there sure are better and worse guesses. The first major fork in Niantic’s product roadmap for Pokémon Go has been reached in December, when the game finally landed on Apple Watch. It is too early to tell the impact of that on daily revenues and active users, but going by my circle of friends and personal experience, we will see a positive bell shape in the stats around December and January. Niantic might get to breathe a sigh of relief there, but put into perspective the numbers are still slumping, with daily revenues down from $16m in July to $2m in October. The watch application is not going to be potent enough to buck the trend all by itself, but provided there is a temporary upward lift, the next challenge will be preempting the oncoming crash. Keeping the game relevant Consequently, the only way to break the pattern of steep drops for Pokemon Go is to non-stop provide new content or events to incentivise returning, or in other words to make the game ‘stickier’. With Pokémon Go, the unfortunate fact of the matter is that while the game consists of a considerable framework, that blueprint has still not been filled with enough substance. The result of that is no real sense of progression or reward from the catching, grinding and the odd Poké-battle. Since I don’t want to slip into content discussions too much, the only way to iron out that downside from a strategic point of view is to keep the game relevant by means of constant game updates, seasonal or social events. If casual gamers don’t care about coming back for the actual game, the only other viable alternative to ensure they don’t jump off the hook is to repeatedly offer special events that are tempting enough to check them out.  We have seen Niantic engage in that tactic already with holiday themed updates and in-game easter eggs and it’s all but a foregone conclusion to expect a lot more of the kind in the months to come. Strategic partnerships are another example of Niantic fighting gripes of an innately hollow game with external measures. As covered before, Pokémon Go has started partnering with various companies to bring more (of the same) content to a growing number of venues. Aligning the Pokémon game with other companies is smart branding, but ultimately just another low-hanging fruit strategy to keep the app relevant. Despite this being nothing but a lipstick-on-a-pig tactic (covering up the real shortcomings of the game), don’t be surprised to read about new partnerships struck all year long. Short-term actions like the above will not turn around Pokémon’s fortune, but it might just inject enough of the good stuff to keep the patient alive. Diversifying the game Zooming out a little bit, we move into wildcard territory. That is not to say everything from here on is pure conjecture. Niantic has proven (twice, if you want to count Pokemon Go Plus) their readiness to port and rethink Pokémon Go for other platforms, which is why I don’t believe it is a reach to see them further branch out within each respective ecosystem. You will have to be at least in your mid twenties to compute the following reference, but I could well envision for example a Pokémon Snap-like world open up on your living room TV on the dedicated Pokémon Go app for Apple TV. Perhaps I am getting carried away a little, but even if we strip Pokémon Snap of its ‘complexity’ (you take pictures of Pokémon in the wild), it would stack up for Niantic to offer a very plain Apple TV app that does nothing more but showcase your caught Pokémon in all their glory. Diversifying the product offering and subsequently integrating all vehicles into a cohesive environment is not only how Apple made billions of dollars, but it would make perfect sense for something as ambitious as Pokémon Go: using your watch to notch up miles, your iPhone to catch and battle and at the end of the day you get to marvel at your newest pet monsters come to life on your TV. By the same token, a similar argument can be contrived for a macOS app, and this is where both Niantic and Apple would need to suss out the viability of such extensions, not alone in terms of lucrativeness but also security (keeping hackers at bay). With Nintendo at long last making a push for Apple’s platforms, things will also get a lot more convoluted in terms of licensing, as they and The Pokémon Company are part owners of Niantic and plenty of thought is going to go into how to avoid crossing each other’s (revenue) streams on a platform like Apple TV. Take Pokémon Go out of its microcosm Let’s finish this one off a whit outside the box: imagine catching Pokémon in Go became a lot more meaningful because your mobile game was linked to your Nintendo account and whatever you caught in the real world would be transferred right over to your (a lot more wholesome) Nintendo games. Sounds pretty good, huh? At least that is what I thought. If there is only the slightest chance for Niantic, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company to somehow realize this, employees and lawyers of each company should be locked into one big board room and not be released before there is a handshake agreement on it. Pokémon Go would kill multiple birds with one stone, as it would become fully embedded into the Pokémon universe and simultaneously silence anyone (rightly) criticizing the game for its lacklustre playability. A deal of that magnitude would turn Pokémon Go into a gateway drug and conduit to a much richer Pokémon universe. To that effect, the implications of such deal would be huge for Apple and Nintendo, as both parties would get access to new markets and potential customers for their platforms. In summary, Niantic is going to stand by their 2016 mantra and bank on sustained PR work and seasonal updates. At the same time I expect them to work on product extensions, including stocking up the Apple Watch experience and a foray to new platforms in order to expand the scope of Pokémon Go. With that, content additions are just as critical for a long-term success, but I have made the conscious decision to leave that particular discussion to the gamers amongst you. So go ahead, let me know in the comments what you want to see in future Pokémon Go updates!

Rowan09 Agneev Mukherjee I was, but when I realized that I have to devote half an hour for reading an article, I decided to ask for a TL;DR. You have to admit that it’s one of the longest articles ever written… askep3 Lol no it’s on the medium short side there are much longer articles on this website Agneev Mukherjee Oh yeah? Give a link?! Agneev Mukherjee I actually read all articles besides the Daily Deals, just so you know… Agneev Mukherjee *asshole alert Diego Milano I still have no idea what people find so amusing about this game. Anonymouse Me too. I’m waiting for the day someone puts out an app called Pokemon Stop! Diego Milano It’s only until someone runs over a kid standing in the middle of the street to catch a Pokemon. BlackPantherK Add a joystick or arrow keys + putting a story behind it would solve the problem (that’s what most of my friends complain about haha)…. Rowan09 I got bored a long time ago and still not pass level 4. askep3 Same it’s just not worth the grind, I got it again when they released the Apple Watch version, opened it up, and after 15 minutes finally found a Pokémon!!!!!! A 50 CP Pidgey! Complete bs and a total waste of time Rowan09 Pretty much. What Nintendo needs to do is release a real Pokémon version for the App Store. Jovani Hernandez Like Nintendo with MARIO Sapphire S The games too slow now. theres no excitment in waiting ages to see if pokamon stay in the ball then continous attempts after that to throw balls and waiting still for them only to find the pokamon doesnt want to be caught and youve used all your pokaballs. Well done what a brilliant update. I liked the game when it first came out and pokamon were actually catchable so i could move onto the next and go on a lil pokamon adventure. Now it consists of standing in the same spot loosing all your pokaballs on 1 or 2 pokamon so close the game till i decide i next wana waste time hating a game i used to love Bugs Bunnay don’t you just LOVE the comments section? isaac suhail This game will forever be a popular game. Not nearly a second big as when it first came out but Pokémon go is going to get a lot more complete and when it does I believe it’s fan base will return big. But players like me enjoy the game because we grew up with Pokémon. I know plenty of people who still love it and play it. It’s dying out but many people in my city still play it and it’s awesome. jsk2 The Pokémon Go Plus is a Nintendo product, NOT a Niantic product. And as Nintendo controls all of the game licensing for the Pokémon franchise, it was probably an offer they couldn’t refuse. That, and I’m not sure how the Go Plus is a “platform.” The best part of the Go Plus (for those of us in rural areas) is that you can use it to safely hit pokéstops as you drive through town and it lets you beat the speed limit the Go game puts on pokéstop interaction. But otherwise I agree with your article: Niantic needs to seriously upgrade the game’s content if they wish to keep their customers. All those special events definitely helped. But, now that they’re over, the game feels stale again. P.S. As for the all the haters: guess what, not everyone in the world likes and dislikes the exact same things you do. For some of us, it makes the bore of exercising far more tolerable. Get over it and go back to keeping billygoats from crossing bridges! David Ruiz Multiplayer!

In a Facebook post published Tuesday, well-known blogger Robert Scoble claims that the Cupertino firm has partnered with German lens specialist and optical instruments maker Carl Zeiss on the project, which should develop augmented reality optics for the digital glasses. It’s unclear how reliable Scoble’s information is, but Apple is thought to have already talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers. Scoble claims that a Zeiss employee confirmed the partnership between Apple and Carl Zeiss in a quick interview at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada last week. “A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year. (I thought it was next year but now that I saw this I believe it will happen this year),” reads his post. Unlike virtual reality products that completely immerse you in three-dimensional CGI-generated worlds, augmented reality headsets and glasses superimpose computer imagery on top of the real world. As mentioned, Bloomberg’s November 2016 report stated that Apple’s smart digital glasses would connect wirelessly to an iPhone and project images and other information into the wearer’s field of vision. The Cupertino firm has reportedly ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, Bloomberg added. “Augmented reality can be really great. We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We’re high on augmented reality in the long run,” Apple’s boss Tim Cook said in July.

By Rob Thubron on Jan 10, 2017, 8:30 AM 13 comments TechSpot Considering that Apple charges $69 to replace a single lost AirPod, you would imagine that an app designed to find one of the misplaced wireless buds would be a good thing. But it seems the iPhone maker disagrees, and has just pulled ‘Finder for AirPods’ from its app store. The clever application uses Bluetooth signal strength from a lost AirPod to help guide an owner to its position using a hotter/colder system. It isn't able to find a bud that fell out of your ear while jogging 5 miles away from home but can locate one within a house or the close vicinity. Owners welcomed the $3.99 app, which solved one of the biggest problems associated with Apple’s tiny devices: the fact they’re easy to lose. But just a few days after release, Apple pulled Finder for AirPods from the store. One of the developers from app maker Deucks took to Reddit to explain the Cupertino firm’s decision. Yeah, just got off the phone with them. They didn't find anything wrong with the app itself, but rather they didn't like the 'concept' of people finding their AirPods and hence was deemed "not appropriate for the App Store." When another Redditor asked for proof of this conversation, the developer added: “The proof being, they called me to say that the App Review board doesn't like the concept of the app and deemed it not appropriate for the App Store. They have their own reasons why, but probably won’t release it to the public.” While those who have already bought the app will find it still works, there won’t be any future updates. Deucks recommends those looking to get their money back head over to the iTunes/App Store refund site. The situation is a strange one, especially as the developer still has other similar Finder apps for other products (Jawbone, Fitbit) on the store.

The iPhone 8, which is already expected to feature a “glass sandwich” design, will apparently have a stainless steel chassis. Don't Miss: All the reasons people are ditching Android and switching to iPhones Apple’s iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s were the last iPhones to have a glass and steel design. Since then, Apple has used an aluminum unibody design for the iPhone, with glass being found only on the front of the phone. With the iPhone 8, Apple is tipped to bring wireless charging to the iPhone, a feature that requires the use of glass on the back of that handset so that radio waves can pass through. According to Digitimes, Apple has placed orders for stainless steel iPhone parts with Jabil, bypassing its usual supplier Foxconn. Jabil and Foxconn both made stainless steel chassis for Apple’s iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s. The report notes that the iPhone 8 chassis will be made of forged stainless steel. Forging stainless steel, Apple Insider explains, is a process that involves squeezing a metal alloy between two halves of a mold to form a finished part. The resulting component has a better structural rigidity than other manufacturing processes. The stainless steel used in the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s was CNC-machined. Sources also told Digitimes that forging stainless steel is 30% to 50% cheaper than the current unibody CNC machine process, and quality control is more reliable. The method should also reduce manufacturing time. It’s unclear at this time what kind of glass Apple will use for the front and back of the iPhone 8 — in fact, the glass sandwich design and the use of stainless steel are yet to be confirmed. But considering Apple’s way of building iPhones, it’s likely the company is looking to both offer novel features — such as wireless charging — and also to ensure the structural integrity of the handset. Nobody wants anymore Bendgate issues with the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be planning three new iPhones this year, including the radically redesigned iPhone 8, as well as iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus successors. It’s unclear whether the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will also be made of glass and steel, or if they’ll stick to aluminum unibodies. Whatever the case, it’s likely that Apple will explain in detail how it built its 2017 iPhones in future videos, complete with Jony Ive voiceovers.

Samsung's long-awaited release of an iOS app for its Gear S watches was finally released this weekend. I took the Gear S3 Frontier and Apple Watch Series 2 for a run in the freezing cold weather to see if one stood out from the other. By Matthew Miller for The Mobile Gadgeteer | January 9, 2017 -- 13:21 GMT (05:21 PST) | Topic: Mobility There has not been a single aspect of my experience running with the Gear S3 connected to my iPhone that's satisfied me in any way. As a runner and a mobile device fan, you will always find at least one wearable on my wrist to track the details of each and every run. While the Garmin Fenix 3 HR provides the most comprehensive data experience, I am also a fan of smartwatches that help me triage email, communicate with people, and aid in my quest for a healthy lifestyle. The original Apple Watch was my favorite Apple device, and the Apple Watch Series 2 offers an even better experience for runners. I'm training for my first full marathon, and the Apple Watch is my prime candidate to help me achieve my goals. Apple Watch CNET Review: A beautiful, bold watch, with complications Apple sets high bar for smartwatches on first attempt Hidden port for Apple Watch can be used to charge it, perhaps more 7 tips and tricks to get the most out of your new Apple Watch A couple months ago, I purchased the fantastic Samsung Gear S3 Frontier, with the idea it would serve as my primary GPS sports watch due to the more open nature of S Health and integrated LTE that would allow me to call for help in an emergency. I previously tested a leaked beta of the iOS Samsung Gear S application but couldn't wait to finally see the official release of Samsung Gear S for the Gear S2, Gear S3, and Gear Fit2 devices. I installed the new iOS app, connected my Gear S3 Frontier, attempted to load up some music, and took it and the Apple Watch Series 2 for a short run on the icy sidewalks of Puyallup, Wash. ZDNet's Jason Cipriani is working on a full walkthrough of using an iPhone with the Samsung Gear S application, so stay tuned for all of those details. I am particularly concerned about the ability to use the Gear S3 Frontier with an iPhone for GPS run tracking and motivation, so let's take a closer look at just that experience. Setting up the Gear S3 Frontier and iPhone If you have an iPhone and a Gear S2, S3, or Gear Fit2, then you can download and install the new Samsung Gear S app from the App Store. Connections are acknowledged on the iPhone and Gear S3. You have to pair up twice to the iPhone if you want to use your Gear S3 to initiate calls through your iPhone. There is no S Health app for iOS. Similar to how Samsung Pay is integrated into the Gear app on Android, the S Health app is integrated into the Samsung Gear S app on iOS. That is where things go wrong every single time for me, as I will describe in the next section. Once you are paired up, then the Gear S3 is ready to go, so get outside and get ready to run. If you want to attempt to load music, then you are supposed to be able to do so through your computer and a Wi-Fi connection to the Gear S3. I could not get it to move a single song to the Gear S3 so gave up on that after 15 minutes of frustration. Running with the Gear S3 Given that the Gear S3 runs Tizen, the app gap is a real issue on the smartwatch. You won't find RunKeeper, Strava, or other popular run tracking apps on the platform. Thankfully, Samsung has opened up S Health to work with connected services like RunKeeper, Strava, Misfit, Jawbone, and Fitbit. Sadly, this is not available for iOS users. Thus, you are limited to using the S Health app for run tracking, so open up the exercise module, choose running as your activity, and get going. The Gear S3 Frontier is a solid GPS sports watch with the ability to simply spin the bezel around to switch between status screens and see all of your captured data as you run. This beats the Apple Watch touchscreen or crown twist experience and is one reason I was excited about the possibility of using the Gear S3 with an iPhone. After the run was complete, I chose to finish and save it on the Gear S3. I then tapped on the Open S Health option on the main display of the Samsung Gear S app and was taken to the embedded S Health app experience. I saw my run down in one of the activity boxes and tapped the running box. I then saw my total mileage and elapsed time with a plot of the time on a day chart. I was getting quite excited about the entire experience, and then I tapped on the line containing my run to dive into all of the wonderful details of splits, elevation, heart rate, and more. Tapping on this line quit the Gear S app. I launched it all again, then tapped the run again (this is the same thing you do on Android), and the app quit again. So, that's it. You cannot see any details of your captured run data in S Health on the iPhone. It also turns out that captured data is not syncing up to the S Health servers, so even when I open up S Health on an Android device, that run captured from the Gear S3 and synced to the iPhone does not show up. Something serious here is broken, and without the ability to see any of my run details, the Gear S3 is a failure when connected to iOS. Running with the Apple Watch Series 2 The new Apple Watch also has an integrated GPS receiver, and so I had it mounted on my other wrist. The default option is to use the Apple Workout app to capture run data, and that option actually gives you the best experience for viewing your data on the run with customizable displays. In typical fashion though, data captured with Workout is also kept within the Apple ecosystem, so you cannot export to other services. Thankfully, RunKeeper now has an Apple Watch app that works with GPS and the heart-rate monitor. I fired up RunKeeper (the data viewing experience is limited while you run) and captured all of that data during my run. You won't see elevation data or other advanced data like you would with a GPS sports watch, but there is enough there for the typical runner. That data then syncs up to the RunKeeper servers after the run and also syncs through to the Apple Health application. Which one is best? Normally when I pick a "best" smartphone in a list, I discuss several caveats about it being my personal choice based on subjective factors. When it comes to the current implementation of the Gear S3 with the iPhone, it is clear to me that one wearable stands out from the other, based on the facts. Neither the Gear S3 Frontier or Apple Watch Series 2 offers enough for those who want to track and improve upon minute details of their performance (vertical ratio, ground contact time, etc) or want to use these devices for serious multi-sport tracking. These smartwatches are definitely smartphone companions first and fitness-tracking devices second. Neither can beat a GPS sports watch from Garmin, Polar, Suunto, TomTom, or others. However, they can provide what the majority of casual athletes need in a GPS sports watch. The challenge is working with a phone that they were not primarily designed to work with. Apple iPhone owners should stick with the Apple Watch for running, while Android smartphone users should consider the Samsung Gear S3. The Gear S3 experience is extremely limited on the iPhone, and right now, S Health is broken. There has not been a single aspect of my experience running with the Gear S3 connected to my iPhone that's satisfied me in any way. There is the potential for the experience to improve, but Samsung is going to have to do a lot of work to get there. The Gear S3 experience on Android is awesome for running, with the ability to sync to multiple services and play loaded music (or even stream Spotify music), as well as the functionality to call for help if something bad happens on your run.

CUPERTINO, CA - OCTOBER 27: Apple CEO Tim Cook smiles during a product launch event on October 27, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Apple Inc. unveiled the latest iterations of its MacBook Pro line of laptops and TV app. (Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images) (Photo : Stephen Lam/ Getty Images) Later this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook is said to enter talks with the Indian government on the possibility of opening a local manufacturing plant in the country. Reports circulating that it is Apple's Taiwanese Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Wistron that will be the one to build the manufacturing plant in Bengaluru and produce for Apple in India. The initial reason for the plant is just to do assembly inside India's tariff barriers since Apple is currently carriying a 12.5 percent of import tax levied on each iPhone sold in the country. The company only holds a meager two percent share in the Indian smartphone market, and one of the prime reasons for this figure is the iPhone's expensive price due to a high import tax, Forbes reported. Building the plant inside India would cut off the 12.5 percent tariff, as components from which to assemble electronics enter India tariff free. While it is true that India has cheaper labor than China, analysts believe that there will also be lower labor productivity as the two will always go together.  If Apple press on its plan, analysts could still not assert whether the absence of the tariff will cover the productivity differential. Cook, however, believed that India is an important growth market in the company, even it lacks robust source of raw material locally compared to China. Sources added that India could sell to the company solder, capacitors, wires, which all of these the country can produce, however, having a foreign manufacturer buying locally is not the main value here but driving up the standards of that local production to meet international standard is the big catch for India's market. It is worth noting that, after relaxing its regulations that required foreign tech companies to locally source at least 30 percent of products sold in retail stores, the Indian Government is determined that it would not give in to any more demands by Apple, or any other tech company that intends to sell its products in physical brand stores in India, Phone Arena reported. If plans pushed through with Apple opening a manufacturing plant in India, it will be able to open direct retail stores in the country where it has very limited market share.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is reportedly working with Carl Zeiss AG, a company known for developing optics for everything from rifle sights to cameras, on an augmented reality headset. According to Robert Scoble, Apple hopes to launch the device sometime later this year. Scoble made the comment on a Facebook post, citing a Zeiss employee. “A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year,” Scoble said. “I thought it was next year but now that I saw this I believe it will happen this year.” Scoble suggested that he questioned why Zeiss wasn’t showing off AR during this year’s CES show, commenting that perhaps “Tim Cook didn’t let you.” Scoble said Zeiss employees “smiled nervously” at the statement. How will Apple’s augmented reality glasses work? Unfortunately, Scoble’s report doesn’t give us a whole lot of meat to work with. Tim Cook has already suggested that Apple’s more interested in augmented reality instead of virtual reality, but we haven’t heard what sort of direction Apple wants to take. Will it attempt to create some sort of HoloLens product, meant to be used in a home or office, or instead adopt a Google Glass “wear it everywhere” approach? I’ve argued that Apple seems to be a sitting duck, letting competitors such as Microsoft move forward with innovation. Perhaps Apple does indeed have something fun up its sleeves after all.

Name* Email* Your name* Your email* Comments Submit Few people realized it at the time, but the world shifted fundamentally a decade ago when Steve Jobs pulled the first iPhone from Apple's bag of technological tricks. (Provided) "Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything," Jobs declared as he paced across a San Francisco stage. It obviously wasn't an empty boast. We all know now that Jobs' "magical product" has reshaped culture, shaken up industries, put computers in billions of pockets and made it possible to do just about anything with a few taps on a screen. Besides its then 3.5-inch touch screen, the first iPhone featured a browser for on-the-go web surfing and built-in apps to check email and get directions. Going mobile Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since its debut, spawning millions of mobile applications and prodding other technology companies to make similar smartphones that have become like phantom limbs for many of us. We use iPhones and their copycats to instantly share video and pictures with friends and family from almost anywhere. We use them to figure out where we are going. We use them to find the best deals while shopping in stores and to pay for stuff at the checkout stand. We use the phones to a hail ride, to tune instruments, to monitor our health and help find our next jobs. Phones have gotten so smart that they even talk back to us via helpful digital concierges such as the iPhone's Siri and the recently introduced Assistant on Google's Pixel phone. "IPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live," Apple's current CEO, Tim Cook, boasted in a retrospective that the Cupertino, California, company posted on its website. Roadkill in its wake The iPhone's revolutionary touch screen doomed the BlackBerry, another once-popular internet-connected phone. Mobile phones and their tablet cousins triggered a downturn in personal computer sales that is still unfolding. An estimated 219 million desktop and laptop computers shipped worldwide last year, down from 264 million in 2007, according to the research firm Gartner Inc. Meanwhile, nearly 1.9 billion mobile phones shipped last year, up from 1.15 billion in 2007. All told, Gartner estimates about 5 billion mobile phones are currently in use around the world compared to 1.3 billion PCs. The eroding popularity of PCs spurred shake-ups at powerful tech companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, none of which adapted nimbly to the mobile world unleashed by the iPhone. Then-Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer scoffed at Apple's glass-and-metal gadget, telling USA Today in April 2007 that "there's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance." Microsoft wound up squandering the US$7.6 billion that it spent to buy phone maker Nokia in a futile attempt to catch up to the iPhone. Ballmer stepped down as CEO three years ago and was replaced by Satya Nadella, who introduced versions of Microsoft's popular Office programs that worked on Apple's iPad – a tablet based on the iPhone. A huge hit … then a stall The iPhone's success helped make Jobs a revered figure for many, and one whose October 2011 death was mourned around the world. The device has established Apple as the world's most profitable company with earnings of $45.7 billion on sales of $216 billion during its latest fiscal year. (Prior to the iPhone's release, Apple posted an annual profit of $2 billion on sales of $19.3 billion.) Its stock-market value is hovering around $635 billion, thanks to a split-adjusted stock price that's risen by nearly a factor of 10 since the iPhone's debut. (All figures in U.S. dollars) Lately, though, the iPhone appears to be losing some steam. People are keeping older models for longer before upgrading or switching over to competing phones that run on Google's Android software. Apple suffered its first-ever decline in iPhone sales in its last fiscal year, causing the company to miss its revenue projections and hitting Cook with a 15 per cent pay cut . Most smartphones now run on Android, partly because Google gives away the software. That has helped iPhone rivals woo price conscious consumers, especially outside the U.S., with phones that are much cheaper than the iPhone. In his statement, though, Cook promised the iPhone is "just getting started. The best is yet to come." Organizations: Apple, Google, Microsoft Gartner Inc.

Yesterday (January 9) the Cupertino giant celebrated the smartphone’s 10th birthday. It proved to be a revolutionary device changing the way smartphones were to be designed and operated. No physical keyboard, bigger screen and it pushed to be a true personal computer in pockets. Highest selling iPhone  To date the iPhone 4s is the highest selling smartphone in Apple’s history shipping 29.19 million units and raking in over ten billion pounds in its lifespan. The sizeable iPhone 6 is currently in second shipping 23.09 million units. In an Apple press conference in 2010 Steve Jobs said bigger phones would not sell well. “No one’s going to buy that, you can’t get your hand around it,” he said. The iPhone 6 is still available to buy with the potential to surpass the 4s.  The lowest selling iPhone of all time is the first generation iPhone with 790,000 units shipped, generating almost two billion in revenue.     “No chance” The iPhone had plenty of critics after its announcement in 2007. In an interview with USA Today, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said: “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. “No chance. It’s a $500 subsidised item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I’d prefer to have our software in 60 percent or 70 percent or 80 percent of them, than I would to have 2 percent or 3 percent, which is what Apple might get.” Fast forward to 2016 Apple passes the one billion sales milestone and secured 12.5 per cent market share against its competition in Q3. All Android vendors totalled 86.8 per cent while Microsoft saw quarter-on-quarter decline of 32.5 per cent to 0.3 per cent. Former Nokia chief strategist Anssi Vanjoki believed Apple would continue catering to a niche market. “The development of mobile phones will be similar in PCs. Even with the Mac, Apple has attracted much attention at first, but they have still remained a niche manufacturer. That will be in mobile phones as well.” Nokia quit manufacturing smartphones in 2014 selling its handset assets to Microsoft. The manufacturer is planning to re-enter the smartphone market this year. In comparison Apple secured 6.5 per cent market share, shipping over two million iPhones in Q4 of 2007. Research in Motion (RIM) had 11.4 per cent and Nokia were market leaders with 52.9 per cent. Decline After nine years Apple saw its first iPhone sales decline in February 2016. In Q4 2015 Apple sold 71 million units (17.7 per cent market share) – a decline from the 74 million devices (20.4 per cent) it sold in Q4 the previous year. The manufacturer came behind Samsung in the rankings, who came first and sold over 83 million units (20.7 per cent) in Q4 2015 – an increase from the 73 million units (19.9 per cent) shipped in Q4 2014. “Best is yet to come” Apple CEO Tim Cook said: “iPhone is an essential part of our customers’ lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live. “iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come.” TAGS 10th anniversary Apple Steve Jobs Tim Cook birthday iPhone SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleThree's MakeTheAirFair campaign hits 100,000 signatures Next articleCable.co.uk: 'UK households paying too much for broadband' Manny Pham RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Job fears at O2 as 160 employees face redundancy GEAR4 launches D30 case range for iPads EE first operator to have all call centre staff based in UK NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Business Development Manager: Garry Wybourn – 0203 122 0872 / 07747 632 553 POPULAR POSTS Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

It won't be easy. A prototype drone at a Qualcomm lab in San Diego [Photo: Sean Captain] More from The Sensor Revolution The Everything Chip: Qualcomm's Plan To Power Drones, VR, Cars, PCs, And More The iPhone 7 Plus Is Easily Outselling Smaller iPhone 7, New Holiday Data Suggests Sean Captain 01.10.17 9:00 AM Remember "Intel Inside"? The ad campaign transformed a maker of components for beige boxes into a top consumer brand two decades ago. San Diego's biggest tech employer, smartphone chip provider Qualcomm, is still a long way from matching Intel's feat, both in name recognition and in revenue. But the company dreams of going much farther by being inside seemingly everything: smart cars, high-end fitness bands, VR headsets, smartwatches, AI systems, consumer and commercial drones, and internet-serving satellites. Qualcomm even thinks it can kick Intel out of PCs and server farms. It's shelling out tens of billions of dollars to achieve its heady ambitions. You might expect a flamboyant, aggressive CEO to be driving Qualcomm's ballsy charge for world domination. That doesn't describe my impression of the man sitting across from me in a spare conference room in early December, wearing jeans and a gray University of Michigan fleece (honoring the school where he got his masters degree in electrical engineering). Forty-seven years old, with bushy gray hair and smart looking, dark-rimmed glasses, Steve Mollenkopf has the quiet voice and cool demeanor of the engineer he is. Over 22 years, Mollenkopf worked his way up the ranks at Qualcomm and took over as CEO in March 2014. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf It wasn't an easy start. Qualcomm's hot new smartphone processor, the Snapdragon 810, was a bit too hot, according to some reports that it overheated in phones such as the LG G Flex2 and HTC One M9. (Qualcomm insists the chip performs fine.) The Chinese government was pushing an antitrust case over what it considered Qualcomm's excessive licensing fees for 3G and 4G cellular tech; and a big shareholder, hedge fund Jana Partners, was pushing to split the company in two—between its chip design and patent royalty divisions. And Taiwan's MediaTek, though smaller than Qualcomm, is rising to challenge it in the smartphone chip market. "I feel like this management team has been through a tremendous amount of major issues in a short period of time, probably faster than anyone I can think of," Mollenkopf says, calmly. He's leaning back in his chair with hands clasped around his knee. "We decided ultimately to do the biggest restructuring in the company's history. Then at the same time, we also repositioned the company and really changed the narrative of the company." That narrative, in essence: Powerful processors and wireless connections are going to be in tens, perhaps even hundreds of billions of new devices, and Qualcomm wants to provide chips for as many of them as possible. That requires remaking the company and starting, sometimes from scratch, in businesses already dominated by rivals. It wouldn't be the first time for Qualcomm to charge into industries it seems to have no business being in. Qualcomm has bought over $50 billion worth of companies since Mollenkopf became CEO. Instead of splitting, Qualcomm is swelling, buying over $50 billion worth of companies since Mollenkopf became CEO, including a pending $47 billion deal for Dutch chipmaker NXP. The tie-up will likely more than double Qualcomm's staff (even after some layoffs that Mollenkopf says will come) and extend its reach to cars, medical devices, home automation, wireless payments, and unsexy-but-important machines like point-of-sale terminals at store checkouts. In China, Qualcomm got back in business by paying a $975 million settlement and adjusting licensing fees. (However, a South Korean investigation recently charged anticompetitive practices that may result in an $865 million fine.) But even as Qualcomm takes on new challenges, Mollenkopf has been jettisoning projects that weren't clearly connected to its core chipmaking business, such as augmented-reality software platform Vuforia, which it sold in 2015. (A mural celebrating Vuforia still covered the side of a Qualcomm warehouse when I visited.) Altogether, the company has cut $1.4 billion in annual expenses, along with about 1,700 jobs. Smartphones And Beyond With the great big exception of Apple (which designs its own chips for iOS devices), Qualcomm dominates the high-end phone universe. Its top Snapdragon chips power flagship Android smartphones like the new Google Pixel, the HTC 10, Moto Z, and even many of Samsung's Galaxy S7 line, as well as the exploding Note 7. (Samsung uses both Qualcomm's and its own Exynos chips). Qualcomm also makes a fortune—likely about two thirds of its profits—from other people's chips through licensing fees on the cellular technologies it has developed. These include the CDMA wireless standard that powered 2G and 3G Verizon and Sprint phones for two decades, much of the 4G technology in phones around the world today, and—Qualcomm hopes—technologies that will get incorporated into the insanely fast 5G standard coming on line in the next four years. Like Apple, Qualcomm designs chips and hires other companies, such as Samsung, to make them. Intel and Samsung have to worry about reconfiguring their factories and having enough demand to keep them busy before they can introduce new chips. Qualcomm and Apple just pick whatever factory provides the best deal. "We don’t care exactly how full Samsung's fab is. We let them worry about it," says Keith Kressin, Qualcomm's senior VP for product management. Jumping between manufacturers has allowed Qualcomm to shrink its chips four years in a row. The upcoming Snapdragon 835 is 35% smaller and uses 25% less power than last year's top chips, the 820 and 821. (In buying NXP, however, Qualcomm will now own some chip factories.) Dominating one industry is no guarantee for the future. Intel owns the PC (and Mac) and server businesses, but its smartphone and tablet plans flopped. "I think Intel's sin was that they didn't listen to what Apple wanted," says Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett. "They said, 'Here's what we have. Want some?'" Intel tried to wedge its processors, based on its design technology called x86, into mobile devices. But the mobile industry was using a chip type created by a British company called ARM. In the mobile market, everyone but Intel, including Qualcomm, builds ARM-based chips—the platform for iOS, Android, and the floundering mobile version of Windows. The phone business is still growing, especially in developing countries, but more slowly than it had been—in single-digit vs. double-digit percentages each year, according to market research firm Gartner. Qualcomm and other chip companies hope that gangbuster growth reminiscent of the go-go smartphone years will come for all those newly connected machines—clumped into a catch-all category called IoT, the internet of things. Mollenkopf believes that Qualcomm's smartphone chips will be perfect for all these new devices and even for the "cloud" of server farms that hold the IoT together. In every new category, it faces competition: Intel, for instance, is challenging Qualcomm on just about every front, such as drones, virtual reality, cars, and 5G wireless. And Qualcomm is way behind other companies on some fronts, like Nvidia for smart and autonomous cars. Not The Same Kind Of Sea Change As it tackles all these new markets, Qualcomm has to avoid the peril Intel met with phones: failing to convince customers that what it's selling, Snapdragon, is perfect for whatever they are looking to buy. But Mollenkopf dismisses the Intel parable: "Almost every other transition that people talk about—PC-to-smartphone, for example—it was a big technology change. What you had to be good at changed dramatically." Mollenkopf claims that's not the case today: The trend toward ever-smaller and more energy-efficient chips that phones engendered dovetails into the needs for other connected gadgets. "It's all really being disrupted by communication and low-power computing and the synthesis of many different technologies together," he says. A big part of this trend is the SoC—system on chip. A phone's CPU, graphics, modem, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other components, now including artificial-intelligence engines, are squeezed into a single chip to save space, money, and power, while boosting speeds (with shorter distances for electrons to travel). Those are benefits for any device. "You can use the [technology] roadmap from cellular to really help out automotive and internet of things," says Mollenkopf. Qualcomm's rivals also build SoCs. Prototype drones packing Snapdragon processors In San Diego, I visit a lab full of consumer drone prototypes. About a half dozen 3D-printed models sit on a workbench; a few steps away, engineers test image-stabilizing algorithms for drone-mounted cameras. The drones run on the Snapdragon 801 SoC, Qualcomm's top smartphone chip from 2014. Qualcomm has to build working models of drones, headsets, and other products to figure out elements like software needed to make its phone chips work in them, says Raj Talluri, who runs Qualcomm's IoT division. Only then can it pitch the chips to companies making the devices. The $599 Hover Camera Passport drone, from Chinese company Zero Zero Robotics, is in a growing category of selfie drones that can hover steadily in front of people, able to recognize and lock onto faces to take photos, and even follow people as they move about. Most drones don't run on Snapdragon, yet they can be quite sophisticated. The Phantom 4 and Mavic Pro drones from Chinese drone maker DJI use the Myriad 2 machine-vision chip from a startup called Movidius (now owned by Intel) to rapidly recognize people it's following or to map a safe flight path over rough terrain. Qualcomm is making some progress: Tencent, Zerotech, Pegatron, Nine Eagles, and Sunly have announced plans to build drones on the Snapdragon Flight chips-and-software platform. Those aren't household names, but the business is wide open. "There aren’t any dominant chipmakers in the drone market, as it’s still very fragmented," says Gartner analyst Mark Hung. Part of Qualcomm's pitch is that the same Snapdragon capabilities can serve many types of products. The Snapdragon VR820, Qualcomm's prototype VR headset, is powered by a built-in 820 chip. That makes it self-contained, in contrast to headsets that rely on a tethered computer, like Facebook's Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, and those that make you snap in a smartphone, including the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View. Qualcomm's prototype VR headset With a camera on the front of the VR820 headset, the same image recognition that a drone uses to spot and avoid obstacles can also reference nearby objects to figure out where someone wearing the headset is and how far they move. The technology can also recognize and transpose real-world hand movements into the virtual world. Trying it out, I could not only look up and down or side to side; I could also step toward or away from 3D characters, which appear closer or farther as I move, and look above or underneath them. Most other VR systems require external devices like infrared beacons around the room in order to track the wearer, and they require holding controllers to read hand movement. As with drones, Qualcomm wants others to make their own headsets based on the VR820 design. Chinese companies Coocaa, Focalmax, Pico, and Whaley have announced plans to build VR820 headsets, all for the Chinese market. Once again, Intel is right there. In August 2016, it showed off a very similar headset design called Project Alloy, including the same type of movement tracking. But Intel is a bit behind: It won't have the developer kits until the spring, and no one has committed to using the tech in consumer products. No matter how good the technology, both chipmakers will have a challenge breaking into an already crowded market. Intel's Project Alloy headset Qualcomm is jumping into a market that's in its infancy even compared to VR: mixed-reality glasses that superimpose a screen over the wearer's view of the world. San Francisco-based Osterhout Design Group will put the new Snapdragon 835 in its R-8 and R-9 "smartglasses." They promise to actually do what people expected of Google Glass—blend the real and online worlds together in one view. Mollenkopf doesn't get overly exuberant about drones, VR, and other "high-complexity, smartphone-like" consumer gadgets, as he calls them. These are, "things that people believe generally will happen," he says. "They don't know when. They are interested in them. They're wondering whether it's going to be the new smartphone or the new iPod or whatever." ODG's smartglasses incorporate Snapdragon processors. In more mature markets as well as emerging ones, Qualcomm is betting that ever more connected gadgets will require ever-more powerful processors. Take fitness trackers: The iconic Fitbits run on fairly low-end chips, called microcontrollers, typically made by STMicroelectronics. Qualcomm is an investor in Fitbit, though, and many other companies that it's banking will require more powerful chips. "We invest in companies that could be future partners or customers of Qualcomm. They don't have to use our silicon today," says Patrick Eggen, who manages the company's investment arm, Qualcomm Ventures, in the North America. It's invested hundreds of millions of dollars (the company doesn't reveal specific numbers) in startups pushing technologies that Qualcomm wants to get into, including drones, virtual reality, augmented reality, medical devices, and even satellites. Fitness trackers are getting more complex and resembling smartwatches, which have cellphone-like capabilities. (Polar's new fitness tracker, the M600, runs Google's Android Wear smartphone OS, though not on a Snapdragon chip.) "What started out as a simple job of tracking your steps…the expectation is increasing," says Talluri, mentioning features like touch screens. Qualcomm does provide Snapdragons to about a dozen smartwatches, including from Asus, Fossil, Huawei, LG, Michael Kors, and Samsung. All other brands are tiny compared to Apple's share of the market, though, and even the Apple Watch isn't an iPhone-like phenom. "We got strong feedback five years ago to not try this," admits Grob. Maybe Qualcomm's steepest uphill battle is for PCs—hardly machines of the future, but still a giant business. In December, Microsoft and Qualcomm announced a version of Windows that will work on the ARM-based chips that Qualcomm makes, and will be able to run all current Windows applications. (Microsoft's earlier attempt to put Windows on the ARM chips in some of its Surface tablets flopped because it couldn't run older apps.) "If you're [a company] that makes a high-end smartphone, then you have the process and technology to manufacture a thin laptop," says Matt Grob, Qualcomm's CTO. Like Mollenkopf, Grob is a longtime Qualcomm engineer, with 25 years at the company and 59 patents. Stocky, with dark hair, he's very soft-spoken, sometimes nearly whispering. "You can think of it like a smartphone with a laptop-size battery… so the battery life will be tremendous," he says. No one has announced plans to build Qualcomm PCs, but Grob says to expect ultra-thin, low-cost laptops by the end of 2017. Qualcomm is making the same kind of pitch for the server business—that its chips are smaller, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than Intel's. On the surface, Qualcomm's dream to push its incompatible chips into servers looks as fraught as Intel's attempt to get its incompatible chips into phones. "We got strong feedback five years ago to not try this," admits Grob. But a lot has changed, argues Gartner's Mark Hung. Internet giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are custom-building hardware and software for their server farms, and they might be up for trying new technologies, he says. Driving Ambitions Starting from the smallest consumer gadgets, Qualcomm now wants to increase its stake in the biggest: cars. Modern cars are packed with sensors and processors, and NXP makes scores of them: antilock brake controllers, tire pressure sensors, temperature sensors, accelerometers, radio tuners, Ethernet switches, keyless entry systems, and a lot more. Chipmaker CSR, which Qualcomm picked up in 2015 for $2.4 billion, also makes automotive components like Bluetooth and GPS chips. They provide the foundation that Qualcomm can top off with a Snapdragon chip. "We're good at all the non-car pieces that are going into the car and really changing how the car is architected, but we're not good at the car pieces," says Mollenkopf. Already, Qualcomm has sold over 340 million chips to over 20 carmakers, things like modems and other wireless components. It's still getting up to speed with smart cars, which started with "infotainment" systems. They power both navigation and entertainment features like streaming audio apps and Bluetooth connections to cellphones—platforms like Ford Sync, Apple Car Play, and Android Auto. Now smart cars are evolving into autonomous cars. Nvidia, which crashed and burned trying to get into cellphones, has been a lot smarter with cars. Its Tegra chips—which, like Qualcomm's Snapdragons, incorporate ARM technology—power the infotainment systems in cars from Audi, BMW, and Honda. Its autonomous car "supercomputer," the Drive PX 2, was picked by Tesla, which will use it to control its self-driving cars in the future. At this year's CES, Nvidia announced deals to put Drive PX 2 in Audi cars starting in 2020 and to co-develop an AI-powered car with Mercedes-Benz. As almost always, Intel is competing with Qualcomm here. Its Atom processors, which flopped in smartphones, are getting a second chance in car infotainment, already installed in 30 models. Intel also just announced its own autonomous car project, using both Atom and more powerful chips, called Intel GO. BMW is partnering with Intel on developing self-driving car tech, and the automaker strongly hinted that Intel GO will make its way into its iNEXT project for an electric, semi-autonomous car set to hit the road in 2021. In San Diego, I saw some concept cars Qualcomm was getting ready to show off at CES in early January. The star would be a Maserati Quattroporte gutted and rebuilt with Qualcomm chips packed inside. Qualcomm's infotainment chip, the 820A, powers features like safety cameras, GPS, and voice commands. Bluetooth chips embedded throughout the car don't just connect riders' cellphones; together with microphones, they track who is in the car, and where. (Only the person in the driver's seat has full control through voice commands.) The gutted interior of a Maserati being reconfigured as a tech show car. Qualcomm doesn't have a deal with Maserati; it just bought a car and tricked it out, including reverse-engineering Maserati's engine computer system—showing what it could do for companies if it can convince them to pair up. (It did similar with a Cadillac.) That is starting to happen. Audi's 2017 cars will run on Snapdragons, and at CES, Qualcomm announced a similar deal for Volkswagens starting in 2019. Automotive is another example of the hopeful, long-game approach. So far, Qualcomm barely registers in the autonomous-car market, but Qualcomm Ventures has been investing in companies that it hopes will build that market. One of them is Cruise, a San Francisco startup that makes sensors for autonomous cars. GM bought Cruise for about $1 billion in 2016 and is using the tech on the Chevy Bolt autonomous cars it's testing on the streets of San Francisco. Qualcomm is starting a research program in Germany that could develop technologies for autonomous cars, but it's far from having a platform as Intel and Nvidia do. Qualcomm has been building the artificial intelligence it will need for self-driving cars, drones, and other futuristic machines. In 2016, it added to its Snapdragon 820 smartphone chip a neural network capability called Zeroth, a name inspired by Isaac Asimov's robot laws. After the science-fiction legend created his first, second, and third laws about how robots should behave, he added a new law, called the Zeroth, to precede them all—that a robot may not harm humanity. "We found that no one had trademarked it or even knew what it was. It was perfect!" says Grob. Qualcomm later decided the term was a bit esoteric, though, and it settled on the sedate "Qualcomm Machine Learning Platform." The Sky Might Not Be The Limit Wireless is where Qualcomm made its fortune. And no matter which new tech categories matter most in the future, it will remain mission-critical for Qualcomm. The company got lucky with its first invention, called code division multiple access—CDMA. The technology allows cellphone towers to transmit multiple calls at once by assigning each call its own encryption code. The phones on the other end decrypt only the data packets meant for their call. CDMA challenged the prevailing technology, called GSM, which instead divided calls by assigning bits of each one into tiny time slots. Most of the world stayed with GSM, in part because it was a free, open standard. Qualcomm owned CDMA technology and charged licensing fees. But Sprint, Verizon, and a smattering of other companies around the world opted for CDMA, and Qualcomm got rich on the fees. An early prototype CDMA phone Qualcomm then bought up rights to a technology called OFDM that formed the basis of 4G wireless (and will for 5G, too), and the world paid Qualcomm licensing fees. LTE has come very far since it was introduced with a maximum speed of about 12Mbps back in 2010. As speeds grew, so did the name; the latest version, called LTE Advanced Pro, will have a top speed just shy of a gigabit per second and be in Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 and its platform for smart cars. Many of the tricks that went into that speed explosion, like combining five or more signals to carry more data, will be the foundation of 5G. "It's still based on OFDM. Patent-wise, Qualcomm…is still a significant player," says Akshay Sharma, who tracks wireless tech for Gartner. OneWeb can potentially bring Qualcomm billions of new customers. 5G's final form will come from collaborations between many companies in an international standards body (called 3GPP). But Qualcomm is trying to assure a big role through facts on the ground. In October, it came out with the first 5G chip, the X50 modem, even though the standard won’t be fully baked till likely some time in 2018. The X50 is designed for trials, so gadget makers and networks can get a sense of which technology ideas work and which ones don't. In the process, they will get used to Qualcomm's 5G technologies—maybe improving the chances that its royalty-earning technologies make it into the 5G standard. Guess who's right behind? Intel, which launched its own chip, simply called "5G Modem," at CES, saying it will be ready for tests in late 2017. Qualcomm's plans go above the atmosphere to OneWeb, a project to blanket the Earth with internet access using a fleet of 648 small, mass-produced satellites. Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm's chairman and Mollenkopf's predecessor as CEO, serves on the OneWeb board along with Richard Branson and tech captains like Airbus CEO Thomas Enders and SoftBank chairman Ronald Fisher. "It's one of our bigger projects," says Grob. Qualcomm's cellular modems will be in the solar-powered ground stations that connect to the satellites and link in devices on the ground through Wi-Fi and small cellular networks. Qualcomm also designed the antenna systems throughout, from base stations to satellites, and its modems will likely be in the second-generation of spacecraft, says OneWeb. The satellites, expected to launch beginning in 2018, will also provide internet connections to planes, cars, and ships. Altogether, OneWeb could potentially bring Qualcomm billions of new customers. A Dash Of Hubris However all its plans turn out, Qualcomm has already succeeded at one thing: being really ambitious. Some schemes, such as getting into mobile gear like VR headsets, seem like a natural expansion from phones. Others, like tangling with Intel on PCs and servers, seem almost cheeky. But being cheeky has served Qualcomm well in the past. In 1993, the company, which at the time made satellite-connected text-messaging machines for truckers, crashed the cellphone party. A novice in the burgeoning field, it had the hubris to say that its new technology, incompatible with everyone else's, was better and that people should pay extra to license it. Enough companies did. Now Qualcomm is a giant in 4G, and its prospects for 5G are strong. Qualcomm's first product, a satellite-based communications system for truckers In 2007, when Snapdragon debuted, Qualcomm was a nobody in the phone processor business. "I can remember sitting back in the mid-2000s timeframe and people said, "Yeah, you're good at the modem but you'll never, ever have a position in the smartphone,' because smartphones are all about—just name your technology—it's about CPU, it's about GPU, it's multimedia," says Mollenkopf. "We're number one in all those things today." Being daring also means making mistakes. One of them was Mirasol, an almost-impossible-to-explain display technology that promised LCD-like color image quality with E Ink-like power savings. (Pixels reflect ambient light and use power only when the image changes, instead of constantly refreshing, as LCDs, OLEDs, and other displays do.) Despite the promise, Mirasol never made it. The late, lamented Toq watch Qualcomm tried to keep Mirasol alive by using it in its own smartwatch brand, called Toq. Introduced in 2013, Toq never caught on, either. "It was so cool we maybe made a mistake and decided to sell it commercially, and it was not a good idea," says Jim Merrick, the director of marketing. "We don't make commercial products." With Mirasol, Qualcomm also broke with tradition by having its own factory, a Taiwan facility it sold in 2014. It didn't sell the technology, though. (Reports say that Apple is now developing display technology at the factory.) In all my conversations with people at Qualcomm, they didn’t shy away from admitting to failures—neither getting defensive nor wallowing in mea culpas. "Qualcomm doesn't get real amped up in the high points. It doesn’t get real low in the low points," Mollenkopf says. Qualcomm's low-key leadership over the years isn't a sign of timidity. As engineers, Mollenkopf, Grob, and their predecessors have the kind of quiet confidence from looking at the problem and doing the math. Sometimes that means admitting that the numbers don't add up. "We have the ability to change ourselves when we need to change ourselves, and a track record of doing it," says Mollenkopf. Never miss a story.

Update: Apple says no plans to manufacture products at Mesa, Arizona site Posted Jan 10, 2017 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Fitbit acquires the Vector smartwatch startup, as the wearable giant continues its roll-up Update: Apple has reached out to clarify that the Notice of proposed production activity at the Mesa, Arizona site relates to an application to renew the Foreign Trade-Zone status that the location already had at the time Apple acquired the site from its former supplier, GT Advanced Technologies. And while it confirms it applied for a renewal of the FTZ status, triggering the Notice of proposed manufacturing activity, it emphasizes it does not intend to manufacture products at the site. Rather its intention is for Mesa to become a global command hub for its data center operations — meaning the site will be used as the central location where it receives and configures servers, assembling them into racks, before distributing the units for use in its various data centers. Its application to renew Mesa’s FTZ status appears to be aimed at retaining certain distribution and logistical benefits that stem from having a site with the designation, rather than as a route to enabling it to expand manufacturing capabilities in the US. At this stage the Mesa global data command hub is not yet operational. Once it is up and running, Apple says production at the site will be limited to assembling servers into racks. Apple also noted it does use a range of US-based suppliers as part of its global manufacturing supply chain. Its annual supplier report lists 69 manufacturing facilities in the US, with US-based companies supplying components such as the glass in all iOS devices; iOS and Mac chips and processors; RF components for iPhone; and various display materials for iPhone, iPad and MacBook. It adds that 33 different US states contribute to making its products, and has also previously shared that it works with 8,000 domestic suppliers — claiming its supply chain generates more than 360,000 US jobs. Original story follows below.  Apple has submitted a proposal to expand its manufacturing capabilities at a site in Mesa, Arizona. The notification of proposed production activity was submitted by Apple on December 27, and published in the Federal Register yesterday. The notice shows Apple seeking to expand its production capabilities at the site in Mesa to be able to produce finished products and utilize foreign status materials/components — including a laundry list of core electronics components, such as printed circuit board assemblies, lithium polymer batteries and monitors. “The current request would add finished products and foreign status materials/components to the scope of authority,” the notice states. The first product Apple is intending to manufacture at the Mesa site appears to be data server cabinets — which are listed in the title of the notice. This is not a consumer product Apple sells, so would presumably be used for building out its own data centers. At the time of writing Apple could not be reached for comment but we’ve reached out with questions and will update this story with any response. Cupertino does already assemble the Mac Pro in the US but this election cycle the company has come under high-profile political pressure from (the now) President-Elect Donald Trump to expand its on-shore manufacturing capabilities, with Trump calling for iPhones to be made in the US. As well as pushing this suggestion on the campaign stump, Trump reportedly put it to Apple CEO Tim Cook during a phone call between the pair after he won the election — with Trump suggesting tax incentives could be used to persuade large corporations to set up manufacturing facilities in the US. Apple’s current supply chain for devices such as the iPhone, iPad and Mac involves a web of assembly spread across multiple countries, mostly in Asia. So any moves to repatriate manufacturing, even greased by tax incentives, would undoubtedly take a long time to unpick and re-form such a complex supply chain system. Not to mention requiring an army of cheap labour on tap at home to do the assembling, without which the cost of manufacturing the products would rise — likely pushing up their retail price-tag. (Or, if enough humans couldn’t be found in the US labour force, a massive investment in assembly robots could be an alternative — such as we’re starting to see Apple outsourcer Foxconn make — which would presumably not be the kind of long term (human) jobs Trump was hoping to create…) The Mesa Notice invites public comments from interested parties — with a closing date for receipt of February 21. If Apple is granted production under the Foreign Trade-Zone procedure it could be exempt from customs duty payments on the listed foreign-status materials/components used in export production. While, for domestic sales, the notice states Apple would be able to choose the duty rate during customs entry procedures for the listed foreign-status materials/components. “Customs duties also could possibly be deferred or reduced on foreign-status production equipment,” it adds. According to Business Insider, which spoke to a source with knowledge of Apple’s data center plans, the servers Apple uses in facilities such as its data centers in Oregon and North Carolina are currently built and tested on-site, and Cupertino is intending to consolidate server manufacturing at the 1.2 million square foot Mesa site. BI notes another report, by The Information last March, that said Apple has been working on projects to design its own data center operations for security reasons. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Revises an Invention to Cover a Next-Gen Acoustic Display | Main | Apple Granted Liquid Metal Related Patent for Embossed Apple Logo on Products » January 10, 2017 Apple Granted an RFID Tag Microchip Integration Design Patent   Apple's Senior VP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller introduced the iPhone 7 on September seventh and informed us that they had added Felica, Japan's version of NFC, to the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2. In October Apple's CEO tested out the technology in Japan when taking a ride on the Yamanote Line railway. Felica uses NFC-F technology which is a faster form of RFID with Type B communications. Today we learn that Apple was granted a patent for an RFID tag and microchip integration design. The technology was gained through LuxVue Technology, a company they acquired back in 2014. Whether today's patent is used in Apple's iPhone today or this is something for the future is unknown at this time, but the patent does reference Japan's faster RFID standard.   Granted Patent: RFID Tag and Microchip Integration Design   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to an integrated microchip, method of integrating a microchip, and a microchip integration system. In an embodiment, a microchip such as a micro RFID chip or integrated passive device (IPD) is electrostatically transferred and bonded to a conductive pattern including a line break. In an embodiment, the line break is formed by a suitable cutting technique such as laser ablation, ion beam etching, or photolithography with chemical etching to accommodate the microchip.   Integrated passive devices (IPD) are used in wireless and RF applications.   Apple's patent FIG. 8A noted above is a schematic top view illustration of a far field RFID tag including a micro RFID chip and a pair of micro LED devices connected to a planar dipole antenna in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 8B is a schematic top view illustration of a near field RFID tag including a micro RFID chip and a pair of micro LED devices connected to a looped antenna.   In the particular embodiments illustrated, one or more electrode trace lines #152 can be formed on the substrate #102 similarly as the antenna patterns #120. One or more micro LED devices #150 are transferred and bonded to contact areas of the electrode trace lines using one or more electrostatic transfer head assemblies. In this manner, the one or more micro LED devices connected with the micro RFID chip can light up when the RFID tag is interrogated by a reader.   Felica is NFC-F that technology which is a faster form of RFID with Type B communications. Today's patent shows the U.S. frequency for RFID is at 915 MHz and the Japanese standard being 950 MHz.   Apple's granted patent 9,542,638 was originally filed in Q1 2014 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.   Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.

We buy one off eBay on its 10th birthday to find out. By Alistair Charlton January 10, 2017 13:37 GMT The original iPhone with its 3.5in screen is surprisingly compact by today's standardsIBTimes UK The iPhone is 10 years old. On 9 January 2007, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs announced "a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communicator". These were all one product: the iPhone. It was a day Jobs said he had been looking forward to for two-and-a-half years, and one that has gone down as a turning point in consumer technology, the birth of the smartphone we know today. But enough gushing over history. We put our iPhone 7 Plus to one side and used an original iPhone for 24 hours to see how they've stood the test of time – starting late on the eve of the iPhone's birthday. Sunday, 11pm: Bubble-wrapped piece of history Bleary-eyed and unsure of the time or day, we return home from the CES technology show in Las Vegas to be greeted by a bubble-wrapped package. Our iPhone 1 set us back £107 (€123) on eBay and comes with no box, charger or any accessories at all. It also sports several scratches and chips to the metal back and an alarming amount of mysterious gunk in the headphone jack. But it's ours, it works, and is the genesis of the smartphone. And besides, immaculate examples in the original box cost over £1,000. One joker wants £4,600 for one in a sealed box. Monday, 11am: Comically small After a jet-lag induced sleep we examine the iPhone in more detail; it looks and feels comically small compared to our 7 Plus. The original iPhone's screen is just 3.5in, compared to 4in for the iPhone 4 and 5, 4.7in for the iPhone 6 through to 7, and 5.5in for the Plus models. It feels tiny yet familiar; the iOS software has undergone thousands of changes over the decade, but the home screen and menu system have remained fundamentally the same throughout. It's funny how quickly we get used to the size of everyday products changing. Televisions, cars, smartphones; all have increased massively over the decades but only when we go backwards do the changes make themselves obvious. We remember owning an iPhone 3G and overhearing a stranger saying: "These new phones all the kids have, you can barely fit them in your pocket." We wonder what size phone they have today. 12:30pm: Who remembers MobileMe? MobileMe was an ill-fated suite of online services, killed in 2012 and replaced by iCloudIBTimes UK Inserting a SIM card then connecting to Vodafone and our Wi-Fi router was no issue at all, but getting much else done is proving difficult. The phone won't recognise our iCloud account or the details of an old @mac account. Instead it demands we log in using Apple's MobileMe service, which died in 2012 and became iCloud. We're struggling to get around this. Even opening icloud.com causes the phone's Safari web browser to crash. 12:45pm: Hello, work email Let's try our IBTimes UK email address instead. This is starting to feel like hacking instead of simply setting up a smartphone. We enter our details and... another error. Followed by an email from Google explaining how the login attempt was blocked because the iPhone is so old its software is out-of-date and considered unsafe. We warily click "allow access to less secure apps" and try again. Success; our work emails come flooding in. 1pm: In a time before apps Working through our inbox and replying to emails feels very familiar. The process has barely changed in a decade and that's just fine. What has changed (or rather, grown beyond belief) is the app ecosystem. Back in 2007 the AppStore did not exist; iPhone users were stuck with the 17 apps Apple supplied with the handset. Jailbreaking was an option, unlocking the phone to add third-party apps, but this was (and still is) a treacherous route towards security and instability issues. Due to running newer software from 2009 our iPhone has the AppStore, but nothing works anymore. All popular apps require the phone to be running a newer version of iOS; Twitter, for example, demands iOS 9, but our phone cannot be upgraded beyond version three. To get around this we are using the web version of Twitter and have added a shortcut to the home screen. YouTube also isn't supported anymore. It opens, but will only play one video; one made by YouTube to explain how the app no longer works. Safari to the rescue, again. It is now we're reminded about the iPhone's low screen resolution of 320 x 480 pixels (compared to 1080 x 1920 on the 7 Plus). HD became par for the course years ago, but pre-dating Apple's Retina screens means we're offered 'HQ' on YouTube for High Quality, rather than High Definition. The original iPhone has a 3.5in screen, tiny compared to the 5.5in iPhone 7 PlusIBTimes UK 2pm: How about some positives? The original iPhone is the perfect size for one-handed use. Where our 7 Plus feels like it is never more than balanced precariously on top of our hand, its ancestor fits snugly within our grip. We can reach the entire keyboard with our thumb and stretch easily to the top-mounted lock button with our index finger. No wonder Jobs and Apple were hesitant about upping the screen size for so long –this actually feels great. Less great is the speed of the iPhone. Despite being connected to a 30 Mbps internet connection, web pages load very slowly compared to what we are used to. For today the slowness could just about pass as quaint, but give it a week and we'd be pulling our hair out. 2:30pm: Can you listen to music on the original iPhone? Yes and no. Music can be transferred from laptop to iPhone via a USB cable. But downloading anything from the iTunes app is a no-go because it crashes every time we try to open it. Safari and the YouTube mobile site once again come to the rescue. Eventually. Even just performing a search here takes the best part of a minute. And things would be much worse outside, because this phone doesn't even have 3G, let alone the 4G we are used to today. Notice how slow the internet is when your iPhone shows E instead of 4G? That's the absolute best you can ever get from this phone. Apple's aluminium design switched to plastic and glass through the iPhone's life, before returning for the iPhone 5, 6, and 7IBTimes UK 2:40pm: Anyone got a dongle? We have finally found something to listen to, but quickly run into another problem. The first iPhone's headphone jack was sunk into its body, making it impossible to connect headphones with anything but the slimmest of cables. Apple's own earphones were (surprise!) no problem, but everyone else had to buy a dongle. Sound familiar? We tried Bluetooth and, after punching the air with joy when our Bose headphones connected, were unable to get music to play through them. The iPhone recognises them, but only as a Bluetooth headset for making phone calls. 3pm: What about the camera? The iPhone's 2-megapixel camera is a world away from the 12MP, dual-lens setup of the 7 PlusIBTimes UK It's a 2-megapixel sensor with no flash, image stabilisation, zoom or any features at all. It can't record video, there is no front-facing camera for selfies, no timer, no burst mode, no white balance control, no grid to help frame photos better. Nothing. Just an icon to tap to take a photo. Having said all that, image quality is surprisingly good for its age. As long as there is enough light and nothing like a bright TV screen to mess up the automatic exposure, the original iPhone does a decent job. However, the tight framing is disappointing, compared to the wide-angle lenses of modern phones. Worth noting is how little you could do with a photo in 2007 compared to today. The first iPhone lets you email it, assign it to a contact, or set it as your wallpaper. Today there are 14 default options. Here is the same scene shot on the iPhone and iPhone 7 Plus: Photo taken by the original 10-year-old iPhoneIBTimes UK Photo taken with the iPhone 7 PlusIBTimes UK 4pm: iOS is the same, but very different We keep being reminded of how limited old versions of iOS were. There is no notification drawer to swipe down from the top, no settings drawer to swipe up from below, no multitasking (double pressing the home button opens your favourite contacts page), and no Siri. It feels familiar, like getting into any car from the last 60 years and being able to drive it after a minute of orientation, but also very different. We realise how spoilt we have become and just how quickly things are done with a modern smartphone; Google searches, emails, photos, video editing... it's all instant and the pace never slows no matter what your workflow is. In 2007 life was taken with one slow but sure-footed step at a time – not the maddening, multitasking rush we subject ourselves to today. Volume buttons and mute switch stand the test of timeIBTimes UK 5pm: Is this it? There isn't really much to do with an original iPhone. Our example not having App Store access lets us share the same experience Apple fans (this writer included) had on day one a decade ago. It's just a phone with a web browser. We remember friends in college being genuinely blown away by CoverFlow, the feature where you can swipe through your music by album cover. Being able to pan around Google Maps, tap on a restaurant and book a table (or, as was more likely aged 17, order a pizza) on a phone was hugely impressive at the time. But now? There are a dozen apps for that. 9pm: 'Oh cute! Nice Chinese knock-off' Our housemate comes home and is very impressed with the iPhone. Mostly because he thinks it is a scaled-down Chinese knock-off bought in Vegas. No, this is an iPhone; it's the same size as that 3GS you had at university a few years ago. How times change.

This past October, for example, Cook during an earnings conference call enthusiastically said that Apple was “high on” the technology. One month earlier, Cook said that Augmented Reality is more intriguing than Virtual Reality because it allows people to talk to each other and see other information while remaining present in a conversation. Don't Miss: All the reasons people are ditching Android and switching to iPhones While Apple’s plans in the AR space remain murky, there are growing reports that the company is planning to release a pair of Augmented Reality equipped glasses by 2018, if not sooner . Most recently, Robert Scoble posted a note on Facebook claiming that Apple will release a pair of Augmented Reality glasses via a partnership with Carl Zeiss AG. Exclusive news: Apple and Zeiss working together on augmented reality optics. For the nerds who were at CES and not paying attention to all my posts. A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year. (I thought it was next year but now that I saw this I believe it will happen this year). … And that explains why there was no augmented reality in Zeiss’s booth even though it was right in the middle of the AR area. For those unfamiliar, Carl Zeiss is a well-regarded German company with decades of expertise developing a wide array of advanced optical systems, from surgical microscopes to eyeglass lenses. While you might naturally want to take Scoble’s proclamation with a grain of salt, it’s worth noting that we’ve heard similar rumors from even more reputable sources over the past few months. A Bloomberg report from November of last year, for example, relayed that Apple had already ordered “small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing.” Just two weeks prior to that, Ming-Chi Kuo — who perhaps has the most solid track record with respect to Apple rumors — issued a research note claiming that Apple is prepping to release AR technology that will leapfrog the competition by three to five years. Kuo isn’t prone to hyperbole so his statements in this regard certainly raised a few eyebrows while generating quite a bit of intrigue. Notably, it’s no secret that Apple today has a sizable and growing team of engineers and researchers with varied and deep experience across both virtual and augmented reality. Per a Financial Times report from last year: The secret research unit includes hundreds of staff from a series of carefully targeted acquisitions, as well as employees poached from companies that are working on next-generation headset technologies including Microsoft and camera start-up Lytro, according to people familiar with the initiative. The company’s latest acquisition in the area is Flyby Media, an augmented reality start-up that uses let mobile devices “see” the world around them. Fly-by’s team worked closely with Google in developing software for its 3D positioning technology Project Tango. What’s more, Apple over the past few months has made a number of high-profile hires in the AR space. This past September, for example, Apple hired Yury Petrov, formerly of Occulus VR, and  Zeyu Li, an engineer from the Augmented Reality-centric startup Magic Leap. With the iPhone having celebrated its 10th anniversary this week, it’s only natural to see some tech observers wonder aloud about what Apple’s next big innovation might be. From what we can gather thus far, it may very well be in the AR space. For what it’s worth, here’s what Scoble posted about the upcoming iPhone 8 a few months back. More on iPhone 8. Just had a source that I trust tell me it is a clear piece of glass. With the compute in a strip at the bottom. Translation it does Mixed Reality. VR, AR, and AI. He also talked to me about Siri. Asks “why did Viv.ai sell to Samsung? I know the founders didn’t want to do that.” So Apple showed them the new Siri for mixed reality and the game was over. As we said back in October, not a chance. So Scoble isn’t typically the most reliable source for Apple rumors, but there’s no denying that there’s a whole a lot of AR-related smoke that isn’t coming solely from Scoble.
