By DAVID WETHE Bloomberg View First Published 1 hour ago    •    Updated 1 hour ago Share This Article Martin Craighead's knack for innovation helped turn Baker Hughes into a sort of Apple for oil services. Under his tenure as chief executive, the company became a coveted asset that rival Halliburton Co. sought to take over in a failed $35 billion deal. And it was technology that led him to favor a partnership with General Electric Co. instead. Set to become the world's second-largest oil-services provider after merging with GE Oil & Gas, Baker Hughes will get the chance to combine its digital applications with the industrial giant's Internet-of-things platform to integrate oil rigs with customers' software systems in real time. Investors got further insight into Craighead's latest feat on Thursday, as Baker Hughes boosted sales for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The innovation engine in Baker Hughes is in full throttle," Craighead, 57, told analysts and investors Thursday on a conference call. "As we set our technology agenda for creating a step change in productivity for our customers, we firmly believe our merger with GE Oil & Gas will be revolutionary." A bit of a Steve Jobs type is how Joel Tarver, who was responsible for digital applications at Baker Hughes, remembers the first time he saw Craighead in front of a crowd in 2006. With his close-cropped hair and glasses, and an intensity in his eyes, Craighead rolled out the new "Answers While Drilling" pitch to a company audience — much like the late Apple co-founder's presentations of iPhones and iPads. It was all about giving customers information at the same time that they were drilling so they didn't have to stop and do the analysis. "It was just a very Apple-esque launch of the brand," said Tarver, who based one of the apps he developed for Baker Hughes on the Candy Crush smartphone game. "It's just not something the industry was really well known for, to come out and win hearts and minds." Years later Craighead made a splash at his first ever analyst day as CEO in a suburb outside Houston. He was offering up a new technology that would aim to take down the most iconic symbol of the industry -- the nodding donkey, as the oil pumps that dot fields in Texas are known. Electronic dance music beats accompanied lightning fast graphics on a large movie screen as the new Linear Electromagnetic Actuated Pump, or LEAP, was announced. So far, LEAP has failed to displace the traditional pumps in any significant way. The company announced its first field trial of the new technology and has not discussed it further since then. Baker Hughes' revenue climbed 2 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the company said Thursday. It reported a loss, excluding certain items, of 30 cents per share, worse than the 12 cents expected from analysts. Shares fell 1.6 percent to $62.58 at 9:59 a.m. in New York. In the four-plus years that Craighead has run Baker Hughes, the company has surpassed analysts' annual earnings expectations once, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For 2016, the only time he beat quarterly estimates was in the third quarter. Melanie Kania, a spokeswoman for Baker Hughes, declined to comment. Craighead faced a daunting challenge at the start of 2012, taking over from CEO Chad Deaton. A little more than a year before, Deaton spent $5.5 billion to buy fracking service provider BJ Services Co. just before the market for hydraulic fracturing collapsed from a glut of new gear. "He took over a very big company with a lot of problems," David Anderson, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a phone interview. "It was very clear he was trying to change the culture. He was trying different things." While Craighead had to cut more than 20,000 workers during the industry's worst financial crisis in a generation, he was still forced to carry extra costs he otherwise would have slashed further. His ability to streamline the company was severely limited while the Halliburton merger process dragged on. Craighead is credited by analysts for ultimately snagging a $3.5 billion breakup fee from Halliburton that helped Baker Hughes pay down debt and provided cushion during the downturn. By merging the company in which he spent more than three decades with GE's oilfield business, he's helping create a service company that's second only to Schlumberger in market value. In his spare time, one of Craighead's favorite things to do is fly fishing, said James Wicklund, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Dallas who has known Craighead for years. "It lets his mind slow down from racing 500 miles an hour thinking of the next new thing." But life in the slow lane may not be enough for Craighead, who'll be vice chairman of the new Baker Hughes once the deal is completed next year. "He needs to be an operating guy," Wicklund said. "He's too energetic to be just a passive board member. That may be his biggest challenge going forward."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES The battle over MormonLeaks -- two websites with one name and one goal: target the LDS Church ROTC may move from BYU to UVU after colonel bristles at Honor Code SLC shirks Trump, refuses to enforce his immigration edict Garrison Keillor: Help us, GOP, you're our only hope Salt Lake County also will refuse to enforce Trump's immigration edict ELEVATE H&R Block Announces Two New Offers: Refund Advance of Up to $1,250 and Free Federal 1040EZ   Professional-in-Residence Jim Mortensen Prepares Students to Become Top Advisors   3 Unforgettable Date Night Ideas   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Opinion | 07 Jan 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (103) Tell Us Your Mac Automation Stories by Adam C. Engst The news that Apple had laid off Sal Soghoian, who has been a fixture in the world of scripting and automation for decades, hit hard at MacTech Conference back in November. Although Sal hasn’t been making as many public appearances as he used to in the days of Macworld Expo, his indefatigable efforts to promote user automation inside and outside Apple have had wide-ranging impact. Sal worked tirelessly within Apple to encourage support for AppleScript and Automator (among much else), and to ensure that Apple apps provided the necessary scripting dictionaries and Automator actions. He was long a champion for the user, believing that users know best what they need to do and that automation technologies were essential for enabling users to create and streamline their own workflows. What should we make of Sal leaving? Apple didn’t lay him off specifically, it instead eliminated the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies. It’s my understanding that multiple groups within Apple wanted to hire Sal afterward, but Apple was under some sort of hiring freeze that prevented him from migrating within the company. So it doesn’t look as though Apple was trying to get rid of Sal personally, which is good. What’s less good is that it would appear that Apple doesn’t see the need for having a position that evangelizes user automation. A 9to5Mac reader sent email to Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to ask that Apple not kill AppleScript and Automator, and was told “We have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS!” Federighi’s response prompts the question of whether Apple’s future actions will bear out his statement. It may be overreaching to read too much into his precise words, but “intent” is an aim or a plan, not a guarantee. And “support” can mean “maintenance mode” rather than “advancing the state of the art.” Regardless, eliminating Sal’s position isn’t a step in the right direction. Sure, Apple could have plans to replace AppleScript and Automator with super secret magic unicorn technologies, but based purely on what the company has done and said, it’s hard to believe that. It wasn’t always like this. The reason AppleScript survived the purge of products and technologies after Steve Jobs returned was that Jobs understood the importance of automation to key Apple markets, like publishing, finance, and TV and film, not to mention the enterprise and IT worlds. These industries live and die by custom workflows based on AppleScript and other automation technologies built deep into macOS. Jobs personally approved the inclusion of Automator in OS X, and he enabled and supported adding AppleScript as a development language to Xcode. And it was because of his support that Apple’s automation team went on to develop AppleScript/Objective-C, script libraries, and JavaScript for Automation. But the Apple of today is an entirely different company, focusing as it does on the iPhone and iOS. Even so, it’s obvious to anyone who uses iOS that there is still an important role for automation. I can tell Siri to “Change ‘Floating’ to 8 AM” to adjust the time of my wake-up alarm, but I have no way to automate the five taps necessary to play the audiobook we listen to every night in the Hoopla digital library app. Five wasted taps every night isn’t the end of the world, but if you can’t automate the little stuff, you certainly can’t automate the big stuff. If Apple’s seeming indifference toward automation worries you because you rely on scripts, macros, workflows, and more to get your work done quickly, effectively, and accurately, here’s what I’d like you to do. Leave a comment on this article outlining how you depend on Mac automation tools in your job. If there are too many examples to fit in a single comment, just focus on those that are the most important to you. I’ll compile all the comments and publish them as a future article, and I’ll also send a copy to Craig Federighi and Apple CEO Tim Cook so they see concrete examples of why we need these automation technologies to continue to evolve. To kick things off, here’s my most important bit of automation. When it comes time to publish a new or updated Take Control title, I start with three versions of the book: a PDF, an EPUB, and Mobipocket file. A copy of each must be stored in several locations on our internal file server and uploaded both to our Web server and to Amazon S3. Plus, the uploaded versions must be renamed precisely according to an algorithm that’s replicated on our server, so the site can update itself and serve the correct files based on the presence of properly named uploads in the right directories. When I used to do this by hand, it took 15–20 minutes, and I ran the risk of renaming a file incorrectly or uploading to the wrong directory. (And making a mistake meant that I had to spend even more time figuring out what I’d done wrong and fixing it.) Now that I have a series of Automator workflows performing these tasks for me, it takes me just seconds to initiate the uploads, and there are never any errors. So that’s my automation story — tell us yours! Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Take Control of Automating Your Mac If you use copy and paste, you’re taking advantage of an important shortcut. But did you realize that the Mac offers dozens of shortcuts that make tedious tasks quick, accurate, and repeatable? Author Joe Kissell reveals OS X’s many shortcuts and examines the utilities that go further, offering concrete examples and long lists of possibilities.   READERS LIKE YOU!

It's just pure magic how I can get first and third party apps to collaborate to do just about anything. For instance, I can have the Finder duplicate/rename 300 screenshots, send them to Pixelmator to crop, and then Transmit to upload to my server. It's just a pain in the neck to do it by hand and honestly, it's nothing short of magical having all these apps work together to complete my task for me. Reply Tommy Weir  2017-01-09 14:05 I have a custom naming approach for all files on my system. And every year, they are sorted into relevant groups and archived off using the automator actions which the developers of DevonThink Office Pro provide. It's a simple thing, a folder is monitored, files are imported and tagged. But the knowledge that the organisation is done and it's consistent year in and year out. I can't tell you what that means for my peace of mind in my business. 2. My son uses folder actions all the time, resizing images, converting and renaming them for different use cases, it's like his party trick for employers while he's studying in Boston College. 3. I use a combination of Automator, Hazel and Keyboard Maestro together with some scripts I picked up online to keep my computer organised. These various tools move files around to their rightful folders, rename files to my standardised system, save email attachments and move them to the right folders, clear up strays that land here or there, archive off application installers and delete old files that are backed up and not in use for some time. Reply Chuck Shotton  2017-01-09 15:03 Well, in a nutshell, most of the Web industry on Mac OS in the early days of the Internet would not have existed if not for Sal's work with AppleScript, AppleEvents, scriptability/recordability of applications, AppleEvent Dictionaries, the Script Editor, and the concept of scripts as runnable applications. Every external extension created for MacHTTP or WebSTAR, Userland Frontier, and all of the other HTTP servers on the Mac depended exclusively on these technologies. It was how applications talked. It's still how they should talk, but Apple (NeXT) seems to have never embraced it as they should have. Even the newest incarnation of MacHTTP, MacHTTP-js, depends on a slew of AppleEvents to do its job. Let's hope this great legacy isn't lost just because it doesn't work on iOS... Reply Anthony Reimer  2017-01-09 15:39 I use AppleScript and Automator for automating actions in the Finder. Some common things I have created that I use at work: • Clean the desktop of shared computers. • Automate server connections. • Take any downloaded dmgs and move them to an Installers folder automatically (using Folder Actions). • A service that opens the current URL in a specific browser (e.g., if a page needs Flash, open it in Chrome). I also use it as an integral tool to integrate with FileMaker Pro. (e.g., export text data from FileMaker to a file, have BBEdit clean it up, then upload that edited file to a web site using Fetch — AppleScript + FileMaker scripting can make this a single step for the user). The Mac Admin community is all about automation for both the efficiency that comes from it and the consistency of result. While Python and shell scripting are core to that automation, I know I still put Automator and AppleScript to use on a regular basis. Reply Anonymous   2017-01-09 15:51 For 16 years now approximately 15 times a year I do financials based on a series of companies. The workflow I've created reduces 21 pages of reports to a readable 4 and about 90 minutes of my time to 20. That's roughly 16 * 15 * (90-20) = 16,800 minutes or 280 hours or 35 work days or 6 work weeks of my life. That's time with family, time doing other work things, time that I am not simply throwing down the hole of clicks and points. Thank you for HyperCard, AppleScript, Automator and anything else Apple can provide to give me more time! Reply Paul Ellis  2017-01-09 16:21 Which Mac automation stories? Back in the day, when I regularly had tasks that merited automation, I used QuickKeys. Nowadays I use Hazel for the few regular automated file-handling tasks I have. I've found that on those comparatively rare occasions when I have a repetitive task that could do with automating, Automator invariably lets me down. It's quicker to complete the task manually rather than trying to bully Automator into action. Here's an example: automating iTunes playback. I leave iTunes running when away from my house for an extended period, to stop the place appearing to be empty. A few years ago I spent a couple of hours figuring out how to use Calendar to automate playback, but then found the Calendar events I created didn't 'travel', but had to be created afresh every day. I can no longer be bothered with this palaver: I simply remote in with Teamviewer and manually toggle playback. Welcome to C21 Mac automation, conspicuously lacking in usability and utility. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-09 16:33 One of the hardest things with automation is picking the right tool. For what you describe, I'd use Keyboard Maestro, which can really easily play random music from iTunes at specific times. Reply Rob Wells  2017-01-09 17:31 I work at a small newspaper and we depend on AppleScript. The most important is one AppleScript that creates working pages from a master InDesign file. It applies the right styles, sets the date of the edition on each page, sets the page numbers and saves a copy to disk with an appropriate, dated filename. This was written almost 5 years ago and has prevented many mistakes, not least with incorrect dates going to print! Previously staff would duplicate an old page — risky for many reasons. On the other end, we use AppleScript to reliably produce the PDF files for use by our printers, custom settings and all. Other things we’ve done with AppleScript include scripting BBEdit to fix common mistakes in stories, retrieving and setting weather forecasts, TV listings, football fixtures & scores, creating the barcode (and checking it is correct — an occasionally major problem before). Newer stuff is often in Python but with an AppleScript interface. Code here: https://github.com/ppps Reply Rob Wells  2017-01-09 17:21 Oh, and that's just AppleScript. There's all sorts of stuff we do with Hazel and Python scripts run as LaunchAgents (through Lingon). Our newsroom is an all-Mac office and on occasion in the past a member of staff has suggested buying cheaper Windows machines. Alongside the longevity of Macs (most of ours are almost 10 years old), automation is always the big reason I give for why we would be worse off. My understanding is that bigger newspapers have software written for them to handle this stuff, which we could never afford. Mac automation technologies have enabled us to do it ourselves in-house. Reply Mike Warren  2017-01-09 17:57 I'm so old I remember when the whole reason for having a computer was automation . I consider AppleScript a programming language. I've created programs for record keeping, budgeting, a foreign language dictionary, flash cards. I use AppleScript for a daily email message to my partner (it pulls info from flat-file databases, Calendar.app; assembles a message, sends it via Mail.app, saves it as my Safari home page.) I have so many little scripts and Keyboard Maestro routines that I feel hopeless when I have to use someone else's Mac. Reply Daniel  2017-01-09 18:00 Keyboard Maestro, with an accompanying mix of Apple Script and shell scripts, is a wonderful glue for web applications with lacking APIs. After a recent migration between institutional repositories (for academic publishing) hundreds of full text files where missing because of a bug in the new systems import script. There were no APIs for uploading new files to existing records in the system, and some manual steps were required in the upload form, but the automation tools allowed me to reduce each process from maybe 30 error prone clicks in both of the applications and Finder to about three clicks per record. It saved me several hours of tedious work. Reply Daniel  2017-01-09 18:12 Another error in the same migration required me to verify the order of attached files in both of the systems, also for a few hundred items. By automation I could with a single keyboard shortcut navigate to the next item in a list of IDs, find the record in both of the systems, then open all attachments in order in new windows and tile them on the screen in two columns allowing me to see differences at a glance. If in order, a new click got me to the next item, else I could handle the error before moving on. Reply Thomas Tempelmann  2017-01-09 18:54 As a developer (for apps such as Find Any File, iClip and iBored), I recently have started using Automator and AppleScript to assist my customers when they have some technical troubles and are not too computer-savvy. I have scripts to collect files I need to look at, fetch system information, email them to me, or copy, move and delete files to fix some of their setups. And just the other day I used AppleScript to verify a slow memory leak in one of my apps, which required 1000s of mouse moves. With AppleScript, it took me 15 minutes to write the code, then have it perform its task for about one hour to cause the issue that otherwise took users days or even weeks to run into. A few hours later, and I managed to identify and fix one of the most obscure bugs I had for a long time in my app. Also, I'm happy to have spent the money on Script Debugger, which makes writing AppleScripts much less of a pain, indeed :) Reply gastropod  2017-01-09 19:43 Currently my main automation use is somewhat indirect. To tolerate Mail.app at all, I've found Mail Tags and Mail Act-on to be indispensable. They do a lot of automating for me by greatly expanding the filter tests and actions available, and by allowing for single key actions such as moving selected messages to a folder without having to drag through the folder tree. Since I run a majordomo server and several mailing lists, intricate mail sorting is a lifesaver. In the past, I used Quickkeys to remap the keyboard and add macros to music software such as Finale. Saved me hours a week and a lot of frustration. I'm planning to dive into Keyboard Maestro soon, partly to improve the modern Finder window handling train wreck. which costs me at least an hour a week in getting windows back where they're supposed to be. Reply gastropod  2017-01-12 22:21 I entirely forgot the services I created with Automator a few years ago to do routine exif handling. Automator calls on exiftool to show all metadata in BBEdit, strip all metadata, strip all but a few exif/iptc fields, alter GPS data, etc. Not only do they save some effort when used, they save the time it takes to periodically check the exiftool docs, since it has so many options I can never remember them. It's also much easier than the command line to do things to an ad hoc file selection. Reply Naomi Pearce  2017-01-09 19:49 Early in the days of Automator, Sal made a comment, something about it changing the way applications work together where you don’t have to learn the application, just find the action for the feature you want it to do. I looked at him sideways and thought, “yeah, right, okay buddy.” Some time later, I had worked on a proposal for several days (days because it involved a fair amount of PR-101 that had been requested), finished it, print-to-.pdf and sent it off. I followed up on it the next day and Andy Taylor of MacSpeech, Inc. said “well, yes, he’d received the Executive Summary and looked forward to the rest of it.” Wait, what?! Print-to-.pdf was something one took for granted, particularly from Word, and I opened the document and sure enough, it had not printed the whole document to .pdf, just the first page. I could get it to print page 1, or print from page 2-on, but not the whole document. Minutes were ticking by, and panic ensued. I was screwed. Or was I? I remembered what Sal had said about Automator and fired it up. I clicked on “workflow” to create a workflow. I used the search and found an action to combine PDF pages and dragged it over. Clearly, it needed to know what PDF pages to use to combine, so I found an action to Get Specified Finder Items and dragged it on top to make that happen first. Then I found an action to open the result up so I could see it (open finder items, I think it was called), and dragged that action below Combine PDF Pages. That’s all I could think of needing to do, so I dragged the page-1-only document and page-2-on document into the first action, and hit run. No more than 15 minutes after I first thought “what?!”→ just like magic → problem solved. And I never learned the applications, just found the actions for what I wanted to do. I’ll be darned. Wow! Only on a Mac. Reply Walt Jump  2017-01-09 20:21 I use Automator to routinely download specific files from government databases, rename them, and move them to specific folders for use by my FileMaker databases. This saves me at least 1-2 hours a day. I also use a program by someone who accesses the PTO databases and provides one file for data obtained from multiple databases by the use of Apple script and Automator. Reply Douglas Mobley   2017-01-09 21:08 The museum where I volunteer has a project to digitize old newspapers to aid the searching of them. The workflow, in simplistic terms, consists of photographing each page, processing the pages through Photoshop, and finally OCRing the images into newspaper issues. I had been using Photoshop actions to automate one step of the process but I was able to improve my productivity (measured as pages per hour completed) by more than 50% in the last year, using AppleScript to automate the workflow. Creation of folders and renaming of files is handled by Applescript control of Finder, and the processing of the page images through Photoshop is handled with AppleScript. I have used Automator to record and then understand what system events to include in my Applescript. Reply valm1  2017-01-09 21:10 The ability to adjust things in order for them to suit your needs is a first requirement for computers. That is why I liked Apple from the 1980s, and that is why I stopped using them 20 years later. I still have an iPad, but only two, maybe three apps are actually very useful. The rest is either buggy, full with ads or just plane useless. And the user cannot do a thing about it, unless you jailbreak the thing. No updates for individual apps either, so we are stuck with a buggy iOS emailer. I have never lost so many emails - many days of work. Never been so disappointed with Apple - a total waste of money and, especially, of my time. Reply Jeff Porten   2017-01-09 21:23 I think I've been writing AppleScripts for as long as the language has existed, and I've done a great deal of professional consulting doing one-off AppleScripts for my clients. I'd be lost without it. Most common use cases: 1) an AppleScript that cleans up and organizes my Desktop icons according to a custom grid, grouping them by color tag. 2) a randomizer selection when I have a group of files to read or movies to watch, picks "some item in the current folder". 3) any application missing a keystroke; i.e., I have dozens of one-line AppleScripts mapped to Quicksilver launch keys, so I can hit control-command-3 and label a Finder item yellow. (Then there's "comment and label yellow", which uses the yellow label to remind me that an item has a Finder comment.) Reply Rob Lewis  2017-01-09 23:16 I've used Macs since 1986, and our family has owned more than 15, along with assorted iPods and iPhones. With Apple's recent neglect of the Mac lineup, AppleScript is pretty much my last remaining reason for staying loyal: if they take that away, there's little reason for me to stay on the reservation. And if my computer isn't a Mac, there's not much reason for my next phone to be an iPhone. I have a fairly elaborate Home Automation system that is totally based on AppleScript and the XTension program. I love how it makes it easy to control and modify the behavior of the system. I've thought for years that an enhanced version of Automator could finally—finally!—make Home Automation accessible by mere mortals. In my opinion this is a gigantic missed opportunity for Apple. I'm frankly very worried. There are so many signs that Apple has lost its soul chasing shiny iObjects. Reply chrischram@gmail.com  2017-01-09 23:23 I have several Photos libraries on two different disks. I use an Automator app, with a bit of embedded AppleScript, to wrangle these libraries and let me select which one to open. I use AppleScript to collect the data from my weather station and upload it to my web space. It's more reliable than the software that came with the station. I also use AppleScript to massage the weather data and import it to a Numbers spreadsheet. Reply Jake  2017-01-09 23:47 I book several music venues in NYC. I book 100-200 acts per month. I rely heavily on automation, mostly with Keyboard Maestro, AppleScript, a bit of automator, TextExpander, and now also with Better Touch Tool to create app-specific touchbar buttons which trigger my applescripts. For those in doubt about the touchbar, I find it to be the best tool Apple has come out with in years. It's an amazing launcher for all my macros, and I have MANY. It's very powerful! I have actions that add confirmed events to the calendar (BusyCal), send confirmation emails at specific dates/times (much of which is because of a powerful CLI utility called iCalBuddy), resize and reformat images automatically, update web calendars with band descriptions, pictures, links, etc...basically everything I do relies on Mac automation in one form or another. It literally turns hours of work into minutes and allows more music to happen in New York. For me, automation is the best part of using a Mac! Reply Firitia  2017-01-10 01:21 Making netboot images requires automater (or system imaging utility which is just a shell around it). Over history the reability of it has been dubious. In 10.12.2 it is not working: the image source (sierra installer) cannot be found, even if you manually select it. In 10.12.1 it could be found, but the programm crashed anyway when trying to make the image. In 10.12.0 it was working. In 10.11.5 also. But it crashed in 10.11.4, 10.11.3, 10.11.2. Working in 10.11.1 and 10.11.0, but not 10.9.5, and so forth with the ups and downs into the times of the past. (Perhaps I mistake some version numbers, and with some versions it appeared to work on one but not on another computer, but the general idea remains.) In addition to that, when you save a workflow for next time, that next time trying opening it either opens, or it does not at all, or it just crashes the program. Reply Jon Gotow  2017-01-10 00:37 Another developer chiming in here (I'm the author of Default Folder X, App Tamer, Jettison, HistoryHound, and a bunch of other stuff going back nearly 30 years). I use AppleScript in 3 primary ways: 1. For automating processes in my own business, including email parsing and message handling, and software development and testing. 2. For customer support, sending AppleScript applets to customers to help them fix problems or collect debugging information. Having someone run an AppleScript is far more reliable than trying to walk them through a set of steps. 3. Integrating my software with other developers' products. As an example, Default Folder X can detect when Path Finder, a popular Finder substitute, is running and ask it to perform various tasks instead of the Finder - which is exactly what Path Finder users want it to do. That wouldn't be possible (or would be much harder) without AppleScript. Reply DeeAnne Lau  2017-01-10 00:52 AppleScript is used in many of the programs that I use! I am really appalled. I use it to tailor my spam controller program, SpamSieve. I have a Repetitive Motion Injury plus a pinched nerve in my neck. Being able to use scripts to control the Finder or web actions have saved me from much pain. I use A Better Finder Rename applets and use Automator to make contextual services that can be triggered by keystrokes. I use Script Debugger, also, to help me understand the underlying aspects of scripts as I compile them and look for problems. I still rely on some of Dougs Applescripts for iTunes to do things in that (frustrating) program. I use Hazel to manage organization of my downloads and printer folders. I am retired, but I still use my Mac for financial management, communications, learning, and recreation. I rely a lot on AppleScript and Automator. Reply paule  2017-01-10 01:16 I use automator to do mass re-namings of files of photos I take for my son's football team. I estimated once that using automator saves me about 45 minutes per week -- and reduces the error count to zero. Over 14 rounds of footy, that's nearly 11 hours of saved effort. I know I could write a shell script to do the same thing, but Automator makes it easy for me to do (it's been over a decade since I last wrote a shell script!) Reply Felix Deimel  2017-01-10 04:21 I'm using parts of AppleScript to allow users of my professional remote management app, Royal TSX to automate keyboard input. This can range from having a password automatically entered to complex scripts that inject values from their associated connections or credentials. The 10.12.2 update made this completely unreliable as uppercase characters or special characters appearing anywhere in the text can completely mess up the casing. Sometimes it's correct, but it's completely unpredictable and the frequency of errors is very high. I've posted a radar and TSI about this but have yet to hear back from Apple. Here's a copy of the bug report: https://openradar.appspot.com/29182929. One of my customers posted a +1 kind of radar for this here: https://openradar.appspot.com/29825727 If anyone around here is affected by this as well I'd appreciate you "duplicating" my radar.

I know of the existence of Automator, Applescript, javascript, shell scripts and other bizarre animals but am not knowledgeable at writing them. But I find using them to be useful, fun and good for my marriage. When I decided to also implement bootable clones for backup, I attached all clones to my wife's iMac and cloning is done from my MacBook Pro by authenticated traffic. This gives comfort and protection against ransomware affecting the MacBook Pro. I had disks mounted and making noise all day. My wife rightfully pointed to noise and energy bill: a perspective for divorce. But my MacBook Pro's clones are all sitting attached to the iMac, away from CCC and its easy to use automation tools. So I found on the internet "Mount" and "Eject" Applescripts, adapted them to my needs and, to trigger them, use a timer software (Task Till Dawn). Thus these drives are only mounted and doing noise one hour per day, around midnight. Marriage saved ! Thank you Applescript ! Reply Andy Lietz  2017-01-10 08:07 We're a prepress and printing house and we use AppleScript all the time to automatically typeset and alter layouts in InDesign with data from Excel and FileMaker. AppleScript is the "glue" that binds it all together and one of the major reasons we're on the Mac. But as a programming language, AppleScript feels more and more old-fashioned now compared to, say, Python or Ruby. I've met Sal at MacWorld and especially admire him for persuading Adobe to put good AppleScript support into InDesign. It's very sad to see him (and, it seems, Apple's support for automation) leave the company. Reply Bill Cheeseman  2017-01-10 08:26 I was a trial lawyer specializing in major environmental, financial and intellectual property litigation in a large law firm.

Reply Charles Butcher  2017-01-10 09:26 For me, AppleScript as a way for non-programmers to tie applications together is probably the most important differentiator for MacOS. I've been loyal to Apple since my first Quadra 800, but if they abandon AppleScript I'll probably move to Windows or plain UNIX. I run my freelance business on FileMaker Pro. AppleScript lets me create calendar events and to-dos straight from FileMaker, use BBEdit to clean up text from within another application, scan and OCR documents straight to DEVONthink, and a host of other small tasks that over the years must have saved me many hundreds of hours. Sure, AppleScript can be a pain to write, and I've never got on with Automator. But the fact that so many apps support AppleScript, even if only in limited or idiosyncratic ways, is a real achievement. People say the Mac has been "dumbed down"; I've been OK with this so far, but losing AppleScript would be a big blow to professionals. Reply John Cooper  2017-01-10 09:47 I use Keyboard Maestro for window management, application launching, and text expansion, and A Better File Rename for mass renaming of files.

I am in academia, so I’ve mostly developed scripts to automate or help with my teaching and with my record keeping. Initially with Excel, I’ve created a script that would create an Excel spreadsheet formatted and with all the formulas to compute grades putting the precise dates I would teach excluding the holidays. And this would be created by me just copying the webpage where the roster of students for the course is. Then, to take attendance I would use a script that would prompt me with the student name and I would just say “present” or “not here” to have the appropriate mark entered in the sheet (“P” or “A”). Macs had the ability to work with voice command I believe since v 7.5 (my earliest Mac OS version) via the SpeechRecognitionServer. Same thing wold work for entering grades (my office mate decided on a Mac after witnessing me doing both the grades and attendance). After that, I would create from each of my student a web page with his/hers record. I could have 1 or 1000 students and the pages would be created in a flash. I would ftp ( using the Terminal app) to my site and name every file according to their location. Then, to enter grades in the (brain dead) software the College uses to get student grade, AppleScript with Safari and Javascript and I automatically put grades attendance status and last class attended by having an AppleScript that reads the Excel or Number (the one I prefer) spreadsheet data. At the college, at one point the Math Department was creating final exams for remedial level Math courses by getting questions from a 2000+ problems from a MS Word document. This document was divided in various sections. These exams were made by randomly selecting one question from each section. It was a long and laborious process. I was asked to help and from then on we would get all (7 per semester) exams created in less than a minute. They would come already formatted ready for printing. Using Smile, from Satimage (Satimage.fr an AppleScript based developer tool) I have created various QT movies that helped me with teaching, Pre-Calculus trigonometry, Calculus differentiation and integration, statistics distribution, etc. I have created Mathematical libraries for all kinds of Mathematics operations, including Matrix algebra and Statistics Library to help me teach Statistics (much faster and easier to access than R or other scientific software). Using AppleScript and a Mac Mini server Apple could easily disrupt the Education Market by simplifying everyone’s life. It would be cheaper and error free, very likely also more secure and private, without violating any law (FERPA). But hey, who wants to make a ton of money anyway? I’ve created an (AppleScript) app that everyday puts the APOD (apod.nasa.gov) as a background picture of my desktops (I’ve many). I’ve created a script that would search and display the lyrics of the current iTunes song. I use AppleScript to organize my folders, I use AppleScript to apply rules to my incoming Mail. I use AppleScript to generate and save passwords. I use AppleScript… Yes, I would say that Mac automation is the single most important reason I use Macs (actually, now most of my extended family uses Mac because of me). So, yes, Apple should support Mac Automation, because each automation user implies in many others that follows.

It sounds more like the work of an efficiency expert accountant lurking in the background. Axing automator does not seem just like an isolated incident. It probably reflects the strategic view that Apple computers (including smartphones and tablets) should serve a menu of isolated self-sufficient apps (except for Apple's own apps, of cour$e). Nothing can be further from truth. Switching among multiple apps does not just requires a bunch of extra clicks. Cumulatively it is debilitating and interferes with even the desire to use the appliances. The approach should be just the opposite: make multi-app automation easy and use will skyrocket. Reply Gavin Eadie  2017-01-10 12:25 Wow! A lot of responses, maybe mine's already in there but .. I use AppleScripts for various Finder conveniences. One I rely on daily creates a alias, on the Desktop, to a new folder created in Dropbox every midnight. The folder is named for the date and each day I drop any new material I want to keep into that "today" folder. The script is kicked off by launchd at midnight (+1 minute) and every time I log in. It's not a big deal but I suspect I wouldn't have the personal rigor to do this manually every day. Having set this up fourteen years ago (Dropbox added more recently), I rely on its convenience and the historical record it provides. Reply Aaron Priven  2017-01-10 13:30 Without automation, we couldn't do all kinds of the work we do at AC Transit creating bus stop signs and schedules.

From their actions alone, Occam's Razor suggests that they are phasing out the Mac and OS X no matter what they say. The writing is on the wall. That being said, Applescript is one of the main reasons I own a Mac. I have written hundreds of scripts to make my life easier. Two I would pick to highlight are a Software Marketing and Tracking System and a Dead Man Monitoring System. The Software Marketing and Tracking System uses Applescript, Filemaker, and Mail to automatically track software trials, purchases, channels of distribution, etc. Incoming emails are automatically processed to log purchases, issue serial numbers, create a customer database, and track trial installations. The whole system is driven by email arrivals and requires no manual intervention. This has saved man-years of manual effort. The Dead Man Monitoring system is described in the next post Reply Steve Cunningham  2017-01-10 16:15 (Continued from previous post) The Dead Man Monitoring system is for a paralyzed patient who cannot communicate. It guarantees that help will be summoned if someone doesn't enter the patient's room every two hours. Since I am the sole caregiver, if anything were to happen to me the patient would die of dehydration before anyone found her. The system uses a motion sensitive camera to track entrances and exits from the patient's room. When detected, the camera places a message in a folder which triggers the Monitoring script to log it and reset the Dead Man Counter. The Monitoring Script also runs automatically every two hours and, if there has been no activity, initiates a series of alarms and notifications, first locally and then to a list of external responders. A schedule for which hours are monitored during the day can be set and changed as well as the list of responders. Everything is done with Applescript. The system runs on a UPS protected Mac Mini and uses Launch Agents to monitor itself for failures.

That's kind of the point. If you can't automate tasks, then it ceases to be a computer. I have no great love of Applescript, but I do think Apple Events was a truly great innovation. My hope is that Swift will provide a way to work directly with Apple Events, without resorting to horrid workarounds. The sooner the better.

Although I am not a huge fan of AppleScript (I find the syntax annoying and at times impenetrable - I also don't like the lack of good debugging tools) I have nonetheless used it, and Automator, for years for a wide range of tasks. At present, I use a combination of AppleScript and Automator to blog from my Mac and to produce eBooks. I have scripts and folder actions that: • Post Evernote notes to my Wordpress blog (yes, I could use Postach.io, but they have been somewhat unreliable of late) - this requires some PHP in the AppleScript • Pass Evernote notes to Scrivner for eBook production • Pass images from an Evernote note back to Evernote as individual notes for posting to Instagram • Resize images for blog posts • Resize images for posting to Twitter One of the most fun scripts I had (and I found this on the Internet and adapted) automated Keynote to send out a tweet when a slide was shown.

And if you're looking at other monitors, why not other computers? Why not other phones? The walls around Apple's painstakingly constructed (and very profitable) garden are crumbling, and it won't end well. The likely demise of AppleScript and Automator are, well, another break in the wall.

I'm a photographer and one of my favorite workflows that I have created involves launching an application, called PostHaste, every time I insert a SD with fresh new photos, in my mac, this creates automatically a folder on the server that is renamed with the contents of the clipboard, previously copied from the latest event in my calendar. After this, a new Finder window is prompted to the foreground revealing the newly created folder, next to it Image Capturehas been launched allowing me to drag and drop the new photos into the new folder window. My photos then are automatically renamed by Hazel. Reply Patricia Pfitsch  2017-01-11 16:17 My husband and I run a small transcription business. Our clients are production companies who send us raw film footage they’ve taken for documentaries. We create a written transcript of the film by transcribing what they hear and see—then we we send the transcript to the client. Our clients are usually under a tight deadline so it’s crucial that we can create the transcript fast—often we need to transcribe hours of film and get the transcripts to the client within a twelve-hour period. That kind of speed depends on using AppleScript to create shortcuts for names and other words and phrases that are repeated continually in the dialogue. (You’d be amazed at how many times people say ‘you know’ in conversation.) We also use AppleScript to start and stop the film while we’re transcribing. AppleScript is the key to our success and without it we’d be out of business!

Main advantage is, XML is both the database language and the web page language. Thanks to that environment, we are able to develop enhancements and new features way faster and more freely than if we used the usual mySQL - PHP framework. A specific — yet, very simple — cgi sends the http requests to our AppleScript hub (Smile), which in turn sends the hard stuff to some osax (mainly, XMLLib.osax). A herd of Smile apps handle up to 100 requests a second (approximate — I did not measure recently). Our DIY web site system works wonderfully for 50,000+ sites maintained by 100,000+ admins.

And when I switched from my previous note manager to Evernote, I wrote an AppleScript that transferred my old notes, nicely categorized.

Reply Mark Leslie  2017-01-12 11:51 I work for a global sports apparel brand, and we could not match the speed of the marketplace without Applescript and MacOS automation technologies. Many years ago when we first implemented large automated workflows, we absorbed two successive years of +20% increases in product SKUs without the need to scale up existing production art team staffing. Not only that, but the very significant decreases in user errors (typos, component placement, file naming) reduced previously typical rework while freeing proofing efforts to be more focused on essential product details. In all aspects of our business - product creation, preparation of manufacturing visual spec documents, color management, merchandising materials / catalogs, product photography - Applescript and deep cross application connections drive our capabilities. Data from corporate data stores are piped to drive workflows and assign metadata attributes to assets. We use hot folders on servers to drive MacOS purpose built “appliances” running as asset creation engines. Assets created in this way are then transferred to other servers for delivery to another art team. With everything we have in place, and all the successes we have achieved, we still regularly discover new opportunities for automation. I can’t foresee any end to how we can harness the deep reach and power of Applescript, Apple Events, and scriptable applications.

Just about all applications work with this via "Services". I use this because I have a hard time reading because of my dyslexia. Having the computer read me the text while I follow along helps out SO MUCH! It's also so easy to setup that I've created multiple text-to-audio versions of different accents because WHY NOT! A thick Russian accent can be quite funny and make the reading better than it was originally! - Example of the text-to-audio Russian accent: http://czepeda.com/writes/123 .

Currently there are few, if any, pieces of our content that are not created, processed, or touched in some way without the automation we've developed with AppleScript. Next time you read a comic from Andrews McMeel Syndication (formerly Universal Press Syndicate/UniversalUclick) or United Features Syndicate it is there in part because of AppleScript. David Ohman Vice President of Digital Product Development Andrews McMeel Universal Reply RJay Hansen  2017-01-14 12:08 I manage a design/prepress department for a direct mail/printshop/web design company. Soon after I started I began seeing opportunities to improve the department's efficiency by writing AppleScripts to automate many tasks that are done repeatedly in the department. From simple scripts to automatically create job folder structures (use many times a day by every department member) to more complex ones that automate processes and interactions with Excel, Acrobat and InDesign. I've even written a basic imposition program for InDesign with AppleScript. These scripts save untold man-hours over the course of a year. It will be a sad day if this ability is ever removed from MacOS. Reply Joern Dyck  2017-01-14 16:43 I once had the task to open and save 5.000 videos on a remote Xserve. Because back then, QuickTime files would only play in a browser after the file was loaded completely. (Today everybody expects that the video starts to play after the first few Bytes have been loaded.) Apple provided a way to prepare old videos for this: just open the file and save it again with the QuickTime Player, unaltered. But nobody can manually open 5.000 files in the QuickTime Player and save them again. With AppleScript, you just iterate through all files in the folder, open them one by one with QuickTime Player and save them again. It's a few lines of code, and the poor Xserve would be busy for some nights. (Because AppleScript is happy to work at night). I have solved many problems like this with AppleScript. Rarely gets AppleScript the credit that it deserves. Reply Chris  2017-01-17 11:24 I provide workflow support to some non-technical artists and creative professionals. I use Automator to create a double click friendly application to execute bash scripts of multiple and sometimes confusing commands. This minimizes errors, while simplifying the process to keep the end user in control. Reply Steven McCarthy  2017-01-17 12:50 Have been using Applescript for 20+ years in Magazine Publishing and Prepress. First at Hearst Magazines then later at McCgraw-Hill, continuing to use at Bloomberg LP on such tiles as Businessweek, Markets, and Pursuits Magazines. Automated many workflows over the years that preflight InDesign layouts, update links, create press-ready PDFs, automatic FTP transfer of files, also scripts which convert and archive files into organized files and folders which adhere to strict naming conventions. I have automated workflows for our Mobile apps group where print layouts are re-purposed for mobile and online web applications. These automated workflows save hundreds if not thousands of manual work hours to the point where if for some reason a script stops working there is a cry and backlash from the staff who refuse to go back to the old manual workflows. Can't say how much AS has helped. Thanks to Sal for all he has taught and done for the AS over the years. Its hard to put into words. Reply Rick Pepper  2017-01-17 14:10 A key feature of AppleScript, which is largely overlooked or mocked, is that it's _accessible_ to non-programmers. The most overlooked feature (or failure to realize the value and necessity) of AppleScript seems to be the ability to communicate with numerous disparate applications within a single body of code to accomplish a complex task. Many prep-press technicians (pre-press primarily in the earlier days) have to "just get things done" any way they can and AppleScript EMPOWERS them to do that. We always use straight AppleScript, never use Automator. AppleScript, for me, _IS_ "Why Mac"?" - it's about being agile. If Apple kills the Mac, they';ve killed our automation. If they kill off AppleScript, they've lost future Mac sales. Much of what we wrote in the mid 90's can still be wrangled with in order to update as needed because the platform has remained stable. If Apple shifts gears on us, they've largely negated the advantages and efficiencies we've enjoyed since 1994. I work for a large commercial printer. Over the last 22 years we have used AppleScript to: 1. Construct entire print production workflows 2. Convert numerous file types to preferred file types 3. Create files for output on systems that were "not Mac compatible" 4. Automate (pre-press) near-line archive storage system retrievals (system 1) (46 GB's in the late 90's!) 5. Automate the archival of and then the retrieval of said near-line archived files (system 2) (over 50TB and counting) 6. Convert proprietarily built EPS files to more output-friendly EPS files using Illustrator 8 & "Scripz" 7. Generate web previews for a web-based print ordering system 8. Batch modify file names from digital cameras 9. Convert exported metadata (XMP files) from Lightroom to other text file formats 10. Work around bugs in Illustrator 8 by reading/altering/re-writing EPS files (late 90's) 11. Convert PMS colors in EPS files to either Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, or Black using Illustrator 8 with "Scripz" then Illustrator 9. 12. Create HTML table-based reports from various data sources 13. We were able to build an AppleScript/QuarkXPress-based automated imposition system that we used for over 10 years (late 90's) 14. Creating and populating Quark files from text files then generating several different forms of EPS and/or PS files based on output requirements, delivering them to remote servers 15. Exchange data with AS/400 via FTP with Fetch and raw text processing (2000) 16. Mount/dismount server volumes 17. Before iTunes existed, I built my digital jukebox using SoundApp and FileMaker - controlled by AppleScript 18. Automate the retrieval of, response to and attachment processing of incoming emailed orders using Entourage (since 2006-ish) 19. Automate the construction of a monthly auto trader magazine using Quark 4 and GraphicConverter, a more free-flow layout (not just dropping images in static locations) with flush-bottom columns, thousands of vehicles in less than an hour, hands-off (2000-2005) 20. Remove the necessity for pre-press operators to use the Finder to create jobs in Quark (v3 - v4) which involves creating a folder structure based on an invoice number, opening the desired Quark template (from thousands), saving it in the new folder, and updating slug lines in the document 21. Automatically check for and copy/install various files and/or folders (pre- OS X) 22. Automate the conversion of Quark files to InDesign including update fonts 23. Automate the extraction of table data from Word and data from Excel, manipulate and save as tab-delimited text files. 24. And numerous other utility scripts to manipulate, machinate and export text 25. Automated file copiers/movers based on an input control text file - part of our imposition proofing system built on-the-fly because something else in the workflow changed and we had to adapt while maintaining productivity. Reply Argyl Dickson  2017-01-17 14:44 We produce hundreds of short video files ranging from as short as 5 or 10 seconds to 5 or 6 minutes. The project architecture we put these assets in requires a .jpg file for the opening video frame and the ending video frame otherwise there is a flash during the start or end. It would sometimes take an hour or more to open up each video file and save out a still frame from the front and end of the video. So I wrote a script that we can now drop hundreds of files on and generate start and end frame .jpg files with the proper name modification and what would normally take sometimes hours is literally done in less then a minute. This is just one example of how applescript has saved me and the clients I work for hundreds of man hours through automation. Reply Carlos Ysunza  2017-01-17 15:07 We are a Photography/Graphic Design studio based in Mexico City, we are just 4 people working with 8 Macs and a very important part of our business depends entirely on AppleScript. We make a cosmetic catalog each month for one of our client, which is an international enterprise and a very important part of the process is completely automated using AppleScript. For the second biggest client, we build a complex print system combining a big data base in FileMaker, Photoshop and Epson plotters all of it is controlled 100% with AppleScrip. Of course we us AS for other no so big but time consuming projects in our every day work. Without the use of AppleScripting automation on the Mac would be impossible to do all this jobs with so little personal; for us is vital technology. Reply David Popham  2017-01-17 18:43 I use AppleScript mainly to automate InDesign and Illustrator, and the big advantage it has over JavaScript is how multiple applications can be tied together in a single script. Data from an Excel spreadsheet can be cleaned up in BBEdit then used to create a graph in Illustrator which can be placed in an InDesign document. Among the things I've done: - created more than 200 country profile sheets containing 13 tables and 13 charts - created a font management system - saved a company that I worked for from having to pay thousands of hours of labor for simply clicking a mouse (opening InDesign files and turning on/off certain layers, checking in/out files in vjoon K4) - processed thousands of Illustrator files for press - reformatted thousands of Word labels for my sister-in-law's real estate business Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:26 In my company we use AppleScripts in our own work every single day, and we often write scripts to help our customers with their various and unique problems. The time saved is enormous. A few examples: when we make appointments, my office manager clicks on the event in the calendar, then triggers a script (via DragThing) that creates emails that go to the customer and to me. The script also sends a text message to my phone. Each day, a script runs at 8:01 AM on my office manager's Mac, scanning the calendar for appointments the next business day. Emails are automatically sent to remind the customers of their appointments. The emails are all exactly as I want them-- never a mistake-- and they go out automatically. I wrote a script for a plastic surgeon. She has a form for new patients on her website. The results of the form are returned in an email. When those emails arrive, the receptionist clicks on them, then runs a script that reads the data and creates a new contact in Contacts. Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:58 The script also creates a record in FileMaker, then prints a PDF for the doctor with all of the information presented in the layout she prefers. AppleScript ties apps together, giving a real 1 + 1 = 3 effect. Mail, Calendar, Contacts, FileMaker-- and many others-- can be part of a system held together with AppleScript. I write scripts for my customers who use InDesign and they save a ton of time with them. And, they get great results. For example, a picture on a page needs a caption below. I've written a script that get the width of the picture, then makes a text box the width of the picture and offset a standard amount vertically, then sets the style of the text in that text box to "caption style" (and creates the style if it is not present). It then groups the picture and the caption box, so they can be moved without messing up their relative positions. I'm not the best AppleScripter but I'm able to write scripts that I and my customers use to great advantage. Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:59 I think of AppleScript as the Mac's "secret weapon." I love using it to make someone's life a little (or a lot) better. Reply James  2017-01-18 08:07 I use Applescript in our work environment for almost everything. From art preparation, to book creation, to ebook conversion, to file validation, to file distribution. Applescript drives our video management, MathML creation, and cover creation. The cost savings with Applescript are the sole reason my team's work has not been outsourced. The creation of chapter-level ebooks alone saves $1m a year in external costs, and is faster and more accurate than what a vendor can provide. Our Applescript driven page layout system has topped 1.2 million pages and keeps our costs well below industry rates. Simply put, without Applescript and the Apps which whole heartedly support it (like InDesign), my team's output would be a mere fraction of what it is while costing much more. Reply Olle Westbergh  2017-01-18 09:39 Oh no. We rely on Apple automation technologies a lot in our company workflows. If they are eliminated we would be forced to move from OS X to Linux or Windows… Reply Henry Domke  2017-01-18 13:57 AppleScript has been essential for automating some of the tedious parts of file preparation for my art business.

Yours truly, Henry Henry F Domke Henry Domke Fine Art Nature Art for Healthcare www.henrydomke.com Reply Larry McMunn  2017-01-18 17:08 In 1993 I bought a new product called AppleScript. I took a chance on it because it promised me — a graphic designer and artist — the ability to automate a lot of my page layout tasks without learning to program. Within two years, in 1995 I was able to partner with one of the largest mutual funds in the world to produce documents using this technology. Over the years, we added more and more financial companies to our client list producing quickly and efficiently tens of thousands of pages annually for these clients. 22 years later we are still using the core ideas and concepts developed back then. The success of our company would not have been possible without the power and flexibility of AppleScript. These documents get typeset and assembled automatically from many sources. Only the power of AppleScript will let us integrate this variety of data sources into a cohesive workflow. Some of these documents are developed from as many as 25-30 data sources. And these varied data sources come from text files, Word Docs, Excel workbooks, and a variety of databases from Filemaker to 4D to giant mainframe entities. Reply Eric Geoffroy  2017-01-19 11:53 It's the one ring that rules them all. With AppleScript I can control the Finder, web javascript, Python, bash. Many of my automated solutions use a diverse toolbox. Instead of a bunch of disconnected scripts, I am able to use AppleScript to push and pull data from these and other programming languages all controlled by a master script. Windows, Linux, and iOS do not have this. It's one of the few unique things Macs can do. Windows has copied everything else that used to make the Mac special. The time savings in automated solutions is huge. I've measured some of our old manual processes that take 2-6 hours and introduce human error. These same tasks have been reduced to 20 minutes. The ratio is 30:1 in some cases. I used to worry my company would make us use switch to PCs which would have destroyed our workflows. I fought against Microsoft Windows for years. Now I fear what Apple itself will do. Reply Rick Pepper  2017-01-19 11:54 Agreed - Apple is becoming their own worst enemy (and ours). Reply Ash  2017-01-19 17:57 A computer that can't be programmed by the end user isn't a computer, it's a toaster. I use Applescript all the time, to reorganize files, crop photos in batches, convert text files into spreadsheets and vice-versa, and to prepare text files for publication. I would hate to lose Applescript - it is the reason I love my Mac. Reply alldritt  2017-01-19 18:01 As the developer of Script Debugger (AppleScript editor/debugger), I have a mountain of automations for my business. I have build automations which compile Script Debugger, collect release notes from our bug tracker, manage software versioning and perform software uploads. As a one-man shop, I need these things to be done quickly and correctly. Back when I did this by hand, there were always errors. I have bug tracking automations that process crash reports and customer support emails in various ways. I have email marketing automations. The list goes on and on. Automation makes it possible for a tiny organization like mine to accomplish what it does. At a personal level, I have many automations for day-to-day life. For instance, my local library sends email confirmations when I borrow books, CDs and DVDs. I have an AppleScript to process these emails and create Reminders for when each item is due back to the library.

With not even a high-school education I quit my job delivering candy, bought a used Mac II for $2,435, and called myself a Mac Consultant. Within a few short years I was using AppleScript for automating workflows for NYT, Fidelity Investments, Reuters and other large clients. I was not merely improving workflows, I was creating products that could not exist without automation. For example, the financial page and weather charts in the daily NYT paper, which are still being generated daily using my AppleScripts to this very day. Reply Mark  2017-01-23 08:08 I'm not a developer, I work in feature film post production. Since our projects are highly sensitive, all video shared across departments has to be heavily watermarked & individually marked per the recipient. This can be done inside Media Composer, but its clunky, slow, relatively manual & ties up the editing system. I was able to learn & write an AppleScript application which takes Quicktime files & creates FFmpeg commands to convert them to our required formats along with multiple burnins - names, dates, timecode's, even cutting off frame handles using filename data. Many variables are automatically read from the source files. AppleScript then formats all this data for the FFmpeg filters. Drop Quicktime files, choose presets, press encode. The formatted FFmpeg 'jobs' are split into batches and sent to the Terminal for batch processing. All this happens in the background, film editing work continues. The time savings are enormous. Hours per day. AppleScript is indispensable for us. Reply Apta  2017-01-23 23:50 I use an AppleScript for the Mail app to automatically grab the raw source of spam messages and send an email reporting the spam to Spamcop. It's very tedious to do that manually and, when there is so much junk mail to report every day, I would give up if it weren't for AppleScript. Reply Ray Robertson   2017-01-24 10:12 Part I: Above, several of my clients and AppleScript Pro alumni have described very cool automated solutions. So I’m discussing Mac automation in general… Like many others, I got my first computer because I wanted to avoid dull, repetitive, manual tasks. Then I realized that although I was accomplishing more on a Mac at work I was still repeating many manual steps every day. The market demands that commercial software must appeal to tens of thousands of users in order to be successful. Consequently, no software does exactly what we need for our own work. To move beyond that, I started making shortcuts with macro utilities to drive the UI, but otherwise my only choice would have been to become a full-fledged programmer and write my own apps from scratch. Reply Ray Robertson   2017-01-24 10:12 Part II: Mac automation technologies like AppleScript and Automator provide a “middle way” solution which bridges that gap. I can customize existing applications to do exactly what I need to get done, without creating an entire program from the ground up. AppleScript’s English-like syntax and Automator’s puzzle-piece interface are often derided by traditional programmers. But it is a great solution for people working in deadline-driven production environments, where a user may only be able to focus on automation a few hours a month. In the publishing world, the automation potential is huge. Often a six-week process can be reduced to a couple of days. Companies really need these types of customized solutions, and Mac automation is often the only answer. App extensions must, again, appeal to thousands of users, and while saving some time they end up requiring users to go through the same manual steps every day. Reply Ray Robertson   2017-01-24 10:12 Part III: We must also remember that AppleScript in the hands of an experience script is a rapid development environment. One of my first clients had an IT staff of 40 people, with one group dedicated to text automation and another dedicated to images. Using a Windows platform, major new automation implementations would typically take six months, but not be able provide full automation. Enter AppleScript, where my development would typically take two weeks and be crucial to the workflow. And fixing last-minute problems where other technologies fell short? Typically a day or two. We need these automation technologies to continue because they remain a major advantage to the Mac platform, saving companies huge amounts of money every year, and making the lives of so many users much less tedious. ### Reply Anon  2017-01-24 10:28 I work as a developer on macOS for a large, multinational packaging design company. Amongst other things, I write AppleScripts to automate the laborious parts of the work. When I automate something, I estimate how much time we save per use, then log every use in a database. Its then relatively simple to calculate how much was saved by each app every year. Last year AppleScript based solutions saved us well over £100k. And that's quite puny compared to my old employers' stats. The fact that we can do this is what keeps up buying Macs. If we couldn't, then Windows would start looking like an attractive option to some. As it is, we can say, "Hey! Don't go to Windows or you'll lose £100k plus a year!". Pretty persuasive. I know AppleScript has some pretty big flaws. If you have to get rid of it then so be it, but only if its replaced by something better. Reply Hank Roberts  2017-01-24 16:20 I asked at NASA how to download the full earth imagery from DSCOVR http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/ and one of the scientists there sent me an Automator script I can run that goes to their archive and collects new pictures.

A couple of our main products are built around our template editor which enables customers to drag n drop images and edit text fields. These changes are transmitted to a Mac running InDesign. A PHP routine updates the IDML and invokes an AppleScript routine that causes InDesign to render the changes and output an updated PDF. This PDF is converted to a JPG which the customer views in their browser. All the complexity of InDesign is hidden from them. All they worry about are their images and text. We can make the templates as complicated as desired and at the end, the customers get exactly the marketing materials they want (the PDF). All because Mac applications have a programmable API. Reply has  2017-01-25 07:45 @Ray Robertson III: [abr] "Using Windows, major new automation implementations would take six months but not provide full automation." That's an endemic cultural problem, not a technological one. Teams of programmers who only know how to program run by managers who only know how to manage. They know nothing of the problem domain and have no interest in learning, yet assert their skill at Teh Codez qualifies them to solve problems in that domain despite repeated failures. I'll take a talented, ambitious artworker—the REAL domain expert—and teach her how to code any day, than try to convince the bureaucratic deadweights of your average corporate development team to change their ways. The former is highly motivated to raise her game; the latter to protecting its turf and resisting change or loss of control. It's not about Mac vs Windows, it's about users vs entrenched interests. And in that respect AppleScript is just as isolated and indifferent to the other 99% as Real Programming is. Reply has  2017-01-25 08:40 Mac Automation is already a FAILED PRODUCT and Apple knows this. They're a $½Tn global business serving ½Tn customers; it has no interest in 10000-user products and kills even successful ones (Xserve, Aperture, etc) with zero remorse. Automation as we know it is already dead—it just hasn't stopped twitching yet: what Apple needs now is a user interaction model that serves the other 99% too. Mac Automation's true value to Apple now is the vast unique insights it offers in shaping what comes next; learning from its failures as much as its successes. Today's QUERY-driven Apple Event Object Model ("scriptable app" interfaces) may be flawed; but imagine a worthy successor as THE cornerstone of our future QUERY-driven Siri world. AppleScript's Pascal semantics and syntactic fakery is a convoluted horror, but issuing simple human readable AND writable AND touchable AND speakable COMMANDS is the next UI/UX Revolution just waiting to happen. Let us teach Apple to see this too.

Creating word documents with 100+ images is a real timesaver (considering doing this by hand). Also, we keep record of customer data (name, address and some dates), which will be used to fill into the Word documents and mail messages. This way, a lot of errors are eliminated, and we use this info for the billing process too. Besides AppleScript (8000+ lines of code) we integrate python code and a Postgres database.

Companies insist on renewable energy for reasons of social responsibility – clean energy promotes healthy communities through clean air and water, and does not contribute to climate change through carbon pollution – and because of low energy costs, Steve Hill, director of Governor Brian Sandoval’s Office of Economic Development, told the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. “We have developed a brand that matters to those companies,” Hill told the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. Lack of access to clean energy “can be one of the few things that is a deal breaker” in bringing investment to Nevada. Data centers, electric car, battery producers and other innovative companies–like the Tesla Gigafactory–expect access to clean energy. Also Wednesday, Nevada clean energy advocates applauded an announcement that NV Energy, the state’s largest electric utility, and Apple have reached an agreement to build a solar plant to supply Apple’s renewable energy needs at its Reno data center. NV Energy said the 200-megawatt project will add “hundreds of jobs” and increase the 1,900 megawatts of clean renewable power already produced for the utility’s customers, NV Energy said in a statement. Advocates for clean energy applauded the agreement. “Coming soon after Governor Sandoval’s State of the State address, in which he extolled the benefits that the clean energy economy has brought to our state, this announcement emphasizes that Nevada’s economic future is paved with clean energy,” said Andy Maggi, director of the Nevada Conservation League. “The agreement with Apple makes it clear that companies want to locate where they have access to clean energy. Legislators and the Governor now can make it clear that our state is the place where they can meet their clean energy goals with policies that will grow access to and generation of clean energy in Nevada.” “We are excited about today’s announcement and the opportunity to bring new clean energy jobs to Nevada,” agreed Annette Magnus, executive director of Battle Born Progress. “We must continue to find opportunities to boost our clean energy economy and make our state a leader again for renewable energy.” “Clean Energy Project applauds continued collaborative communication between the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada and the Governor’s Office of Economic Development to ensure policy and regulatory alignment to fulfill Governor Sandoval’s vision for a new Nevada,” Jennifer Taylor, executive director of Clean Energy Project. “CEP is encouraged by PUCN Chairman Joe Reynolds and Director Steve Hill’s assertion energy policy, economic development and economic diversification, are interrelated and linked as we move into a legislative session highlighting a number of energy issues. As Director Hill noted, and CEP has historically contended, many industry sectors, and companies on the cutting edge of technology and manufacturing, will not look to relocate to states where there is not a direct path to clean energy. “CEP looks forward to continued work with its business network to support GOED and the Governor’s Office of Energy to realize the Governor’s vision of a new Nevada,” she said. RenewNV is a partnership of organizations working to build and enhance Nevada’s clean energy economy.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Apple Watch to Cause Minimum Distractions When in Theaters, Thanks to Upcoming Update January 28, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Tumblr is Finally Letting Users Adorn Their Creations with Filters and Stickers Asus’ Raspberry Pi Rival Comes Better Equipped with Power Apple Watch comes with the perky feature of waking the screen when lifted. But that can be quite distractive sometimes, especially when in theaters or churches and raising your arms not intending to wake up your Apple Watch. Thankfully, Apple is addressing that issue with its latest watchOS update. According to Apple’s developer guide, Version 3.2 of watchOS will be adding a new ‘Theater Mode’ to keep your Apple Watch silent even if raising your wrist. The smartwatch will not just have its display turned off, but it will also cancel out all notification tones when the ‘Theater Mode’ is activated. The notification alerts will not be entirely turned off either, as Apple Watch will still alert you of the notifications via haptic feedback. This is different to the Theater Mode in Android Wear that was introduced with v5.0. In the Android ecosystem, Theater Mode was used to completely turn off the display and notifications including vibrations. But the process of waking up the screen is almost the same. Users will either have to tap the screen or press the digital crown in order to access the notification or turn on the screen. Apart from Theater Mode, Apple will also be adding SiriKit, making the Siri services more accessible to apps and other services. Apps will be able to access Siri without relying on the iPhone. This should make Siri more integrated with further bunch of apps in Apple Watch. The support for SiriKit will cover various apps and services including those for messaging, payments, ride sharing, calls, photo searches etc. Apple hasn’t mentioned when the new update will be coming out. There’s also no word on when the developer preview versions will be rolled out.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

We expect Apple to keep innovating, coming up with new designs for its products and more. What we didn’t expect is for Apple to come up with a design for…wait for it…a vaporiser! The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published an application that describes what can only be a vaporiser. The Verge reports that the device can “regulate temperature” and release heat from a “substance within a canister”. We have no idea why Apple is designing a vapouriser, but people seem to think that it might have something to do with Apple’s plans for its upcoming Apple car project. The Verge does suggest the possibility that the device could be used as a vape (an electronic cigarette) or even as the basis for some sort of 3D/holographic display. As with most technology patents these days, it’s unlikely that this one will ever see the day. Even if it will, it’ll be years before it’s even out in the market.

 Microsoft says its attack on Apple's Mac business is working Matt Weinberger Jan. 26, 2017, 7:03 PM 13,462 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft Surface BookMelia Robinson/Business Insider Windows PCs are starting to chip away at Apple's dominance of the high-end computer market, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said on an earnings call Thursday. Overall, Microsoft's business of licensing Windows out to PC manufacturers was up 5% last quarter, Hood says, accounting for both business and consumer PCs. Breaking that down, Hood said that Microsoft's business of licensing Windows for the "non-pro" (as in, consumer) market had its own 5% growth last quarter, beating the overall shrinkage of the PC industry, "as our partner ecosystem continued to see growth and share gains in the Windows premium device category."  Microsoft defines "premium devices" as computers that are in the $900-plus price range. That segment has long been Apple's strongest market, with its popular iMac and MacBook lines commanding luxury prices for what the company pitches as a more user-friendly computing experience.  Meanwhile, many of Microsoft's PC partners spent the last several years focusing on low- to medium-priced computers, sacrificing Apple's philosophy of high margins and instead trying to make it up in volume. Meanwhile, Apple entrenched its position as the computer manufacturer of choice for the discerning power user. But when Microsoft launched its Surface Book laptop back in the fall of 2015, the company explicitly declared that those days were over, pitching it as a more powerful and versatile alternative to Apple's flagship MacBook Pro. The intention, Microsoft said, was to prove to the PC manufacturers that there was room in the market for high-end Windows machines.Microsoft CFO Amy HoodStephen Brashear/Getty Images At the same time, the growing market for laptop/tablet hybrids like the Surface Pro 4, and the slow rise of virtual reality headsets like Facebook's Oculus Rift — which requires a powerful gaming PC for the best results — are driving demand for higher-end Windows machines. And Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and HP are increasingly making those PCs. More recently, Microsoft introduced the Surface Studio PC, a unique blend of tablet and desktop computer, competing with the Apple iMac. And while the Surface Studio isn't cheap, starting at $2,999, it's reported to be selling better than even Microsoft's most optimistic projections. Combine that with the fact that Microsoft had previously said that disappointment in the newest line of MacBook Pro laptops drove people towards the Surface this last holiday season, and you start to see how Microsoft's attack on Apple might be working.

It has 62 percent market share among devices that cost more than $450, the figure used to denote the premium space, according to data presented by market research company Counterpoint. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said iPhone sales in India had increased by 50 percent, adding he believes Apple is, “just kind of scratching the surface there.” India is expected to become the second largest smartphone market in the world this year, overtaking the U.S., and catching up with China. Apple’s sales have apparently reached 2.5 million over the past year, with the iPhone 7 apparently proving surprisingly popular. More: Everything we think we know about the iPhone 8 Why surprisingly? Because it’s very expensive, and 70 percent of the smartphones purchased in India cost less than $150. Apple continues to sell the iPhone 5S and iPhone SE, along with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, in India through retail partners, ensuring its smartphones are available in as a wide price range as possible. However, Apple’s market share in India is still less than 3 percent, according to data released in mid-2016. This means it has to make do with holding tenth place in the overall market share in India, way behind market leader Samsung, which has 25 percent market share. Although Samsung is at the top of the charts right now, it is also facing considerable competition from Chinese brands. During the last three months of 2016, Vivo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, and Oppo took hold of the next four positions behind Samsung. Compared to the same period in 2015, market share in India controlled by Chinese smartphone brands has risen 65 percent. Tim Cook made positive statements about Apple’s position in India throughout 2016, and struck important deals with local providers to solve 4G connectivity problems, which had slowed smartphone adoption. While this will assist in Apple’s quest to become more than a niche brand in India, it may not be enough to match the huge growth of Android-based smartphones provided by Chinese manufacturers in India.

Yet Amazon.com's surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple and Alphabet's Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the "connected home" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the centre of customers'lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. "When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet," said Mr Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mr Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokesman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. "The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month," she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple's system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an US$0.50 (S$0.71) to US$2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known Star Wars toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. "They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not certified," said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. "They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing," said Mr Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. "We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid." AMAZON'S "OPEN" APPROACH Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the "Works with Alexa" label -which isn't required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon's website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the "Works with Alexa" label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you're outside the house.) "It also makes for a better user experience," notes Mr Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. "You'll experience some latency if you're always having to bounce off the cloud" as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget's companion app first, set up the device, then add a "skill" to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the US. "If that experience isn't good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad," said Mr John Neilson, the company's chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokesman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. "The danger I see for Apple and the home is they're assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare," said Mr Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ.

It goes without saying that this is an impressive number. Furthermore, with so many downloads and such a high rating, it is safe to say that this app is nothing short of great. To explain, 4Shared is basically a huge database in which everything, all files, are shared by its users. It may not be specifically designed for free music, but it certainly has large amounts of free music for you to download. Along with millions of music files, you can also share and download video files, images, and whatever other media which the app supports.

Everyone has at least heard of Spotify, and millions of people across the globe use it as their go-to software for free music. The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. spotify I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists. All things considered, this popular radio-streaming giant offers an incredible amount of free music. There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

It seems like it has compatible with all the versions. YouTube Music We all know YouTube. This app, however, is a tiny bit different to the great website. With this app, you get “A YouTube built just for music”. Basically, this form of YouTube cuts out the non-music videos, leaving you with only the music. There are ads just like the actual website, but it’s worth the short ads to use this great app. With this app you can also create personalised stations which will adapt to your likes over time.

Furthermore, you can listen to your music offline. Basically, with Napster, you can listen to your favourite playlist when travelling to work, without being interrupted by ads. Finally, the Napster app at the moment has been downloaded around 70,000 times. All things considered, although Napster is back in a new way, it still greatly delivers like its old ways.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. ROCK MY RUN Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Gaana: Music & Radio Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’..

Stingray offers the basics of any other great free music streaming app. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website.

This is a very broad question which may require a lengthy answer. In its simplest form, a download is a file which has been shared from another computer to your own computer (or device). Like giving an item to another person, a download is essentially like a computer giving an item to another computer. Files come in many forms. Some files are as tiny as a few bytes, whereas some are as huge as a few gigabytes. There are also dozens of different music file types, such as: mp3, mp4, wma, ogg, mpeg-1, wav, and more – all of which correspond to or are usable within different software programmes. For example, mp3 is perhaps the most common file type for music downloads. Mp3 files can be used in almost any music playing software programme, like iTunes or Windows Media Player. On the other hand, a file type like WMA is more common to music playing programmes like Windows Media Player. Conclusion That concludes the heaps of great apps for free music downloads.

The Daily Express claimed that with the Watch Series 2, it is finally time to buy a smartwatch. “The Apple Watch 2 is finally here bringing a host of new features and improvements to the world’s most popular smartwatch and this is why you should finally consider buying one,” says critic David Snelling, who adds that the water-resistant design and GPS make it ideal for fitness fans. There have been a lot of naysayers who changed their minds once Apple updated its signature smartwatch. Chance Miller from 9to5Mac is one of those people. “As I explained back in September, a few things about Apple Watch Series 2 were immediate improvements over the original model. This included software features such as Auto Unlock, Apple Pay, Scribble, Activity Sharing and more, as well as design factors like the cheaper price options of the Space Black model. After four months with the device, it’s those features plus more that have won me over.” Miller adds that even though features like Auto Unlock and Apple Pay have become less important with the new MacBook Pro, he hasn’t stopped wearing it every day. Luckily for Miller and other Watch owners, Apple is going to soon release an update to make the Watch even more useful. The Verge has the news. Theater Mode on the Apple Watch will allow you to peacefully watch movies or plays. [Image by Daryl Deino] “Apple is planning on adding a new Theater Mode to the Apple Watch in the upcoming watchOS 3.2 update. According to Apple’s developer guide, Theater Mode easily allows users to mute sound and disable waking the screen when raising your wrist, making it ideal for those looking to avoid interrupting fellow theatergoers at a movie or play.” The article adds that notifications will still arrive on the Watch with haptic feedback. These notifications can be viewed by pressing the digital crown or tapping the screen when they arrive. In addition, Apple is adding SiriKit to watchOS 3.2. This will allow developers to make services in their applications accessible through Siri. Apple Watch owners who commented after a similar article on Mac Rumors are happy. “This makes perfect sense. I was watching La La Land the other day and my watch kept lighting up when I moved my wrist. The name definitely reflects what it would be used for,” says CCrunner_tj. “Makes a lot of sense really. I already use a ‘cinema face’ which is just the modular face in red with no complications as a compromise, but this would be a better solution,” says Cambookpro. In even better news for Apple Watch users, Mashable notes that Apple may soon let you talk to Siri in order to use your apps. Siri on the Apple Watch will soon be a lot more useful. [Image by Daryl Deino] “The next version of Apple Watch’s software will let you talk to Siri via your smartwatch in order to interact with third-party applications, according to new developer documentation from Apple released on Tuesday. This will let you do things like order an Uber, send a message through a chat application, make a payment, and more.” There is no doubt that the Apple Watch is becoming a more respected device, but it’s still not the mainstream hit that it was expected to be. Many thought the Watch would affect the industry like the iPod, iPhone, or even iPad. However, that just didn’t happen. To be fair, there isn’t any company who has been ultra-successful with any smartwatch. Do you own an Apple Watch? What are your thoughts on Apple’s smartwatch? Let us know in the comments section.

Yet its latest application puts even those strange ideas to shame. Apple just filed a patent for a vaporiser. The patent, filed in July and published yesterday, describes a "sublimator/vaporizer", and was first noticed by Digital Trends. It carries both Apple's name and that of company engineer and senior manager Tetsuya Ishikawa. Ishikawa has a history of filing patents related to heat creation and management, so a chamber for vaping as-yet-unknown materials seems right up his alley. The patent documents describe a chamber that uses a heated plate to slowly compact the material being vaporised. This could potentially solve a problem with the bowls of many popular vapes today: If your bowl is packed incorrectly, you wind up with uneven heating and a lot of wasted, unvaped material that necessitates a quick stir midway through a smoke session. It isn't clear from the filing what substance is actually intended to be vaporised in the device. (It could, for example, be used in certain industrial and medical settings.) At the moment, however, the most common vaporisers in Apple's wheelhouse — the consumer electronic market — are recreational vapes. While we have no idea what Apple intends to do with its vaporiser — and it's well worth noting that this is just a patent, and may never see the light of day — California, where the documents were filed, legalised recreational marijuana use last year. There is, at least, some history, at least, with other kinds of vapes: Firefly was developed in part by a former Apple employee. We reached out to Apple to ask what they have in mind for the vape, but had not received a response at time of writing. [Digital Trends] Comments Join the discussion!

 These are the stores where the most people use their iPhone to pay Kif Leswing Jan. 25, 2017, 8:00 AM 2,527 facebook linkedin twitter email print Brick and mortar retailers with the highest percentage of Apple Pay credit card transactions. TXN New analysis suggests that drugstore Duane Reade and grocer Whole Foods have been the most successful brick-and-mortar stores at getting customers to embrace Apple Pay — a technology that allows Apple users to pay with their phone or watch. But the usage rates even at the best brick-and-mortar retailers lag behind services with popular mobile apps, according to data analysis from TXN, a consumer spending analytics app.  They found that the total number of monthly Apple Pay transactions grew by 50% year-over-year in their sample, although it still "accounts for a fairly small percent of all credit card transactions," according to the analysis.  TXN TXN derived its analysis from its research panel, which has over 3 million payment cards, according to CEO Jonathan Wolf. TXN's participants let the company essentially see their credit card statements in exchange for incentives. One TXN analyst figured out that some banks label Apple Pay transactions, so they used that to chop their data into Apple Pay and non-Apple Pay credit card transactions.  Overall, Wolf sees a "success story" based on growth for Apple Pay in this data. "If you offer a payment option while shopping on your phone, it's a real thing," he said.   "Five years ago the ability to pull my phone out of my pocket and pay did not exist." Since then, he said, "I’ve gotten faster and faster on the draw. There’s a point where it’s actually faster to pull out your phone." Apple Pay, a way to pay for goods with an iPhone or iPad, was launched in late 2014 along the iPhone 6. Since then, Apple has expanded it to the web, to Mac computers, and has signed up hundreds of banks. But Apple does not share a lot of Apple payment data. Most recently, last summer it unhelpfully said that Apple Pay has "tens of millions" of monthly users.  So the best way to get an idea of who and how people are using Apple Pay comes from analytics companies like TXN.

MacRumors has learned that reviews were never made available for the LG 5K Display in Apple's online store, though the reason for that is not clear. It could be that reviews were not activated due to the long delay between when the display was announced and when it became available for purchase. Whatever the reason behind the lack of reviews, the issue has been fixed. As of this morning, the LG 5K Display listing on Apple's website does indeed feature a "Ratings & Reviews" section. Looking back at archived web information from 2016 and early 2017 confirms that the LG 5K Display listing never displayed rating or review details, and if Apple were censoring reviews, the company also likely would have put an end to lukewarm reviews for the 4K LG UltraFine Display. The 4K display store listing has offered reviews since it became available for purchase. Because Apple didn't delete the reviews, the premise behind the original reddit post is flawed. While it's true there's been some negative feedback about the LG 5K Display on Apple's Support Communities, there was no secret censoring of information on the store page. It is not clear if Apple is looking into any of the issues that prompted the reddit post. On Apple's Support Communities, customers complain of issues with the display suddenly shutting off, flickering, or not connecting to a Mac, ports not working, sound problems, and more. The LG UltraFine 5K Display has been available for purchase since the middle of December. Apple is currently offering a limited time discount on the display, dropping the price from $1,299 to $974.

Rating: 10 Votes ralphholzmann 3 days ago at 11:27 am I purchased two of these monitors. My only (and big) gripe is that you can't rotate them vertically. Now, when I say that you can't rotate them vertically, I don't mean that the monitor base doesn't support rotation (it doesn't). I mean that in the macOS display settings, you cannot change the rotation/orientation for these external monitors. I have both of mine mounted on VESA arms that support rotation, but the macOS software won't give me the option to rotate, no matter what I do. Yes, I've tried opening settings/Display while holding option + command. Huge bummer, really wanted a long vertical monitor for code.

That's a good tip, didn't know this one, then I asked myself, would it also works on brightness, yes it does. Rating: 4 Votes Weaselboy 3 days ago at 11:39 am OMG YES!!! I thought it was only me... It is so annoying, and i can never find the perfect volume on anything. Have to play around with the system and video volume for a minute to get it right for every video i watch! Hold shift+option then hit the volume keys and it will move in 1/4 increments to help with this. [doublepost=1485373359][/doublepost] Reddit is garbage. I wouldn't trust the junk on that site for anything. There are a handful of subreddits that are pretty heavily moderated, so are a decent source for information. There is a history subreddit that is quite good. But overall, I would agree with you that for much other than funny pictures of cats, it is a mess. Rating: 4 Votes fperkins 1 day ago at 02:40 pm I was a little nervous about ordering this monitor because of some bad reviews. I got mine today, plugged it in, plugged in my tMBP 2016 via the provided USB-C cable and it all worked perfectly. No issues with flicking, buzzing, crashing, etc. I can't believe how nice the screen is though. I thought my MBP screen was crystal clear, but this thing is amazing.

There is a good reason for that because the demand for tablets isn’t as high as it used to be. All major tech manufacturers have been having a hard time lately in terms of creating bestselling tablets. Apple for example has not been so eager to produce new tablets as it used to be in the past, but rumor has it that Apple has something big scheduled for 2017. What’s interesting is that Apple hasn’t refreshed its iPad lineup for a while now and this caused for the demand for iPad devices to increase. With that being said, it’s easy to understand why Apple would want to capitalize on that and. For that reason Apple is expected to come out with two new tablets during 2017. Today we’re going to go over what we know about the upcoming iPad Pro 2, iPad Air 3. iPad Pro 2 The first model of iPad Pro arrived on the market one year ago and Apple has received good feedback from its customers. Even though Apple fans have been asking the Cupertino based tech giant to refresh its iPad Pro lineup, Apple didn’t. Recent rumors are pointing out that Apple is in fact set to launch a new iPad Pro 2 in March and this coincides with the fact that Apple has a new operating system update scheduled for March. The device is expected to come with a sleeker design which doesn’t include the classic 3.5mm audio jack and a new set of high performing hardware parts. iPad Air 3 Everyone was speculating that Apple has ended the iPad Air line but the whole tech community is speculating that Apple is actually working on designing a brand new iPad Air 3. The upcoming tablet is supposedly going to feature a slimmer design that’s going to have around 6mm of depth. Additionally, iPad Air 3 is expected to come with Apple Pencil support. Nonetheless, we should mention that Apple has yet to confirm any of these rumors as being true. All that we can do right now is to wait for March to come and see if Apple does decide to bring two new devices.

However, the game developer has also decided to drop the video game’s accessibility on the old Apple devices. According to Supercell, it will stop supporting those Apple devices that have versions lower than iOS7.x. Advertisement Supercell revealed the main intention of dropping the support for the lower version Apple devices. They recommend that the players should change their gaming systems. It wants the gamers to at least update their devices. This new rule will be applicable when Supercell releases a new update for Clash of Clans. Supercell Ask for Updating Apple Devices The game developer says that technical reasons have forced them to take this decision, reports Mobile & Apps. So, if the players want to continue playing their favorite game on mobile, they immediately must update their device. Reports suggest that lower versions of Apple devices cannot update the game to the higher version. However, there are a few lower iOs versions of Apple devices that gamers can update to higher version. Such devices include iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPad Mini 1st generation, iPhone 5, iPad 4, 3 & 2 and iPod Touch 5th generation. So, if you have an Apple device of the lower version that does not have the capacity to upgrade, you will simply have to purchase a new device of higher version.  Only then, you would be able to get access to the new update of Clash of Clans. However, this new update is not compulsory and is optional. Gaming Experience for Clash of Clans to Improve The latest Clash of Clans update will introduce new improvement that will ensure that the gaming experience improves for the best. This new update will also target the bugs and glitches troubling the smooth flow of the game. There is a possibility that Supercell might remove the existing winter theme in the game as a part of the improvement. Moreover, the developer targeted the winter theme for the Christmas of 2016. Now that it is over, Supercell would rather come up with a new storyline or theme for its updated Clash of Clans game.

Orrin Hatch, ally in iPhone fight Edward C. Baig , USA TODAY , KHOU 8:27 PM. CST January 27, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook attends a meeting of technology chiefs in the Trump Organization conference room at Trump Tower in New York, New York, USA, 14 December 2016. E   (Photo: Albin Lohr-Jones / POOL, EPA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Apple CEO Tim Cook has apparently been sharpening his political skills. Politico reported that Cook had dinner Thursday night with President Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, whom Trump appointed as a White House special advisor, at a posh Washington restaurant. Former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for the environment, policy and social initiatives, also reportedly attended the meal. On Friday, Cook met with Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who tweeted out a picture he took with Apple’s chief. The two men have a long history together. Great to see my good friend @tim_cook this morning to talk tech priorities in the 115th Congress. https://t.co/LFifHUDvuH #utpol #tech pic.twitter.com/sWCK8tY7wz— Senator Hatch Office (@SenOrrinHatch) January 27, 2017 “During today’s meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, we discussed ways to grow the economy and our tech industry, as well as his recent visit with me in Utah,” Hatch wrote in a statement emailed to USA TODAY. “Given the issues I work on as chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, it’s especially useful to listen to innovators like Tim.” Utah has been able to attract tech talent thanks to low taxes, affordable housing, and the proximity to two major colleges, the University of Utah in Salt Lake and BYU in Provo. Cook joined Hatch this past fall as the headliner on a Utah Tech Tour. The Senator sided with Apple during the encryption debate over the San Bernardino massacre where 14 people were killed, after the FBI tried to get access to the shooter’s iPhone. During an onstage appearance with Hatch, Cook said that “I realized that in some cases some people have tried to make (encryption) out to be bad. Encryption is inherently great and we would not be a safe society without it.” Cook was also among the high-profile tech CEOs that met then President-elect Trump at Trump Tower in December. Like many tech leaders, Cook is dealing with a president whose candidacy he opposed and who has threatened moves that could throw a wrench into tech's highly global business, from import taxes to more restrictive immigration policies. In comments made to employees, Cook explained his participation in the Trump Tower meeting as a way to get Apple's message across. “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage.” Cook added that “we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the substance of Cook's recent meetings.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Ready to serve: AVFPD's Solera station back in business Friday Jan 27, 2017 at 5:49 PM Jan 27, 2017 at 5:49 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — Just a few months after local voters approved a measure intended to boost public safety, Apple Valley Fire Protection District’s Solera Station No. 337 is ready to serve its community again. The station, located in the Jess Ranch area, was closed for six years due to budget cuts. But a steady increase in emergency incidents prompted the Measure A campaign last year, which passed with almost 77 percent of the total vote. While funds from the measure won’t be received until this summer, AVFPD Fire Chief Sid Hultquist said the Solera Station was opened up on part-time status thanks to some one-time funds. “We’re just happy we got the community’s support in passing the tax measure, with near to 80-percent support,” Hultquist told the Daily Press during a tour of the station Monday. “That’s why we decided to open up this station early. We know how important it is to show the community why we requested this tax.” The measure will extend a sunsetting tax voters passed in 1997. Taxpayer dollars collected are expected to be used to reduce 911 response times, improve AVFPD firefighters' ability to simultaneously respond to numerous emergencies and reopen closed fire stations, according to a previous Daily Press report. The Solera Station, which officially re-opened Jan. 19, is now staffed 40 hours a week by two full-time firefighters who came from other stations. A captain and a paramedic are also on hand to respond to any emergencies in the area. Battalion Chief James Peratt said the district closely looked at the number of medical and emergency calls received in the area before the station’s re-opening. The station is now open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, the peak hours for receiving emergency calls. Equipped with a brush patrol engine that carries 300 gallons of water, as well as a paramedic engine with advanced life support for the community’s elderly population, the station and its staff are ready to respond to any emergency incidents. “This station being open makes a huge difference,” Peratt said. “There’s a huge medical aid need in this area. It’s so busy out here that engines from other stations get pulled out over here, which takes away resources from other areas.” Station Captain Rich Unferdorfer agreed with Peratt, proudly stating that firefighters arrived within three minutes after receiving their first medical aid call last Thursday. “The patients couldn't even finish pre-arrival instructions because we got there so soon,” Unferdorfer said. The station is expected to remain on part-time status until July, when funds from Measure A will allow the AVFPD to open it full time. Plans to open a full-time station at Yucca Loma Road are also underway for the summer, and the District is actively recruiting for multiple positions to make those plans a reality. With increased staffing, the station plans on providing free public services to the community again, such as blood pressure checks. “This is exciting for us,” Hultquist said, smiling widely as he showed the Daily Press a discarded “CLOSED” sign that used to adorn the front of the Solera Station. “This is one step closer to our ultimate goal.

Operating Systems by Vanessa Hand Orellana January 27, 2017 5:11 PM PST @vanehand Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) What's new in iOS 10.3? The best new features coming to your iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch with the latest iOS update. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 2:08 Close Drag Apple has released the first public beta of its latest iOS update, giving us a glimpse of the new features coming to its iPhones, iPads and iPods. The rumored "Theater mode" is notably absent from this beta. According to several Apple rumor sites like BGR, Apple Insider and Macworld, the company was set to release a new screen mode that would dull the colors on the screen for better low-light viewing. What were some of the features that did make it into the 10.3 update? 1. Apple ID Profile There's a new profile section at the top of the settings menu with all your account information. Click on your profile to access your iCloud, iTunes, App Store and Family Sharing information in one place and scroll down to see a list of all the Apple devices linked to these accounts. You'll still need to log in to the Find my iPhone app on your phone or web browser to access them all, but it will save you from having to dig through the settings to access each account. 2. iCloud storage breakdown If you pay for extra storage on Apple's iCloud, this next one will be especially useful. You can now see exactly how you're using your iCloud storage by clicking on the iCloud option in this new profile section. Tap the graph at the top of this section to figure out exactly what the storage hogs are. This gives you a device and program-specific breakdown detailing how many gigs of storage are being used by each. If you haven't activated the two-factor authentication on your account (which you should), you'll notice a new "suggestion" section right below your profile in the main settings page. Apple may use this space to give you other suggestions to improve your device's performance, but for now this is the only suggestion that appeared on my phone. 3. Weather in Maps If you're a fan of Apple's proprietary Maps app, you will now have a glimpse of the weather wherever you go. The latest update adds a tiny weather bug to the bottom right-hand corner of the screen showing the current weather conditions in that area. For a seven-day breakdown of the weather just 3D Touch the weather bug or continue holding to open the weather app in a new screen. 4. Find my AirPods If you've splurged on a pair of AirPods, this feature will save you time and money. If not, just read ahead. Sign in to your Find my iPhone app and you should now see the AirPods as one of the devices associated with your account. Click to see the last known location of the 'Pods when they were paired with your phone or ping them to make them ring. Just make sure you're not wearing them if you want to keep your hearing intact. Apple has not disclosed the official release date for iOS 10.3, which means these features are still subject to change. And the final version of the update may still end up including the "theater mode" or any other features Apple wants to debut before WWDC in June. iOS 10.2: 6 reasons you should upgrade These are the best features in Apple's latest software update for iPhone and iPad devices, including the new TV app and 100 new emojis to chose from. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 2:22 Close Drag Share your voice 0 comments Tags Apple Operating Systems Mobile iOS 10 8 Design 8 Features 7 Sound 7 Value CNET Review Apple AirPods Long-delayed and highly ridiculed, Apple's wireless headphones are finally here -- but once you try them, you won't be laughing anymore. $222.67 See it Apple All the latest Apple news, featuring developments on the iPhone, iPad, Macbooks, OS X and much more.

Apple exceeded my expectations by not only bringing back the 4-inch form-factor but making sure that it wasn’t a complete joke. Sharing many of the same specs as the iPhone 6s, which had only been released half a year earlier, Apple made sure that the SE's compact size didn’t compromise on performance. As an added bonus, the iPhone SE was Apple’s most affordable phone yet starting at $399. Although not the cheapest phone by any means, it is when you’re talking about Apple. As I was reviewing what came out when last year (in anticipation for what we might see this year), I realized that the iPhone SE’s anniversary is just around the corner in March, which got me to thinking: Should there even be a second generation iPhone SE? In short: Yes, there absolutely should be. Apple and Sony are practically the only two big manufacturers that give a darn about compact phones that don’t perform like garbage, and although I would like more variety in the compact category, I am grateful for the two that currently exist. However, I don’t think that Apple should continue releasing the SE in the same manner that they did last year, or even give it the same name. Instead, I think the SE would be better off simply being a third addition to Apple’s typical iPhone refresh in the fall. If the iPhone SE were to be added to the fall lineup, I think it would receive larger fanfare. Anybody who wasn’t an enthusiast expected the SE to pop up, so when headlines popped up last March it was likely a surprise for most people. Additionally, I think there are a considerable amount of people now that strategically plan to upgrade in the fall according to Apple’s “normal” schedule at this point, so I would think that people would be willing to give it more consideration if it was released around the same time as other iPhones. At this point, I’m of the mind that three size offerings would be a good thing to offer. A lot of manufacturers seem to be offering two size variants lately, but even then the smaller of the two typically doesn’t fall into the “compact” category. Maybe I’m still living in the past, but in my mind, a 4.7-inch display is still pretty big. Apple could stand out by offering their 4-inch variant alongside their other two flagship iPhones. If Apple did choose to take this route, I think it would be cool if the smallest iPhone’s design would reflect that of the other two as well. I actually like the SE’s square form factor, but having a unified design would make it more appealing, especially if Apple plans to shave bezels in this year’s iPhones as rumored; just because some people prefer a smaller phone doesn’t mean they necessarily prefer a smaller screen. I guess what I’m trying to say is, if Apple intends to keep an iPhone with a 4-inch screen around, I think it makes sense to release it alongside the 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones. If nothing else, I do hope that Apple keeps the iPhone SE’s concept (compact, affordable new iPhone) around for at least one or two more generations. Readers, what are your thoughts? Do you think that Apple should keep releasing the SE in a separate event, or do you think they should incorporate it with their fall iPhone line-up? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

The organization was created to help shape the future of artificial intelligence technology in an open way. Apple joins Partnership on AI as a founding member Tom Gruber is Apple’s representative on the organization’s Board of Trustees. He co-founded Siri in 2007 and launched the company’s voice-controlled interface. The company was bought in 2010 by Apple and Siri is now part of both iOS and macOS. Mr. Gruber’s involvement in artificial intelligence goes back years. zAfter receiving his M.S. in Computer and Information Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst he served as a Research Associate, and later as Senior Project Leader for Enterprise Integration Technology, at the Knowledge Systems Laboratory of the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. Along with Mr. Gruber, Greg Corrado from Google/DeepMind, Ralf Herbrich from Amazon, Eric Horvitz from Microsoft, Yann Lecun from Facebook, and Francesca Rossi from IBM joined the Board of Trustees. The Board also includes independent non-corporate trustees from OpenAI, the American Civil Liberties Union, UC Berkley, the MacArthur Foundation, the Peterson Institute of International Economics, and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence & ASU. Apple Opens up About Artificial Intelligence Apple recently changed its closed door policy on sharing AI-related research and has already let its engineers publish their first paper. In that paper, Apple described a way to enhance object recognition for computer systems learning facial details and other objects. For Apple, more open involvement in the AI community could prove to be a big benefit for its own Siri technology. Apple is seen as falling behind in AI and voice control thanks to Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. Both are powerful and compelling voice interfaces, but they still require humans to learn how to the right words and phrases instead of letting the computer adapt and learn what we mean. Current voice control systems also lack a deep understanding of context, which makes them more difficult to interact with in a natural way. The Partnership on AI will look at those shortcomings as well as the social and personal implications of deeper computer understanding. The organization’s first meeting is set for Friday, February 3rd in San Francisco. We’ll know more about their path, as well as how other people can get involved, soon after.

John Martellaro @jmartellaro Jan 27th, 2017 6:05 PM EST | Particle Debris In a deep sense, this item is about Apple. We are biased towards Apple products for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it’s because we became enamored with an Apple II or Mac in our youth and stayed with what we learned and loved first. I see this, in a positive way, with many of my guests on my Background Mode podcast. Is it real love? Or cognitive bias? Sometimes, the technical superiority of an Apple product in an important respect earns our loyalty. It could be because the underlying UNIX (FreeBSD) of Apple products is appreciated by a technical person who’s accomplished with UNIX. It could be graceful, simple, beautiful design. It could be better overall security. It could be the customer service. Or the friendly retail stores. And yet, so much of our dialog about technical companies and products relies on hearsay and issues we don’t have direct experience with. In those cases, it’s all too easy to assume that biases founded in technical experience can be confidently extended to opinions about related technical areas. It often goes like this: We love what we know. We rationalize decisions.  If we decided not to buy brand X, brand X must be inferior. You’re In Denial. (No I’m Not!) Recently I have come across this cognitive bias issue is several different ways. The first is an introductory interview with Nobel prize winning Princeton psychologist Daniel Kahneman: “Kahneman: Your Cognitive Biases Act Like Optical Illusions.” In that article there is a nifty optical illusion that’s an analog to a cognitive bias one might form. You’ll be intrigued, I promise. Next, Michael Lewis has written a book about that very decision making process explained by Dr. Kahneman,The Undoing Project. Here’s a great introduction via Bob Cringely. “Welcome to the Post-Decision Age.” That article will also get you started. A quote: Our decision-making processes, such as they are, are based on maximizing survival not success. Early hunter-gatherers weren’t so bothered with optimization as just not being eaten. This put an emphasis on making decisions quickly. Of course, we flatter ourselves that we’ve had 10,000 years, perhaps 500 generations to get beyond rash judgments about survival, but, seriously, how much time do we really spend pondering our deepest judgments about each other and about tech? Given the time spent with work, family and Game of Thrones, do we really spend hours researching the relative merits of the companies we like and the products we select? Or how we’ll respond to a tweet. Or the decisions of government? The above resources are a real eye opener and help explain why there is so much bewilderment about why people buy the products they do and why they’re loyal to certain companies and bad-mouth others. It’s at the core of many things you read here at The Mac Observer and everywhere else. Next page: The news debris for the week of January 23rd.

Thank you. January 27, 2017 at 7:17 EST PM JustCause January 27, 2017 Love is never logical. Apple’s commercials are often emotional/musical because it bonds us to their products.

The projects will support Apple’s renewable energy needs for its Reno data center. In the coming weeks, NV Energy will file an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) to enter into a PPA for the solar power plant. The project will bring NV Energy’s total to more than 529 MW of new solar resources in construction in Nevada or under review for approval. This is in addition to the 491 MW of universal solar resources in Nevada currently serving NV Energy customers. Apple will also dedicate up to 5 MW of power to NV Energy’s future subscription solar program for residential and commercial customers. “We are proud to play a role in helping Apple meet their energy needs with Nevada’s abundant solar resource,” said Paul Caudill, president and CEO of NV Energy. “In partnership with our customers, we continue to develop a more balanced fuel mix in a way that benefits the local economy by providing hundreds of jobs for Nevadans, particularly those in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local 357 and 396, and advances the state’s policy goals.” “Investing in innovative clean energy sources is vital to Apple’s commitment to reaching, and maintaining, 100 percent renewable energy across all our operations,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives. “Our partnership with NV Energy helps assure our customers their iMessages, FaceTime video chats and Siri inquiries are powered by clean energy, and supports efforts to offer the choice of green energy to Nevada residents and businesses.” Currently, NV Energy customers are served by more than 1,900 MW of renewable resources in Nevada, including 19 geothermal energy resources, 13 solar energy facilities, six hydro plants, one large wind farm and a variety of biomass, methane and other renewable energy projects.

During Microsoft’s earnings conference call yesterday, CFO Amy Hood relayed that the company saw the cumulative sale of Windows licenses increase by 5% in the consumer market. All the more intriguing, though, is that Hood partially attributed this growth to a growing number of premium-priced PCs, a category that Microsoft defines as PCs that cost $900 or more. Don't Miss: The iPhone 7 might be losing a fight with its older brother “Our partner ecosystem continued to see growth and share gains in the Windows premium device category,” Hood said. Speaking to Microsoft’s newfound commitment towards releasing premium hardware at a premium price, the company this past fall unveiled a pricey new professional workstation, geared towards creatives, called the Surface Studio. It’s sticker price? $2,999. And if you want to fully trick it out, you can easily spend as much as $4,199 on it. Interestingly enough, Microsoft just last month published a blog post claiming that more people were switching from the Mac to the Microsoft Surface than ever before, a dynamic it partially attributed to the lukewarm reception to Apple’s revamped MacBook Pro. More people are switching from Macs to Surface than ever before. Our trade-in program for MacBooks was our best ever, and the combination of excitement for the innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro – especially among professionals – is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface, like this. It seems like a new review recommending Surface over MacBook comes out daily. This makes our team so proud, because it means we’re doing good work. Of course, we’ll have a better grasp of the hardware landscape once Apple releases its earnings report this coming Tuesday. Incidentally, Apple’s MacBook Pro may have been widely criticized by seasoned Mac users, but it’s worth noting that Phil Schiller this past November said that Apple enjoyed more online “orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before.” Trending right now: Apple’s iPhone 8 might look a lot like this The iPhone 7 might be losing a fight with its older brother Two Galaxy S8 features that will seriously annoy you See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Look at one of the most stunning iPhone 8 concept designs we’ve ever seen BGR News Get a $100 AT&T Visa® Reward Card DIRECTVSponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech Apple’s iPhone 8 might look a lot like this BGR News Just when you thought Windows Phone couldn’t get any more dead… BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File) Posted By: Gerard Taylor 28. January 2017 Denmark will become the first country in the world to appoint a digital ambassador to manage its relationship with technology giants such as Google, Apple and Microsoft. According to the Danish newspaper, Politiken, the development has become necessary because companies are now so large, both in their economic strength and the influence they have on people’s everyday lives, that they surpass many of the countries where Denmark has its traditional embassies. ‘These companies have become a form of ‘new nation’, and we have to deal with that’, said Anders Samuelsen of the Liberal Alliance party. Apple and Google are almost large enough to enter the club of the world’s top 20 major economies, the so-called ‘G20’, if they were nations. ‘We will, of course, stick to the old way of thinking, where we protect our relations with other countries. But we are bound to have close relationships with some of the companies that affect us’, said the Foreign Minister. This is not a new development, as the world already saw the rise and fall of the British East India Company between 1600 and 1874, and the Dutch West India Company between 1602 and 1674.   Source: NTB scanpix / Norway Today Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Related SHARE TWEET PIN SHARE Previous post Related Articles News Woman and daughters found dead in freezer in Denmark Finance Elkjøp increases its number of stores in Denmark News Pregnant woman killed in park in Denmark News Norwegian teenager abused in Denmark Be the first to comment on "Denmark to appoint world’s first ‘digital ambassador’" Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Hatch & Dept of Veterans Affairs, dinner w/ Jared Kushner & Ivanka Trump Chance Miller - Jan. 28th 2017 12:09 am PT @ChanceHMiller Tim Cook View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Tim Cook has held a pair of notable meetings in Washington D.C. this week according to reports. First, BuzzFeed News reports that Cook met with Senator Orrin Hatch on Capitol Hill, while Politico reports that he also went to dinner with Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Apple VP of environment, policy, and social initiatives Lisa Jackson was also in attendance at the dinner. Cook’s meeting with Senator Hatch, a republican from Utah, is the latest evidence of strong connection between the two. Last year, Cook held a sit-down interview with Hatch, discussing a wide-range of privacy and security topics. Hatch sits on the Judiciary Committee and antitrust panel, while he also leads the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Hatch stated that his meeting with Cook focused on ways to grow the economy and tech industry. More specific details are unclear at this point. “During today’s meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, we discussed ways to grow the economy and our tech industry, as well as his recent visit with me in Utah,” Sen. Hatch said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Given the issues I work on as chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, it’s especially useful to listen to innovators like Tim.” According to the same report, Cook met with the leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs this week to discuss ways Apple could help veterans, such as with increased hiring and promotion. Finally, Politico reports that Cook and Lisa Jackson went to dinner with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, both of whom have instrumental roles in the new Trump administration. Kushner, who was often referred to as President Trump’s right-hand man during the campaign, is a Senior White House Advisor in the new administration. At this point, it’s unclear what was discussed at that dinner. While politics are presumed to have played a role, it’s possible it was more of a friendly dinner than a business one. Lisa Jackson served in the Obama administration as the EPA head form 2009 to 2013, while she also sits on the board of the Clinton foundation. Tim Cook making the rounds in Washington is nothing to be too surprised about and will likely continue to occur as we move forward. In December, Cook attended a meeting of tech leaders with Donald Trump, discussing manufacturing, job creation, China, and more.

GoogleÕs head-on rival to the iPhone, the Pixel, is off to a modest but promising start. It is Google's first step in what it says will be a years-long effort to take on Apple where itÕs strongest. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. SAN FRANCISCO — The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start — but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. “This was probably a really good learning experience for them,” says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Doshi estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period. Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 phones that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. “Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success,” says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. “It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung,” says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.3 Will Automatically Upgrade Your iOS Device’s File System To APFS By Ali Salman Jan 25, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple’s release of macOS Sierra last year marked the debut of a new file system named APFS (Apple File System). The new format is oriented towards solid storage drives that greatly focuses on data integrity and encryption. However, APFS support in macOS Sierra is very young and limited, nonetheless, the company is expected to make the file format default as soon as the next version of the operating system arrives. Yesterday, Apple released the iOS 10.3 beta and by the look of it, Apple is pushing the APFS file system earlier than what we expected. Let’s see some more details on the matter. iOS 10.3 Beta Introduces APFS File System For iOS Devices iOS 10.3 beta 3 brings a boatload of new internal and visual variations. As the company notes, the release of iOS 10.3 will upgrade iOS device’s file system to APFS. To be precise, the change will be implemented on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch as well as the fourth generation Apple TV. The best part is that the new file system will convert the file system while still preserving the existing data stored on your iOS device. However, Apple still recommends that users should create a backup of their device before they decide to update to the latest iOS firmware. When you update to iOS 10.3, your iOS device will update its file system to Apple File System (APFS). This conversion preserves existing data on your device. However, as with any software update, it is recommended that you create a backup of your device before updating. While iOS 10.3 beta brings quite a handful of new additions, the conversion of file system to APFS is definitely worth seeing. This is because, at this point in time, we are not sure if the conversion will have any direct impact on the iOS device’s performance. In addition to this, we’re also glad to see that Apple introduced the file system conversion to be part of iOS 10 and not wait for the next iOS release. Advertisement In contrast to this, the APFS file sytem was first introduced in the macOS Sierra last year. Moreover, the release notes of macOS Sierra 10.12.4 does not highlight that the update will aid in converting HDDs file system to the new file system format, APFS. We will probably receive more updates in the forthcoming iOS 10.3 beta firmware, so be sure to stay tuned for that.

A message full of smiley faces, hearts and kisses can reportedly crash a smartphone. The cruel trick can be used on any iPad or iPhone running iOS 10. It reportedly exploits a bug in the software that causes the Apple gadget to crash. There are two ways to send the bug - both of which were pointed out by YouTuber EverythingApplePro. Read More Pokemon Go Gen 2: Everything you need to know about the update from Niantic - from Legendary to new characters The first involves sending a message that includes the white flag emoji, a zero and then a rainbow emoji along with a hidden character called a variation selector. When received, the iPhone's software attempts to combine the emojis, fails, and the messaging app crashes. In some cases, a user's physical buttons and touchscreen will freeze as well. The second method involves using the same characters, but saving them as a contact file and then sharing it to an iMessage contact across iCloud. A man using his iPhone Read More Revealed: The 10 passwords MOST vulnerable to hacking Composing the message on an iPhone can cause it to crash, so dedicated pranksters may have to resort to iMessage on a desktop computer to send it onwards. There doesn't appear to be any way to stop the prank besides pre-emptively blocking whoever might want to send it to you. If you find yourself the victim of the prank, you'll need to reboot your iPhone or iPad to get it working again. This is the latest bug to hit iOS and anyone unlucky enough to be hit by it will no doubt be hoping Apple releases a patch quickly to plug the hole.

Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Google-owned British AI firm DeepMind last year established the non-profit organization, called “Partnership on AI,” which will have its inaugural board meeting in San Francisco on February 3. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Apple “has been involved and collaborating with the partnership since before it was first announced and is thrilled to formalize its membership,” the alliance said in an online post. Major technology firms joined forces in the group, with stated aims including cooperation on “best practices” for AI and using the technology “to benefit people and society.” Creation of the group came amid concerns that new artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. The companies “will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology,” according to a statement. Internet giants have been investing heavily in creating software to help machines think more like people, ideally acting as virtual assistants who get to know users and perhaps even anticipate needs. SpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk in 2015 took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them. Read: As regulators waver, Apple takes on Qualcomm in courts Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation. A concern expressed by Musk was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilization as a whole.

Asit Ranjan Mishra Cupertino-based Apple had earlier sought and failed to receive a waiver from the government on local sourcing norms for its branded stores in India. Photo: Reuters New Delhi: Apple Inc. on Wednesday made a detailed presentation to an inter-ministerial group about its plans to manufacture iPhones in India but insisted on easier import rules and sought long-term fiscal concessions as pre-conditions for expanding its operations in the country. A government official present at the meeting said the presentation was made to officials from the departments of electronics, revenue, environment and commerce and industry. “No decision has been taken yet. The electronics and revenue departments have been asked to submit their responses on the demands of Apple, after which a decision will be taken,” the official said, requesting anonymity. The Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed government official as saying “it’s almost a done deal” and adding that many of the things sought by Apple are “workable”. Mint couldn’t independently confirm this. WSJ also quoted a second government official on the nature of the incentives sought by Apple—a 15 year tax holiday on the import of components. Apple executives, including global vice-president (iPhone operations) Priya Balasubramanian, met commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday. “We have been working hard to develop our operations in India. We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we have had with the government about further expanding our local operations,” an Apple spokesperson said in an e-mail. The Times of India reported on 30 December that Apple planned to make iPhones for the Indian market in Bengaluru through Wistron Corp., a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer which is setting up a facility in Peenya, the city’s industrial hub. Cupertino-based Apple had earlier sought and failed to receive a waiver from the government on local sourcing norms for its branded stores in India. Apple’s sales in India crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2015, according to results filed with the registrar of companies. Still, Apple has a minuscule market share of under 2% in India’s smartphone market, compared with South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, the leader in India’s smartphone market, which has a share of 21%.

It is understood that the company’s Brussels-based Global Head of Transfer Pricing, Isabel Verlinden, is involved with the case. The consultancy giant netted a €327,000 payment in 2015 and €268,343 the following year. By the end of last year, €1.85m had been spent by the State on the case since 2014, with the costs shared between the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Attorney General’s Office and the Chief State Solicitor’s Office.  Ireland has challenged the EU ruling that Apple owes Ireland €13bn in back taxes and has appealed it to the European courts. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is due to address the Oireachtas Finance Committee on Apple next week, as is Finance Minister Michael Noonan and the chair of the Revenue Commissioners. “Over the past three years, approximately €1.85m has been paid in total, including VAT,” The minister, Mr Noonan said, in response to a parliamentary question from Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty. “This includes all legal costs, consultancy fees and other associated costs.” The bulk of the payments have been made to barristers, with UK barrister Philip Baker QC  netting the most. He has been paid €267,470. He earned about €49,000 in 2014, almost €152,000 in 2015 and €66,525 last year. The Government has accused the European Commission of interfering with Ireland’s tax sovereignty and has exceeded its powers in ordering the technology giant to pay €13bn in taxes to the Exchequer. The Government said that the commission has attempted to “re-write the Irish corporation tax rules” in making its decision. Mr Noonan has already insisted that the California tech giant was not given any sweetheart tax deals when it opened its base in Cork in 1980. Apple has also denied any such arrangements are in place at present, or that they existed in the past. Mr Cook declined an invitation to appear before the OIreachtas Finance Committee. That decision was met with disappointment and anger among TDs. Apple executive Claire Twaites wrote to the Finance Committee to tell them Mr Cook would be declining the invitation. She said the European decision is “a complex and challenging issue, and one on which we are receiving ongoing legal counsel”. Ms Vestager is due to appear before the committee on Tuesday, while Mr Noonan will appear on Thursday. Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly set to move its international iTunes business to Cork from Luxembourg on February 5, according to the AppleInsider website. The international iTunes office has been located in Luxembourg since 2004. Apple received planning permission last August for an expansion at its European HQ in Cork that was to deliver 1,000 jobs. An Bord Pleanála gave the expansion plan the go ahead after dismissing an appeal against the development by local residents.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple releases macOS Sierra 10.12.3 update Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, January 24th, 2017, 05:56 Category: macOS, News, Sierra, Software, Touch Bar It’s not a huge update, but it might help out a bit. On Monday, Apple released macOS Sierra 10.12.3, the newest version of its macOS 10.12 operating system. The update, which weighs in as a 1.05 gigabyte download via the App Store, adds the following fixes and changes: – Improves automatic graphics switching on MacBook Pro (15-inch, October 2016). – Resolves graphics issues while encoding Adobe Premiere Pro projects on MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13- and 15-inch, October 2016). – Fixes an issue that prevented the searching of scanned PDF documents in Preview. Apple hasn’t specified too many other changes with the update, so it’s sort of a question of installing it and seeing how it behaves. If anyone out there’s installed and played with macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and has any feedback to offer, please let us know in the comments.

No, affairs just cause misery...  By Amanda Platell for The Daily Mail Published: 20:43 EST, 27 January 2017 | Updated: 20:43 EST, 27 January 2017 e-mail View comments The pictures of Rory McGrath's loyal wife Nicola hugging him and smiling at him outside court this week showed a very public display of affection. McGrath had just been given a suspended sentence for conducting a long campaign of harassment against his ex-mistress and her family after she broke off their five-year affair. Nicola endured not only the private agony of the affair but also the public humiliation of the court case, which revealed how, during his 14-month stalking campaign, the 60-year-old comedian tormented his former mistress with endless texts and intimate photos and sent menacing messages to her husband. Comedian Rory McGrath (pictured outside court with wife Nicola) avoided jail despite having conducted a lengthy campaign of harassment against a married woman The court heard how, when he'd been spurned, McGrath described himself as suffering 'the madness of the addict who can't get what he wants'. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Astonishing forgiveness of fallen TV star Rory's wife: She... 'I apologise to my wife': Rory McGrath kisses his partner... Share this article Share Yet despite the terrible pain this must have caused Nicola, she is publicly standing by her man — just like so many women have before her. As McGrath's lawyer said: 'His wife's ability to understand his conduct is nothing short of phenomenal.' Remarkably, 60-year-old McGrath's marriage has survived this treachery and he and his wife Nicola were pictured hugging each other outside the court  Nicola's determination to 'heal their relationship' is admirable. But doesn't this tawdry case reveal the horrifying extent of the suffering that can be caused by extramarital affairs? McGrath was supported in court by his wife Nicola, and thanked the judge when told of his suspended ten-week prison sentence It is not just the heartache between McGrath and his wife. The affair destroyed the former mistress's marriage and devastated her children. And it's difficult to imagine what McGrath's two children with his first wife have had to go through. Yet our society seems gripped by a fever of adultery, with an estimated one-third of married couples cheating, and the dating website Ashley Madison — which specialises in extra-marital liaisons — having one million users. Last Sunday, five million viewers tuned in to the BBC's rampant new series Apple Tree Yard, in which Emily Watson plays a 50-year-old mum locked in a humdrum marriage. Ripe for passion, she hooks up with a suave but predatory civil servant with a penchant for sex in public places. Within minutes of encountering him at a conference, they're at it in a broom cupboard. 'Sex may be an animal pleasure,' she says, 'but adultery is a human one.' For her — like McGrath — it becomes an addiction, one she is prepared to risk everything for. Apple Tree Yard glamorises adultery — although we are given a hint of disaster to come when we flash-forward to the future and our 'heroine' is seen handcuffed in a police van. I do hope the series shows the other side of the adultery coin: the bitterness, the broken families, the misery. Yes, there are times when love dies and leaving is the right thing to do, however painful. But often, having an affair is the opposite of glamorous. As McGrath found, it's like strapping an emotional suicide vest to your chest and walking into the midst of those you love. Before detonating it. The former panellist on They Think It's All Over, the BBC sports quiz show, also reduced the woman's teenage daughter to tears by suggesting she had a 'personality disorder'   Gina plays sex card  While I deplore the vile social media abuse that Brexit challenger Gina Miller has been subjected to, it's a bit ripe for the multi-millionairess to claim she has been attacked because she's a woman. If a man had fibbed about his law degree (as she did) and presented himself in the smug, sanctimonious, self-promoting way she does, he would have received the same angry response. And if she doubts this, perhaps Mrs Miller should take a look at the social media comments directed at her fellow Remoaners Tony Blair and Sir Richard Branson. While I deplore the vile social media abuse that Brexit challenger Gina Miller has been subjected to, it's a bit ripe for the multi-millionairess to claim she has been attacked because she's a woman   La La? I wish I hadn't bothered  Not for 20 years has a movie had as many Oscar nominations as La La Land — 14 in total. So it was with much excitement I went to see it with a gay friend who adores a musical. We were ready to leave after 30 minutes. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone can't dance or sing. The burger we had afterwards had more sexual chemistry than they did. When I said to my friend, about Gosling: 'Ed Balls dances better than him,' he replied: 'And Ann Widdecombe better than her.' So much hysteria for such a silly movie. That's Hollywood for you!   Having just won yet another best-presenter award, Ant and Dec received their OBEs yesterday. With them were their wives Lisa and Ali. The thing we love about Ant and Dec is they're so un-showbizzy. At the palace, they wore morning suits, and their wives didn't have a split skirt or plunging cleavage between them.   Much hand-wringing from the Left as it is revealed the number of people sleeping rough in the UK has risen by 50 per cent. Those of us living in big cities can see it for ourselves. I spoke to one of three new arrivals begging in the area I live in north London. He said he'd just arrived from Romania. Why was he here, I asked? He looked at me as though I was stupid and said he could 'earn' more on the streets of London in a month than at his old job in a factory in his home city of Bucharest in a year. And he's already applied for a council flat and plans to bring his family here. Bring on Brexit.   A risky name game  The adorable Alex Jones, co-presenter of the BBC's very popular The One Show, has just had a much-longed-for baby at the age of 39. She thought it was too late for such happiness, but managed to phone the show live to share her wonderful news. Alex said the first days with her new son were so precious, but now she wants to share him with the nation and has invited viewers to help her choose a name. Does she really want a boy called Dwayne? The adorable Alex Jones, co-presenter of the BBC's very popular The One Show, has just had a much-longed-for baby at the age of 39   Madonna's Mission   One moment she's ranting against Trump, saying she wants to blow up the White House. The next, Madonna is in demure mode, trying to adopt twin girls in Malawi. Quite why the twice-divorced, 58-year-old mother-of-four with a penchant for men half her age feels she is ready for motherhood again is anyone's guess, especially since she's had such a difficult relationship with her son Rocco. But perhaps I've got it wrong. Perhaps Madonna was on a different kind of search in Africa — looking for a new toyboy. One moment she's ranting against Trump, saying she wants to blow up the White House. The next, Madonna is in demure mode, trying to adopt twin girls in Malawi   It has been almost 30 years since a naked, heavily pregnant Demi Moore graced the cover of Vanity Fair, photographed by Annie Leibovitz.  Next month we have Natalie Portman in an advanced state of pregnancy. Same snapper, same mag, but this time the subject can actually act.    Sad to see that Jane Fonda has parted from Richard Perry, her partner of eight years. Especially since the actress, who's been serially disappointed on the romantic front, had said: 'I'm with a man who's very different from the others. He's kind. Nobody teaches young women to look for kindness. We look for glamour, sexiness, but no one says maybe the quieter ones are the better ones in the long haul.' The break-up appears to be due to her 'rededicating herself to activism'. Burning a few bras on a demo are cold comfort when you can't keep the love of a good man.    Sad to see that Jane Fonda has parted from Richard Perry, her partner of eight years.

So it is astonishing that some of these 'overworked' nine-to-five doctors want to charge patients for minor surgical procedures after agreeing to open after normal surgery hours. A group of them are prepared to work evenings and weekends — offering effectively a private service — and are planning to pocket the proceeds. Yes, these are the same GPs who in 2004 took Tony Blair's deal to bump their salaries up by £20,000 to £110,000 — in return for working fewer hours and closing their surgeries at weekends.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps Comments (0) Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Apple added Night Shift support to macOS 10.12.4, which is currently available as a beta. It’s easy to activate, so follow along to learn how. To manually activate Night Shift on your Mac do this: Click the Notifications icon at the right edge of your Mac’s menu bar Swipe down just like you do to show the Do Not Disturb setting Click Night Shift Sorry gang, older Macs don’t get Night Shift To schedule Night Shift on your Mac do this: Go to the Apple menu and choose System Preferences Select Displays Click the Night Shift tab Set when Night Shift runs from the Schedule pop-up menu Schedule Night Shift and control its intensity in the Display System Preferences You can also set how much your display colors shift towards red when Night Shift is active. Just use the Color Temperature slider in the Displays settings. It’s right under the Schedule pop-up menu. Unfortunately, not everyone can try Night Shift, even when macOS 10.12.4 is out of beta. The feature isn’t available on older Macs like my 2011 MacBook Air. Good thing I also have a new Touch Bar MacBook Pro.

Earnings from Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook and major drug companies Merck and Pfizer are among the dozens of companies reporting earnings. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday and while no action is expected, the statement is expected to sound a little more hawkish as it looks forward to rate hikes. The January employment report Friday is the highlight of a heavy data calendar, which also includes personal income and spending Monday, the employment cost index Tuesday and car sales and ISM manufacturing data Wednesday. President Donald Trump wrapped his first week in office with a flurry of executive orders, tackling everything the Affordable Care Act to energy infrastructure to immigration. He met with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May in his first official meeting with a head of state. Trump did rattle Mexico over the $60 billion annual trade deficit the U.S. has with Mexico, and as the administration engaged in talks with Mexican officials, the president got into an exchange with the president of Mexico over who would pay for a wall along the southern U.S. border. After an awkward diplomatic moment, the two presidents talked and then issued a conciliatory joint statement about how they will continue to talk. Markets took all of it in stride, and stocks ended the week with gains. The Dow, over 21,000 for the first time, ended the week at 20,093, up 1.3 percent for the week, while the S&P 500, above 2,300 briefly, ended the week at 2,294, up 1 percent. show chapters US economy will 'surprise' to the downside this year: Pro    20 Hours Ago | 01:27 Sixty-six percent of the S&P 500 companies reporting earnings so far have beaten estimates, and profit growth is coming in at about 6.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. "The Fed, I think will be a reminder that the Fed is still going to be an important ingredient in the market's performance this year. Next week, there's no press conference and I would expect the language in the statement that comes out after the meeting to sound roughly balanced. That's what we were left with last time," said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. Grohowski said there's a low chance of a hike even at the Fed's March meeting but he does see two to three rate hikes this year. "Nothing [on rate hikes] until June, but therein lies the potential risk. Most of the focus next week will be on employment but over the course of the week I'm watching inflation. That's something we have to keep an eye on," Grohowski said. Wages have begun to rise, and CPI headline inflation crossed 2 percent last month for the first time in two years. "We get a couple of important reports. There's a PCE report [Monday] and the wage report in the employment report" on Friday, he said. Amherst Pierpont chief economist Stephen Stanley said he's also watching the inflation data, and expects to see average hourly wages rise by about 0.3 percent in Friday's employment report. He expects 165,000 nonfarm payrolls. "165,00 is pretty similar to what we've seen in the last two to three months of 2016. I think the labor markets have gotten tight so it's going to be difficult to see big gains at this point," said Stanley. "The wage numbers are going to be trending higher. They moved in a pretty definitive way last year. We're at the point in my view, where we're past full employment. We've seen wages rising." Traders say Washington will be the big focus again next week, and markets are looking for information on the Trump programs that have driven stocks higher. They are also cautiously watching for any developments on trade that could seem protectionist. They will also be watching for any news from Trump's separate weekend phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Germany and France. "I'm amazed at how under control the volatility has been in the face of these daily headlines," said Grohowski. "In the bigger picture, that's been one surprise ... how the market broadly speaking has remained calm when you think of measures like the VIX. When I think of the year unfolding it could be extremely dangerous to extrapolate out anything resembling a calm, low volatility environment." The VIX, the CBOE's volatility index, declined 8 percent in the past week to end at 10.58, hitting a three-year low Friday. "I sense there's still an awful lot of cash sitting on the sidelines," said Grohowski. "There's as much anxiety about missing the next leg higher, as there is about protecting for a downside scenario." Grohowski is targeting 2,350 for the S&P 500, not much higher this year. Opposite 2016, he said the market could perform better in the first part of the year, rather than the last. He said the market is focused on policy, particularly tax reform, and there could be a misstep a long the way that drives it lower. Analysts have been concerned that the trade talk could begin to sound protectionist and result in tariffs. The White House, in fact, raised the idea of a 20 percent import tax on Mexican goods as one idea on Thursday. "While we feel better about the earnings outlook, I do feel creeping into sentiment, more expectations. I'm calling this year, it's going to be a 'show me.' I think there's still expectations driving this market higher," he said. "It's going to be show me the tax reform, show me the regulatory ease. There's a lot of expectations building up."

MONEY How to Make Real Money From Virtual Things From Bitcoin to Kimoji, there's a whole new economy of intangible goods ready for your business to sell. By Zoë Henry Zoë Henry is a staff reporter at Inc. and a graduate of Brown University. She lives in Brooklyn, New York. @ZoeLaHenry Reporter, Inc.@ZoeLaHenry WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Illustrations by Bewilder Advertisement Just a decade ago, few would have guessed that virtual goods could create a real market. Then the smartphone age sparked a whole new universe of ephemeral, yet lucrative, commerce. "People have gotten much more comfortable with the idea of paying for things that are virtual," says Joost van Dreunen, the co-founder and CEO of SuperData, a gaming research firm. For startups in this fast-growing market, the goods may be fake, but the sales are real. Some of the most promising new areas of business are hidden behind what can sound like Millennial smartphone-speak: Kimoji! Color bombs! Bitcoin! But these terms--meaning, respectively, Kim Kardashian images, Candy Crush aids, and digital currency--represent some of the biggest breakthroughs in the virtual goods economy, which now accounts for more than $100 billion in global sales, van Dreunen estimates. "We're attributing value to things that have no inherent value," he says. Here are four ways that you, too, may be able to capture the real spending on fake things: Stickers and emoji: Replace words with pictures You probably already fill some of your text messages with emoji, those digital images that range from sad faces and broken hearts to suggestive produce and party hats. Their more commercial cousins are "stickers," which can be tailored to specific events, brands, or people--like the wildly successful Kardashian line, which made more than $2.8 million in global revenue in 2016, according to market researcher Sensor Tower. Who is making money: App makers, marketers, and branding firms can most easily jump into the sticker industry. How to do it: If your core business is apps, consider designing a line of stickers to sell via the stores run by Apple and Google. Most sticker makers don't charge much, usually 99 cents to $1.99 per collection (minus the stores' 30 percent cut). The payoff is slim if you're doing this on your own, so many app makers get involved only once they have a paying client on board--usually a company or a celebrity who commissions stickers and the related "keyboard" technology. $50 million- $100 million Annual U.S. digital ad sales from stickers and emoji Who's succeeding: Big tech companies like Facebook dominate, but there is some room for startups. Vivian Rosenthal, the founder of New York City-based sticker-tech firm Snaps, has worked with clients including Pepsi, Nike, Heidi Klum, and Kim Kardashian. Yet Rosenthal says that celebrity content makes up only a small portion of her sales: "The bigger opportunity we're seeing is for brands" to create stickers for advertising, she says. Since launching in 2011, Snaps has signed deals with more than 100 companies, each of which pays from $10,000 to $100,000 per month for its own tailored keyboards and related products. The risks: Since revenue per transaction is so small, it's a race against time to acquire enough customers. That's part of what doomed Hi-Art, a New York City startup that made stickers for some celebrity musicians. "We still weren't growing enough that we were profitable on in-app purchases alone," says co-founder Brian Lederman. His advice: Move quickly to strike distribution deals with big messaging services, such as Line, Kik, or WeChat. Those third parties may pay to license your content, which they can then distribute to their hundreds of millions of users.   Mobile gaming: Waste time more efficiently More than 138 million Americans play mobile games, most of which are free to download--and many then pay for small in-app purchases that help them win those games more quickly. (Thanks, color bombs!) Who is making money: Mobile game studios. Some other developers of recreational apps, including online dating services and language-learning programs, also benefit from this free-to-play, pay-to-advance model. How to do it: If you've designed and published a mobile game, you might expect to earn about $25 per paying player per month from in-app sales, according to mobile marketing company Swrve. The challenge is to find and keep those big spenders: Overall, just 1.9 percent of players make purchases on mobile games. Here, again, the app stores will take 30 percent off the top. $6.7 billion U.S. mobile game revenue in 2016 $37 billion Global spending on mobile gaming in 2016 Who's succeeding: Traditional game publishers like Electronic Arts are investing serious cash in mobile games; more recent winners include Activision's King, the maker of Candy Crush, and Jam City, the seven-year-old private Los Angeles game developer previously known as SGN. Jam City counts 45 million users across hundreds of titles, and says it's on track to do $400 million in annual sales; one of its products is Cookie Jam, a series of puzzles that charges users for extra lives or moves. The company has entire teams dedicated to tracking players' progress and coming up with new levels and obstacles, says Jam City co-founder Josh Yguado: "What's beautiful about the mobile gaming industry is that you have so much day-to-day understanding of what virtual goods users are purchasing, and at what point they're dropping out." The risks: Remember, a very small segment of users (in Jam City's case, fewer than 10 percent) choose to purchase digital goods, so you need to consistently make new content. "If you think you have the perfect game, and you have a one-track development process, you will almost by definition fail," warns Yguado.   Virtual currency: Spend money on new money You've probably heard of Bitcoin--but what about Ether, Dogecoin, and Zcash? Most such online-only "cryptocurrencies" aren't controlled by government entities like the Federal Reserve. That has helped them attract a following among digital privacy advocates, investors looking for the next hot commodity, and, yes, less savory elements looking for a digital equivalent of untraceable cash. Who is making money: Financial services and technology startups, especially those with experience in the complicated and highly regulated financial markets, are best positioned to jump into the world of virtual money--or the related "blockchain" technology that helps it move around the digital universe. How to do it: Your biggest business opportunity is to start what's known as a digital wallet or an exchange, where you generate revenue by charging fees to buy or sell these virtual assets. (Examples include the San Francisco-based startups Coinbase and Kraken, and the Omaha-based Exodus.) Some startups are looking to the blockchain, developing and selling applications for this new type of financial system. James Gatto, a partner specializing in virtual currency for law firm Sheppard Mullin, calls blockchain-related tech "the greatest value of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem." $400 million Annual fees that can be collected from trading digital currencies Who's succeeding: One of the leading digital currency startups is five-year-old exchange Coinbase. It counts 4.5 million customers, who buy and sell currency on its website. The company has facilitated $5 billion worth of transactions for consumers and institutional investors. "The line between investing and use has been blurred with the advent of digital currencies," says co-founder Fred Ehrsam. The risks: Regulation! Though the currencies themselves may not be government controlled, those that handle them must navigate U.S. financial rules. Ehrsam estimates that his startup has spent $10 million on red tape, including getting registered by the U.S. Treasury and obtaining money transmitter licenses in dozens of states. (Coinbase is also fielding an IRS probe over users buying Bitcoin to avoid paying taxes.) Another challenge was the time-consuming process of establishing banking relationships to let users sync their financial accounts. As Ehrsam says, "The business is a really hard one to build."   Virtual assistants: Provide invisible help Think Siri or Alexa: There's a growing demand for digital assistants that can understand spoken requests and perform tasks, such as scheduling a meeting, calling a friend, or making a payment. Who is making money: Startups that develop machine learning for existing digital assistants stand to make the most money, while some newcomers are creating their own app-based assistants. How to do it: This new breed of artificial intelligence is built on speech-recognition programs and other quickly evolving technologies. If you have a smart group of programmers eager to take on a sophisticated topic, you could develop and sell a standalone app, or license it to third-party companies for a fee. (Take NextIT, based in Spokane, Washington, which licenses its Alme platform to businesses and also builds custom digital assistants for individual companies.) Or you could sell your whole company: Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all recently acquired machine-learning startups--some for hundreds of millions of dollars--to power their own digital assistants. $13.7 billion Projected size of the global cognitive computing market, which includes machine learning and automated reasoning, by 2020 Who's succeeding: A number of startups are making standalone digital assistants, including the Santa Clara, California-based SoundHound and the Mountain View, California-based EasilyDo. And some entrepreneurs are serial innovators: In 2005, William Tunstall-Pedoe launched what became Evi Technologies, a Cambridge, England-based software maker that eventually created its own digital assistant. In 2012, he sold the company to Amazon for a reported $26 million; now, the e-commerce giant uses Evi's technology to enhance its own digital assistant, Alexa. Tunstall-Pedoe, who left Amazon a year ago, is considering starting another A.I. business. And he sees plenty of room for new A.I.-related startups to find "massive" success: "It's a super exciting space." The risks: Big, big-name competition. Since the tech giants are already making digital assistants, yours needs to significantly improve on what's widely available. "It would be difficult to create a standard, Alexa-like product unless you have very unique technology," Tunstall-Pedoe says. FROM THE FEBRUARY 2017 ISSUE OF INC. MAGAZINE Advertisement

Photo: Reuters/Lucas Jackson Reuters Microsoft Corp's (MSFT. O) market capitalization topped $500 billion for the first time since 2000 on Friday, after the technology giant's stock rose following another quarter of results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Shares of the world's biggest software company rose as much as 2.1 percent to $65.64, an all-time high, in early trading, valuing the company at $510.37 billion. The last time Microsoft was valued more was in March 2000, during the heyday of the dotcom era, when it had a market value of a little above $550 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Despite the gains, Microsoft still lags Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) market capitalization of about $642 billion and Google-parent Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) market value of a little more than $570 billion. Microsoft reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts' average estimate for both revenue and profit, mainly due to its fast-growing cloud computing business. The company's profit and revenue have now topped Wall Street's expectations in seven of the last eight quarters. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant nearly three years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company's efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. When he took the top job in February 2014, the company's stock was trading at around $34 and its market value was roughly $315 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. "The pieces are falling into place as we are starting to see an important shift in the model, with improving profitability in growth segments," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, boosting the median price target to $68.50 from $68.00. Of the 37 analysts covering the stock, 27 rate it "buy" or higher, eight have a "hold" rating and two "strong sell".

Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign.” He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon.—Agencies Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleBanks ponder the meaning of life as Deutsche agonises Next articleYusuf Zafar takes over as new Chairman of PARC Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Economy Watch PIA needs well-envisioned business plan for revival Economy Watch KSE-100 benchmark dips by 228 points Economy Watch Private sectors vital to improve Pak-Spain bilateral trade Digital Newspaper Social Diary Signing ceremony of Share Purchase Agreement of PSX with the Consortium of Chinese Exchanges and local financial institutions Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor-in-Cheif: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: Khalid Butt E-Mail: obslhr@pakobserver.net Resident Editor Peshawar: Tariq Saeed E-Mail: obspwr@pakobserver.net Group Director : Khurram Jaffrani E-Mail: khurram_jaffrani@hotmail.com Director Marketing : Naveed Ahmad Khan Cell # 0300-5129008 Contact Us Online Edition : Q Malik / Ch Imran Zafar E-Mail: webmaster@pakobserver.net Islamabad: 051-2852027, 051-2852028 E-Mail : observer@pakobserver.net Karachi: 021-35308446-49 E-Mail : obskhi@pakobserver.net Lahore: 042-36306666, 36303333 E-Mail : obslhr@pakobserver.net ABOUT USHead Office Address: Daily Pakistan Observer, Ali AKbar House , Markez G-8, Islamabad Contact us: observer@pakobserver.net FOLLOW US Home Health Voice of People © Copy Rights Reserved .

She is now in the running for the state teacher of the year. Brown teaches third grade at Jim Allen Elementary School and is in her third year of teaching. “Teachers, we don’t do this to be recognized. No teacher in this county does this job to be recognized. I’m just so inspired to be around these amazing educators. This is awesome,” Brown said after being named Teacher of the Year. “I hope that my students will come away from my classroom with two things.  First, I want them to know how valuable they are and how much they have to offer the world.  My goal is to have encouraged them so much throughout the year that when they leave my classroom they know that they are important and that they have contributions to make to society,” Brown said previously. “Secondly, I hope that my students leave my classroom with a love of learning.  Everything that I do in my classroom, from engaging technology to flexible seating, is designed to make students enjoy the learning process.  If they come away from my classroom knowing they are valued deeply, realizing they are important, and looking to their future with excitement, then I know I have done my job well,” Brown concluded. “Lacey Brown has been involved in many leadership roles at our school,” Jim Allen Elementary School Principal Rachel Watts said. “he is an integral part of our faculty who goes above and beyond her required duties and she is willing to help any student, teacher, support staff or parent any time.” Comments Name (required) Email Address (will not be published) (required) Website (enter your own site, if any; not northescambia.com) Your Comments: Have a comment on this story?

Shares of the world’s biggest software company rose as much as 2.1 percent to $65.64, an all-time high, in early trading, valuing the company at $510.37 billion. The last time Microsoft was valued more was in March 2000, during the heyday of the dotcom era, when it had a market value of a little above $550 billion. Despite the gains, Microsoft still lags Apple Inc’s market capitalization of about $642 billion and Google-parent Alphabet Inc’s market value of a little more than $570 billion. Microsoft reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts’ average estimate for both revenue and profit, mainly due to its fast-growing cloud computing business. The company’s profit and revenue have now topped Wall Street’s expectations in seven of the last eight quarters. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant nearly three years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company’s efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. When he took the top job in February 2014, the company’s stock was trading at around $34 and its market value was roughly $315 billion, according to data collected by a foreign news agency. “The pieces are falling into place as we are starting to see an important shift in the model, with improving profitability in growth segments,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, boosting the median price target to $68.50 from $68.00. Of the 37 analysts covering the stock, 27 rate it “buy” or higher, eight have a “hold” rating and two “strong sell”.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile Image Source: ConceptsiPhone, YouTube iPhones might get curved LCD screens next year Chris Smith @chris_writes January 25th, 2017 at 7:45 AM Share Tweet The iPhone 8 will have a curved display, multiple reports said, which will be a first for Apple’s flagship product. The phone is also expected to have a flexible OLED screen, also a first for the iPhone. OLED screens offer better performance and energy efficiency, and they’re easy to bend, to accommodate wraparound iPhone screen designs. But Japan Display, who’s currently making flat LCD panels for Apple, announced that starting next year, it’ll mass-produce bendable LCD screens that might be used iPhones. Don't Miss: T-Mobile employees share horror stories of lies and bill cramming in ‘wild outlaw’ stores JDI’s flexible LCD screens will use plastic instead of glass, which is why they’ll be bendable. The screens won’t be as flexible as OLED panels, but JDI’s CFO Shuji Aruga told The Wall Street Journal that they’ll be flexible enough to be used in Galaxy Edge-like designs. The screens, pictured below, might be less expensive to make, at least for JDI, as they do not require substantial investments in new production lines, IHS Markit told The Journal. Image Source: TAKASHI MOCHIZUKI/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL It looks like JDI’s clients are already interested in such a prospect. Apple and Huawei are JDI’s largest customers, but there’s no official confirmation from either company. However, people familiar with the matter said Apple is looking at the displays for possible future iPhone models. “Mass production is planned from 2018, and we wouldn’t do that without demand from our clients,” Aruga said. JDI is also interested in developing flexible OLED screens, although some analysts think the company might not be able to pursue both flexible LCD and OLED technologies. Samsung Display, meanwhile, will be the main beneficiary of Apple’s OLED orders this year. LG Display and Foxconn’s Sharp are also expected to manufacture OLED displays in the future. This year, Apple is expected to launch two iPhones that will have flat LCD displays, including the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, in addition to the iPhone 8 flagship.

However, the patent application does not mention anything about what substance the device is designed to be used with, The Verge reported on Saturday. It may be a standalone product intended for recreational use and interestingly the application does not cite a human end user, the report added. Speculations are that if not a vape, Apple could foray into air freshener segment. Recently, the vapour technology was used to create interactive holograms.

Join For Free In the last post, we changed the communication between our classes to be based on the Key-Value Observation. As we can see, KVO is not the best solution for our problem, but sometimes can be helpful if we need to observe one particular object property changes. In this post, I will modify the communication to have the same characteristic as the delegation software design pattern. Let's see what changes are required in the class diagram in order to achieve our target: In the UML diagram above, you see two «protocol», which is pretty much same as the «interface» in other Object-Oriented Programming languages (if they support this particular principle). The protocol or the interface sometimes called as a contract, and all of the classes that implement the protocol or interface will have a “contractual obligation” to implement all of the required properties and methods. I would more think about the protocols as a template, where all of the required parts needs to be filled out. If we are referencing to a protocol in Objective-C, the form is used, where ProtocolWantToConform is the name of the protocol. About the Delegation Pattern The delegation pattern originally was created for allowing something similar to multiple inheritances, which is not available in most of the programming languages. In our Apple software ecosystem, the pattern is more about acting on behalf of another object. Usually, delegates are for accomplishing well-designed (and limited) functionality, helping the developers have a nicely decoupled software. The best examples of delegation patterns are the UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource protocols. With a careful software design, you can use separate classes and code to provide the behavioral part (from the delegate) and the data source for your table view. The benefit to doing so is that you can later easily change any of them without making significant changes in the table view controller itself. About the Protocol Files I have already tried to explain what a protocol is. Let's see how can you create a protocol file. Don’t forget the protocol should stand only as a blueprint for the classes want to conform to or implement the protocol. Having said that, we don’t need to implement any details in the methods; only the method signatures. Optionally, we can also specify if the method is optional. Creating a protocol file is a bit tricky in Xcode, but you can get used to it quite easily. Go to File > New > File, and on the screen, select the Objective-C file (marked with a small m), as you can see in the screenshot below: Click on Next and select Protocol as File Type. Give it a reasonable and meaningful name. Eventually, you will end up only one file with the .h extension and a quite simple @protocol NameOfProtocol @end structure in the file. That is the parent or super-protocol! Protocol Files for Our Solution As we can see in the UML diagram, there are two protocol files used: PMODataHolder and PMODownloaderFromURL. We need to establish a two-way communication, or at least cross-reference between those entities via the delegate and the receiver properties. Keep in mind that we need the receiver property to hold the reference of the image holder object in the delegate protocol in order to make a callback on it with the downloaded data. PMODataHolder.h: #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "PMODownloaderFromURL.h"

/**
Forward declaration of the used and referenced protocol
*/
@protocol PMODownloaderFromURL;


@protocol PMODataHolder <NSObject>

/**
Our delegate, which will do the actual download for us.
*/
@property (strong, nonatomic, nullable) id <PMODownloaderFromURL> delegate;

/**
Completion handler. Call with the downloada data as NSData when the download of the data completed.
@param data The downloaded data is raw NSData format.
*/
- (void)didDownloadedData:(nullable NSData *) data;

@end I think it is a well-commented file. There are a few things I would like to emphasize. Please note the forward declaration of the cross-referenced protocol for the delegate class, which was required by Xcode, to build the solution. Without this, I had a nasty “no type or protocol named” error. The second thing I want to emphasize regards the delegate property declaration. As you can see, the delegate will be a strong attribute. The other thing you should note is that the delegate type is ID. This kind of declaration can make your code loosely coupled since it won’t tell you what kind of object we want to reference here, only that we require that this class need to implement a certain type of protocol. I think this is one of the important techniques which helps you to apply the principle from the GoF design patterns book Program to Interfaces, Not Implementation. PMODownloaderFromURL.h  #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "PMODataHolder.h"


/**
Forward declaration of the used and referenced protocol
*/
@protocol PMODataHolder;

@protocol PMODownloaderFromURL <NSObject>

/**
A weak pointer, pointing back to the original caller. We can do a callback message sending via this, when the async download finished.
*/
@property (weak, nonatomic, nullable) id <PMODataHolder> receiver;


/**
A general downloader method, which is required to implement.
@param url The url of the source file.
*/
- (void)downloadDataFromURL:(nonnull NSURL *)url;

@end The only change here about the cross-declaration is the weak attribute of the receiver property. This is because I would like to avoid retaining circles. Using the weak pointer means that if the receiver object for some reason has been already deallocated (for example, the download process takes a long time and the user has been already moved to another screen), the receiver object will be successfully freed from the memory by the ARC. Changes in Our Files PMOPictureController.h  #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
//1
#import "PMODataHolder.h"

//2
@interface PMOPictureController : NSObject <PMODataHolder>

/**

@param url The picture full url, as NSURL
@return An instance PMOPictureController.

/**

/**

@return an instance of UIImage.
*/
- (nullable UIImage *)image;


/**
Removinf the default initalizer
@return nil
*/
- (nullable instancetype)init NS_UNAVAILABLE;

@end As it was described in our new UML diagram, the PMOPictureController needs to implement the PMODataHolder protocol. At //1 ,  the protocol header file imported, and at //2 , it is declared that this class needs to conform to the said protocol. PMOPictureController.m #import "PMOPictureController.h"
#import "PMODownloader.h"
#import "PMOPictureWithURL.h"
#import "PMODownloadNotifications.h"


@interface PMOPictureController()

/**
Our private data class, storing and hiding the information.
*/
@property (strong, nonatomic, nullable) PMOPictureWithURL *pictureWithUrl;


@end

@implementation PMOPictureController

// 1
@synthesize delegate = _delegate;

#pragma mark - Initializers
- (instancetype)initWithPictureURL:(NSURL *)url {

self = [super init];
if (self) {
_pictureWithUrl = [[PMOPictureWithURL alloc] initWithPictureURL:url];
PMODownloader *delegate = [[PMODownloader alloc] init];
delegate.receiver = self;
_delegate = delegate;
[self addObserverForDownloadTaskWithDownloader];
}
return self;
}

[self willChangeValueForKey:@"image"];
self.pictureWithUrl.image = [UIImage imageWithData:data];
[self removeObserverForDownloadTask];
[self didChangeValueForKey:@"image"];
}
}

#pragma mark - Accessors

return self.pictureWithUrl.image;
}


#pragma mark - Notification Events

NSLog(@"Image download failed");
}


#pragma mark - Notification helpers

}


- (void)removeObserverForDownloadTask {
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
}


#pragma mark - Dealloc
- (void)dealloc {
[self removeObserverForDownloadTask];
}

@end Take a look at the @synthesize at //1 . If you remember, I created a property in the protocol, but I also said that the protocol file is just a blueprint; the developer’s work is to build a class from this blueprint. Unfortunately, the properties declared in the protocol won’t be automatically synthesized for us. That’s why we need to implement them by synthesizing them. In very simple terms, this line creates a private variable in the class called _delegate, which will be bound to the self.delegate property. It also creates the default accessors for the self.delegate. Make a note about the initializer changes: It will set up the PMODownloader as a delegate immediately after the default initialization. At //2, we simply pass the task to our delegate. This is the part where the pattern is actually implemented, i.e., it asks another class to do something on behalf our controller. At //3, we have the PMODataHolder protocol, including this method. I kept the other part of the class unchanged, so we still notified in any download problems, and the controller also notifies the objects, which are observing the image Key-Value change. So, let’s take a look at our downloader class, how the protocol will be implemented, and what has been changed:  PMODownloader.h  #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
//1
#import "PMODownloaderFromURL.h"

//2
@interface PMODownloader : NSObject <PMODownloaderFromURL>

/**
Property to store the downloaded data in NSData format
*/
@property (strong, nonatomic, nullable) NSData *downloadedData;


@end At //1 , I import the protocol file, so in the line at //2, I can use it with the class declaration that this particular class will implement the protocol. As you can see the forward declaration for  - (void)downloadDataFromURL:(nonnull NSURL *)url; has been removed since now it is declared in the protocol. PMODownloader.m  #import "PMODownloader.h"
#import "PMODownloadNotifications.h"

@implementation PMODownloader

//1
@synthesize receiver = _receiver;

//2
#pragma mark - Public API / Protocol implementation
- (void)downloadDataFromURL:(NSURL *)url {

NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];
NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sharedSession];

NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [session dataTaskWithRequest:request
completionHandler:
^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
if (error) {
[self notifyObserverDownloadFailure];
} else {

[self.receiver didDownloadedData:data];
}
}];
[task resume];

}


#pragma mark - Notifications
- (void)notifyObserverDownloadFailure {

[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:PMODownloadFailed
object:self
userInfo:nil];
}


@end At //1, I use the same technique with the _receiver property that was used PMOPictureController.m. Maybe you have already noticed that the code is getting more clear, and it is definitely seen in the method at  //2, where all of the other calls just simply replaced by a callback to the receiver and pass the downloaded raw data. I also removed the other, now useless code, but I kept the one for notifying about download failure. Updated Test Cases As I changed the strategy, how to carry out the download, actually hiding the downloader class behind the delegation pattern, our tests need to be updated as well. PMOPictureControllerTests.m  #import <XCTest/XCTest.h>
#import "PMOPictureController.h"
#import "PMODownloadNotifications.h"

@interface PMOPictureControllerTests : XCTestCase
@property (strong, nonatomic) PMOPictureController *pictureController;
@end

@implementation PMOPictureControllerTests

- (void)setUp {
[super setUp];
// Set up the controller with a valid image URL.
self.pictureController = [[PMOPictureController alloc] initWithPictureURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/One_black_Pixel.png"]];
}

- (void)tearDown {
// Being a good citizen, and nil out the strong reference, so we can safely initialize again a new instance
// for the next test
self.pictureController = nil;
[super tearDown];
}


/**
Test the asynchron download
Internet connection required to pass this test!
*/
- (void)testPictureAsyncDownload {
XCTestExpectation *expectation = [self keyValueObservingExpectationForObject:self.pictureController keyPath:@"image" handler:^BOOL(id _Nonnull observedObject, NSDictionary * _Nonnull change) {
[expectation fulfill];
return true;
}];

[self.pictureController downloadImage];
[self waitForExpectationsWithTimeout:5.0 handler:^(NSError *error) {
if (error) {
NSLog(@"Timeout Error: %@", error);
}
}];
}

/**
Testing the download failure wiht a nonexisting domain
*/
- (void)testPictureAsyncDownloadFailed {


self.pictureController = [[PMOPictureController alloc] initWithPictureURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://ThereIsNoSuCHDomainName/MssedUPName.png"]];

XCTestExpectation *expectation = [self expectationForNotification:PMODownloadFailed
object: nil
handler:^BOOL(NSNotification * _Nonnull notification) {
[expectation fulfill];
return true;
}];

[self.pictureController downloadImage];
[self waitForExpectationsWithTimeout:5.0 handler:^(NSError *error) {
if (error) {
NSLog(@"Timeout Error: %@", error);
}
}];
}



@end As you can see, our download test is now based on a KVO on the PMOPictureController image property. PMODownloaderTests.m  #import <XCTest/XCTest.h>
#import "PMODownloader.h"
#import "PMODownloadNotifications.h"

@interface PMODownloaderTests : XCTestCase
@property (strong, nonatomic) PMODownloader *downloader;
@end

@implementation PMODownloaderTests

- (void)setUp {
[super setUp];
self.downloader = [[PMODownloader alloc] init];
}

- (void)tearDown {
self.downloader = nil;
[super tearDown];
}


/**
Testing the download failure wiht a nonexisting domain
*/
- (void)testPictureAsyncDownloadFailed {



XCTestExpectation *expectation = [self expectationForNotification:PMODownloadFailed
object: nil
handler:^BOOL(NSNotification * _Nonnull notification) {
[expectation fulfill];
return true;
}];

[self.downloader downloadDataFromURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://ThereIsNoSuCHDomainName/MssedUPName.png"]];
[self waitForExpectationsWithTimeout:5.0 handler:^(NSError *error) {
if (error) {
NSLog(@"Timeout Error: %@", error);
}
}];
}


@end I removed the successful download test since this part of the code should work via the delegation pattern. Wrapping Up I hope you've gained some knowledge from this post. Delegation is quite powerful in terms of segregation of concerns, which leads us to clean(er) code. It needs some preliminary planning and design by using the “program for interfaces, not implementation” principle. For that particular case, i.e., asynchronously downloading an image, delegation is not the best solution still. In the last post of this series, I will introduce the block-based solution.

PHOTO: REUTERS Microsoft Corp’s market capitalization topped $500 billion for the first time since 2000 on Friday, after the technology giant’s stock rose following another quarter of results that beat Wall Street’s expectations. Shares of the world’s biggest software company rose as much as 2.1 percent to $65.64, an all-time high, in early trading, valuing the company at $510.37 billion. The last time Microsoft was valued more was in March 2000, during the heyday of the dotcom era, when it had a market value of a little above $550 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bill Gates could become world’s first trillionaire Despite the gains, Microsoft still lags Apple Inc’s market capitalization of about $642 billion and Google-parent Alphabet Inc’s market value of a little more than $570 billion. Microsoft reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts’ average estimate for both revenue and profit, mainly due to its fast-growing cloud computing business. The company’s profit and revenue have now topped Wall Street’s expectations in seven of the last eight quarters. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant nearly three years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company’s efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. Microsoft victory in overseas data privacy case stands When he took the top job in February 2014, the company’s stock was trading at around $34 and its market value was roughly $315 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. “The pieces are falling into place as we are starting to see an important shift in the model, with improving profitability in growth segments,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, boosting the median price target to $68.50 from $68.00. Of the 37 analysts covering the stock, 27 rate it “buy” or higher, eight have a “hold” rating and two “strong sell”.

The inherent concept of turning the home console experience into something that’s portable, is a fascinating experiment and what Nintendo’s failed Wii U should have been. The Switch also fulfills a childhood dream I’ve envisioned for decades. As a kid, typically while ‘trapped’ at my parent’s cottage in the summer time or during long car rides, I longed to be able to play my favourite Nintendo 64 titles on the go. My yellow original Game Boy was great (Link’s Awakening remains my favourite Zelda game), but being able to bring a true console gaming experience with me anywhere, was what I’ve always wanted. Even as an adult who spends a large chunk of their time commuting and in airports, being able to bring a video game console on a trip, in a way that’s highly portable and makes sense, is a game changer. With my hopes high, I attended a Nintendo Switch preview event in Toronto where I went hands-on with the Japanese gaming giant’s latest video game console. To my surprise, I actually walked away somewhat underwhelmed by the brief amount of time I spent with the Switch. The intriguing console-handheld hybrid narrative still has me excited about Nintendo’s upcoming video game console, but I’m also concerned that it’s set to repeat the same errors Nintendo made with the Wii U. Questionable build quality Surprisingly, the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers feel somewhat flimsy. Attaching the Joy-Cons to the side of the Switch is a simple process that only takes a few seconds, requiring you to line up the gamepads with a slot located on the side of the dock. The controllers also snap on to either side of the tablet solidly and don’t flex like other gamepad attachments I’ve used in the past that are designed for smartphones and tablets. The Joy-Cons felt small in my hands and I found it difficult to not press the controller’s shoulder buttons by accident, though I like how versatile they are. You can also use the controllers while they’re attached together with the Joy-Con grip, creating a gamepad that feels more traditional, or separately and detached in a way that’s similar to the Wii’s Wiimote. Depending on how you’re playing, or if you have the Switch in tabletop mode and held up by its kickstand, this seems to be the most comfortable way to use the console’s gamepads. While the Joy-Cons felt flimsy, I’m hoping that with time the controller will grow on me. After all, when the Xbox One and PS4 launched a few years ago, I actually preferred the PlayStation 4’s Dualshock 4, only to eventually come to the conclusion that the Xbox One’s gamepad is the vastly superior controller months later (offset joysticks ftw!). The Switch’s Pro controller on the other hand, is sturdy and solid, though it likely won’t be compatible with all games “I’m still holding out hope that the Switch evolves into a viable gaming device” The Switch’s display reminded me of a mid-range tablet and felt relatively solid, though don’t expect the high-end build of an Apple-made iPad. Unfortunately — and this may be my biggest issue with the Switch — the tablet’s screen only features a 720p resolution, likely in an effort to save battery life, which early reports indicate could be as low as three hours with some games (this is estimated battery life for Breath of the Wild). In a tech industry where 1080p displays (and in some cases QHD) have become standard on most high-end smartphones and tablets, 720p is subpar and borderline unacceptable in 2017. It also seems like not all games will output at 1080p to the television when the Switch is docked, with marquee title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild rumoured to hit only approximately 900p, leading further fuel to the rumours that the Switch will have difficulty running ports of Xbox One and PS4 games (to be fair, the Xbox One also often doesn’t run games at full 1080p). The Switch’s dock on the other hand, is more difficult to judge since it was secured to the table it was sitting on at all the demo stations at the event. Sliding the Switch into the dock is a simple process and only took a few seconds, which was great to see given Nintendo is pushing it as something you can grab and instantly continue playing. Where are the games? Consoles always live or die by the quality of their games and especially in Nintendo’s case, third-party support. Various Nintendo home consoles over the years have struggled with attracting third-party developers, starting with the Nintendo 64 in the mid to late 90s and continuing into the GameCube era of the early 2000s. Even the monumentally successful Wii struggled with attracting developers that weren’t directly associated with Nintendo towards the end of its life cycle. With the Switch, Nintendo is adopting the same strategy it did with the Wii and Wii U, releasing an underpowered game console that will likely have difficulty matching the hardware featured in current generation competitors. With the Switch, there’s no getting around the fact that third-party support is abysmal at launch, with most games worth playing — Shin Megami Tensei and Rime for example — not arriving for months. In terms of third-party launch titles, only Super Bomberman R and I Am Setsuna interest me. Nintendo’s first-party offerings are equally disappointing, apart from Breath of the Wild, which despite playing spectacularly and being a monumental step forward for the Zelda series’ gameplay, (my colleague Igor Bonifacic is going to take a more in-depth look at the game) it’s actually visually underwhelming. While Breath of the Wild looked incredible in trailers and still screenshots, the game is hindered by slowdown issues and distracting antialiasing. 1-2-Switch is a fascinating experiment, but even first-party offerings like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Arms, a game that is essentially an upgraded, more accurate version of Wii Sports boxing, aren’t launching until later this year. It’s quite possible more developers will start releasing games for the Switch in the coming months, and that many are waiting to officially reveal the titles they’re working on, but at the outset, third-party developer support for Nintendo’s new console is incredibly weak. Conceptually fascinating With all this said, I’m still holding out hope that the Switch evolves into a viable gaming device, and that upcoming games like the quirky looking Super Mario Odyssey and Xenoblade Chronicles 2, end up being spectacular. It’s also possible that given the unique nature of the Switch, it could become a haven for indie video game developers, similar to what the PlayStation Vita eventually evolved into in its twilight years. With the device’s launch lineup turning out to be a disappointment, is the Switch’s $399 CAD asking price worth it right now? Probably not. I am, however, still holding out that against all odds, the Switch turns into the handheld- home console hybrid device I’ve always wanted. Just the idea of being able to wake up in the morning, play a game on my television before work, pop out the Switch and play the same game during my morning commute in a packed streetcar, is just too appealing for me to give up on so soon. Nintendo’s Switch is set to release in Canada on March 3rd for $399. Photography by Igor Bonifacic.

However, the patent application does not mention anything about what substance the device is designed to be used with, The Verge reported on Saturday. It may be a standalone product intended for recreational use and interestingly the application does not cite a human end user, the report added. Speculations are that if not a vape, Apple could foray into air freshener segment. Recently, the vapour technology was used to create interactive holograms.

Microsoft is now in court arguing that its customers have a constitutional right to know when the government demands their electronic data. The U.S. Justice Department disagrees and is asking a judge to dismiss the case. According to The Associated Press, the lawsuit alleges that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act — which forces companies to fork over the private customer data and keep the transfer secret — violates the First Amendment right of businesses to communicate with customers. “People need to get notice when the government comes knocking at the door to seize all that stuff that historically would have been stored in a file cabinet,” Microsoft lawyer Stephen Rummage told U.S. District Judge James Robart, the AP reported this week. Tech firms Apple, Twitter and Amazon, as well as the AP, Seattle Times and Washington Post were among the companies that filed court briefs in support of Microsoft. In its filing, the AP noted, Apple said it received more than 1,000 secret warrants from the government for iCloud data during the second half of 2015. According to its most recent available numbers, Microsoft received 2,576 similar demands for data over an 18-month period prior to April 2016, with 68 percent of those having no end date. Government lawyers maintain, among other things, that Microsoft has no standing to argue on behalf of its customers. But that simply perpetuates the offense. If the data grab is secret, how are individuals to know when they might need to seek legal protection in the courts? Judge Robart has yet to rule whether the suit may move forward. But he did express reservations about the law, according to the wire service. “I’m disturbed by the idea that you can have an invasion of rights or privacy without ever disclosing it,” he said. “Microsoft customers have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content they have stored.” He’s correct. Not only does the government have no right to gag Microsoft or any other company, federal prosecutors are playing fast and loose with the Fourth Amendment. Judge Robart should act on his concerns and reject the government’s attempts to dismiss the lawsuit.

"This journey has been nothing short of spectacular in every way," he wrote, "and I can proudly say that Xiaomi Global is the first baby I helped bring into the world."

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: This Budget could be the toughest test of Modi's life. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage It's goodbye China, hello virtual reality for Hugo Barra After spending three and half years in Beijing leading smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp's global division, Barra is returning to Silicon Valley to head Facebook Inc's VR efforts. He leaves behind an uneven legacy. Barra, 40, was hired in 2013 from Google, where he worked as head of product management for Android, to oversee Xiaomi's international expansion. While he helped boost device sales in India, the company aborted a push into Brazil and its other global efforts have largely stalled. At the same time, Xiaomi lost ground in its home market to domestic competitors like Vivo and Oppo, which worked more effectively with retail stores. Barra arrived with an ambitious vision, but failed to predict and overcome rapid changes in the global smartphone market. "He did a lot to build up Xiaomi's mindshare internationally," said Bryan Ma, vice president for devices research at IDC in Singapore. "But when you look at the hard numbers, they show mixed results." Barra's surprise exit comes just a couple of weeks after co-founder and CEO Lei Jun said in a letter to employees that the company had recently faced "unforgettable" challenges and now needed to focus on "sustainable growth." After building its success by selling only online, it's now developing brick-and-mortar stores in China. Barra declined to comment for this story, but he cited several accomplishments in social media posts as he departed, including the expansion into India and more than 20 other markets. A spokesperson for Xiaomi said Thursday he would continue to advise the company, "for the indefinite future." When he first moved from sunny California to smoggy Beijing, Barra brought the world spotlight with him. Energetic, globe-trotting, and supremely comfortable commanding a conference-hall stage, the Brazilian-born Barra showed Xiaomi how to introduce its expanding line of products -- which include fitness bands, ear buds, and air filters -- into other countries with a fast-growing middle class. "He helped to be that ambassador to the rest of the world," said IDC's Ma. "He was that enthusiastic, charismatic guy on stage, who helped explain who this Chinese company was." From 2012 to 2015, Xiaomi's smartphone sales rose at a furious clip, expanding more than six-fold, powered by online flash sales and savvy social-media. For parts of 2014 and 2015, Xiaomi ranked first in domestic smartphone sales, and local and international media dubbed the company the Apple of China. When Barra joined, he hoped to translate that success abroad, identifying India and Brazil as key targets. The vision was promising enough that in late 2014, Xiaomi was valued at about $45 billion, the highest for any startup in the world at the time. Yet Xiaomi's position at home soon began slipping. Facing intense competition from Vivo, Oppo and other rivals, Xiaomi dropped from first to fourth among smartphone sellers in China. While it focused on online sales, its competitors worked to become more prominent in retail stores, where the vast majority of customers still buy phones. The challenges at home foreshadowed hurdles in other markets. "To replicate an e-commerce model from China in India or Indonesia is not as easy as it sounds. Every country has a different internet culture," said Edward Tse, a Hong Kong-based business consultant and author of the book "China's Disruptors," which described the early days of Xiaomi and other Chinese tech upstarts. By traveling frequently to India -- and chronicling his trips on social media -- Barra helped to build a smartphone business there with $1 billion in annual revenue, an achievement he noted in his farewell Facebook post. Xiaomi is currently ranked third in the Indian smartphone market, with 9% market share, according to Counterpoint Research. "Hugo spearheaded the idea of how you bring Xiaomi-branded products outside of China," said Gary Rieschel, founding managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners, an early investor in Xiaomi. "He works incredibly hard." Barra thanked Lei Jun and Xiaomi's fans in his departure post on Facebook. "This journey has been nothing short of spectacular in every way," he wrote, "and I can proudly say that Xiaomi Global is the first baby I helped bring into the world." Neil Shah, Counterpoint's research director in India, thinks Xiaomi's performance in India may be near peaking. "There's almost a ceiling about how much you can sell online. Sixty to seventy percent of the markets are offline," he said. For online channels, Xiaomi's margins are razor thin, in India and China alike. Chinese rival Vivo, which works closely with retail stores, has already overtaken Xiaomi in India. IDC's Ma says Xiaomi's prospects in India look positive for the next year, but after that he isn't so sure. "The story in India reflects a lot of what has been happening in China, too. As the market shifts toward offline channels, it favors Oppo and Vivo." According to IDC, India is now Xiaomi's dominant overseas market -- accounting for 62% of its non-China shipments for the first nine months of 2016. Next up is Myanmar, accounting for 16 percent of shipments. "Myanmar is not exactly the first country that comes to mind when you think of the global smartphone market," said Ma. After opening with much fanfare in the summer of 2015, Xiaomi's Brazil office closed last year. The company's position in Brazilian smartphone sales peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, with about 1% of the market, according to Tina Lu, head of Counterpoint Research for Latin America. "Everything they were selling, they were selling at a loss," she said. "Unless you assemble devices locally, you face taxes of about 60%." Xiaomi explored, but never finalized, plans to manufacture devices in Brazil. A former employee at Xiaomi's Brazil office, which once employed 23 people, said local management struggled to distinguish itself. Beyond the pricing and brand challenges, the outpost had a difficult time coordinating strategy with Beijing, the person said. Replicating Xiaomi's early success in developing economies turned out to be elusive -- with obstacles ranging from Brazil's heavy taxes on foreign-assembled devices; to patent-infringement lawsuits in India; to the slow adoption of e-commerce in most developing countries compared with China. "A lot of people, including myself, once thought that if a Chinese technology company can make it there in China, it can make it anywhere. But I got that wrong," said Clay Shirky, an associate professor at NYU Shanghai and author of the 2015 book on Xiaomi, "Little Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream." Now Xiaomi will turn greater attention to fighting for its home turf. In his recent letter to employers, Lei Jun admitted the company had lost focus as it attempted rapid expansion, into both new products and countries. "That's why we must slow our pace, and seriously learn from our mistakes," he wrote. Barra isn't the only executive departing amid the slowdown. In October, Chen Tong, a vice-president for content at Xiaomi, left the company to join news platform Yidianzixun. Zhang Jinling, a vice-president managing finance and investments, left to join Baidu Inc. Chen did not respond to a request for comment, and Zhang declined to comment. "They had some glory days in the past. One can never count them out," said Tse. "But for them to really come back, they need to do a lot of hard work to rebuild the brand. People in China view it now as a declining brand." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

What will you do now? Bigg Boss 10 finale is on Sunday, when it will all be over. For many, just that sentence alone is enough to induce a quick panic. It’s an on again, off again relationship that’s been going on for a decade now. And now, it’s off again. Almost. So why do you watch Bigg Boss? Every year, for three months, it takes over your life. And you let it. But like every addiction, it needs to be addressed. Because right about now, the withdrawal is kicking in. Some may turn to old YouTube videos. Some may watch recaps. Others may even read about it, like that makes any sense. But everyone wants to fill that void. They want their daily fix. And for that, they turn to the next best thing. Which is lucky, if you’re the next best thing. hah Rukh Khan (L) and Salman Khan pose during the promotion of upcoming Hindi action crime thriller film Raees, on the set of Colors television reality show Bigg Boss 10. (AFP) Think about it. For a show to have this kind of impact on the lives of such a diverse crowd, it has to be undeniably special. Granted, it doesn’t have to be intelligent or high-brow to be special. But that’s the point. It is. The biggest reason for its – for lack of a better term – controversial reputation, ironically, is the kind of contestants it attracts. And that’s not the fault of the show. They need the eyeballs. For that, they cast their show like a circus. And the essence of the programme suffers for it. Because Bigg Boss is hardly a circus. Instead, it’s like a game of chess. And they’ve sat monkeys down to play it. But as with everything else, even that has mellowed with age. Gone are the days of Rakhi Sawant and KRK. Bigg Boss is maturing. Its attention-seeking teenage years are behind it. Now, all it wants to do is settle down. Big Brother, as George Orwell proposed it in 1984, resembles an all-seeing totalitarian dictator. And unlike Dr TJ Eckleberg from The Great Gatsby, it needs just one eye. Science fiction has often dreamed up similar scenarios. Charlie Brooker, the British mad-genius satirist routinely invokes the Big Brother concept in his work. That White Bear episode of Black Mirror depicted an unsettlingly dystopian future, one where the whole world is a voyeur, their camera phones always filming something. Read more Black Mirror review: It’s time you started watching one of the best shows ever Even murder. The Jim Carrey film The Truman Show put an existential spin on the same concept. Apple, on the other hand, in its classic Ridley Scott-directed ad, put a capitalist one. Watch the Apple ad: And then there are the obvious parallels that can be drawn about the current climate of mass surveillance and invasion of privacy. But oddly, that’s not how we Indians look at Bigg Boss, as we call it. Like the spiritual creatures that we are, for us Bigg Boss is more like God. Not in a ‘oh we look up to you’ kind of way. Bigg Boss, eye and all, is simply God. And he controls everything, including who he lets in and out of his domain. Only two kinds of people enter the show: Those who want to be someone, and those who used to be someone. Both are visibly desperate. Short of selling their bodies, they are willing to sing, dance even humiliate themselves for their supper. Such is the attraction of the Bollywood dream. They even turn their backs on large lumps of cash because even a glimmer of the alternative, the life they all dream of, is enough. Where else will you see this? Salman Khan, the eye of the storm. (AFP) The only person who even marginally comes close to wielding the godlike power of Bigg Boss is host Salman Khan. The intensity of fear, not respect, but fear that he inspires is a sight to behold. The elephant in the room being that every contestant dreams of one day joining show business, and they all turn to Salman bhai for help. He is the fairy godmother of their dreams and he is the genie that can grant them all their wishes. They saw it happen with Armaan Kohli and Sana Khan. And they want in on some of that action. So they sing, they dance and they even humiliate themselves to make it all a reality. Essentially, that’s what the show represents. It is a place where dreams come to life. It is a land of fantasy, where, for three months, dreamers get a chance to glimpse the lives they can live. Most of them will fade away into oblivion. They will be forgotten. But such is the optimism of Bigg Boss. It’s all worth it in the end. Even the audiences are living vicariously through their favourites, who, over the course of the season, become surrogates. It’s more than just a show. Currently, there are 56 separate versions of it running all over the world. They have Big Brother in Kosovo for God’s sake. They have one in Lithuania. It all began as a sociological experiment to bring people from different walks of life under the same roof, basically throw away the key, and see what happens. The house becomes a metaphor for the world we live in, a closed ecosystem of sorts, a Darwinian rat race to the top. Alliances are made, as are enemies. Sometimes, real love blossoms. And in eviction, there is death. Life after Bigg Boss is spoken about almost as an afterlife where heaven means success and hell indicates the lack of it. Bollywood films are often accused of lifting ideas from the rest of the world. But for some mysterious reason, that’s not the case with Bigg Boss. We all know it’s essentially a spinoff, a tiny insect in the bigger picture of bigger bosses. But no one cares about appeasing the white people this time. There is a proud sense of ownership when it comes to Bigg Boss and its fans. It’s their show. They vote for the contestants. They vote them out. They dictate proceedings. Next year, they will even get to participate. This season, its 10th, the show opened its gates to the common man. Finally, the true purpose of the show, which was to put people from different backgrounds together, was fulfilled in India as well. And for a country like ours, where such divisions are still very much a problem, this show bravely attempted to address them and perhaps even solve them. Swami Omji Maharaj, who was ousted from reality TV show Bigg Boss 10 due to his outrageous antics addresses a press conference in New Delhi. (IANS) The only time people come together in such unity for a common cause is maybe for sports. Or when a natural disaster happens. It’s like Alan Moore wrote about in his legendary graphic novel Watchmen. Humanity comes together only when it is required to fight a common foe. It was the Atom bomb in World War II.

If you sat in a chair, admired a fabric, strolled through a library, scanned a typeface, unfurled an umbrella, shopped in a store or drank from a cup designed by Kavanaugh, you wouldn’t know it. The design community is aware of her, even if the public isn’t. Earlier this winter, while Bob Dylan was not accepting his Nobel Prize in Stockholm, Kavanaugh was accepting an international arts prize, in Prague. A glossy coffee table book celebrating her life and work is scheduled for publication later this year. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Designs by Gere Kavanaugh  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Born and raised in Memphis and educated at the Memphis Academy of Arts (the precursor to the current Memphis College of Art), Kavanaugh credits her hometown with the “foundation” that made her a pioneer in a field almost entirely dominated by men. Said Kavanaugh, who never married: "I had a lot of men say to me, 'Oh, Gere, you can do marvelous designs, but can you cook pork chops?' That was considered a put-down, that you were a professional woman so you probably couldn't cook so you weren't complete. But of course, I could cook pork chops, and very well!" When Kavanaugh began her career in 1952, her status as a “girl designer” made her seem like a novelty among men who had yet to reckon with a talent that Terry Irwin, the head of the College of Design at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, describes as “radical.” Unlike painting or sculpture or photography, design is an artistic discipline that “is so ubiquitous it’s almost invisible,” explained Irwin, 62, a designer who has known Kavanaugh since 1986. “Most people aren’t very aware of what design is about,” Irwin said. “They might think, ‘Oh, Apple designs iPhones,’ or ‘Fashion designers design clothing.’ But if you look around the office you’re sitting in, every single thing in that office, somebody had to design it. “The computer you’re at, a designer designed the interface. The chair. We mediate experiences for people. We give form to material objects that meet people’s needs or delights them.” Koryo silk designs by Gere Kavanaugh  (Photo: Gere Kavanaugh) Said Kavanaugh: “If we didn’t have design, we would be in a terrible mess. Dinnerware is a good example. Just think of eating food, think of the way the cave man or woman ate their food...” But if design is often "invisible," Kavanaugh's signature bold colors, dramatic shapes and expressive lines — evident in such objects as her rectangular tea kettles, her kitchen appliances, her tulip-shaped tables — are made to be admired. ‘What Gere designs is meant to be seen,” Irwin said. “It’s a feast. There’s always a certain kind of exuberance and joy and wit in what she does. You can hear that exuberance when she talks. She whoops!” Islands in the Land, at the Pasadena Museum, by Gere Kavanaugh  (Photo: Gere Kavanaugh) Kavanaugh’s story has been told in museum catalogs, in magazines devoted to art, architecture and design, in a few major newspapers such as The New York Times and in such books as Louise Sandhaus’ 2014 “Earthquakes, Mudslides, Fires & Riots: California and Graphic Design, 1936-1986.” But she hasn’t gotten much mainstream press, and rarely been mentioned in her hometown newspaper, outside of a few “society” columns from decades past. In fact, this article only came about because a friend of Kavanaugh's, Jane Sanderson, a former reporter with the Memphis Press-Scimitar, called to to make sure we knew that a native Memphian had been named a recipient of the 2016 Ladislav Sutnar Prize, an award from the Czech Republic’s University of West Bohemia that recognizes “outstanding international artists and institutions” for their “work and contributions to the world of art and design.” (Another of this year's prize-winners was New York's Pratt Institute, a university of art, design and architecture founded in 1887.) Chair By Gere Kavanaugh  (Photo: Gere Kavanaugh) Gere Kavanaugh lived for much of her childhood in a house (now gone) near Overton Park. "I drew a very unique card," she said, crediting first of all her parents, Frank and Bernadette Kavanaugh. "My father at that time was a rare book dealer in Southern histories, and both my mother and father were exceedingly smart. And because it rained so much in Memphis and there were so many books, I would get out the botanical books my father had and I would try to draw the leaves and plants." Sometimes, young Gere would hold her pencil over the picture on a page and trace its image in the air. "One rainy day my mother found me and I told her, 'I'm trying to feel what these drawings are like.' " Impressed, her parents enrolled her in "junior Saturday school" when she was 8: weekend art classes, sponsored by the city. “I remember vividly to this day my father said, 'I don't expect you to do anything with this but I do expect your life to be enriched by it.' " Kavanaugh attended the old Sacred Heart, a Catholic high school for girls, and then earned a scholarship to the Memphis Academy of Art, then located in the historic James Lee House on Adams Avenue. She also took classes at Memphis State University. She said the "general education" in painting, drawing, sculpture and lithography she received in Memphis provided the "foundation" on which she built her multidisciplinary design career. Gere Kavanaugh is possibly one of the most influential Memphis artists you’ve never heard of. She was recently honored with the 2016 Ladislav Sutnar Prize, an award from the Czech Republic’s University of West Bohemia that recognizes “outstanding international artists and institutions” for their “work and contributions to the world of art and design.”  (Photo: courtesy of Gere Kavanaugh) Said Kavanaugh: "I can still sit down and draw like a dream. That's one of the things that the computer has practically slapped out of everybody. I'm not against computers, but you" — meaning designers — "should be able to draw with your hand, your mind and your eyes combined." Kavanaugh's future began to take a more definite shape when she was awarded a fellowship to be a graduate student at the prestigious and tightly knit Cranbook Academy of Art in Bloomfield, Michigan, which accepted only 125 students a year. She emerged with a Master of Fine Arts degree and "the attitude of being a comprehensive designer," meaning she was willing — eager — to design anything and everything. "When Gere came up, people were taught to completely roam among disciplines," Irwin said. "You could work with an architect doing color for buildings. You might be doing letter forms for tombstones. You might be doing toys or potteries. These days, everybody keeps going deeper into ever narrower categories, so you have a world of specialists, but Gere went everywhere, and my generation cannot do that. We do not have the skill and we do not have the bravery." Toy Village  (Photo: Gere Kavanaugh) “Here in the environment we’re living in right now, where women are trying to get a voice, I think Gere was probably one of the first to be a very, very outspoken female in her field of endeavor,” said Los Angeles graphic artist Nancy Louise Jones, 62, who has known Kavanaugh since 1976. “She has a very rich background of being a pro-active woman.” Out of Cranbrook, Kavanaugh got a job with General Motors in Detroit, where she and her female colleagues made history as the first women hired as designers by a U.S. corporation. To Kavanaugh's consternation, the auto manufacturer's public relations department promoted the women as "Damsels of Design." The women developed such now standard innovations as retractable seat belts and light-up mirrors, but Kavanaugh mostly designed executive offices, exhibitions and kitchen appliances (for Frigidaire, owned by GM). For a 1958 auto show, she created floor-to-ceiling columns made from netting that housed close to 100 canaries. Gere Kavanaugh (at top) was one of General Motors' "Damsels of Design"  (Photo: courtesy of Gere Kavanaugh) After GM, Kavanaugh went to work for Austria-born Victor Gruen in Detroit, and then Los Angeles. You may not know Gruen's name, but you know his work: He more or less invented the shopping mall. "At that time, the East considered California as being next to China," Kavanaugh said. "That has all changed now." In California, Kavanaugh became a freelance designer, sharing space in a $76-a-month Santa Monica bungalow with some of the most important figures in mid-century American design: Gehry; industrial designer Don Chadwick; and the late graphic designer Deborah Sussman. Said Kavanaugh: "We kept our drawings upright in the bathtub because it was the only available space." In 1964, Kavanaugh founded her own firm, Gere Kavanaugh Designs, and since then her life has been a whirlwind of assignments for individuals, brands, corporations and even governments that have transported her all over the world. She designed a research room for the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, which opened in 1990 in Yorba Linda, California. Her "Gere Chair" was odd yet comfortable. She created a now commonplace square-shaped "market umbrella" for patios. Her work began to be recognized, exhibited and purchased by museums. "I always like to carry out a sense of place," she said. "I do a lot of investigation. Why should you travel around the world from one space to the next and arrive at the same attitude you just left? The world is so unique!" Dove Bench By Gere Kavanaugh  (Photo: Gere Kavanaugh) Kavanaugh has some cousins in Memphis, but she rarely comes to her hometown. She'd like to have a reason to return. "I would love to do something for Memphis, whether for a developer or company there or something else. That's what started me, Memphis." 35 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://memne.ws/2kaXIAa

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Scoreboard Check: 5 UWD Services Crush the Broader Market in 2016 Posted on January 27, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann I’m checking off one of my New Year’s resolutions today. It’s something that I plan to do each January from here on out … Review how our subscription-based services performed the prior year. So, I’ve spent the last few weeks combing through each newsletter’s track record and individual trading history for 2016. We had some wonderful success stories. And I’ll share those with you in just a moment. But that’s not all. I’m also not going to hide our less-than-stellar performers like other publishers do. I believe in transparency. And if I were in your shoes, I’d want the full results, So, I’ll show you how each one of our services performed in last year. Like any year, there were winners and losers. But, I’m happy to report 12 of 14 newsletters and trading services (86% win-rate) were in the “green.” Meaning, they booked positive calendar year returns in 2016. As for relative performance, 7 of 14 services (50% win-rate) outpaced the S&P 500 Index (a couple — Income Superstars and Natural Resource Options Alerts — came within 1% of the S&P 500’s total return). And when compared the MSCI ACWI Index (a global benchmark for stocks), we had 10 of 14 services (71% win-rate) outperform. I’m extremely proud of our leaders: Natural Resource Investor, Adventure Capitalist, Global Resource Hunter, Superstar Trader and Wall Street Front Runner. These five ace services absolutely clobbered the overall markets. Each was up an average of 40.02%. That means, as a group, they beat the S&P 500 Index by 235% and the MSCI ACWI by 409%. Just how good is an average of a positive 40% return across five services? Well, consider this: 1958 was the last calendar year when the S&P 500 returned more than 40%! Our Top 10 Trades for 2016 Here are our best individual trades from across the Uncommon Wisdom Daily universe in 2016 … What I love about this list isn’t just that we saw so many triple-digit winners. (Although our subscribers agree that those four rounds of 200%-plus gains were pretty darn nice.) The best part, for me, is that they represent a healthy mix of stock and options trades. In fact, three of four of our 200%-plus gainers were stocks! Now, having big winners doesn’t automatically mean a perfect grade on our annual report card. But it doesn’t hurt! How We Rate the Winners My scoring system is simple. I’m looking at whether a service makes money … whether it delivered what we promised … and whether it beat the market. If it exceeded all three items on my checklist, then it gets an “A.” The “B”s in many cases still beat the market, and the rest need (and are already starting to receive) improvement this year. Whether you want to judge on absolute returns or relative returns, all the data is transparent below. Starting with our newsletters … One of our top 10 winners came from JR Crooks’ Global Resource Hunter. That 209.2% gain in SM Energy (SM) you saw took place in a little over two months. And it was one of five big energy winners he closed out that same week, with gains of 18.5%, 23.3%, 23.6% and 66.1%. I think you’ll agree, that kind of performance — a whopping 36.21% return for 2016 — merits an “A+” grade. Income Superstars is Nilus Mattive’s monthly newsletter that zeroes in on solid dividend-paying stocks that can weather just about any market. Many of the stocks have been in the portfolio for a long time, and their 2016 gains were just a fraction of their overall return. But consider this: Nilus was able to rake in $54,148 in his real-money Dad’s Income Portfolio last year. That’s a total return of 18.5%, or about 50% better than the S&P 500 during that same time! Combine that with an 11.36% return in the model portfolio, and I think you’ll agree — this performance is worthy of an “A” rating. Banned in New York: The Powerful Investment That Seniors in All Other States Should Consider It started out as a crazy encounter with a South Florida financial adviser, but ended up with a breakthrough retirement strategy that Seniors in 49 of the 50 states should seriously consider right away. Click here for the full story. Internal Sponsorship Grant Wasylik has done a great job in his first year at the helm of Disruptors & Dominators. He led members to a 48% gain in Spirit Airlines (SAVE) in just four months and closed out a 78% gain in First Mining Finance (FF.V). But then Mylan (MYL) got rocked by controversy about its EpiPen pricing and Stratasys (SSYS) failed to launch into the stratosphere. Our “B+” rating leaves room for improvement. And with all the current gains on our open positions list — building on top of the 9.32% gain last year — we are confident we’ll make the mark again this year. Cash Flow Kings — Rather than following time-tested metrics like cash flow, traders are reacting to everything President Trump says and does right now. And it’s easy to feel behind-the-curve when the curve twists wildly each day. But that doesn’t mean investing in well-run, cash-rich companies won’t pay off over the longer term. Our stocks are up more than 5% this year alone, with longer-term holds in Visa (V) and Apple (AAPL) up 56% and 81.5%. And newer positions like Reynolds American (RA) and Boeing (BA) are up 26% and 27% in just few months. We take our “B-” rating and our 6.32% return as a challenge to do even better in 2017. *** Some of our biggest individual winners came from our trading services. You saw one of these names already in the chart above … Grant Wasylik’s Adventure Capitalist, posted a steady stream of double- and triple-digit winners. In fact, our two biggest winners from the year came from this service. When it comes to banking big gains from small stocks, members got to do just that. And thanks to its 40.80% return for the year, this service earned its “A+” grade handily. Grant’s Wall Street Front Runner service also gets high marks. It didn’t crank out huge gains like his other service, but it did produce a steady stream of short-term (average time in trade: 2.7 days) gains in 66 stocks. At year-end 2016, the service was just eight months old and boasted a 54% win-rate. And with a 34.61% return (a combination of “core” and “bonus” trade performance for simplicity’s sake) last year, it’s definitely showing its “A+” game so far! My Global Trend Trader targets three stocks a month with big potential to move fast, and tells us to sell the rest. This makes it easy to hit the exits, but that’s meant giving up some bigger gains along the way. Our Crash Protection Portfolio treaded water, which I’m OK with because that means we didn’t have a major crisis that caused this protection to kick in. I’m giving this service a “B+” for beating the market (with a 15.64% return) and having some exposure to gold and bonds if/when we need it. And my 10-Minute ETF Trader service delivered on its name — a set-it-and-forget-it approach to trading that targets the three strongest ETFs we follow each month. Our favorite story was a 17.4% one-month gain in the iShares Silver Trust (SLV). Otherwise, we tracked a series of single-digit wins and losses. I’m giving us a “B-” here. To boost that grade, we are looking at expanding the ETF universe we cover. If we see better performers than the ones we have (which generated a 5.33% return in 2016), we will happily make the switch to deliver even-better results. *** As we’ve seen so far, “slow and steady” can win the race. But we don’t always notice the smaller gains as they happen until they add up. That’s why we enjoy those big winners when we see them. And that’s why we have several options services — to go for those big gains, as often as we can! JR Crooks has two services on this list, both with high marks. His Natural Resource Investor service hit its stride this year. Here, JR led his subscribers to a series of double-digit gains all year in all sorts of commodity plays. The 53.25% return in 2016 is proof that you don’t need to spend a king’s ransom to generate regular gold gains. It’s an “A+” all the way here for our top-performing service across Uncommon Wisdom Daily. Nilus Mattive’s Superstar Trader was also a superstar performer. It shows 32 separate closed profits vs. zero booked losses for 2016. This means he generated consistent results from the early-year volatility through the year-end rally, and everything in between. With a 35.21% return last year, this is a very easy “A” to award. JR makes this list again with Natural Resource Options Alerts, which generated a few of our Top 10 trades that you saw earlier. (You also saw his keen ability to trade oil stocks and ETFs in Global Resource Hunter. Click here to see a brand-new report from JR about one of the newest trends he’s following.) In Natural Resource Options Alerts, JR helped his subscribers play the crude oil market like a fiddle with leverage. Here are the energy options trades he closed in the last six months of 2016 … The service hit a rough patch in the summer months. But most options traders know that there are just as many swings and misses on the way to going for (and getting) the big gains. Here, the wins made up for the losses, with an 11.75% return. So, this deserves a strong “B+” rating, in my book. Now, I want address our blemishes, too, rather than concealing them. Our two laggards, Crisis Options Trader and Currency Options Alert, were down 40.11% and 89.26%. They have two things in common. Both launched in 2016, and both focus exclusively on buying options. And that means putting a relatively small chunk of capital at risk (vs. buying stocks) in exchange for the potential (and the leverage) to make big gains. The main difference between these services is that one launched too late, while the other arrived perhaps just ahead of its time. Crisis Options Trader is already taking advantage of two opportunities we missed last year. The first was that it launched after the early-2016 market rout. The second was that we focused more on company-specific risks rather than the macro risks that came to dominate the market. The service did a great job trading the big post-Brexit dip, and generated two of our Top 10 trades listed above. But markets quickly absorbed last year’s geopolitical shakeups, which crushed-our year-end bearish bets. And our winners just didn’t make up for it. I don’t like that “C” rating, so this year we have already started following the biggest risks in the global markets for bigger gains. We’ll also keep sharing our monthly list of “stocks to dump” and making select bets against them. Our idea remains to be positioned for swift pullbacks, but now with exposure to the seemingly tireless bull. Currency Options Alerts wasn’t just ahead of its time as a service, but also with its trades. JR Crooks did a great job in calling world currencies’ near-term direction. But a stubbornly high U.S. dollar last year kept many moves (and their profit potential) muted or delayed. This year he’s looking to buy more time with the trades and to hit the exits faster. I have to give this one a “D,” but I do so knowing that there’s a whole lot of triple-digit return potential this year with the editor, as you saw above, and his strategy. And with the threat of trade wars and currency wars under President Trump, we should have no shortage of opportunities to follow the money all around the world. Look, I’m not proud of those two services’ 2016 results. But, this is what happens some years with options trading. It’s riskier than picking stocks, mutual funds and ETFs. We’ll have big down years like this, but we’ll have big up years, too. We could easily see huge turnarounds in these services. I would not cast them off for one bad year. And as you can see, we have improvements already under way. *** This leaves us with one more service, Blue-Chip Option Alert. Its 13% gain for the year beat the markets, no question. So why did I give it a “C-” grade? It did deliver on its mission to deliver options recommendations on big, liquid, blue-chip stocks. But it ended up offering several trading strategies but not a lot of trades. And while that resulted in a yearly gain, we needed to offer more trades and less confusion. We plan to make some major adjustments here soon. *** Overall, looking at this 2016 report card, I’m proud of the results we posted. But we are also eager to deliver even better results this year. And by next January, no matter what the market brings our way this year, I expect to deliver similar … or even better … results. Either way, you’ll get my 2017 report card in January 2018.

By Jessica LowellStaff Writer Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Email Writer (207) 621-5632 Share Comment Read Article 1 of 5 Guests get red-carpet photos taken as they enter the Kennebec Valley Chamber of Commerce Kenney Awards ceremony Friday at the Augusta Civic Center. Staff photo by Joe Phelan AUGUSTA — More than 700 members of the Kennebec Valley Chamber of Commerce gathered Friday at the Augusta Civic Center for the Kenney Awards, the chamber’s annual celebration of its members. Three of the six awards already had been announced, and three were decided, for the first time, by the attendees of the dinner, voting with their smartphones. Chris Voynik was named the 2017 Cynergy Young Professional. “I will be the first to tell you how challenging it is,” Voynik said in his brief comments, during which he thanked his family and friends for their support and help. Voynik started in business at Maranacook Community High School in Readfield, when he sold energy drinks from his locker. While earning his business management degree at Thomas College, Voynik built his first business, Wag Rags, which with the help of his grandparents, making durable dog toys from recycled T-shirts. Most recently, he has developed an iOS app called e-Clp that allows users with multiple social media profiles to connect across all platforms using Apple’s Airdrop Technology. Jobs for Maine’s Graduates was named the Community Service Kenney Award winner for 2017. “I work with 6,000 of the best kids in the state,” President and Chief Executive Officer Craig Larrabee said, accepting the award. The students in the Kennebec Valley and their community service projects, he said, are second to none. Jobs for Maine Graduates is a public-private partnership that strives to give Maine students the skills they need to succeed in school, in college and in the workforce, including financial literacy, college transition skills and community service learning. Last year in the Kennebec Valley, 660 students in nine schools performed 3,200 hours of community service and raised $12,000 for nonprofit organizations in their communities. The Snow Pond Center for the Arts was picked as winner of the President’s Choice Award, which recognizes organizations that show leadership in their business and has an exemplary community impact. “This means so much to us,” said John Wiggin, executive director of the Snow Pond Center for the Arts, when he accepted the award. “There are so many of you that have been supportive of what we have done.” Snow Pond Center for the Arts, with roots that reach back 80 years to the New England Music Camp, has grown into a music and performing arts education center. With Executive Director John Wiggin, the organization made the shift from a summer program to a year-round music education enterprise through the Snow Pond Community Music School. It also developed introductory programs in music at its own facility and at locations throughout central Maine to broaden its reach. In 2016, the Snow Pond Arts Academy opened in Sidney with 110 students. The winners of three other Kenney Awards already announced also were recognized. Emery’s Meat and Produce, of Gardiner, was selected as the chamber’s 2017 Small Business of the Year. Leon Emery gave thanks to those who helped him start his business in Augusta and establish is Gardiner store. Performance Foodservice — NorthCenter was named the chamber’s 2017 Large Business of the Year. Greg Piper, regional president, said the recognition meant a lot to his company. “I have the honor of accepting the award, but I am accepting it on behalf of the employees, They are the reason for our growth.” He said they have accepted the changes brought about by changes in ownership, and it’s their work that has made Performance Foodservice — NorthCenter one of the top-performing companies in its corporate group. Mark Johnston received the Peter G. Thompson Lifetime Achievement Award for 2017, Johnston said the award was more meaningful because it has been named for his friend, Peter Thompson, and he was humbled to be standing among the evening’s honorees. “I wouldn’t be standing here this evening without the help of hundreds of people,” Johnston said, including his parents, his employees and his wife, Judy, and daughter Elizabeth. “I have tried to keep a balance between family and work and civic responsibilities, and if anyone suffered, it was them. I could not do what I do without their love and support.” In addition to the other awards, Augusta police Deputy Chief Jared Mills was named the volunteer of the year. The event drew more than 700 people to the Augusta Civic Center. Jessica Lowell — 621-5632 [email protected] Twitter: @JLowellKJ Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Shares of the world's biggest software company rose as much as 2.1 percent to $65.64, an all-time high, in early trading, valuing the company at $510.37 billion. The last time Microsoft was valued more was in March 2000, during the heyday of the dotcom era, when it had a market value of a little above $550 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Despite the gains, Microsoft still lags Apple's market capitalization of about $642 billion and Google-parent Alphabet's market value of a little more than $570 billion. Microsoft reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat analysts' average estimate for both revenue and profit, mainly due to its fast-growing cloud computing business. The company's profit and revenue have now topped Wall Street's expectations in seven of the last eight quarters. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant nearly three years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company's efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. When he took the top job in February 2014, the company's stock was trading at around $34 and its market value was roughly $315 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. "The pieces are falling into place as we are starting to see an important shift in the model, with improving profitability in growth segments," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, boosting the median price target to $68.50 from $68.00. Of the 37 analysts covering the stock, 27 rate it "buy" or higher, eight have a "hold" rating and two "strong sell".

By Guest Author on January 25, 2017 January 25, 2017 by Guest Author 026 By Sanjay Sinha, Head of Fortumo India The Watal Committee’s recent report on digital payments brought some long-awaited clarity to the digital payments ecosystem of India. I believe I speak on behalf of all mobile operators, service aggregators and digital merchants using carrier billing when I say we are glad to see direct carrier billing was touched upon in a positive manner in the report; and it is not an exaggeration to call their recommendations on carrier billing revolutionary. Carrier billing has so far been an afterthought in the digital payments industry of India due to an outdated perception on the nature of the payment method; for some, carrier billing still means conventional utility of payments for ringtones, logos and other simple VAS products. If we look at other countries across the world however, the picture is drastically different. Most recently even Apple – the world’s most valuable technology company – has implemented this payment method in their App Store. In Europe, carrier billing has also passed over to the physical world and can be used to pay for services like taxi booking, parking fees and even physical purchases in vending machines. While other countries have pushed forward with regulation that has allowed adoption of carrier billing on a larger basis, so far we have been lagging and regulation has proven to be a big stumbling block. One example of this is the logic of carrier billing payments only being allowed for services consumed on mobile devices. People already are listening to music through Spotify on both their mobiles and laptops; they are purchasing games from Google Play on their phones but also playing them on their tablets without SIM cards etc. There is no single point of consumption for digital services and with access being available from any device, payments should be too. Advertisement Another example has been the enforcement of double opt-in for transactions done through carrier billing. This regulation is understandable in the context of legacy VAS services where it has been done to protect the consumer. To combat fraud, there are many other measures, some of which we have highlighted in a recent white paper. For modern digital services, having such limitations in place does not make sense and reduces attractiveness for merchants to implement the payment method as well. Especially now, as there is a double standard in comparison with card-based payments.   But it is welcome to see that Watal Committee is seeing the potential for growth and expansion of the payment method and hopefully the issues mentioned above will get cleared up as well. Our estimates (based on annual financial reports and our own internal payments data) show that in Europe, depending on the market, up to 20% of people are using carrier billing. We feel the uptake in India could be even higher as Europe has strong bank infrastructure while in India carrier billing could be the default digital payment method for large sections of users who have not been reached by banking and other payment systems. The recommendation of enabling carrier billing for low value transactions in a “sandbox environment” with light touch regulation has the potential to bring carrier billing on par with other forms of digital payments. This is a welcome stance, especially after the recent RBI clarification on TRAI queries about prepaid balance on digital purchases, which was a big disappointment and led to many large carrier billing projects being stalled or curtailed by telecom operators. The order had also put a big ambiguity over carrier billing in India. The Watal Committee recommendation then not only clears the dark clouds over carrier billing, but shows a way forward to put carrier billing in its right place in digital ecosystem in India.  The committee clearly and correctly recognizes the fact carrier billing could be a very important tool for India where other forms of digital payments have somewhat limited reach as compared to carrier billing. After all, virtually everyone already owns a mobile phone and a SIM card, which makes it potentially the second most available payment method after cash. The recommendations, if implemented in the right way, can lead to expanding the reach of carrier billing from digital entertainment to a wide array digital services, like taxi booking, classifieds, healthcare and education. Mobile operators, digital service companies and finally consumers would gain greatly from the implementation of the recommendations. And this is not just to get access to paid entertainment, but in the longer perspective, services that improve their quality of life. We should, however, exercise necessary caution, with optimism of course, because these are just recommendations. A lot will now depend on how and when these are implemented. A lot also needs to be done by the telecom operators on the business model front; allowing higher revenue share for merchants on par with global standards would go a long way in making carrier billing a viable, if not first choice of many merchants. * Also read: On making carrier billing independent of carriers Watal committee recommends light touch regulation for carrier billing in India Image Credit: Image by Robbert Noordzij, used under CC BY 2.0, from here. 026 Related #carrier billing #Digital Payments #Fortumo #Sanjay Sinha #Views #Watal Committee Related Watal Committe Report recommends regulation for Carrier Billing in India After carrier billing, Fortumo looks to integrate wallets for mobile transactions Sony LIV to offer carrier billing in partnership with Fortumo Fortumo Opens Indian Office; Appoints Sanjay Sinha As General Manager Fortumo to offer carrier billing insights to mobile operators Updated: Fortumo Partners 4 Indian Telcos To Launch Direct Carrier Billing; Telco Rev Share Ratio < Previous Next > Identity politics in banking technology Idea to raise Rs 2000 Cr through issue of private bonds John BaRoss Direct Carrier Billing [DCB] is now available in over 115 countries globally. Globally DCB is a ~$12B sector of the Carrier Commerce industry, projected to grow to over $20B in the next 3 years. DCB began over 20 years ago near the dawn of monetizing the Internet, focused initially on micro-payments. As mentioned in this article, DCB is now used as a payment option for digital and physical goods. DCB has proven to help bring sizable populations off the sidelines of eCommerce and into the mainstream of the global digital economy. As Carriers have over 7B accounts globally, DCB (along with Carrier Mobile Money – also a multi-billion dollar global sector of Carrier Commerce – are flagship solutions having the most impact with advancing financial inclusion to the ~2B+ unbanked globally thanks to the nearly ubiquitous reach of Carrier billing today – which is unmatched – along with the known and trusted billing relationship Carriers have with billions of people globally. Along with the four Carriers in India involved with launching Payments Banks (another sector of Carrier Commerce), there is compelling promise to advance financial inclusion in INdia, home to the largest population of unbanked in the world.

Name: Subject: Message: Android emoji – everything you need to know Features How To The Bestby Edgar Cervantes8 hours ago 4 358 15 Emoji seem to have taken over the world, with emoticons quickly becoming a dying tongue around the inter webs. And for good reason; these little icons offer a convenient and friendly way to express emotions. Even turds look cute when pictured as emoji! But what about us Android users and enthusiasts? You may recall that for a while emoji just showed up as lame squares, and in some cases that continues to be the case. This is because the first major phone maker to adopt these was Apple, in an attempt to attract more users from Japan (where emoji first became popular). It didn’t take long for this to explode and become the amazingly popular trend it now is, with most smartphone users adopting the cute hieroglyphs. See also: Where did emoji come from? November 2, 2016 Want to learn more about how emoji came to be? We have gone through the whole story in a separate post, which you will find right above. What matters here is that Android now has support for emoji (and has for a while, of course), but your experience will vary depending on multiple factors. Our plan here is to take you through an extensive guide on the Android emoji experience. Shall we get started? Not always supported! While Android does officially support emoji, these cute icons don’t exactly work with every device. Emoji officially entered the Android world with version 4.1 Jelly Bean, but those were black and white versions of the colored symbols. It wasn’t until Android 4.4 KitKat that Google decided to integrate colored emoji to their operating system. Then came Android 7.0, which brought compatibility with Unicode 9 emoji. This means your experience will vary depending on the device and software version you are touting. It’s worth noting the vast majority of people are somewhere above Android 4.1, though. According to Statista, only about 2% of Android owners were using anything under Android 4.1 as of September 2016. This means most of you can enjoy emoji at least to a certain extent. You probably know whether your phone sports emoji support or not, and how these would look. Are you seeing a bunch of squares when iPhone users send you messages? Do you see simpler icons in black and white? You know the deal. Apps with emoji support Regardless of whether your phone supports emoji or not, the experience won’t be as streamlined as we wish. Some applications will get emoji support only with certain Android versions. The guys over at caniemoji.com have put together a table clearly showing where each of the most popular apps stand. Let’s take a look. We will go through some of the most popular apps with native emoji capabilities. Facebook Messenger This tool, which has replaced every other form of communication for many of us, comes with integrated support for emoji. There is a button on the bottom corner of the screen, when you open a conversation, which shows four little faces. Just tap on it and you will be presented with a plethora of emoji to use on your conversations. Furthermore, if you are worried about having emoji support for text messaging, you will be glad to know the app can also replace your stock SMS app. Download Facebook Messenger WhatsApp In WhatsApp you can simply open a conversation and tap the happy face icon located on the bottom-left corner of the screen. There’s all kinds of emoji there! Download WhatsApp Hangouts We know it’s hard to get people to use Hangouts, but also know the true Android fans out there stay true to Google’s messaging service and utilize it whenever they get a chance, so we just had to add this service here. Getting to the emoji is easy. Open a conversation and look at the bottom-left corner of the screen. There will be a happy face there, which will unveil all supported emoji with simple tap. Download Hangouts Google Messenger Most Android phones nowadays come with Messenger pre-installed, but that wasn’t always the case. Some phones still prefer going with alternative apps. The good news is anyone can get this application from the Google Play Store. This SMS app is simple, yet feature-full. But let’s get to the point – one of its wonders is native emoji support. Simply open or start an SMS conversation and look towards the bottom-right section of the screen. Once again, the smiley face will be there. Tap it to see all available emoji. Download Google Messenger Google Allo Allo is Google’s own WhatsApp-like service. The application links to your phone number and Google account, offering all kinds of neat messaging features. Among them is full emoji support. These can be found on the bottom-right corner of a conversation screen. Download Google Allo Snapchat Snapchat and its disposable nature also make for a good emoji conversation. You can even create your own emoji characters! They call these “Bitmoji”, but that is a whole other story. The point is you can totally make use of all those happy faces within the app. They become available when creating a snap or sending a message. Within the message screen, simply open a conversation and the option will appear on the bottom-right corner of the screen. Download Snapchat Skype Still using Skype? You can enjoy emoji too! Just open any thread and find it on the bottom-left area of the screen, next to the text input option. Download Skype Keyboards with emoji support Sometimes you just don’t want to deal with app solutions. All these services have emoji options in varying areas and deal with them in different ways, making for an inconsistent experience. Using emoji straight from the keyboard may be a better alternative. There is a sea of keyboards with emoji support out there, but we will give you a few of the most popular ones to get you started. Gboard Want to stick with Google applications? This is the tech giant’s very own alternative and works like a charm, especially when trying to send cute turd emoji to your friends. The main feature here is the ability to search for these, as opposed to simply browsing through them. If you know what your emoji looks like, you can just type in a description and find the right icon (e.g. poop). The process takes a couple steps. Find the comma button, located towards the bottom-left area of the keyboard. Press and hold, then select the smiley face. There will then be a search option right above the emoji, if you would rather conduct a search. Download Gboard Swiftkey Swiftkey continues to be a favorite among many an Android user, mostly for its magical prediction and customization prowess, but it is also great for sending emoji. Just press and hold the enter button (bottom-right area of the keyboard) to see all your options.   Download Swiftkey Swype Swype is another very popular keyboard. And yes, it does also feature emoji support.  It is not the most convenient way to emoji, but support is there. Simply start typing something like “smile” and the respective emoji will appear in the prediction options. Keep in mind this is the only paid app in this app. It costs $0.99, but they do offer a free trial. Download Swype See also: Guess which country uses the most emoji every day? 🤔 September 10, 2016 Wrapping up You are now ready to join the emoji party!

Spiralling business rates; the living wage; online behemoths like Amazon ruthlessly undercutting you at every turn. Why someone with Dixons Carphone boss Sebastian James’s illustrious pedigree should wish to be involved in such an increasingly thankless industry is anyone’s guess. As the third son of the landowning Lord Northbourne, he’s hardly short on well-placed connections. Success: Sebastian James is on course to collect a £4.9m package as a result of the merger After all, he holidays with David Cameron, with whom he’s been best pals since they were at Eton and Oxford together. Take a peek at the infamous Bullingdon Club photo which stalked the former Prime Minister throughout his political career, and you’ll see James’s cherubic face staring back at you from the front row. He hardly looks like your average high street grafter. In fact, he’s more groovy geography teacher than buttoned-down executive. Open-collared Johnnie Boden shirts and casual slacks are his everyday uniform. During occasional television spots, he wears a sports jacket, which might well have been flung over him by a press officer moments before going on camera.

Share this article Share At weekends, he tootles around the Oxfordshire countryside in a raffish, Terry-Thomas-style Austin Healey, a gift from his wife Anna last year for his 50th birthday. If Sebastian (Seb) is in the mood to ride his fancy motor with the top down this weekend, few would hold it against him.  Dixons Carphone has reported a 6 per cent boost in trading over the past 10 weeks, its fifth consecutive year of growing Christmas sales.  If that hardly sounds earth shattering, it’s worth remembering where Dixons was when James arrived as development director back in 2008.  Few who set foot inside one of its branches back then would have predicted it would still be alive today, let alone in relatively rude health. Stores were tatty and unloved, its products over-priced. Its staff, sulky and ignorant, had become a nationwide joke.  He and chief executive John Browett together masterminded a turnaround plan, retraining demoralised workers and sprucing up its product ranges. When Browett departed for Apple in 2012, James was catapulted into the hot seat. Turnaround: Dixons and mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse merged to form Dixons Carphone It was his decision to embark on the £3.2bn merger with Carphone Warehouse, after hitting it off with Carphone’s founder Sir Charles Dunstone.  At the time, the move was greeted with a fair few scoffs of derision. ‘Two drunks propping each other up at a party,’ was how one observer viewed this union of tired-looking high street staples. But two-and-a-half years on, the shares in the firm – which comprises Dixons, Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse – are up nearly 60 per cent and James expects profits have increased this year to somewhere just under £500m. This year, he is on course to collect a £4.9m package as a result of the merger. A handy sum, though his fortunes have not always been so rosy. After starting his career as a consultant, working at Bain & Company and then Boston Consultancy, he embarked on a DVD venture in 2003 called Silverscreen. With the advent of online streaming, the business was belly-up by 2006 with James losing a substantial chunk of his own cash.  With four children to consider, these were scary times. There was no redundancy money to fall back on and no immediate job prospects on the horizon. In an interview this week, he said of this hairy point in his career: ‘I remember walking down Pall Mall after seeing a headhunter, convinced I might never get a job again.  Many people were very kind and you never forget them. Some were less kind and you don’t forget them either.’ Friends in Notting Hill recall that for a time James wasn’t doing a great deal. During this period they describe his wife Anna, a former marketing director at Mothercare and Carphone Warehouse who now runs her own firm called Spring Chicken, as the family lynchpin. The pair met in somewhat inauspicious circumstances when Seb was at Boston Consultancy. He interviewed her for a job for which he decided she was unsuited. Fortuitously for him, his colleagues had the sense to recruit her anyway. Once James’s career revived at Dixons, the couple decided to move the family from West London to a £2.3m home in Oxford for the sake of their children’s schooling.  He maintains a small crash pad in the capital, around the corner from Dixon Carphone’s sparse Acton offices.  Away from business, he has experienced a brief taste of political life after (then) education secretary Michael Gove commissioned him to review state-school spending in 2010.  Might James consider following his Bullingdon drinking partner Cameron into public office? He insists not, claiming he isn’t tough enough. Besides, the all-encompassing world of politics would encroach on James’s precious downtime, which he likes to spend playing guitar with his band Numbernine (a cross between Radiohead and U2, apparently). Like I said, a groovy devil. It’s hard to imagine the mundane world of washing machines and flat-screen TVs containing him for long.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Comments (0) Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Apple may be the reigning gadget champ, but it’s facing a fierce battle with e-commerce giant Amazon whose got a surprise winner on its hands — the Echo. One analyst estimating 10 million of them were sold in the latest holiday season alone — And NOW many smart home appliance makers are rushing to hook up with echo’s digital butler Alexa That’s raising questions about where Siri is in this race to turn on our lights, lock the doors, and keep the house warm. But Reuters Stephen Nellis says Amazon has its own challenges. “So the big risk with Alexa and controlling devices around the home like a thermostat is the integration’s not that tight. You gotta buy the device, you gotta download the app, the gotta set it up and then go into the Alexa app and then set it up there and then you can tell Alexa to turn the heat up.” Still, Alexa stole the CES show earlier this month. At the world’s biggest tech gadget show she showed up in LG’s refrigerator, Ford’s car, and in China’s major smartphone maker Huawei’s latest phone. She can control over 250 home gadgets today. For Alexa, smart home companies just need to write code and submit that to Amazon for review. Getting in bed with the iPhone … not so easy. That’s why Apple has less than half the number of things that work with its Homekit system. Gadget makers have to jump through many more hoops with Apple from including special chips that work with Apple’s system to sending the products to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. But that means, they’ll work out of the box. One thing Apple does have going for it... a billion iOS users. If you haven’t noticed while you updated your iPhone to iOS 10 ... look now.

Hatch, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee and leads the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, has met with Cook several times in the past and participated in Apple's ongoing encryption debate with the U.S. government, calling for a private Senate briefing with Apple attorney Ted Olson following the dismissal of the San Bernardino case. During Friday's meeting, Hatch told BuzzFeed he and Cook talked about ways to grow the economy and the technology industry. They also spoke about Cook's trip to Utah in October, where Cook took part in a privacy-related Q&A session hosted by Hatch. "During today's meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, we discussed ways to grow the economy and our tech industry, as well as his recent visit with me in Utah," Sen. Hatch said in an statement to BuzzFeed News. "Given the issues I work on as chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, it's especially useful to listen to innovators like Tim."Cook, along with Apple's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives Lisa Jackson, also had dinner with Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, on Thursday evening. They dined at Italian restaurant Tosca, located near the White House, but it's not clear what was discussed. Cook's meetings with Hatch, Trump, and Kushner follow a December tech summit that saw Cook and other leaders like Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, IBM CEO Ginny Rometty, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss topics like trade, immigration, and vocational education. At the time, Cook told Apple employees he attended the tech summit with Trump because Apple plans to continue to focus on key areas like privacy, security, education, human rights, and combating climate change. "Personally, I've never found being on the sideline a successful place to be," he said. "The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena." Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion, Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members with at least 100 posts.

Rating: 4 Votes CarlJ 3 hours ago at 09:55 pm God forbid Tim meets with successful businessmen who love the United States.We don't really know whether Trump is objectively successful - he refused to release his tax returns, unlike every other presidential candidate for the last umpity years (he made all sorts of excuses, but we still don't have them). We know he talks endlessly about how successful he is, but that's not really worth much. The same guy who wouldn't believe President Obama was born in the US even after being shown all sorts of official proof... and to prove he's a great businessman, all we've got is his tweets about how he's definitely the best and smartest businessman evar, and his name on a bunch of things many of which he doesn't own.

Committee Chairman Orrin HatchOrrin HatchSenate panel to vote on Trump Treasury pick Monday Apple's Tim Cook meets with lawmakers in DC Poll: Nearly 80 percent of voters want Hatch to retire MORE (R-Utah) announced the move late Friday night. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who later established is own hedge fund, testified before the panel earlier this month during a hearing that lasted more than five hours. ADVERTISEMENT Democrats grilled him on a range of topics including the foreclosure practices of his former bank, OneWest, and his use of businesses in tax havens, but it did not appear that there would be significant Republican opposition to his nomination. "Committee members and the American people heard a strong case from Steven Mnuchin on why he should be Treasury Secretary,” Hatch said in a news release. “His seasoned career as a financial leader equip him with the ability to steer the American economy in the right direction. And his commitment to work with Congress to reform our outdated tax code and explore ways to improve our nation’s broken infrastructure system should garner the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle."  So far, the full Senate has confirmed President Trump's picks to lead the Defense and Homeland Security Departments and the CIA. The chamber also confirmed Trump's pick to be ambassador to the United Nations.   Tags Orrin Hatch   View the discussion thread. Most Popular Most Popular Discussed Past: 1 day 1 Surprise!

He has also halted the issuing of visas to the nationals of six other mainly Muslim countries, including Iran, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, for three months, BBC News reports. Mr Trump said the measures were part of new measures to "keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US". Rights groups have condemned the move, saying there is no link between Syrian refugees in the US and terrorism. Under Mr Trump's wide-ranging executive order, all refugee admissions have been suspended for four months. Mr Trump signed the order at the Pentagon after a ceremony to swear in Gen James Mattis as defence secretary. During the ceremony, he said: "I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people."     Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 13:10 • 28/01 Apollo 1 stars commemorated in US 12:50 • 28/01 Zhamanak: Armenian National Congress not to vie for parliament? 12:33 • 28/01 Trump closes US borders to Syria refugees 12:22 • 28/01 Armenian Army day marked at military pantheon (photos) 20:01 • 27/01 Probe reveals causes of military student’s death 19:39 • 27/01 CoE Secretary General to visit Georgia on Jan 30 19:22 • 27/01 Mike Connors, ‘Mannix’ star, dies at 91 19:13 • 27/01 French Constitutional Council rejects Genocide denial criminalization bill 18:36 • 27/01 Bundestag remembers Holocaust victims 18:26 • 27/01 German population hits record high of 82.8 million due to migrants 18:13 • 27/01 Council of Europe marks 16th anniversary of Armenia’s membership 17:51 • 27/01 Russian security service says hackers attacked major banks in 2016 17:29 • 27/01 Russian MPs pass bill to soften domestic violence law 16:59 • 27/01 Doing business in Russia easier than making US $300m investments in Armenia – economist 15:57 • 27/01 Nagorno-Karabakh key foreign policy issue for Russia – spokesperson 15:48 • 27/01 Ombudsman’s representatives visit life-termers 15:25 • 27/01 CSTO offers safeguards only against aggression – ex defense official 15:13 • 27/01 Armenia’s army efficient, capable of accomplishing strategic tasks – minister 14:28 • 27/01 We need free, competitive and fair business environment in Armenia – Karen Karapetyan 13:55 • 27/01 Merkel expected to speak with Trump about Russia on Saturday 13:44 • 27/01 John Heffern’s recent promotion serves to Armenia’s advantage –analyst 13:22 • 27/01 Armenia’s premier, Kuwaiti ambassador discuss development of bilateral economic ties 12:58 • 27/01 Turkey marks Holocaust Remembrance Day 12:45 • 27/01 Military student dies suddenly, investigation launched 12:34 • 27/01 Figures never justify facts – Armenian defense minister on army suicides 11:59 • 27/01 Part of US $200m military equipment delivered to Armenia – defense minister 11:30 • 27/01 Zhoghovurd: Exodus from Armenia’s ruling party 11:05 • 27/01 Putin, Trump to speak by phone for first time on Saturday 10:26 • 27/01 Azerbaijan continues ceasefire violations 10:15 • 27/01 ‘Democratic parliamentary elections vital for us’ – Armenian NA vice-speaker 09:34 • 27/01 Toshiba to sell slice of smartphone memory chip unit 09:21 • 27/01 Mexico condemns Trump's border wall tax proposal 20:26 • 26/01 Armenia’s premier meets with Gyumri businessmen 20:19 • 26/01 Police seek Brazilian tycoon over corruption claims 19:24 • 26/01 New opposition forming in Armenia – Richard Giragosian 19:04 • 26/01 Greece rejects Turkey soldiers' extradition 18:51 • 26/01 Armenia’s prosecutor general, head of CE office in Yerevan discuss issues of mutual interest 18:05 • 26/01 Russia says no direct contacts yet between White House and Kremlin 17:39 • 26/01 No political reason for ex-premier’s statement on secession from ruling party – Eduard Sharmazanov 17:03 • 26/01 Apple sues chip-maker Qualcomm in China 16:52 • 26/01 Armenia interested in Eurasian integration potentials – Karen Karapetyan 16:43 • 26/01 Oscar De La Hoya arrested over DUI 16:30 • 26/01 Ensuring trade turnover growth priority of Armenian-Russian investment fund – minister 16:19 • 26/01 Visa free travel to boost tourism between Armenia, Russia – premier 15:38 • 26/01 US $500 investments in Armenia expected -

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Apple iPhone loses No. 1 spot in China for the 1st time in 5 yrs The iPhone 6s sold 12 million units in 2016 or around 2 percent of all phones sold in China, behind the Oppo R9 – the flagship smartphone of the Chinese brand Oppo Electronics – which sold close to 17 million units, capturing 4 percent market share, according to Counterpoint Research. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Apple's iPhone has failed to clinch the title for the top selling smartphone in China for the first time since 2012, making the US technology giant "vulnerable" in the world's second-largest economy, according to a report released Friday. The iPhone 6s sold 12 million units in 2016 or around 2 percent of all phones sold in China, behind the Oppo R9 – the flagship smartphone of the Chinese brand Oppo Electronics – which sold close to 17 million units, capturing 4 percent market share, according to Counterpoint Research. Oppo is one of the fastest-growing smartphone brands in China which has made its name through high-spec low-priced devices, being sold through bricks and mortar stores. It marks the first time an Apple iPhone is not the best-selling smartphone in China in five years, Counterpoint said, highlighting the rough year the US company has had in the country. Counterpoint noted that China's smartphone shipments reached an all-time high in 2016, growing 6 percent year-on-year to 465 million units, but it noted that Apple still remains "vulnerable" in China. "Apple with slowing traction for its flagship iPhone 6S during last year saw its double-digit negative growth being somewhat offset by relatively healthy demand for the newer flagship iPhone 7 series in Q4 2016," the research said. "However, Apple still remains in a vulnerable position and there is higher expectation already with the next year flagship which is rumored to be substantial upgrade from both design and components perspective." Apple has yet to respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. China struggles The Cupertino, CA-based company has been struggling in China for the last few quarters. In the three months to September 24, 2016, Greater China revenue fell 30 percent year-on-year. Apple has been on a charm offensive, visiting China last year, and announced a USD 45 million research and development center in Beijing. Its market share has fallen from 14.3 percent in 2015, to 10.4 percent last year in China, Counterpoint said. Apple has been squeezed on the higher end of the market by Huawei which has been making a huge push with its smartphones, not just in China, but abroad too. In the mid-tier price range, Oppo and Vivo have released high-quality but lower priced devices and are aggressively taking market share. Oppo's shipments grew 109 percent year-on-year in China, while Vivo saw a 78 percent rise. Huawei was up 21 percent, but Apple was down 21 percent, according to Counterpoint. Even Xiaomi, once the darling of the Chinese smartphone world, saw a 22 percent year-on-year decline in shipments in 2016. "While the smartphone user base is at an all-time-high and maturing, still bulk of the popular models are still skewed towards mid-end which outs a cap on growth for players such as Apple," Counterpoint noted, highlighting one of the biggest challenges for the US company in China. iPhone 8 key But Apple is slated to be releasing a special tenth anniversary edition of the iPhone 8 this year, with leaks and rumors suggesting a major overhaul in design. One report said Apple could be using OLED screens rather than LCD screens, while the display would take up more of the front of the phone. Analysts said the next iPhone will be the key to unlocking growth in China. "The key features which are driving smartphone market have been fast-charging, OLED displays, bigger batteries and dual cameras which were already available. But most were missing in the iPhone 6s. The iPhone 7 Plus has a bigger battery and dual camera but it was beyond the reach of most consumer in China because of price," Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint, told CNBC by phone. "In the iPhone 8, the OLED screen which is rumored will be a positive. I think the next model will be key for Apple."

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech Reviews OnePlus Bullets V2 earphones review: Pretty good for the price OnePlus Bullets V2 earphones review: Pretty good for the price OnePlus Bullets V2 earphones are one of the latest accessories that the Chinese company has brought to India Written by Shruti Dhapola | Published:January 28, 2017 1:49 pm Bullets V2 come with a modest price tag of Rs 1,199 It’s official: OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T have been a hit for the company. But the Chinese technology startup also has other accessories on sale on its India e-commerce portal, and OnePlus Bullets V2 earphones are the latest to join this segment. Previously, the OnePlus Icon in-ear headphones were launched along with the 2015 flagship, and I wasn’t too impressed by these when I had reviewed them. I felt there were expensive at Rs 2,999 and the sound quality just didn’t match up, even though they looked premium. Watch all our videos from Express Technology The Bullets V2 on the other hand, come with a modest price tag of Rs 1,199 and are available on the company’s India online store. So how do these perform in daily usage? Here’s what I thought after using them for sometime. Specifications: Type: In-ear| Impedance: 24Ω | Coil Material: Copper-clad aluminum | Diaphragm: Aryphan Polyarylate | Driver Unit: 9mm dynamic | Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): <1% (1000Hz, 1mW) | In-line remote: Yes | Sound Pressure Level (SPL): 107dB | Rated Power: 3mW | Connector: 3.5mm jack | Frequency Range: 20 – 20,000Hz Price: Rs 1,199 OnePlus Bullets V2 are stylish, and sleek, and fit quite easily in my ears. OnePlus says they have included “anti-allergy silicone ear tips” in these, and the earbuds weigh only 2 gms each. There are extra silicone tips in the box as well, but this time there’s no special case to keep the earphones, like it was the Icon. Since these have been my primary earphones for sometime now, I can vouch for the earbuds being light, and you won’t have a problem if you use them for longer periods, which is what I end up doing on most days. While the earbuds have metal casing on the outside, I’ve noticed quite a few deep scratches on them, thanks to my slightly rough usage. So do keep that in mind. OnePlus Bullets V2 are stylish, and sleek, and fit quite easily in the ears OnePlus says it has “partnered with the German audio experts at LOFO” to create the Bullets V2’s ARYPHAN polyarylate diaphragm, which is “known for its light weight and high vibration frequency.” It’s promising a tangle-free experience with the earphones. While the tangling is still an issue, on the sound quality front, the earphones deliver quite well. You don’t have to crank up the earphones to full, and audio is loud enough to keep most people happy, and even at a high volume, the audio doesn’t crack. If you, like me, listen to a lot more vocals, pop music, the Bullets V2 are pretty good, especially if you consider the price. The vocals sound good, which is what I care most about and the beats are clear. My current music obsessions includes Sia, Ed Sheeran, Chainsmokers, and I sometimes go back to playing Adele or Amy WineHouse or Arctic Monkeys. I used these with the iPhone 6s to listen to music on Apple Music (AAC, MP3 files), also to listen to music via YouTube on the Redmi Note 4. OnePlus Bullet V2 earphones also come with an inline remote control The Bullet V2 earphones also come with an inline remote control, with three buttons; volume up and down and in the middle to pause music, replay or take a call. Long pressing the middle button will trigger the voice assistant on your phone, and I only realised this happens after a couple of instances where Siri popped up in the middle of my music session. Like I said, these have been my primary earphones for sometime, and taking calls on them was not an issue. The audio quality was quite good and clear, even on the voice calls. Overall, OnePlus has done quite a good job with these earphones. For daily use, the Bullets V2 are excellent earphones, especially if you need a more affordable, but sturdy option for the daily commute. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: OnePlus Budget 2017 BusinessArun Jaitley should focus on job creation in Budget: Rating agency Crisil Budget must be presented after assembly elections: Akhilesh Yadav writes to PM Modi OpinionLook at budget algebra, not math Best of Express J-K: Five soldiers feared trapped after Army post caved in under snow in Kupwara district EntertainmentAlia Bhatt, Hrithik Roshan, Karan Johar stand with Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

BlackBerry Mobile announced this week that a new phone - complete with a physical keyboard and dubbed the "Mercury" - will debut Febuary 25 at the annual Mobile World Congress trade show. That follows hard on the heels of an announcement from Nokia, which teased the Chinese launch of its new Nokia 6 phone ahead of a larger Febuary 26 launch event. Nokia? BlackBerry? What's next, the return of Baby-G watches? It may all feel a bit 2002 seeing these phone brands come back into the spotlight, but here's the thing: These are not the phone brands that you think they are. Both of the new smartphones are made by different companies than the ones we knew and loved, as a result of complicated licensing agreements. Read also: BlackBerry's keyboard is back for one last dance The company you know as BlackBerry - Canadian, security-conscious - is focusing its efforts on software to augment smartphones and its auto efforts via QNX - a part of the firm that makes smart dashboard software and has its own self-driving car prototype. While BlackBerry designed the Mercury in-house, it and all other BlackBerry phones will be made and sold by Chinese tech giant TCL. A different company And Nokia is no longer the company that rose to prominence with its old feature phones, though it still makes telecom equipment and other consumer gadgets. But since Microsoft sold Nokia off, the rights to make Nokia-branded phones belong to HMD, another Chinese tech company. Both firms are trying to make a bigger mark in a global smartphone market that's still largely dominated by Apple and Samsung. Picking up a well-known- if slightly dusty - brand from the earlier days of mobile phones is one way to do that. But don't expect exactly the same experience that you had before. Both phones also represent a capitulation of sorts to Google. BlackBerry and Nokia held out for a while using non-Android operating systems for years. (Nokia and BlackBerry each had their own systems for a while. Nokia also moved to Windows Phone while it was owned by Microsoft.) Both failed, in part because they couldn't keep up with the app selection from Apple and Google, as most developers were only interested in making programs for those two platforms. With both phones now using Android, that won't be an issue anymore. Of course, consumers will have to hear more details about these phones before we can judge whether either comeback will work. The success or failure of a phone depends more on its features, price and value than on whether it gives you warm fuzzies by reminding you of tech days gone by. But if you're looking to rock a little retro this year, this could be one way to do it.

Sign up By Catherine Salvador , Christian Post Contributor Jan 27, 2017 | 12:05 PM x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The all-new Cisco Spark Board is created to define how companies conduct their conference meetings. The board has just been announced by the company on Tuesday and it is believed to bring a tight competition with the Microsoft Surface Hub and Google Jamboard. CiscoCisco Spark Board is the product of the company's partnership with Apple. Cisco Spark Board may become the benchmark of how conference meetings should be conducted. The device is compared to function like a tablet, though it has a gigantic screen fit for a video conference. There is also a home button to allow the user to access the main menu easier than before. "For this product, we needed something that was familiar. We needed an experience that was obvious," said senior vice president and general manager of IoT and applications, Rowan Trollope. Trollope's statement pertains to the partnership of Cisco and Apple so that Spark Board can work compatibly with iPhone, though it can also run smoothly with other devices. And since the board is made to be convenient, the home button feature is a perfect fit. Cisco is reportedly focusing on the ease of use and simplicity, which is different from what Cisco has been developing for their other products. The Spark Board can run Spark — a cloud-based service made for collaboration activities. Users can draw images with their fingers, or use an aluminum pen that can also serve as an eraser — just like what a whiteboard eraser does. The screen can also be zoomed in our out by just pinching the screen, similar to what it being done to handsets and tablets. Cisco Spark Board has two variants available: 55-inch and 7-inch sizes. Both variants are capable of supporting 4K display. It also has its own camera, speakers and microphone. The price is set at $4,999 for the smaller version and the $9,990 for the larger one. A $199 monthly fee is required for software update. Share on facebook Share on twitter Share Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit Free sign up cp newsletter!

It seems that this will soon be possible, as Quartz is reporting that scientists have built a Mobile device that can do this exact thing. Well, not the phone yet, but close to it as it’s essentially a DNA analyzing kit that is connected to your phone. Now you might wonder why this is such a big deal, but if you consider that many years ago DNA samples had to be sent away to large laboratories to get analysed in what was a lengthy and very expensive process. Now that can be checked accurately from a phone – and that’s remarkable. There are a lot of very cool things that can be done with this technology, other than just detecting bad guys. There is the obvious security angel that to could offer where a device can only work when the right owners DNA is attached to it, but perhaps the biggest breakthrough will be on the medical front. It’s the kind of technology that can be used by doctors to look at your DNA and determine your history, what you are likely resistant to and be able to diagnose you more accurately or prescribe the right medication for your body. Instead of doctors having to wait weeks to get this feedback, they would be able to do it instantly from their phones. So, you might be curious ho this all works, so I’ll try and break it down to you without going into the specifics of DNA. You can google that all on your own. Stockholm University took a sample of human tissue and could analyze it in a specifically designed attachment which they had connected to a Lumia 1020 smartphone (which I’m sure will annoy Apple and Android purists). The scientist places the tissue sample inside the attachment. As DNA is too small to capture on a camera, an enzyme is used to multiply it 1000 times before a set of chemicals is added which makes it fluorescent. Lastly, the attachment will shine two different lasers on the mixture and with all those DNA snippets emitting light, a smartphone camera will now be able to detect the DNA and it can be analysed correctly. To be fair, it’s still a complicated process and the device is far too bulky or expensive to be used by anyone other than expensive hospitals, but it is still significant progress in DNA processing. The technology is far away from becoming mainstream,  but that a cellphone can be used to drastically improve the ability to save lives is fantastic and just further adds to the innovative usage that we can get out of these powerful devices. I’m sure as the technology improves, it will branch out to police, security companies and eventually become part of our daily lives. Though the thought of someone cloning me based off DNA they scanned from my phone is still pretty scary. Let’s focus on the positive medical benefits for now before reaching too far into the sci-fi realm.

Turns out that people really, really love emoji. Marketing firm Emogi calculates that more than 2 trillion messages incorporating one of the colorful characters were sent by smartphone users in 2016 alone. Marketers used 775 percent more emoji in 2016 than the prior year. There’s an emoji search engine, touch bar, and even feature film. So perhaps it’s not all that surprising that apps with emoji in their description attract more downloads than those with plain old text. That’s according to app developer Novoda, which conducted a study using Google’s Developer Console. It tracked the performance of three different app listings in the Google Play Store, three of which had emojis at the end of the description: a rocket ship, a humanoid holding waste over a recycling bin, and a double-underlined one hundred. A fourth listing — a control group — didn’t have any. Novada exposed 25 percent of Google Play Store users to the emoji-fied descriptions and 25 percent to plain text. More: Google’s experimental new feature lets you search with emojis via Twitter The results were surprising. In Germany and Italy, the “rocket” emoji and “100” emoji boosted downloads by a whopping 20 percent compared to the control group. Users in Poland, meanwhile, showed a clear preference for the “recycling” emoji — downloads did 7 percent better with it than without. The data from other countries wasn’t as clear-cut. Would-be downloaders in Russia, France, Spain didn’t appear to prefer any one emoji over the other. And U.S.-based users preferred the description without the emoji over the emoji-fied listings. More: Apple and Microsoft put the kibosh on a proposed rifle emoji The breakdown likely has something to do with cultural differences. According to a Swiftkey study published last year, countries like Canada were found to use the greatest number of “raunchy” emojis (money, violent, and sports emojis), while France used four times as many “heart” emojis than other countries. Brazil, meanwhile, used more than double the amount of religious emojis (prayer hands, church, star in night sky) than the average. Australia used clothing emoji at nearly twice the average rate. And users in Arab countries were more than four times as likely to use the “flower” and “plant” emojis. The takeaway, Novado said, was that tailored app listings perform better than generic ones. Apps with emojis did 4.5 percent better on average than those without. “[Optimization] has real and measurable effects on [developer’s] revenue,” it said. “Localize your tests to get better results.” One thing’s for sure: Emojis aren’t going away anytime soon. The world’s approximately 2 billion smartphone users send six billion emoji each day. Fully 92 percent of internet users employ emoji in everyday conversation, one-third of them daily. And nearly half of all posts on pic-sharing network Instagram contain an emoji of one form or another. Also watch: Share

To make it, lemongrass and chilli-infused tequila is mixed with ginger cordial and vanilla sugar. The drink is crowned with sparkling wine. Muddled lemongrass and serrano peppers are left to infuse with tequila for three to four weeks, until the alcohol absorbs the heat of the peppers. "Indians love spice. This one is served with sparkling wine, which is mild and balances the tequila's strength once it hits your throat," says Valentine Barboza, who has created the cocktail for the Khar resto-bar.

CALL: 9324839393 COST: Rs 575 Flower power Marigold, most often found in garlands, finds itself in an infusion in the Marigold Fizz. "We take classic cocktails and add our own twist to it," says Aastha Gupta, co-owner, It Happened in New York. The Marigold Fizz is thus a variation of a typical gin fizz. It has marigold-infused Gordon's gin, lime, sugar, egg white and a splash of soda. "Marigold, unlike other edible flowers, pairs really well with alcohol," she adds.

The bartender creates a Hot Chilli Pepper. Pic/Bipin kokate The liquid is then strained and added to the cocktail, which is mixed with house-made almond syrup and rum.

Yash Bhanage, partner at the resto-bar, says, "Here, we have replaced the strawberry with raspberries. We infuse 750ml Gordon's gin with 400gm raspberries for 24 hours, then separate the alcohol using a thin muslin cloth." To make the cocktail, lime juice and sugar syrup are added to the gin; this is then topped with sparkling wine. AT: The Bombay Canteen, Kamala Mills Compound, Lower Parel. CALL: 49666666 COST: Rs 750 Turmeric time As far as infused cocktails go, one with raw turmeric most certainly makes you wonder, "What were they thinking?" Thankfully, the Turmeric Glow at Andheri's newly launched Bombay Cocktail Bar manages to get it right. For this cocktail, gin is infused with turmeric for a week. Ginger juice, made in-house, is added to this, in addition to orange as well as lime juice. The mixologist follows this up with a splash of tonic water, and finishes the drink with some sweet grenadine syrup, to balance out the flavours.

"We infuse the vodka with apple slices and cinnamon bark overnight. To make the cocktail, we muddle cinnamon, add sweet and sour mix with vodka, then pour in the infused vodka and top it off with a cinnamon ice cube,", says Dennis Wu, VP (operations), Glocal Junction.

Walker/Getty Images for City Harvest) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Donald Trump Trump administration Jared Kushner JTA — American Jews are watching the beginning of Donald Trump’s presidency with both fear and hope. Many have expressed worries about some of his supporters’ ties to the so-called “alt-right” movement, whose followers traffic variously in white nationalism, anti-immigration sentiment, anti-Semitism and a disdain for “political correctness.” Those fears intensified when Trump named as his chief strategist Stephen Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News, a site Bannon once referred to as a “platform” of the alt-right. Trump’s strongly conservative Cabinet picks also back policies on health care, the environment, abortion and civil rights often diametrically opposed to the views of most Jewish voters. Yet others have praised Trump’s stance on Israel and his nomination of David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who supports West Bank settlement construction and has expressed doubts about the two-state solution, as US ambassador to Israel. Trump won 24 percent of the Jewish vote, with especially strong support in the Orthodox community. Here is a look at the president’s Jewish advisers who will be helping to shape US policy for the next four years. Jared Kushner Jared Kushner exiting Trump Tower in New York City, Dec. 7, 2016. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Trump’s Orthodox son-in law is serving as a senior adviser to the president. Kushner, the 36-year-old scion of a prominent real estate family from New Jersey, will not receive a salary and will focus on the Middle East and Israel as well as partnerships with the private sector and free trade, according to The New York Times. A day before his appointment was announced, Kushner said he would step down from his role as CEO of his family firm, Kushner Properties. Kushner, who married Trump’s daughter Ivanka in 2009, played a crucial role in the president’s campaign, especially on Israel. He worked on Trump’s speech to the AIPAC annual policy conference that earned the real estate mogul a standing ovation, and helped plan a trip to Israel for his father-in-law last year. (Trump canceled the trip after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed his call to ban Muslim immigration to the United States.) Trump appears to be smitten with Kushner, often referring to his “fantastic” son-in-law when boasting of his pro-Israel credentials. Kushner may have become a household name during the campaign, but he’s no stranger to the limelight. In 2006, at 25, he bought the New York Observer newspaper. Two years later he became CEO of Kushner Properties, four years after his father was sent to jail for tax evasion, illegal campaign donations and witness tampering. In 2015, Fortune named Kushner to its 40 Under 40 list, an “annual ranking of the most influential young people in business.” David Friedman Donald Trump and attorney David Friedman exit the Federal Building, following an appearance in US Bankruptcy Court on February 25, 2010, in Camden, New Jersey. (Bradley C Bower/Bloomberg News, via Getty Images/JTA) Friedman, a bankruptcy expert and longtime Trump attorney, was tapped as the US ambassador to Israel. A statement by Trump’s transition team in December said Friedman, who speaks Hebrew, would serve from Jerusalem, but White House press secretary Sean Spicer said last week that Trump had yet to decide on moving the embassy from Tel Aviv. Friedman, who is in his late 50s, is the son of a Conservative rabbi with a family history of ties to Republican presidential candidates — his family hosted Ronald Reagan for a Shabbat lunch in 1984, the year he won re-election. He lives in Woodmere, New York, in the largely Jewish area known as the Five Towns, and owns a home in Jerusalem’s Talbiya neighborhood, according to Haaretz. Friedman has expressed support for and funded construction in Israeli settlements, and has expressed doubt about the future of the two-state solution, traditionally a pillar of bipartisan US policy in the region. Some of his controversial statements — including slamming backers of the liberal Israel advocacy group J Street as “far worse than kapos” and charging President Barack Obama with “blatant anti-Semitism” — have sparked outrage from liberal groups. Jason Greenblatt Jason Dov Greenblatt, Donald Trump’s top real estate lawyer and an Orthodox Jew, is one of three members on the Republican nominee’s Israel Advisory Committee. (JTA/Uriel Heilman) Greenblatt, the longtime chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, is working as special representative for international negotiations focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, US-Cuba relations and American trade agreements with other countries. An Orthodox Jew and Yeshiva University graduate, Greenblatt studied at a West Bank yeshiva in the mid-1980s and did armed guard duty there. A father of six from Teaneck, New Jersey, Greenblatt said he speaks with people involved in the Israeli government but has not spoken to any Palestinians since his yeshiva studies. He has cited the American Israel Public Affairs Committee as one of his main sources for staying informed about the Jewish state, and helped draft Trump’s speech at the lobbying group’s annual conference in March. Greenblatt, who has said he supports the two-state solution, has implied that Trump will take a laissez-faire approach to peace building. “He is not going to impose any solution on Israel,” Greenblatt told Israel’s Army Radio in November. He also said that Trump “does not view Jewish settlements as an obstacle to peace.” Steven Mnuchin This file photo taken on November 17, 2016 shows Steven Mnuchin arriving at the Trump Tower for meetings with US President-elect Donald Trump, in New York. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP Photo) Trump picked Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who worked as Trump’s national finance chairman during the campaign, to serve as Treasury secretary. Trump and Mnuchin have been friends for 15 years, and prior to being in charge of Trump’s campaign finances, Mnuchin, 54, served as an adviser. Part of what The New York Times describes as one of Manhattan’s “most influential families,” Mnuchin and his father — the prominent art dealer Robert Mnuchin — both became wealthy working at Goldman Sachs. The younger Mnuchin also co-founded the entertainment company RatPac-Dune Entertainment, which has worked on such Hollywood hits as “Avatar” and “Black Swan.” Some saw Trump teaming up with Mnuchin as unusual, considering that the real-estate mogul had consistently bashed Goldman Sachs during his campaign — but it doesn’t seem to have hindered a good working relationship. Stephen Miller Stephen Miller in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City, Nov. 11, 2016. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Trump named Miller, who has played a crucial role in his campaign by writing speeches and warming up crowds at rallies, as senior adviser for policy. Miller, who has described himself as “a practicing Jew,” joined the Trump campaign in early 2016, quickly rising through the ranks to become “one of the most important people in the campaign,” as Trump’s campaign manager told The Wall Street Journal. Previously the 31-year-old worked for seven years as an aide to Trump’s choice for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., helping the lawmaker draft materials to kill a bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill. Some of Sessions’ arguments are similar to the harsh and often controversial statements by Trump on the issue, such as calling for building a wall on the Mexican border and banning Muslim immigration to the US. Though Miller grew up in a liberal Jewish home in Southern California, he was drawn to conservative causes early. As a high school student he wrote a letter to the editor of a local paper in which he slammed his school for providing free condoms to students and for making announcements both in English and Spanish, among other things. Carl Icahn Carl Icahn participates in a panel discussion at a New York Times conference in New York City on November 3, 2015. (Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for New York Times via JTA) Icahn, a businessman and investor, is serving as a special adviser on regulatory reform issues. He is working as a private citizen rather than a federal employee or special government employee. An early supporter of Trump’s candidacy, Icahn, 80, is the founder of Icahn Enterprises, a diversified conglomerate based in New York City formerly known as American Real Estate Partners. He has also held substantial or controlling positions in numerous American companies over the years, including RJR Nabisco, Texaco, Philips Petroleum, Western Union, Gulf & Western, Viacom, Revlon, Time Warner, Motorola, Chesapeake Energy, Dell, Netflix, Apple and eBay. Icahn is a major giver to Mount Sinai hospital in New York City, among other philanthropic endeavors. In 2012, he donated $200 million to the renamed Icahn School of Medicine there. In addition, Icahn established seven Icahn Charter Schools in the Bronx borough of New York. Gary Cohn President and COO of Goldman Sachs Gary Cohn speaks onstage during Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on October 13, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc via JTA) Cohn, the outgoing president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, heads the White House National Economic Council. At Goldman Sachs, where he had worked since 1990, Cohn answered to CEO Lloyd Blankfein and was considered a strong candidate to lead the bank. The 56-year-old father of three has a reputation for abrasiveness, but also for getting things done, according to a Wall Street Journal profile last year. In a 2014 New York Times op-ed, Goldman Sachs executive Greg Smith wrote on the day he resigned that Blankfein and Cohn were responsible for a “decline in the firm’s moral fiber” that placed its interests above those of its clients. Cohn, a Cleveland native, in 2009 funded the Cohn Jewish Student Center at Kent State University named for his parents. Success wasn’t always obvious for Cohn, whose struggle with dyslexia made school difficult for him. But the Goldman Sachs banker, who was featured in a book on underdogs by writer Malcolm Gladwell, told the author that his learning disability also taught him how to deal with failure and that “I wouldn’t be where I am today without my dyslexia.” Boris Epshteyn Boris Epshteyn on June 30, 2015. (Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for SiriusXM via JTA) Epshteyn, a Republican political strategist who appeared as a Trump surrogate on TV, is working as a special assistant to the president. Epshteyn, who is in his mid-30s, also is serving as assistant communications director for surrogate operations. A New York-based investment banker and finance attorney, Epshteyn was a communications aide for Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008, focusing his efforts on the Arizona senator’s running mate, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. He defended Trump on major TV networks over 100 times, according to The New York Times. TV hosts have described Epshteyn, who moved to the United States from his native Moscow in 1993, as “very combative” and “abrasive.” In 2014, he was charged with misdemeanor assault after being involved in a bar tussle. The charge was dropped after Epshteyn agreed to undergo anger management training and perform community service. David Shulkin David Shulkin, the Under Secretary of Health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, leaves a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower, Monday, Jan. 9, 2017, in New York. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Shulkin, the undersecretary for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, will lead the department as secretary under Trump if confirmed by the Senate. He would be the first holdover appointment from the Obama administration, in which he served since 2015. Shulkin, 57, is an internist who has had several chief executive roles, including as president of hospitals, notably Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. He also has held numerous physician leadership roles, including as chief medical officer for the University of Pennsylvania Health System, and academic positions, including as chairman of medicine and vice dean at the Drexel University School of Medicine. As an entrepreneur, Shulkin founded and served as the chairman and CEO of DoctorQuality, one of the first consumer-oriented sources of information for quality and safety in health care. Reed Cordish Reed Cordish attending the Celebration of Xfinity Live! Philadelphia, March 30, 2012. (JTA/Bill McCay/WireImage) Trump chose Cordish, who is friends with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as assistant to the president for intragovernmental and technology initiatives. He will be responsible for initiatives requiring multi-agency collaboration and also focus on technological innovation and modernization. Cordish is a partner at his family’s real estate and entertainment firm, the Baltimore-based Cordish Companies, . Cordish’s father, David, the chairman and CEO of The Cordish Companies and an AIPAC board member, is a friend of Trump. The two met during the mediation process of a lawsuit in which Trump sued The Cordish Companies. And Cordish, who is in his early 40s, has another connection to the Trump family — he was introduced to his now-wife Margaret by none other than Ivanka Trump, who attended the couple’s wedding in 2010 with husband Jared Kushner. Cordish and his wife were listed as co-hosts for a Manhattan fundraiser for Trump’s presidential campaign in October, Jewish Insider reported. Avrahm Berkowitz Berkowitz, 27, is serving as special assistant to Trump and assistant to Jared Kushner. Berkowitz and Kushner met on the basketball court of an Arizona hotel during a Passover program, Jewish Insider reported. The two stayed in touch and Berkowitz went on to work with Kushner in several capacities. After graduating from Queens College, Berkowitz worked for Kushner Companies and later went on to write for Kushner’s paper, the New York Observer. In 2016 Berkowitz, who was then finishing up his last semester at Harvard Law School, directed a Facebook Live talk show for the Trump campaign. Later he worked on the presidential campaign as assistant director of data analytics. Berkowitz’s first cousin is Howard Friedman, who served as AIPAC president in 2006-2010, according to Jewish Insider.

To get The Daily Crunch in your inbox every day of the week, sign up here. Alphabet’s ‘other bets’ start looking like better bets, Microsoft ascends to the clouds and Trump enlists more titans of tech. All that and more in The Daily Crunch for January 27, 2017. And if you’re a billionaire prepper, Middle Earth apparently looks like a pretty good escape route. 1. Alphabet’s letters beyond G are starting to make money Alphabet formed to make sure that it could treat Google and its other businesses with the individual care and accountability that each merits, and now its Other Bets are starting to pay off. During its most recent quarter, it revealed big growth for revenue from that category of its business, and a significant decrease in spending. We’ve seen a lot of action in the Other Bets category to turn things around this year, including shifts from pure research to early commercialization at Waymo and Verity, for instance. Expect this to continue and accelerate through 2017. 2. Microsoft Office and cloud offerings push earnings up Microsoft saw a bit better performance than analysts were expecting in its quarterly earnings, helped along by growth in its Office and cloud segments, which is promising because the company is really restructuring to focus on those offerings as its primary concerns. AI and cloud were the talk of the town on the earnings call, too. Everyone’s betting on distributed, intangible brains. 3. Donald Trump’s manufacturing council includes tech leaders Trump’s preference for a regulation-light industry environment has industry leaders trying to get close to help sway things their way. This time around, a new manufacturing council Trump set up has announced its full membership. The council includes Dell CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and more. If things go south for this administration, which seems like a fairly reasonable possibility, it’s going to be awkward seeing all these industry leaders walk it back. 4. Apple’s looking to boost its AI efforts Apple is in danger of either being or appearing a laggard in the AI world, and that could have big impact on its ability to recruit top talent. Two moves today should help on that front. In iOS 10.3 it’s offering an opt-in feature that would allow Apple to analyze user iCloud data anonymously and use it to drive its intelligent software work. Separately, it also officially joined the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society, with Siri lead Tom Gruber acting as Apple’s representative. This is likely intended to signal to AI talent that the iPhone-maker is actively participating in the field. 5. Snapchat’s big UI overhaul Snapchat hasn’t done much in the way of changing its basic UI, but a new universal search feature is a big difference. The feature arrived for iOS users, and there’s a lot to go through if you’re used to the way things were. Anthony takes a look at the changes in a diet demo. 6. Thiel of New Zealand Peter Thiel is a New Zealand citizen, it turns out. Heck of a backup plan for a guy helping Trump turn the U.S. upside down. 7. Tesla sues Chris Urmson and its former head of Autopilot A lawsuit exposed stealth startup Aurora to the light, since the company co-founded by Chris Urmson and Tesla ex-Director of Autopilot Sterling Anderson was named along with the men as defendants in a civil lawsuit from Tesla. Tesla says its former employee stole company secrets and poached employees – though it was pretty unsuccessful at the last bit, as only two employees ended up going over to the new co., which works on autonomous driving software systems. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:45 | Crunch Report Weekly Roundup: AppDynamics sells to Cisco ahead of IPO, CZI buys Meta 12 hours ago | Anna Escher Apple aims to up its AI smarts with iCloud user data in iOS 10.3 17 hours ago | Natasha Lomas Trump’s manufacturing council includes Elon Musk, Michael Dell and Mark Fields 17 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Alphabet’s bets beyond search are starting to pay off yesterday | Matthew Lynley Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report | Galaxy S8 Coming in March 5 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Snap will reportedly file publicly for its massive IPO late next week 8 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Twitter releases national security letters 9 hours ago | Kate Conger Zuckerberg defends immigrants threatened by Trump 10 hours ago | Josh Constine Comment moderation powered by Up Next Disrupt NY 2017 registration is open, get your extra early bird tickets now Posted 16 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Senior Developer - 41399BR at Harvard University - Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Cambridge, MA, United States) Engineer: Client Support Center at Target (Brooklyn Park, MN, United States) Product Manager at Calldorado (Kongens Lyngby (Copenhagen), Denmark) IT Infrastructure Manager (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland; Berlin, Deutschland) Digital Strategies Manager at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Carolinas Realty (Charlotte, NC, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Thanks, TC Team 10th Annual Crunchies AwardsTicket Prices For The Crunchies Increase In Just 5 Days Get Yours Today Weekly Roundup: AppDynamics sells to Cisco ahead of IPO, CZI buys Meta Posted 12 hours ago by Anna Escher (@annaescher) 0 SHARES Next Story Silicon Valley’s false feminist idol finally makes a peep This week saw numerous acquisitions, three major tech lawsuits and government agencies going rogue on Twitter. These are the biggest stories to catch you up on this week’s tech news. 1. AppDynamics, which helps companies monitor application performance, was supposed to go public this week. But the IPO was called off in favor of a giant $3.7 billion acquisition from Cisco. The IPO would have valued AppDynamics at around $2 billion. While the acquisition was part of Cisco’s long-term focus on cloud software, at its core, the deal was actually a data play. 2. Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s $45 billion philanthropy organization made its first acquisition. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative bought up Meta, an AI-powered research search engine. Meta’s AI recognizes authors and citations between papers so it can surface the most important research instead of just what has the best SEO. It also provides free full-text access to 18,000 journals and literature sources. 3. Donald Trump finished his first week as the president of the United States. Minutes after the inauguration, pages related to LGBT rights and all mentions of climate change were removed from the WhiteHouse.gov site. He signed an executive order that could jeopardize a six-month-old data transfer framework enabling EU citizens’ personal data to flow to the U.S. for processing. 4. President Trump’s Twitter presence is like none other, but his behavior on the social network may prove riskier than initially expected. In addition to the unsecured Android phone he is still reportedly using to access his account, the typos, defamation and informal management of @realDonaldTrump make him an even larger target for hackers. 5. The current administration’s efforts to censor science have already begun. A day after Trump’s inauguration, the National Park Service retweeted pictures of the crowd size at the event. This didn’t sit well with Trump, who reportedly demanded that all National Park bureaus stop tweeting altogether. 6. Apple doesn’t do lawsuits lightly. Hot on the heels of a billion-dollar royalty suit against Qualcomm in the U.S., it’s taking the San Diego-based chipmaker to intellectual property court in Beijing. 7. The lawsuit threatening the future of Facebook’s Oculus VR may have just gotten a lot more expensive. The case claims that Oculus VR stole core VR tech from a ZeniMax Media subsidiary. ZeniMax Media asked the jury to rule against Oculus VR and award $2 billion in compensation, as well as another $2 billion in punitive damages. 8. Tesla has sued the former director of its Autopilot programs, Sterling Anderson. The suit alleges that Anderson tried to poach employees with the intent of starting his own autonomous driving company called Aurora, and of stealing proprietary information from Tesla. 9. Airbnb may be about to acquire payments startup Tilt. The move makes sense, given Airbnb’s recent expansion into experiences. Acquiring Tilt would give Airbnb a leg up in the payments space, specifically payments around social gatherings and events. 10. Alphabet reported mixed earnings for its fourth quarter, and it’s clear that the company’s bets like Play, Google Cloud and its hardware division beyond search are paying off. Microsoft also revealed financials. The company’s growth was led by its Office and cloud segments, which the company is betting on to fuel growth in the future. Verizon (which owns AOL which owns TechCrunch) fell short of analyst expectations and PayPal continued to see strong revenue growth through its Q4. 11. Facebook launched yet another Snapchat clone called Facebook Stories in Ireland on iOS and Android, with plans to bring it to more countries in the coming months. The feature will sit right above the News Feed. The big question here is how Facebook will display this on desktop. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:45 | Crunch Report Apple aims to up its AI smarts with iCloud user data in iOS 10.3 17 hours ago | Natasha Lomas Trump’s manufacturing council includes Elon Musk, Michael Dell and Mark Fields 17 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Alphabet’s bets beyond search are starting to pay off yesterday | Matthew Lynley This Snapchat Spectacles case melted while charging yesterday | Josh Constine Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report | Galaxy S8 Coming in March 5 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Snap will reportedly file publicly for its massive IPO late next week 8 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Twitter releases national security letters 9 hours ago | Kate Conger Zuckerberg defends immigrants threatened by Trump 10 hours ago | Josh Constine Comment moderation powered by Up Next Silicon Valley’s false feminist idol finally makes a peep Posted 12 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Senior Developer - 41399BR at Harvard University - Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Cambridge, MA, United States) Engineer: Client Support Center at Target (Brooklyn Park, MN, United States) Product Manager at Calldorado (Kongens Lyngby (Copenhagen), Denmark) IT Infrastructure Manager (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland; Berlin, Deutschland) Digital Strategies Manager at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Carolinas Realty (Charlotte, NC, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

By SueChang Markets reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks closed mostly lower on Friday after a monumental week that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 20,000 for the first time as investors weighed disappointing fourth-quarter data on domestic economic growth and a spate of earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% fell 7.13 points to end at 20,093.78, after rising on Thursday to close above the 20,000 level for a second straight day. The blue-chip index rose 1.3% for the week. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.09%  shed 1.99 points to finish at 2,294.69, for a weekly gain of 1%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.10% bucked the trend to edge up 5.61 points, or 0.1%, to close at 5,660.78, up 1.9% during the week. Analysts said investors have retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they look for more details on Trump administration’s policies and corporations. “Stocks have been trading sideways since mid-December after a rally after the elections. While favorable earnings and still-favorable economic data underpin most recent gains, markets would still like more clarity on fiscal policies and more clarity from corporations on how they see it would impact them,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve, U.S. Bank. On the economic front, a reading of U.S. gross domestic product showed that economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter and annual growth failed to reach 3% for the 11th straight year. Meanwhile, durable-goods orders also fell in December for the second month in a row. Those lackluster results may have given little cause for enthusiasm among perspective equity buyers. U.K.'s Theresa May meets Trump to talk trade(1:40) U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday will become the first foreign leader to meet Donald Trump since he took office. In a tricky balancing act, she has to lay the ground for a trade deal with the U.S. and avoid antagonizing European leaders. Photo: Reuters “U.S. GDP and durable goods misses dampened some of the enthusiasm we saw earlier in the week. Markets appear to be more interested in digesting recent action than starting anything new with a number of potentially big developments next week,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. Major events next week include the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting and earnings from Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.01% and Facebook Inc. FB, -0.45% Trump met with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May during which the two leaders discussed a new bilateral trade deal as the U.K. prepares to leave the European Union. The summit comes as Trump has pushed an “America first” policy of protectionism and decried multilateral trade deals, while May has promoted her vision of Britain as the biggest proponent of free trade. May also stressed that any trade agreement with the U.S. would put British interests first.

Well, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston has you covered. Federal officials posted a picture of the jaw-dropping scene on Twitter this week, just weeks after uncovering the cash during a money-laundering bust related to TelexFree Inc.’s $3 billion global fraud case. “Photo of $20M seized in box spring following arrest of Brazilian national in scheme to launder proceeds of TelexFree,” the prosecutors’ office tweeted, along with the photo. The image stems from a search conducted Jan. 4 inside the Westborough, Mass., apartment of Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of conspiring to commit money-laundering in connection with the alleged pyramid scheme involving TelexFree. According to the complaint, the internet phone service company ripped off about half of their participants, or roughly 1 million people across the world. Talking money with Trump supporters and protesters(2:44) Just before Donald Trump's inauguration, MarketWatch talked to Trump supporters and women's marchers about money. Here's what they told us. In April 2014, federal agents searched their headquarters in Marlborough — sparking the massive pyramid-scheme investigation. “Later that day, Carlos Wanzeler, one of the founders of the company, allegedly fled to Brazil, his native country, where he has remained,” prosecutors said. “Wanzeler and TelexFree co-founder James Merrill were indicted in July 2014 on charges that they operated TelexFree as a massive pyramid scheme. Merrill pleaded guilty to those charges in October 2016 and is awaiting sentencing.” On New Year’s Eve, Rocha — acting as a personal courier for Wanzeler’s nephew, who is now serving as a cooperating witness — hopped on a flight from Brazil to JFK Airport, the complaint says. He told customs officials he was visiting the Big Apple for one week to celebrate his honeymoon, the Boston Globe reported. After landing, Rocha made his way up to Massachusetts and met Wanzeler’s nephew at a restaurant in Hudson. He received a suitcase with $2.2 million upon his arrival, and then promptly headed to his apartment complex in Westborough, according to prosecutors. Little did Rocha know that agents had been following his every move, and they arrested him soon after. Authorities later searched his apartment and stumbled upon the massive stockpile of cash — hidden under the mattress and inside the box spring, the complaint says. If convicted, Rocha faces lengthy prison time. “The charging statute provides for a sentence of no greater than 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater,” prosecutors said. “Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based on the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.” This article first appeared in the New York Post.

RIYADH: A total of 19,100 counterfeit printer toner cartridges worth SR1.3 million ($346,000) were this week seized from a warehouse in Riyadh, and the owner of a shop arrested, authorities have said. The field inspection team of the Ministry of Commerce and Investment (MCI) found the fake items, which were ready for sale, during a raid on the large warehouse, which has since been shut down. The fake products included cartons of counterfeit toner for well-known printer brands, cartridges ready for sale, packaging bags, rings for closing the cartridges, and stickers and other materials describing the products. The shop owner was arrested pending further investigations, and is set to be referred to the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution. In an earlier raid in the Al-Mursalat area in the north of Riyadh, MCI inspectors seized more than 38,000 counterfeit phone chargers, speakers and batteries for well-known brands including Apple, Samsung and LG. The MCI stressed that its inspection tours will continue, targeting markets, warehouses, shops and commercial establishments. It has called on consumers to lodge their complaints, observations and any cases of fraud or counterfeiting via the toll-free number 1900.

Sayan Chakraborty Uber’s Hyderabad engineering team is ramping up at a fast pace to help support the online taxi firm’s global operations. Photo: Bloomberg Bengaluru: Uber Technologies Inc. will expand its engineering team in Hyderabad to develop tools that will help the company determine fares and driver incentives, as well as support its food and hyperlocal delivery service businesses around the world. Uber did not give details of the number of people it wants to hire. The Hyderabad team, currently 25-strong , will provide technology support for its food delivery service UberEATS and hyperlocal delivery service UberRUSH. ALSO READ | Uber to bring UberEATS, its food delivery app, to India “The Hyderabad engineering team is ramping up at a fast pace to help support our global operations,” a spokesperson for Uber in India said in an emailed response to a query. “It is working on fintech platform and are building tools that are used across Uber worldwide. India is just one of the over 70 countries it serving.” In July 2015, Uber signed a memorandum of understanding with the Telangana government to set up a technology and innovation centre in Hyderabad at an investment of $50 million over a period of five years. That centre currently employs 400 people. Uber also launched a technology centre in March last year in Bengaluru, where a team of 50-odd engineers are working on products around payments, vehicle intelligence and mapping, among other areas, Mint reported on 9 December. ALSO READ | Uber betting on Bengaluru technology centre to drive product innovation India has become an attractive destination for global companies to set up engineering centres. The long list of companies that have done this includes multinationals Apple Inc, Target Corp, Amazon.com Inc, JC Penney Co. Inc, Salesforce.com Inc and Twitter Inc., as well as start-ups such as Indonesia-based Go-Jek. Factors such as the availability and cost make India an attractive destination for companies wanting to set up technology centres according to a September 2015 study by researcher Zinnov. India has emerged as one of the most important markets for Uber after selling its China business to local rival Didi Chuxing.

Thanks a lot Shaun! For the uninitiated, Fire Emblem Heroes was announced earlier this month during a Nintendo Direct broadcast and pits characters from the Fire Emblem universe against one another in free to play battle. Cynicism about free to play aside, Fire Emblem Heroes actually looks really decent as far as free to play collect-a-thon battlers go. Check out these first two videos which showcase some of the many characters you'll see in the game, followed by the official trailer for Fire Emblem Heroes. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Fire Emblem Heroes is scheduled for release on iOS and Android next week on February 2nd, and through January 31st you can vote for which characters you'd like to see added to the game. You can also pre-register for the game on Android through the Google Play store in a similar fashion to how Apple allowed you to be notified when Super Mario Run was released, and let's hope the Android version of notifying works in a more timely fashion than Apple's did. If you aren't in need of any notification then simply look for Fire Emblem Heroes to arrive next Thursday.

Mobile by Rick Broida January 27, 2017 5:00 AM PST @cheapskateblog Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) You can teach an old iPhone new tricks. CC Yutaka Tsutano/Flickr The iPhone has been around a full 10 years now, meaning at some point you've probably upgraded to a newer model. (Possibly several newer models.) And whenever you do that, you're left with your old phone and a question: What should I do with it? Most common answer: sell it. That's a good way to help defray the cost of the upgrade. However, that's not the only option, and not necessarily even the best. Instead, consider repurposing that old iPhone. You might be surprised at some of the feats it can perform. Keep it as a backup phone It's a hard truth: Phones get lost, stolen and broken every day. I don't know about you, but I'd be in pretty dire straits if something happened to my phone. The straits would be less dire, though, if I could just grab my previous-gen iPhone. I'd still have access to my calendar, contacts, iMessages and the like (because they're all synced), along with daily-use apps like Facebook, Spotify, Twitter, my password manager and so on. There's really no better short-term rescue option. In fact, if you still have your new phone (assuming it's busted and not lost or stolen), you can probably just pop the SIM card out and back into the old phone, restoring voice and data until repairs are made. Of course, you don't have to stick the old phone in a drawer and leave it there in case of disaster; you can also keep it as a low- or even no-cost second line. For example, if it's an unlocked GSM model, grab a SIM card from Freedompop (about $13) and sign up for the WhatsApp Basic plan. It affords you 100 voice minutes, 100 text messages and 200MB of 4G data per month -- at no charge. Add it to a multi-camera video shoot Enlarge Image Collabracam Whether you're recording a wedding, a kid's soccer game, a music video or your sure-to-win-the-film-fest indie movie, nothing beats multiple cameras. When it comes time to edit, you can mix footage from different angles and positions to create much more interesting video. Needless to say, your old iPhone can make a great second camera. (Models dating back to the iPhone 4S could capture 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution video at 30 frames per second.) Clear out as much storage as possible to make room for new footage and you're good to go. Even better, spend $4 (AU$6, £4) on Collabracam, an iOS app that links multiple iPhone/iPad cameras (up to six) for live multi-camera video production. It's pretty amazing. Indeed, once you start using Collabracam, I guarantee you're going to start hunting down more old iPhones to add to the mix. Use it as a baby monitor Speaking of video, an iPhone with nothing else to do can easily pull baby-monitor duty, and in fact can rival or even exceed standalone products costing a pretty penny. All you need is Cloud Baby Monitor, a $4 (AU$6, £4) app designed expressly for this purpose. In addition to both audio and video monitoring (with alert options for both), the app can play lullabies and white noise (or even your own playlist) to help baby get back to sleep. There's a night-light option (with brightness control!), two-way audio and more. Needless to say, you can tap into the audio/video feeds from anywhere, provided the iPhone is connected via Wi-Fi. That's a pretty solid return on a $4 investment. Give it the GoPro treatment Stick your old iPhone where you'd normally stick a GoPro. Velocity Clip One final video option: Turn your old iPhone into a GoPro. Again, that's a solid camera in there, so all you need is a way to mount it for action-video duty. Velocity Clip, for example, offers iPhone mounts for your bike, chest and head, all of them priced in the $40-50 range. Granted, an iPhone is a little unwieldy when strapped to your head, but it's still way cheaper than buying a separate GoPro. Whatever mount option you end up with, hit up Ebay for a cheap Bluetooth camera-shutter button. (They're available for as little as $2-3.) That way you can start and stop video recording without having to fiddle with the iPhone while it's mounted. Create a poor-man's Amazon Echo If you've ever used an Amazon Echo, you know the joy of being able to say things like, "Alexa, play some Steely Dan on Spotify." Many folks forget that iPhones have an "Alexa" as well in the form of Siri. Thus, you can turn your old iPhone into an Echo of sorts; just leaved it plugged in someplace within earshot, then say, "Hey, Siri" to invoke a command. (If you need a refresher, here's the complete list of Siri commands to date.) To get even closer to the Echo experience, keep that phone connected to a Bluetooth speaker. If you're an Apple Music user, Siri can serve up songs, playlists and the like (podcasts too, provided you have Apple's Podcasts app). Alas, while she can open third-party apps like Spotify for you, she can't yet make them play. The one exception is Pandora: Say, "Hey, Siri, open Pandora," and the app will start playing whatever was your last station. Leave it on your nightstand An old iPhone might just be the best thing to hit your nightstand since the lamp. Because in that one spot it can serve countless purposes: Bedside clock (Disappearing Bedside Clock ($3, AU$5, £3)) is an interesting choice, as the display disappears after a selected interval, but reappears when you tap the screen or wave your hand in front of it). Alarm clock (check out iOS 10's new alarm feature, but don't overlook third-party apps like SpeakToSnooze, which features some cool voice-control options). Clock radio (TuneIn Radio is a good choice, as it has both alarm and sleep-timer features). Dedicated ereader (iBooks, Kindle, Nook, OverDrive...you don't have to limit yourself to a single app). Meditation player (I'm partial to Buddhify, but there are a zillion others). Spare Roku remote (check out the latest update). White-noise machine (I don't have a particular favorite; hit up the App Store for lots of choices). Any other suggestions for an iPhone by the bedside? Or anywhere else, for that matter? Let's hear your ideas for reusing your leftover handset.

Hear us out. By Sean Swaby I love my family, I enjoy my relationships and I receive a great deal of satisfaction from my life. But sometimes, I just need to disappear. Juggling the demands of life can wear at you. Life can be like sandpaper, constantly scratching your edges. This is stimulating and life-giving. Sometimes you just want it to stop so your mind can catch up… But life doesn’t stop between floors. Pressures from work, social dynamics, taking care of your home and your body, parenting and other serious-adult responsibilities can feel like too much. I need to vacate. I find my solace in the basement, in the garage, or at some other undisclosed location. It feels rude to say it, but I can be a Personal Ghoster: I avoid, I go on an emotional vacation or I just walk away from things to unwind. If you are a Ghoster like me, you can relate to Parramore’s 2009 hit, “Misguided Ghosts.” ‘Cause I’m just one of those ghosts Travelin’ endlessly Don’t need no roads In fact, they follow me And we just go in circles Ghosting stays with you like emotional echos. Twenty years ago, I resigned from a job after several years of turmoil. When I left, I felt like I had failed myself and the people who hired me. I had a difficult time managing the hello/goodbye emotions and what I felt were awkward conversations.  So I walked away.  Numbers were exchanged, but I knew that would be the last time I made any contact. Walking away from relationships with unsaid things chains you to your own emotional ghosts. The ghosts look for ways to leave in peace, but they end up haunting you instead. Dead Man Walking Ghosting happens when people disappear from a personal or a group relationship. Usually Ghosting involves giving no notice at all. A person just vanishes, unfriends you and travels their own road. You have probably been Ghosted and you may even have done it to someone. According to a 2014 YouGov/Huffington Post survey of 1000 Adults, 11% of us admit to Ghosting.  The numbers are low, but most Ghosts I know don’t like polls… because we are Ghosts. Two of the more famous Ghosters are Bruce Willis and Charlize Theron. Willis made a movie out of his Ghosting experience, The Sixth Sense and Theron Ghosted Sean Penn, according to The New York Times. Most of us are Ghosts, but we usually don’t leave our lives or our relationships. We Ghost in quieter, more subtle ways when we: Tune out of conversations and engage in an inward conversation about how much we cannot stand this person, this experience, or the color of our shoes. Vacate our bodies during a meeting. Disappear from a family event for unknown reasons. Avoid our feelings by drinking more alcohol, by eating our feelings (ie: vacATE), or by watching so much TV that we begin to identify with the Zombies. Take three hours to get one item from the grocery store. Use a novel like a paper shield. Ghosting is a gender neutral activity. Elle magazine conducted an informal survey and found that 24% of women and 16% of men admit to Ghosting. If the numbers hold, men are not the vacaters, avoiders or faders that we are purported to be. Ghosting is something we all do and it can even be fun. Nine Reasons You May Want to Give Ghosting a Try wordpress 1. For Art.  Conceptual art or conceptual business ideas are nice, creative ideas that are not real yet. They exist on paper, but in reality no one knows what it will ever look like or even if it will be born. Ghosting is a way of living conceptually. We exist, but not really. 2. For Boundaries. You don’t have to say “No” when all that you do is “Go.” The best boundary is being invisible. 3. For Conservation.  The Word Conservation Society has declared 2015 the Year of the Word. Words are the next dinosaurs. Ghosting can save your words for the important conversations. Contrary to the Twitterverse, life cannot be lived in 140 characters. Sad bt tru, Std Up for Words, Wrd. 4. For Fun.  Strange things happen when you are a ghost. You see dead things. 5. For Health.  Ghosting is good for you because it involves exercise and vacationing. The Avo-iDance is good for your health, it does not require any equipment and you can do it anywhere. When you become really good at Ghosting, your vacationing becomes a Vaca-Shunning. 6. For Protection.  If you need to disappear for a while, Ghosting skills may come in handy. Consider signing up for the gHosting program (ie: Gangster Hosting). You will have a really good reason for this one, “Honey, I won’t be gone long, I’m just in Canada in the Witness Protection Program.” 7. For Recharging.  My iPod ghosts whenever I run down the battery. If Apple tells me that it is okay for my iPod to go off line, then I am okay with it. Unplug, go off line and emotionally recharge. 8. For Revenge.  Go ahead and ghost your haters, your spammers, your No Sayers and your Gossips. Ghost the friends who are nothing more than walking beef jerky (skin + salt + 152 pounds of Jerk). 9. For Superpowers.  I am on a quest to build a super-hero tool belt and an array of super-spy gadgets. One of the earliest lessons I learned by watching Batman and James Bond was their ability to Ghost. When I Ghost, it’s just me keeping the edge to my superpowers. When you avoid, you become a Void. You can never be hit if you were never there in the first place. Ghosts wander until they find a home. “Hi, my name is Sean. I am a Personal Ghoster.” Join me and the rest of the Ghosts at The Good Men Project.   9 Types Of "Ghosters" To Avoid Like Your F*cking Life Click to view (9 images) Photo: weheartit Margaret AbramsBlogger Love Read Later This week, be a Ghost and save your words for the important conversations.

The sales took place on January 17/18/19/20/23/24, and were scheduled back in August 2015. It’s common practice for senior execs in publicly traded companies to schedule share sales some way in advance to avoid the appearance of insider trading. The filings show that Cook retains 979,809 shares after these sales, with a total value of around $117M. Cook was awarded $100M of bonus stock in August of last year for completing five years as Apple’s CEO. He sold $65M worth of shares a week later. The CEO voluntarily opted for his stock awards to be more heavily based on the performance of the company, with its position in the S&P 500 a key indicator. He also had his pay cut last year after the company failed to hit revenue and profit goals. Cook announced in 2015 that he would be giving away the bulk of his wealth during his lifetime through a systematic approach to philanthropy.

Wine is 2.0! by John E Dunn 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Nominee US attorney-general senator Jeff Sessions has said the new administration will seek to “overcome encryption” in remarks that have been interpreted as a veiled reference to backdoors. It’s worth stressing that at no point during his recent confirmation hearings did Sessions not actually mention the term although he is on record as strongly supporting efforts by law enforcement to bypass encryption during police investigations. Answering a question about the importance of encryption in protecting the US from cyberattack, Sessions wrote: Encryption serves many valuable and important purposes. It is also critical, however, that national security and criminal investigators be able to overcome encryption, under lawful authority, when necessary to the furtherance of national-security and criminal investigations. It’s a response that leaves Sessions trapped in the same contradictory world as his predecessors: he must simultaneously extol encryption as a security virtue but also rail against it as a vice that thwarts law and order. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More It sums up the orthodoxy built up by over recent US administrations that the world’s leading tech superpower can have it both ways by unlocking fundamental security protections at its convenience. The high point of this thinking was the NSA’s 1993 Clipper chip, a hardware backdoor that allowed eavesdropping on conversations sent over any telecoms networks using it. Every device containing Clipper was to have a symmetric encryption key assigned to it and stored in a secure system called an escrow. If the Feds fancied a wiretap, the key would be sent to them – and only them. The idea eventually imploded as critics pointed out the absurdity of a backdoor the entire world knew about. How stupid would a criminal have to be to use such as system? By the time experts started worrying about criminals finding vulnerabilities in its makeup – unintended backdoors in the official backdoor, if you will – the idea had flatlined. Today, the mere suggestion of encryption backdoors alarms tech companies who market themselves on security. This is one reason why many of them are today busily building layers of end-to-end encryption into the software their customers use. As was seen during the 2016 court case between the FBI and Apple for access to the encrypted storage on the iPhone of the St Bernardino shooter, it also shifts the focus from them to the individual user. According to reports, the FBI eventually found a way around the iPhone’s encryption by exploiting a software vulnerability in the way encryption had been implemented. With mandated backdoors discredited, this is probably how intelligence services now approach the issue of backdoors. It’s not perfect because finding flaws big enough to give complete access are bound to be rarities, more so as software development improves. But this doesn’t mean that the US government under Sessions will give up on the intellectual and legal arguments still seen as essential to lend credibility to whichever techniques they choose to use to bypass encryption. It is the battle of ideas that will define the future for both the attackers and defenders of encryption. As Sophos says in its argument against backdoors: Backdoors in encryption would undermine freedom of speech and the freedom to conduct our affairs without interference or fear. For now at least, the world can’t be sure whether the next US attorney-general agrees.

Solid encryption generally leaves law enforcement to clean up the mess after an incident, but that’s better than them being able to use bad encryption to catch one incident, followed by more incidents with planning that is protected by “illegal” high-quality encryption, once the general criminal population comes to grips with the bad encryption. Then you’ll see solid, “illegal” encryption tools being distributed in malware-for-hire services and malware development kits. And because law enforcement expects everyone to use the bad encryption, they will be completely unprepared to counter an opponent that doesn’t use it. Every law-abiding citizen has their good name… until they don’t. Once the identity theives steal your identity, you no longer have your own good name. It takes years to clean that up. We don’t need bad encryption making white-collar crime like that easier. Reply Roc RIzzo says: January 27, 2017 at 9:32 pm Jeff Sessions wants to know what EVERYONE is doing, so that he can control them. He wants a master key and a secret back door to your house, for cryin’ out loud. Then, if you are not a white Christian, he wants to take away your right to vote, to start (as he did when he was a US District Court Judge in Alabama). I wouldn’t trust him to clean toilets.

Edward Majerczyk, 29, pleaded guilty in September to prying open more than 300 iCloud and Gmail accounts – at least 30 of them belonging to Hollywood glitterati – and ripping off what the US Attorney’s Office demurely refers to as his victims’ “sensitive and private photographs and videos”. …which is what the rest of us call nude celebrity photos. On Tuesday, he was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, according to the Central District of California US Attorney’s Office. Majerczyk, who’s from Chicago, was sentenced by US District Judge Charles P Kocoras, who said his crime was “abhorrent”. As well the prison sentence – which he’ll begin serving at the end of February  – Judge Kocoras also ordered Majerczyk to pay $5,700 in restitution to one unnamed victim whose photos were published online. The charge is a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA, and specifically, one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information. Majerczyk was charged by federal prosecutors in Los Angeles, but the case was transferred to the Northern District of Illinois, where he pleaded guilty and was sentenced. According to the plea agreement, Majerczyk was a busy phisherman between November 23 2013 through August 2014. That’s right before the September 2014 Celebgate gang-mugging of celebrities let loose, as intimate images of celebrities were stolen and disseminated online in places such as Reddit. Thieves and many equally scumbaggy photo-sharers trampled over the privacy of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Selena Gomez, Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Lea Michele and Hillary Duff, among others. Majerczyk got to his victims with a phishing scam in which he sent messages doctored to look like security notices from ISPs. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More The phishing messages led victims to a website that harvested their usernames and the passwords for their Google or iCloud accounts. With the credentials in hand, Majerczyk was free to romp through victims’ accounts and grab whatever photos and videos he could find. Nasty, eh? Oh yes, said Deirdre Fike, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office: Mr Majerczyk manipulated hundreds of victims by tricking them into providing access to their accounts, including high-profile victims whose information was specifically targeted. The lasting harm this type of intrusion can cause to celebrities and non-celebrities alike cannot be overstated… And it should serve as an important reminder to all of us of how dangerous it can be to respond to unsolicited e-mails in which our personal information is requested, Fike said. Majerczyk’s case followed a guilty plea by Pennsylvanian Ryan Collins, 36, who was sentenced to 18 months in jail in October. Both Majerczyk and Collins pulled the same shtick: sending phishing emails spoofed to look like they came from Apple or Google which asked victims for account credentials. We never heard the details of how they constructed the phishing emails, but October brought us a fascinating dissection of how hackers used Bitly shortened links in phishing attacks to trick Democratic National Committee officials into handing over their own Gmail credentials. The Feds have said that both Collins and Majerczyk were apparently operating independently and there is no evidence to suggest that either Majerczyk or Collins were the ones who actually posted the nude photos online. In another investigation sparked by Celebgate, the US government seized a Chicago man’s computers in June 2015. None of those cases, apparently, are related to yet another celebrity hacking prosecution: that of Alonzo Knowles’ guilty plea in New York for stealing new screenplays and sex videos from celebrities, nor of the felony hacking conviction of Andrew Helton in Oregon for similar hacking of celebrity-owned Apple and Google accounts. In other words, Majerczyk is just the latest in a string of busted, soon to be imprisoned celebrity hackers. Investigators sure don’t seem to be tired of chasing them down, though. All the better for the people they’ve victimized.

Is there any explanation for why restitution was ordered for only one of them? Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Nintendo Switch Batteries Can Be Replaced For A Price By Tyler Lee on 01/27/2017 16:27 PST As with all things portable and electronic, there is worry about battery degradation. If you’re unfamiliar about what this means, basically the more times you use and charge your battery, it slowly loses the ability to hold a 100%, meaning that after awhile it will no longer last you as long as it did on its first day. We’re sure that this is something that would-be Nintendo Switch customers are probably thinking about, and the good news is that in a recent specifications page posted on Nintendo’s website, it has been revealed that while the battery of the Switch is non-removable, Nintendo can replace the battery for you at a price. It reads, “Please note: the internal battery cannot be removed. If the battery needs to be replaced, we plan to offer paid replacement via Nintendo Customer Support.” Nintendo does not state how much it would cost, but we guess you can take comfort in knowing that if and when that time comes, you’ll be able to get it replaced. This shouldn’t be surprising as companies like Apple have similarly offered up battery replacements for their devices also at a price. That being said in terms of battery life, Nintendo expects that it should last you more than 6 hours per charge, but it will depend on the game you’re running. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is expected to last about 3 hours when played on the go. Filed in Gaming. Read more about Nintendo and nintendo switch.

United tests no-frills fares at MSP because we follow rules so well next Commentary Rash Report: 'Alternative facts' and the power of words The press reacts to — and is targeted by — the Trump administration in the week after the inaugural. January 28, 2017 — 12:14am Susan Walsh, Associated Press White House press secretary Sean Spicer, left, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, and senior White House adviser Stephen Bannon have played distinctive roles in a rhetorical drama that harkens back to George Orwell’s “1984.” Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint John Rash @RashReport Reflecting election distortions in the United States and the United Kingdom, the Oxford English Dictionary named “post-truth” as its 2016 word of the year. It defined the term as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” The theme was mirrored in Merriam-Webster’s selection of “surreal” — defined as “marked by the intense irrational reality of a dream” — as its 2016 word of the year. Three specific spikes in online searches for “surreal” were tied to internationally intensive stories: The terrorist attacks in Brussels last March; an attempted coup in Turkey last July, and the U.S. campaign that climaxed with November’s election. Another earthshaking geopolitical event — the U.K. vote to leave the European Union — led Collins Dictionary linguists to list “Brexit” as their 2016 word of the year. Justifying their votes to leave their continental cousins, many Brits cited economics. But “xenophobia” — Dictionary.com’s 2016 word of the year — undoubtedly was a factor, too. In fact, in the day after the Brexit upset, Dictionary.com notched a 938 percent surge in searches of “xenophobia.” The second most significant rise was after former President Barack Obama’s speech expressing concern over the use of the term populism to describe then-candidate Donald Trump’s campaign rhetoric. In fact, Obama said, it was more an example of “nativism or xenophobia.” In explaining their choice, Dictionary.com wrote that, “This year, some of the most prominent news stories have centered around fear of the ‘other.’ ” President Trump seemed to seize upon — and be seized by — this fear when he again claimed that between three to five million unauthorized immigrants voted, robbing him of a popular vote victory to match his Electoral College win. The president offered no evidence to congressional leaders when he made the claim, and neither did White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who backed his boss despite data debunking the assertion. It was the second time in the first week of the Trump administration that Spicer has spun demonstrably false claims. On Jan. 21, without taking a single question, Spicer angrily upbraided the White House press corps about Trump’s insistence that his inauguration crowd was the largest ever despite photographs proving otherwise. Or so it would seem. And yet the results from a scientific study showed the degree to which some supporters were willing to take Trump at his word despite seeing side-by-side photos of the 2009 Obama inauguration and the 2017 Trump inauguration. When asked which image went with which inauguration, 41 percent of self-identified Trump supporters gave the wrong answer, compared with 8 percent of self-identified Clinton supporters and 21 percent of nonvoters. And stunningly, 15 percent of Trump supporters said that the photograph from Trump’s inauguration, which clearly has fewer people, actually had more. As political scientist Brian Schaffner and researcher Samantha Luks wrote in their Washington Post commentary interpreting their research, “the Trump administration already accuses others of producing ‘fake news,’ and instead offers its own (false) ‘alternative facts.’ If a significant portion of Trump supporters is willing to champion obvious fabrications, challenging fabrications with facts will be difficult.” In naming “fake news” as its 2016 “lie of the year,” Politico described the dynamic as “made-up stuff, masterfully manipulated to look like credible journalistic reports that are easily spread online to large audiences willing to believe the fictions and spread the word.” “Fake news” describes a specific process, but the term has been co-opted by some disagreeing with discordant information, however truthful. This includes the president, who deployed the term against CNN online and in-person at a news conference. The “alternative facts” referred to by the pollster and political scientist is the label Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway used to describe Spicer’s remarks. The term, an early contender for 2017’s word of the year, evoked “newspeak” in George Orwell’s “1984,” the dystopian tome that has shot to the top of the bestseller list 68 years after its debut. “1984” previously cut through the cultural clutter 33 years ago when it was evoked in a superlative Super Bowl spot which depicted a heroic hammer-throwing woman smashing an oversized screen of a “Big Brother”-like character. “On Jan. 24th, Apple Computer will introduce the Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like ‘1984,’ ” the commercial concluded. And yet, while the spot was spot-on about the coming computer revolution, on Jan. 24, 2017, there was news of an administration move to curtail public information from federal agencies — particularly ones involved with environmental issues. Concurrently, a Badlands National Park Service Twitter account was used to tweet scientific data on climate change, causing a social-media sensation that soon grew into a rogue movement of scientists refusing to be silenced. The original Badlands tweets have since been deleted, but the controversy over veracity has not been erased. If anything, it’s amplifying. Especially after Trump’s White House strategist Stephen Bannon strikingly and stridently invoked “no-speak” when he called the media “the opposition party” and added that “the media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for awhile.” The terms identified by Politico and various dictionaries needn’t define our times. Indeed, it would be beneficial to the world if an antonym to these words became the unanimous choice for 2017’s word of the year: Truth.   John Rash is a Star Tribune editorial writer and columnist.

The industrial average has now risen 9 percent since Election Day. Stronger U.S. economic data and optimism about Trump's business policy, among other factors, have pushed not only the Dow, but also the other major averages and small-cap stocks, higher in that time. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at the Wisconsin State Fair Exposition Center in 2016. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters But risk factors like rising valuations, a potentially strengthening dollar, and climbing interest rates could knock markets back down in the short term, experts said. Stocks have endured a sluggish period since mid-December after the initial post-election rally wore off. Rising — and Sustained — Confidence Experts said Trump's proposals, including corporate tax cuts, repatriation of cash overseas, deregulation and infrastructure spending, give investors enough hope for rising corporate earnings that the Trump enthusiasm may continue well into his administration. "The market is perceiving this as a business-friendly administration that is coming into office for the next four years. It wouldn't take much to give earnings a real boost. I think that's where the market is coming from and I think it will continue," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. While the Dow components are considerably less industrial than they used to be, most of the companies have a lot to gain from Trump's plans. He wants to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and has touted that plan in meetings with business executives since he took office. Trump will try to give companies incentives to bring cash back to the United States. Apple, for example, has $216 billion parked abroad. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase would benefit from looser financial regulations, while Exxon Mobil and Chevron could get boosts from easier energy production rules. Trump has already signaled he will be friendly to the oil and gas industry, as on Tuesday he signed executive orders to advance the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Consumer Spending Caterpillar and Boeing may see big benefits from infrastructure spending. Income tax cuts could push more consumer money to companies such as Walt Disney, Nike, and McDonald's. Those are just some examples of how Trump's proposals could help Dow component companies at a time when U.S. economic data has shown improvement. "I think that all of this together has encouraged investors, given them some semblance of hope," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Boston Private Wealth. Still, market watchers said Trump administration policies could get derailed in ways that may quash market optimism. Some plans may not get "enacted with the same order of magnitude as expected" or not get passed "soon enough" to sustain the excitement, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. For instance, some congressional conservatives have expressed misgivings about the spending binge that Trump has proposed. He has also brought infrastructure up only sparingly since he took office. Related: What Does a Dow 20,000 Mean for Me? While key Republicans in Congress have supported Trump's corporate and personal tax cuts, it remains to be seen if they can pass his desired 15 percent business rate. Even if Trump achieves all of his desired policies, the market could see a pullback before it starts climbing again, strategists added. Major averages fell last month after the Federal Reserve hiked the federal funds rate by a quarter point. The Dow also retreated more than once recently after approaching the 20K mark. Still, strategists said that if the expectations for Trump's pro-business White House become reality, earnings could get enough of a boost to keep pushing stocks higher.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter PayPal Holdings Inc. created a stir the same day as its earnings report, but it had nothing to do with the payments company’s financial results. PayPal PYPL, -2.96%  reported fourth-quarter earnings after the market closed Thursday and analysts noted improvements in payment volume and in transaction take rates. But the true excitement focused on talks about a partnership between Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.40%  and PayPal, which Chief Executive Dan Schulman brought up in an interview with Bloomberg News the same day. In the interview, Schulman says his company had been in conversations with Amazon, but did not announce any other details. That partnership may be needed, said Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, as PayPal has a few potential catalysts, including opportunities with Venmo, Braintree and OneTouch, but none appear to have the ability to significantly drive earnings. “We remain neutral on the shares, but increased confidence in an emerging opportunity could tilt our bias more positive,” Beck said. He maintained a $39 price target. A potential partnership with Amazon is on the “wishlist” for PayPal bulls, says Tien-Tsin Huang, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, as it is a foray into e-commerce platforms outside of eBay, PayPal’s one-time owner. Other positives for PayPal include eBay’s raised revenue growth outlook and a transaction take rate of 2.63%, which is the lowest decline in more than five quarters, Huang said. He maintained an overweight rating and raised the price target to $47 from $45. “We see several areas of possible cooperation between the two companies including payments, data sharing and lending,” Credit Suisse analysts said Friday morning of a potential PayPal-Amazon deal. They maintained an outperform rating and $47 price target. PayPal shares fell 3% Friday and have declined 3.4% in the past three months, compared with the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.09% gain of 7.9% in that time. Overall, PayPal appears to have seen little effect from payments competitors launched by tech giants Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.01% and Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.06% GOOGL, -1.39% said Scott Devitt, a Stifel Research analyst, which makes him more confident about PayPal’s position. “We maintain our positive view of PayPal shares, supported by the company’s ability to extend its competitive advantages in the payments ecosystem and drive long-term growth through its increasing scale and expanding set of offerings.” Devitt said. Devitt maintained his buy rating and $49 price target. There are, of course, negatives that could weigh on PayPal’s stock. Huang points to a lack of revenue flow through from its increased revenue outlook, a low share buyback and the yet-to-be-determined status and impact of PayPal moving to an asset-light credit model for its credit business. Devitt said he sees the PayPal’s asset-light model as a way for the company to reduce its exposure to risk and have access to more cash.

"Here you go! It's your turn," Chad Van Horn says, tossing the basketball to Desmond "Dez" Mitchell. The 17-year-old catches it, focuses on the hoop ahead and shoots a three-point basket just before dusk at Holiday Park in Fort Lauderdale. They were on day five of their challenge to shoot three-pointers. Van Horn, 32, and Mitchell have been meeting at the park this January, each time extending the number of three-pointers they have to hit before they can go home. Their game plan: shoot three-point baskets that go with the day of the month. So on Jan. 1, it was one three-pointer, two on Jan. 2, and eventually, 31 on Jan. 31. They don't always connect. The ball bounces off the rim with a clang. Some shots are too high or too wide. The thump thump thump of basketballs from other players thunder in the background as they watch Van Horn and Mitchell. They hope the challenge will make them more fit, which is a resolution for 2017. They are also doing this as part of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Broward County Great Big Challenge. Volunteers with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America pick their sport or exercise — yoga, running, walking, weight training. They then create web pages, set up fund-raising goals and have their friends and families donate. Van Horn and Mitchell's challenge is already a slam dank. Two weeks into it, they surpassed their goal of $1,000. In the beginning, the pair accomplished their day's worth of shots in just a few minutes, finishing with a celebratory chest-bump. By now it's been taking up to an hour to complete their goal, shooting under the bright lights of the park at night. "My lifelong record is 31 in a row but that's when I played every day when I was really good," said Van Horn, who played at Robert Morris University in Pittsburgh. "I am hoping Dez carries us through this." "Or you can make 10 in a row and I'll make 10 in a row," jumped in Mitchell between shots one recent Thursday evening when their goal was just five three-pointers. "That's a good point. It's a team effort so if I make 10 and you make 10, I guess I'll make 10 more. We might be here all day towards the end of the month," joked Van Horn, who was named Big Brother of the Year last year in Broward and again this year. The two have known each other for about five years. Mitchell was 12. Van Horn, a Fort Lauderdale bankruptcy attorney, was looking to give back to the community after a coworker suggested he volunteer with the nonprofit organization. He believes they were paired up because they both lost their fathers at an early age. "Dez was a little punk kid when I met him," Van Horn recalled with a smile. "Now he's my size. I'm 6-foot-2 and he's 5-feet-10-inches tall and he's growing every day. We synced immediately." Although Mitchell was more into football at first, he's improved his basketball game with Van Horn's help. "When we first met, he wasn't really a shooter and I said, 'Well, this isn't going to work out if you don't shoot threes because that's all I do,' " said Van Horn. "Basketball was never my favorite sport. I am getting better at a sport that I don't play really well," said Mitchell, who lives with his mother in Fort Lauderdale. He has two older sisters, ages 26, and 22, and two younger brothers, ages 11 and 18 months. Over the years, Van Horn and Mitchell have played video games at arcades, raced go-karts, hit baseballs and seen all the latest superhero movies. Getting behind the wheel is the next challenge. "I am still teaching him," Van Horn said. Two years ago, Mitchell began working at Van Horn's law firm after school. Mitchell delivers files and makes copies and documents for clients and staffers. A junior at Blanche Ely High School in Pompano Beach, he also has a quiet place there to do homework. He wants to study criminal justice, or law, after he graduates. "Most recently, Dez got all As and Bs on his report card, which is most important. As a reward, he is going to New York. I said if you get all As and Bs, where do you want to go? He's never been on a flight before so he wants to see the Big Apple and he wants to see snow, which is crazy, so we will probably go in February," said Van Horn. When they learned about the fitness challenge, basketball naturally came into play. "This time of year, everybody is focused on getting healthy, everybody is focusing on losing weight, including me. I am trying to eat healthy," said Van Horn. "It's about building healthy relationships. Desmond and I could sit at home and play video games (but) we'd rather be out here really competing." "He's better than me. I tried to fight it," Mitchell confessed with a smile. Then, swish.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas January 28, 2017 07:02 GMT Close Trump orders 'extreme' vetting measures for refugees and bans Syrians IBTimesUK/Wochit Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticised President Donald Trump's executive orders this week on immigration and refugees. In a lengthy, carefully worded Facebook post on Friday (27 January), Zuckerberg wrote that he is "concerned about the impact of the recent orders" signed by the president, saying the US is a "nation of immigrants and we should be proud of that". "We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually post a threat," Zuckerberg wrote. "Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation." Zuckerberg posted the message shortly after Trump signed an executive order to establish "new vetting measures" and keep "radical Islamic terrorists" out of the US. The order temporarily suspends the entire US refugee programme, specifically blocks people fleeing the conflict in Syria from entering the US and suspends immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries including Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen for 90 days. "We don't want them here," Trump said of Islamic terrorists during the signing ceremony. "We want to make sure we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people." Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has criticised President Donald Trump's recent executive orders on immigration, refugees and 'extreme vetting'Reuters/Jonathan Ernst During his first week in office, he also signed orders to construct a wall on the US-Mexico border and cutting federal funding to "sanctuary" cities that do not enforce immigration laws. Zuckerberg wrote that his great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland while his wife Priscilla Chan's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. He called for the US to keep its doors open to refugees and people who need help. "That's who we are," Zuckerberg said. "Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today." However, he also praised Trump's promise to "work something out" for Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children. "Right now, 750,000 Dreamers benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that allows them to live and work legally in the US," Zuckerberg wrote. "I hope the President and his team keep these protections in place, and over the next few weeks I'll be working with our team at FWD.us to find ways we can help." He also said he was "glad the President believes our country should continue to benefit from people of great talent coming into the country". On Thursday, Facebook COO and Lean In author Sheryl Sandberg also broke her silence to hit back at Trump's reinstatement of a Reagan-era anti-abortion policy. Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's statements also come amid criticism against tech executives for not speaking out and vocalising their previously stated concerns against Trump's policies that they raised during the race to the White House. Over the course of the election campaign, many tech leaders voiced their serious concerns and sharp criticism over Trump's presidency and backed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. In December, multiple high-profile executives from Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Intel and Oracle met with the president-elect at Trump Tower. Tesla's Elon Musk and Uber's Travis Kalanick also joined Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum to offer their advice, views and knowledge on his economic growth, job creation and productivity policies. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg recently shot down speculation that he may make a 2020 bid for the White House himself, saying he was focusing on the Facebook community and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. "We are a nation of immigrants, and we all benefit when the best and brightest from around the world can live, work and contribute here," Zuckerberg wrote. "I hope we find the courage and compassion to bring people together and make this world a better place for everyone."

As a jobseeker, a first impression was very valuable; now that you’ve accepted a job offer, first impressions are again of critical importance. First impressions about people often turn into long-term perceptions and opinions. This works well for people who make positive first impressions but can be a negative for people who make negative first impressions. Early days are when your boss and colleagues form the most lasting impressions about you. This is when they make assessments about your ‘typical’ behavior, and what ‘type’ of person you are. If you have any attendance or punctuality issues in the first few days or weeks, you’ve already lost a significant battle — their confidence in you. People will take you as seriously as you seem to take yourself and your work. During those first days in a new workplace, where you are meeting your new coworkers, first impressions about you and your future potential can make a major impact on your success with the organization. Have a Positive Attitude Nothing works better to improve people’s first impression of you more than having a positive attitude. Let your enthusiasm for being part of the team and the organization show through to everyone you interact with. Leave your personal problems at home and concentrate on radiating your excitement for this new opportunity. Dress Professionally You should never underestimate the importance of dressing professionally. Studies show that people make a judgment about you within seven seconds of meeting you, and the way you dress can impact this impression significantly. In the beginning, take care to dress professionally even on casual days. In the early days of a new job, you just never know when you’ll be called out to meet a top manager or key client. Perfectly groomed means efficient and reliable (in people’s minds); unkempt means disorganized and therefore difficult to trust with different assignments. After awhile, people realize these things do not necessarily correspond, but initially, your looks and dress are your representation to them. Show Your Team Spirit You are now part of a work team, and teams work together to solve problems and get the job done. Show loyalty to your co-workers by focusing more — initially, at least — on sharing recognition with the team. Always give credit where credit is due to gain the trust of your coworkers. Learn Coworkers’ Names Quickly No one expects you to have everyone’s name down pat by the end of the first day or week, but if you are bad with names, now is the time to research some memory-aid tricks you can use to help you remember your coworkers’ names. Make it a priority to learn the names of every member of your team. And if you are in a situation in which you forget a person’s name, the best solution is simply to apologize and ask again. Ask Questions/Ask for Help No one expects you to know everything when you first start a new job so feel free to ask questions or ask for help when you need it. Remember that it’s better to ask for clarification before you’ve spent time completing a task the wrong way. It can be easy to let pride get in the way when you first start a job but pretending you know things you don’t isn’t the wise path. Listen to your coworker, ask questions and communication openly with your supervisors about any concerns that arise. No one expects you to know it all in the first weeks and months of a new job. Take Notes and Go to Orientation Unless you have a photographic memory — and few of us do — take notes on all the systems and rules of your new organization. Attend all orientation sessions and accept any training that you are offered. Nothing will get you up to speed at a new job faster. Take Initiative In most situations, you will be given small doses of work at the beginning of a new job. Starting slowly allows you to get your feet wet without getting overwhelmed. As you finish assignments and are ready to handle a bigger workload, take the initiative and ask for more assignments. Be proactive. Don’t wait for an assignment. Being a self-starter is a great way to make a strong first impression at a new job. There will be people who need help, and they will appreciate your efforts to start making an immediate impact. Many times, there may be some tasks that you can accomplish with a little guidance, which will probably free up time for someone who needs to work on more important items. Learn Everything You Can About Your New Employer In theory, you should have already done your homework during the interviewing process, but there is always a lot more to learn once you’re on the inside. Get an employee handbook and study it. In addition, gather all those reports and company literature and read as much as you can to become an expert on your organization. Arrive Early, Leave Late and Don’t Call in Sick Be on time, come in early, stay a little later. Remember, you can’t be a go-getter and clock-watcher at the same time so plan to be at work a little longer than your eight-hour shift. There’s nothing that can affect your reputation faster than routinely coming into work late or leaving work early. Especially in these first days or weeks on the job, observe the flow of the office and be sure you are coming in earlier and leaving later than the majority of your coworkers. Also, don’t take long lunches, especially in the beginning. Once you understand the office culture better, you may be able to shift your hours or take longer lunches but in the beginning, err on the side of spending more time at work to make a great first impression. Establish a Good Attendance Record It should go without saying that it’s important to show up to work every day and establish a good attendance record. Yes, there will be emergencies, and, yes, you may get sick, but as best you can, try to make it to work every day during those first weeks and months on the job. Avoid Office Politics and Gossip The workplace can be full of rumors and gossip. Your mission should be to stay above the fray. Take care not to associate the office gossips and don’t get involved in any office trash talk or politics, especially in the beginning. Repeating gossip will do nothing to help you make a good first impression at a new job. Stay out of the office politics for as long as possible. It’s inevitable that you will be exposed to them sooner or later, and you will most likely participate in them as well as it’s human nature. But stay out of the game for the first few months. Show Appreciation Nothing works like kindness and genuine appreciation. Show your appreciation to everyone who helps you learn the ropes during your first days on the job — from your coworkers to receptionists to the folks in human resources. Recognizing those who have helped you get acclimated will show your gratitude, which will do wonders for making a good first impression. Find a Mentor You don’t need to jump on this task your first day, but as you get introduced to senior staff, begin thinking about developing a mentoring relationship with a senior person in the organization. Mentoring has numerous benefits, from a simple sounding board to someone who helps direct and advance your career within the organization. Get and Stay Organized If you’re one of those super-organized people, this tip will be easy for you. The rest of us, however, need to develop a system for keeping track of meetings, appointments, assignments, and projects. Get an organizer or planner and keep on top of all your work. Use your Outlook or Apple calendar, with reminders set for important deadlines. Make an Excel spreadsheet or just write a simple to-do list at the beginning and end of every day. Everyone has a system that works best for them. Try different organization techniques until you find the perfect one; you certainly don’t want to miss an early key deadline or meeting in the early days of a new job. Being the newest member of the organization — the rookie — is both challenging and exciting. You’ll be faced with both difficulties and opportunities, and your goal should be to make the most of all situations. Don’t worry if you don’t make a perfect first impression in those early days on the job — few of us ever do. Remember to relax, keep your mind open, get to know your team members, and do your work. These things should help you go far in making a positive and lasting impression at your new job. 9 Likes 3 Shares Re: Tips To Help You On Your First Day At A New Job by Olisa4all: 10:10am On Jan 20 Highly educative and informative post 1 Like Re: Tips To Help You On Your First Day At A New Job by Nutase(f): 7:22am MsDelilah how is Samson now.

We have a tendency sometimes to only ever comment about poor service, which is perhaps because we are so incensed by it, and therefore are suitably motivated to complain. However, how often do we praise excellent service? Some friends and I have recently been incredibly impressed by the customer service at the new Costa in Portsmouth’s Ocean Retail Park. I don’t think I’ve ever known a team who are so resolutely cheerful and chatty. It’s akin to popping round to your local. You are remembered, asked after and always greeted with a smile. When you consider the fact that Costa itself has been rather remiss in the blind-fitting department (when the sun is at a particular angle, both staff and customers risk vision damage), the excellence of the customer service is even more impressive. I think I’d have had my sunglasses on behind the counter in protest by now, and an ultra-grumpy face. But that couldn’t be further from the reality of their staff. I have also received wonderful service at the newly-refurbished Currys and PCWorld – also at Ocean Retail Park. Until recently this was a place I avoided unless I was either in need of paint or the kids dragged me to Toys R Us. Kirsty Smith, retail manager, and her team were second to none when I recently visited and it’s service like this that keeps you going back. The cynical will say that this is exactly why staff are friendly, but of course it is. Although, having worked in retail myself when I was younger, I can also confirm that it’s extremely hard to keep smiling when you’re the messenger who is getting shot on behalf of the company you work for. It takes some skill and patience to get the best out of customers and, whilst I do try to shop local, that’s not always possible. Nor does ‘local’ keep as many people in jobs, and sometimes you also have to follow your bank balance and not your ideals. HE’S ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION, BUT THEN SO ARE OTHER PEOPLE How refreshing to hear that Ewan McGregor pulled out of an interview with Piers Morgan based on the latter’s derisive comments regarding feminism and women daring to march against Donald Trump. It never ceases to amaze me that people who essentially win the vote, and get who they want in government, then suggest that everybody else just shuts up and gets on with it. These are often the same people who only comment about anything if it’s to moan anyway, never praising any positives, and may as well be branded with the word ‘hypocrite’ across their foreheads. Just as Morgan is entitled to his opinion, so he’d do well to accept that others are perfectly entitled to stand up for theirs. WITH A JOB, TWO SMALL KIDS AND HOUSEWORK, HAIL THE BOX SET The amount of great dramas on TV at the moment is incredible. Taboo, Apple Tree Yard, Unforgotten, The Halcyon and the like. Well, make the most of it. For if memory serves, the BBC and ITV have a tendency to overdose us all on telly during January, dwindling off in February, until then starving us until next December. I assume this is because everyone hibernates around Christmas and throughout winter, but that – according to the TV people – we then all commence busy social lives and spend our time outdoors engaged in active pursuits. Well, not round these here parts, where two small children, a job and housework have me on the sofa by 7.30pm most nights. All hail the box set.

(AP Photos) The three men competing in Trump's Supreme Court sweepstakes By Ryan Lovelace (@LovelaceRyanD) • 1/28/17 12:05 AM Ryan Lovelace Supreme Court Reporter The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/Lovelace-3.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More The legal and political communities are buzzing that President Trump has narrowed his Supreme Court selection to a handful of candidates, less than a wee before he is scheduled to announce his choice. Trump adviser Leonard Leo told the Washington Examiner that Trump does not have a fixed number of finalists and is subject to change his mind at the last moment — which the president himself acknowledged on Thursday. Leo, who is advising Trump on the high court vacancy, told the Washington Examiner that Trump has consulted many people about his selection, including the wife of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Leo said Trump has spoken with Mrs. Scalia on several occasions, including after his election win, which gave Trump a better understanding of the person whose seat he would seek to fill. Leo said several factors are weighing on Trump's decision-making, including the ages of the candidates. Three of the most-discussed contenders are all under the age of 55, including 3rd Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, who is 51 years old, 11th Circuit Judge William Pryor of Alabama, 54, and 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado, 49.

Thomas Hardiman Hardiman brings a diverse resume that would immediately set him apart from any of the Supreme Court's sitting justices. Hardiman, the first in his family to graduate from college, earned a bachelor of arts degree at Notre Dame and a law degree from Georgetown University. He would serve as the only Supreme Court justice without an Ivy League degree. Carrie Severino, Judicial Crisis Network chief counsel and policy director, said Hardiman has developed a reputation as a man of principle whose critics can respect his jurisprudence even when they disagree with him. "He's got a great story and a real nice record of volunteership and public service that he's continued, not just public service in the sense of working as a federal judge and working for the government but being really involved in Big Brothers Big Sisters," Severino said. Democrats looking to thwart Hardiman's potential nomination may scour his recent financial disclosure forms for potential conflicts of interest. Hardiman's stocks and other investments, valued at nearly $22 million, according to the National Law Journal, could be weaponized against him during potential confirmation hearings. Hardiman's 2015 financial disclosure report shows investments in Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Google, and Time Warner among others. Also from the Washington Examiner 2016 was a good year for the defense industry, despite those Trump tweets The top five U.S. defense contractors released their earnings this week, and it was largely good news. By Jacqueline Klimas • 01/28/17 12:01 AM Hardiman's working relationship with Maryanne Trump Barry, the president's sister who serves alongside Hardiman on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, would likely undergo additional scrutiny if Trump picks Hardiman. Trump Barry is reportedly boosting Hardiman behind the scenes. William Pryor Pryor, a former Alabama attorney general, is a favorite of many conservatives and has an ally in Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the president's pick to become the next attorney general. Pryor succeeded Sessions as Alabama's attorney general. "Pryor is just a clear rising star in the conservative legal movement," Severino said. "He has a really exceptional record of jurisprudence that hues to the same kind of principles that Justice Scalia [espoused]." But Pryor has faced difficult confirmation proceedings in the past, which could hamper his chances if Trump is looking for the path of least resistance amid Senate Democrats. Pryor's comment as a politician that Roe v. Wade was "the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history" would likely spur questions from Democrats about his ability to keep his personal politics out of the courtroom. Also from the Washington Examiner Trump emerges as unlikely March for Life hero Abortion opponents and other social conservatives have been reassured that their votes were not cast in vain. By W. James Antle III • 01/28/17 12:01 AM Pryor has written about his difficulty getting confirmed as a U.S. circuit judge in 2003 and noted that his beliefs should not factor into his jurisprudence the same way it would for someone in one of the federal government's political branches. Leo told the Washington Examiner that the candidates' previous confirmation fights did not seem to be a determing factor for Trump in selecting the next Supreme Court nominee. "I don't think prior confirmations have much of an effect on the way the new administration thinks about these things," Leo said. "I don't think the process from the past has had much of an impact on deliberations inside the administration, although I do think there is some recognition of the fact that since this is the Scalia seat, extreme obstruction by the Democrats would be a little unusual because history shows that when the balance of the court [isn't] really being upset it's a less contentious confirmation hearing and process." Neil Gorsuch Gorsuch has developed a reputation as a strong writer whose work calls to mind Scalia's own writing among court-watchers. Gorsuch's record has shown him to be not only a staunch defender of the originalist jurisprudential philosophy Scalia championed, but also of Scalia's emphasis on textualism, an adherence to the language of the rule or law at issue. "Gorsuch really stands out in my mind is his academic credentials are just beyond compare," Severino said. "He's got a clear but just really incisive style, and I think that harkens back to Scalia." Democrats seeking to block Gorsuch's nomination will likely question his ability to remain independent from the president. Lena Zwarensteyn, strategic engagement director of the left-leaning American Constitution Society, said she thought all of the individuals on Trump's short lists posed concerns for maintaining the judiciary's impartiality. "I think there are some real concerns about the independence of these nominees," Zwarensteyn said. "It looks like Trump has some sort of promise from these nominees." Zwarensteyn pointed generally to Trump's public statements as suggesting that any nominee he would select would "do right by him," which she said would mean that their integrity has been compromised. Questions about the independence and integrity of Trump's Supreme Court selection are likely to be a hallmark of Democrats' questions in future confirmation proceedings. If Senate Democrats look to organize a blockade of Trump's selection, the president has said he wants Republicans to use the "nuclear option" to lower the threshold required for the president's allies to overcome Democratic obstruction. Many of the individuals topping Trump's list are far younger than several of the sitting justices, meaning Trump's selection has the prospect of shaping U.S. law for decades to come.

NASA, ESA, Suyu (Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics), Auger (University of Cambridge) Isn’t this image glorious? It looks like five super-bright stars in a cluster, forming a cross. They actually aren’t stars at all; in fact, it’s only one object. What you see is a phenomenon sometimes called an Einstein Cross, one object whose light is bent by the gravitational field of a massive object as it travels from the source to Earth, splitting it into several different objects. This is called gravitational lensing. The Einstein Cross is named, of course, for Albert Einstein, who predicted the effect in his General Theory of Relativity. Any bright object can form an Einstein Cross. This particular example is a quasar -- the extremely bright disc of gas and stars that is thought to surround a supermassive black hole. This gravitationally-lensed quasar is known as HE0435-1223, and is among the five best lensed quasars to date. The other reason it’s remarkable is that it has been used to support the work of scientists who in 2016 calculated that the universe was expanding faster than expected, a measurement known as the Hubble Constant. 40 Photos Breathtaking Hubble Telescope images Since it was launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has sent breathtaking images back from the deepest corners of space Using HE0435-1233, a team of astronomers from the H0LiCOW collaboration, led by Sherry Suyu of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany, the ASIAA in Taiwan and the Technical University of Munich, used Hubble Space Telescope data to calculate a Hubble Constant that was nine percent faster than previous calculations indicated. The multiple images of HE0435-1233 are not perfectly aligned, which means the light travels paths that are not all the same length. This means that they show changes in the quasar over time -- changes directly related to the Hubble Constant. “Our method is the most simple and direct way to measure the Hubble constant as it only uses geometry and General Relativity, no other assumptions,” said co-lead author Frédéric Courbin from EPFL, Switzerland.

The Billboard Comedy Chart lists the week’s top selling comedy albums ranked by sales data as compiled by Nielsen Music. Upon learning that that his first recorded Comedy CD exploded on the scene, Feraz responded: “As a child who watched too much VH 1, I learned two things every artist should strive for – one, charting on Billboard’s top 10 and two, avoiding heroin. So far, so good!” David Drozen, President of Uproar Entertainment and producer of the CD states: “I knew Feraz was special the very first time I saw him perform at The World Series of Comedy in 2013. I told him then that I wanted to record him. He said he wasn’t ready. So I waited until he was. It was worth the wait. Could just be another Grammy nomination coming!” Feraz has a successful podcast INFOdels that has been listed by iTunes as a top 10 “New and Noteworthy” podcast and has been featured on the front page of iTunes numerous times. A few of Feraz’s comedic influences include Greg Giraldo and Jon Stewart, who touch upon big sociopolitical issues, as well as guys like Nick Swardson who see the beauty in a good dick joke. Feraz is known for keeping the energy fun and light throughout his show, rarely taking himself or any situation too seriously. His next joke is just as likely to be something that will make you think, as it is an insane party story about his mushroom trip in Thailand. He creates an honest environment, and audiences can’t help but feel as though they’re spending an evening with a friend they’ve known for years. His style is highly unique, and unlike anything you’ve seen before. If you’re lucky, he may even pull out his guitar and hit a few musical numbers.
