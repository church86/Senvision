SEATTLE: Microsoft on Thursday unveiled a forthcoming Windows update aimed at keeping its desktop and laptop computers at the heart of lifestyles increasing reliant on smartphones. Enhancements to the widely used operating system to roll out later this year are designed to make applications built on Microsoft technology work more harmoniously across an array of internet-linked devices, according to demonstrations given at the company’s Build developers conference in Seattle. One key addition of the Windows 10 Fall update will allow people to leave what they are doing on one device and pick up where they left off on another — be it a Windows, Apple, or Android driven machine. Windows personal computers “will love all your devices,” said Microsoft operating systems group corporate vice president Joe Belfiore. Activities or files will be shifted about using cloud storage service OneDrive and artificial intelligence. Windows 10 will be able to integrate with a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets and virtual or augmented reality gear, executives said. “Microsoft essentially has fully embraced the usage model of moving between phone, tablet, PC, Mac, game console and in the future AR and VR headsets, regardless of the operating system,” Patrick Moorhead, a principal analyst for Moor Insights and Strategy, told AFP. “If it works as well as the demos suggest, it will be successful because the reality is, we live in a heterogeneous world of Windows, Android and iOS.” Bridge to the future The update would be optimal if Microsoft had a pervasive mobile operating system, but the US technology giant saw Windows smartphones eclipsed by Apple and Android devices, the analyst noted. The update “is a recognition that the vast majority of their customers are using Android and iOS (Apple) devices on mobile and they have to accommodate that,” Ross Rubin, a Reticle Research analyst, told AFP. “As Microsoft moves to more of a services model, they need to accommodate platform choice; it is just not a Windows world.” Gartner analyst Jason Wong said the upcoming Windows update still reflected a view that desktop or laptop computers remained at the center of people’s lives — which he said is not the case. Microsoft has held firm that it has not given up on the mobile market, but in the interim is updating Windows to remain relevant in a smartphone-centric world, according to Rubin. Better tuning Windows-powered computers to mobile devices could also serve as a “bridge” to what is being heralded as the next big computing platform — mixed reality infused with artificial intelligence, the analyst said. Microsoft is aggressively creating a mixed reality technology platform and HoloLens augmented reality gear, which Windows 10 is crafted to support.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: Vogel/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple Watch can detect serious heart ailment with 97% accuracy, study finds Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 11th, 2017 at 7:20 PM Share Tweet The Apple Watch launched with quite a bit of fanfare, but the device never exactly became the revolutionary and game-changing product that some analysts were expecting and hoping for. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch over the last two years has managed to carve out a nice niche for itself as a beloved smartwatch and fitness tracker. Indeed, ever since it originally hit store shelves, Apple has increasingly positioned the Apple Watch as a health-oriented device, with Tim Cook recently stating that the Apple Watch helped him lose 30 pounds. Don't Miss: Google Pixel 2 concept suggests Google will double down on a key Pixel feature Speaking to the Apple Watch’s capabilities, a new research report released by the University of California, San Francisco — done in conjunction with Apple — reveals that the Apple Watch’s heart sensor is capable of detecting the most common type of heart arrhythmia with a 97% accuracy rate. As far as the research goes, the heart arrhythmia detection wasn’t done solely with the Apple Watch’s sensor, but relied upon a custom AI algorithm built into the Cardiogram app. TechCrunch reports: The study involved 6,158 participants recruited through the Cardiogram app on Apple Watch. Most of the participants in the UCSF Health eHeart study had normal EKG readings. However, 200 of them had been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (an abnormal heartbeat). Engineers then trained a deep neural network to identify these abnormal heart rhythms from Apple Watch heart rate data. All in all, the results are impressive and suggest that we’ve yet to see the Apple Watch’s full potential as a health monitor. Speaking to this point, Dr. Gregory Marcus, the study’s senior author, said the following in a statement: “Our results show that common wearable trackers like smartwatches present a novel opportunity to monitor, capture and prompt medical therapy for atrial fibrillation without any active effort from patients.” Tags: Apple, Apple Watch View Comments Trending 1 Tech Every last detail surrounding the OnePlus 5 probably just leaked 2 Deals This $22 under-bed LED lighting system is our new favorite thing in the world 3 Tech Google Pixel 2 concept suggests Google will double down on a key Pixel feature 4 Tech Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting 5 Tech Try out Chrome’s new ultra fast search tool for Android before the rest of the world Picked For You Your iPhone 7 Plus will last for way more than two days with this insanely thin battery case By Maren Estrada May 10th at 11:17 AM Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting By Zach Epstein May 11th at 9:59 AM Repair shops can’t wait for you to break your Galaxy S8 By Chris Smith May 10th at 6:20 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

The upcoming changes to the App Store will see the prices of apps and in-app purchases rise as a result of a weakened pound. According to Apple news site, 9to5Mac, a tier 2 priced app which would have cost £1.49 will now cost £1.99. It’s bad news for gamers who want to unlock the full version of Super Mario Run too as users will now have to pay £9.99, up £2.00 on the previous £7.99 cost. It’s not just Brits being hit by higher prices though, Apple users in India and Turkey will also be affected because of changes to exchange rates and taxation policy. The value of the pound fell dramatically after the Leave vote in June and Apple has since raised the prices of iPhones, iPads, Macs, MacBooks and now apps are the next piece of technology to be hit by Brexit. Apple aren’t the only tech giants to be upping prices post-Brexit vote. Tesla are reportedly set to increase prices in the UK by 5 per cent this year and Microsoft are allegedly set to raise prices by 22 per cent because the weak currency. A spokesperson for Apple said, “Price tiers on the App Store are set internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, business practices, taxes, and the cost of doing business. These factors vary from region to region and over time.” Apple added that the changes will come into effect over the next few days.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Apple Valley man dies after collision on Bear Valley Road Thursday May 11, 2017 at 8:10 AM May 11, 2017 at 4:28 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero APPLE VALLEY — A 58-year-old man involved in two-vehicle collision on Bear Valley Road on Wednesday night died of his injuries at Antelope Valley Hospital, authorities said Thursday. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials said Matthew Marshall, of Apple Valley, was pronounced dead after he was airlifted to the hospital. Authorities say Marshall was driving a Kia Sephia that collided with a Chevrolet Cruze driven by a 20-year-old Adelanto woman at Bear Valley and Algonquin roads. Deputies and firefighters responded a little after 8:20 p.m. and found the force of the collision caused major damage to both vehicles. Marshall, who was trapped inside the Kia, suffered major injuries. He was extricated and airlifted, sheriff’s officials said. The driver of the Cruze, along with three passengers who are all from Apple Valley, were transported to local hospitals with non-life threatening injuries. The collision shut down Bear Valley Road between Mohwak and Navajo roads for several hours as the Apple Valley Sheriff's Station Major Accident Investigation Team worked the scene. The cause of the collision remains under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station at 760-240-7400.

Today, Apple debuted a new series of videos, as well as a new website, focused on educating users on how to take the best images with their iPhone… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover On the new website, Apple shares tips for shooting a plethora of different types of images and video. For instance, Apple gives tips for close-up shots, vertical panoramas, action shots, street light, stills while filming video, selfies, and much more. There are also tips and tricks for editing photos such as selfies. We believe that everyone can take great photos. So we’ve put together these tips and techniques to help you take even better ones with your iPhone. Each of the tips has an accompanying video that walks users through the process. For instance, for shooting a vertical panorama, Apple takes users through the steps of using the panorama function in the Camera app, but moving the device vertically instead of horizontally like with typical panoramas. For more complex tricks, Apple offers a step-by-step walkthrough. All of the videos are simple and easy to follow, generally coming in the form of screen captured footage, so users know exactly what buttons to press and what steps to follow on their own device. Most of the videos come in at around 30 seconds to 40 seconds and are straight to the point. Apple has uploaded some of the videos to its YouTube channel, but the full series can be found here on the new How to shoot on iPhone 7 website. Do you find any of this how-tos useful?

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 7:14 PM Updated May 11 increase font size Microsoft previews new features A Windows 10 update will help sort the best photos. By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group, speaks at the Microsoft Build 2017 developers conference Thursday in Seattle. Associated Press/Elaine Thompson SAN FRANCISCO — An upcoming feature in Microsoft’s Windows 10 system will automatically identify the best photos and videos to help people create highlights of their experiences. The tool, called Story Remix, will be part of a “Fall Creators Update” to roll out later this year to 500 million personal computers, smartphones and tablets powered by Windows 10. Microsoft previewed the update Thursday at a conference in Seattle for applications developers. Microsoft will also make a Story Remix app for devices running Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android to help people share images from their children’s soccer games and other events. Apple and Google already offer similar tools to manage images. Both those companies have helped undercut the popularity of PCs running on Windows. Other features in the Fall Creators Update will include: • A multi-device clipboard to let you copy text, images and other content on a laptop and paste it on a phone, as though the two devices were one. It’s similar to what Apple already offers with Universal Clipboard in iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. • With Timeline, you’ll be able to pick a time, say last Wednesday morning, and see what files, apps and sites you had opened, allowing you to easily jump back to what you were doing. A companion Pick Up Where You Left Off feature will let you continue what you’re doing on another device, much like Apple’s Handoff feature. • Changes to the OneDrive online storage service will make it easier to work with files without having to download everything and take up storage space on a device. Microsoft didn’t say when Fall Creators Update will come out. A preview for early testers was released Thursday. As with other Windows 10 updates, this will be free for existing Windows 10 users. The company is also expanding its exploration of a new technological frontier that allows people to mix the real world with three-dimensional projections of life-like images. The fall Windows 10 update will include features for playing games and watching video in the realm of “mixed reality,” the melding of the artificial with things that are actually happening around us. Microsoft also plans to introduce a new mixed reality headset and motion controller in time for the holiday season. The equipment, to be made by Acer, will sell as a package for $399. That is far less than the $3,000 to $5,000 Microsoft has been charging for another mixed reality headset called HoloLens. Apple’s iTunes software is coming to its Windows Store, a development that will help students using a streamlined version of Windows designed for classrooms. That version, Windows 10 S, can only get apps through the store, not directly from third parties such as Apple. Regular Windows 10 users can already get iTunes from Apple.

BuzzFeed reports via inside sources that Amazon Prime will finally be added as an app within the Apple TV universe starting this summer, something that Apple is planning to announce formally at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 5 in San Jose, CA. Also as part of the deal, Amazon will once again start selling Apple TV set-top boxes, something they ceased doing two years ago to avoid, they said, "customer confusion" with other streaming devices that did feature Amazon Prime video like Roku and the company's own device, Fire TV. Recode first broke the news last week about the deal taking shape, noting that it was likely struck at the highest level, between Bezos and Cook. Bezos hadn't commented clearly on the tensions between the companies about their competing devices and why Amazon's app had remained a holdout in the Apple TV realm, but he did hint at Recode's Code Conference last year that it had something to do with "acceptable business terms" being available for putting their app on the device. And Recode notes that the deal shows how Amazon now recognizes the importance of video distribution in sales of its Prime memberships. As Bezos put it, "When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes." BuzzFeed didn't get official comment from either company on the deal, and they don't have a hard date for when Apple TVs will again be for sale by Amazon or its third-party sellers.

It wasn't just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 per cent of my household's commercial transactions flowed through the online giant, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What's more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children. Related Content Amazon to slash JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman earnings: Citi Zuckerberg realises dangers of social-media revolution he helped start This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there's a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison. This is the most glaring and under-appreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. Advertisement I speak, of course, of my old friends, the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The five are among the most valuable companies on the planet, collectively worth trillions. (Apple hit $US800 billion ($1.09 trillion) in market capitalisation earlier this week, the first of any public company to do so, and the others may not be far behind.)

Their growth has prompted calls for greater regulation and antitrust intervention. There's rising worry, too, over their softer, noneconomic influence over culture and information - for instance, fears over how Facebook might affect democracies - as well as the implicit threat they pose to the jurisdictions of world governments. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Mark Zuckerberg, ruler of social media giant Facebook. The company's reach is everywhere, stoking fears over how it might affect society. Photo: Getty Images These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large - to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche. Amazon, I see now, is well on its way to becoming my household's brain, a kind of butler in the sky that runs the place for me. So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy - but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialise online using Twitter, Apple's messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg's popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Apple's iPhone, the uber device of our generation. Could you give it up? Photo: Bloomberg Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don't normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft's word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I'd hate to lose it. In third place, full of regrets: Apple. There's nothing I use more than my iPhone, and close behind are my MacBook and iMac 5K, which may be the best computer I've ever owned. Abandoning Apple would prompt deep and truly annoying rearrangements in my life, including braving Samsung's bad software. But I could do it, grudgingly. It's when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It's here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we've come to depend on them.   In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can't fathom living without it. Without the world's best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes - email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I'd need after ditching Apple - I'd be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992). And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life. When the kids were born, it became my household's Costco - supplier of nappies and other baby gear. Then it launched a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon moved into media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too? Victim to the convenience trap A few years ago I would have thought that was the limit. Then came Echo, the company's talking computer, which speaks through a persona known as Alexa, and which has infected my family like a happy virus. Echo has a way of ingratiating itself into one's most mundane moments. I rewired my household's lights to be able to control them through Alexa. I changed the kind of coffee I buy so that I could tell Alexa to reorder it. When Amazon announced, this week, a new screen-enabled Echo, and a feature to let Echos act as phones, I experienced another frisson of possibility. Amazon, I see now, is well on its way to becoming my household's brain, a kind of butler in the sky that runs the place for me. Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks. One evening three days after I'd ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner. If such a future makes you blanch, that's the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you're right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behaviour - a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won't end if you don't patronise Amazon. But if it's not Amazon for you, it'll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It's too late to escape. The New York Times Poll If you were forced to abandon the Frightful Five, which one would you give up first? Amazon.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 12, 2:39 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Amazon Prime Video Coming To Apple TV, Apple To Announce At WWDC 2017 By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 05/11/17 AT 6:58 PM Close Apple will announce Amazon’s Prime Video app will come to the Apple TV at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, Buzzfeed News reported. With the Prime Video app, Apple TV users will be able to access and stream TV shows and movies from Amazon’s programming catalog. Currently, Amazon Prime subscribers have to use Apple’s AirPlay video streaming standard to view Prime Video shows on a home TV. The app doesn’t have a hard release date, but is expected officially to hit Apple TVs this summer. Read: HBO Classic Shows Including “The Wire” And “The Sopranos” Will Be Taken Off Amazon Prime Apple’s slated agreement with Amazon isn’t only limited to Apple TV, either. Buzzfeed News said Amazon is also expected to start reselling Apple TV. The online retailer stopped selling Google’s Chromecast devices and Apple TV media players in 2015. As Amazon chief operating officer Jeff Bezos told Recode at the time, Amazon’s reasoning behind the move was that it wanted consumers to be able to watch Amazon video on devices sold by Amazon. “We want our player, our Prime Video player, to be on the device, and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms,” Bezos told Recode. “And so, you can always get the player on the device; the question is can you do so with acceptable business terms. And if you can’t, then we don't want to sell it to our customers, because they’re going to be buying it thinking they can watch Prime Video and then they’re going to be disappointed.” The news puts a temporary hold on the disagreements between Amazon and Apple over their respective video programs. While Apple doesn’t have a streaming catalog service similar to Amazon Prime, the company does still have its own video purchasing options for movies and TV shows. In addition, Apple’s traditional 30 percent cut on purchases made within apps has been a hurdle for larger third-party developers. Amazon’s past iOS apps have traditionally removed the ability to make purchases within the app and require you to buy movies, shows or books from another device. There’s no indication whether the eventual Prime Video app will allow for purchases or if it’ll only draw from Amazon’s streaming video options. Read: Apple TV Rumors: tvOS 11 Could Allow For Multi-User Support With Tailored Profiles Amazon’s agreement with Apple highlights the continued importance of video to the online retailer’s bottom line. While video streaming is just one of several benefits from Amazon’s Prime subscription program, Amazon’s original and exclusive content has earned critical plaudits thanks to acquisitions like “Manchester By The Sea” and original shows like “Transparent.” By getting Prime Video onto yet another platform, Amazon wants to remove yet another hurdle that could keep Amazon Prime users from engaging with Amazon content.

Rumors suggested that, at long last, Amazon Prime Video was coming to Apple TV. According to BuzzFeed News sources, it’s a certainty, and the announcement will happen at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The heated battle between the two started with Amazon, which stopped selling Apple TV devices two years ago. It also banned Google’s streaming TV device, Chromecast. Worse, the company forbid third-party sellers from listing Apple TV and Chromecast on the site to avoid “customer confusion.” “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT Apple retaliated by not allowing Amazon’s video offering, Prime Video, on the device. Today though, it appears hands were shaken and pleasantries were exchanged as the two worked out an agreement. We don’t know, however, when (or if) Amazon will once again sell Apple TV devices on the platform.

The most troubling part of this is the fact that I still want to switch. I'm not completely immune to devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8, or even the LG G6. My loyalty gets tested all the time. There's a saying that everything is eventual, and I think this is certainly the case for technology and companies like Apple. Some of the features they've baked into their software, like being able to easily switch between an app from iOS to macOS (as long as the apps support this), or, with Universal Clipboard, being able to copy text from my computer to my phone have kept me interested in sticking around. But it always felt like, eventually, other companies would figure out how to do this, too, and, just by default, make it better in some way or another. In the case of Windows 10, that seems to be the case -- or will be, later this year. Today Microsoft announced Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, and, aside from the familiar naming scheme, there are some genuinely interesting new additions coming to the platform. Like a Universal Clipboard-like feature, called Clipboard (genius!), which will let users copy content from their computer and paste it on their iOS or Android device. And then there's the Timeline feature, coupled with the brand new Pick Up Where You Left Off feature, that will allow Windows 10 users to start a project on their computer and then switch over to their iOS or Android device to keep working on it. At face value these features are exactly the same thing as what Apple already offers, but there's just an extra kicker in there: Going beyond the ecosystem. That's only true in part, really, because you'll still need to have Cortana, Microsoft's digital personal assistant, installed on your device to take advantage of these features, but that feels like a pretty small price to pay to link iOS, Android, and Windows 10. (Developers need to make it happen on their end, too, so it will be interesting to see if it takes off at all.) Apple has always been confident in its own ecosystem, which is why it probably isn't worried about Microsoft rolling out these features. The executives in Cupertino know iPhone owners probably own a Mac, and probably want to keep it, so as long as they keep offering these features those folks might not feel tempted to jump ship. And they're probably right, for most Apple consumers. I'm perpetually on the fence, though, and it's certainly not getting any easier now that Microsoft offers these same features that, up until this year, I could only get between macOS and iOS. Plus Microsoft says it has more to announce later this year, before the September release date for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. Then again, I guess the good news is that I should probably force myself to wait, through June and through September, because Apple has its own Worldwide Developers Conference and iPhone reveal dates, respectively. Maybe the new versions of iOS and macOS will boast new features to keep me around even longer. Either way, Microsoft's doing a great job, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to stay away for too much longer. The fact that Microsoft's goal at this point is to not only improve Windows 10, but also make iOS and Android better, too, is a great thing all around. Has Microsoft's changes in the last year or so convinced you to drop your Apple-branded device? If so, what did you switch to? Let me know!

The news organization reported that Apple engineers have been developing a way to read glucose levels continuously without puncturing the skin by using lights and sensors on the Apple Watch. Last year, Apple hired Rajiv Kumar, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist from Stanford, Calif., which caused a lot of excitement in the medical community, including iMedicalApps.com, and maybe offered a clue to the company's long game. Whether or not Kumar's hire was a hint, for the past 5 years, 30 researchers have allegedly been secretly exploring the noninvasive technology in a "remote location." While that intriguing detail might seem to be out of a biotech spy story, it has every reason to be. If true, this would be a groundbreaking next step for mobile health and telemedicine. There are already diabetes management apps on the market, including "smart" socks and continuous glucose monitoring apps. A nonintrusive continuously monitoring device seems to be the holy grail in Silicon Valley. Google has prototyped a contact lens, and Dexcom is working with Verily to create smaller glucose-monitoring devices. Iltifat Husain's Take "While having the Apple Watch monitor glucose levels would be fascinating, we need to be realistic as well. There are massive regulatory and also clinical situations that would need to be taken into consideration before the Apple Watch could try to read glucose levels in a noninvasive manner. A project like this would require clinical trials to test efficacy, along with a slew of discussions and testing by the FDA. Frankly, this isn't realistic for a company like Apple. Apple in the past has done everything possible to make sure they don't fall under FDA scrutiny -- so I don't think this is something they would come to market with first. I compare this to Apple trying to create a self-driving car -- it sounds cool, and they might create a 'concept car' in 5 years or so, but we all know they aren't going to be selling cars anytime soon."

The reason: like most cash-rich multinationals, it stores most of its money outside the U.S. to avoid paying double taxes. Trump and Republicans have proposed a one-time repatriation "holiday" with much lower taxes on repatriated holdings. Matt Rosoff | @mattrosoff 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Sally Shin | CNBC Tim Cook On Thursday afternoon, Apple noted in an SEC filing that it was issuing $7 billion worth of new bonds -- floating rate notes with various maturity dates between 2020 and 2027. This isn't particularly newsworthy in itself. Apple issues bonds all the time. In fact, according to FactSet, as of the end of the first quarter of 2017, Apple has taken on more than $98 billion in debt. More generally, it's cheap to borrow money because of persistent low interest rates, and lots of companies borrow to help fund ongoing day-to-day operations. But there's a deeper irony here. Apple generates cash flows of nearly $40 billion every six months. It's the richest company in the world, with more than $256.8 billion in cash and marketable securities sitting on its books. Why does such a rich company have to borrow money? CEO Tim Cook gave a clue in his interview with CNBC "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer last week, when he announced Apple's intention to invest $1 billion into new U.S. manufacturing initiatives. Cramer asked, "But this is $1 billion of Apple's $256 billion?" "It's $1 billion of our U.S. money, which we have to borrow to get. That's another whole topic." The topic he's alluding to? Taxation. As of the end of 2016, Apple had more than $230 billion stored overseas. That's because, when Apple earns money from sales outside the U.S., it's taxed once by the country where it makes those sales, then taxed again by the U.S. when it brings the money back home. As a result, Apple doesn't bring that money home. Which leads to the absurdity Cook described later in his interview with Cramer: If you sell globally, you earn money globally. If you earn money globally, you can't bring it back into the United States unless you pay 35 percent plus your state tax. And you look at this and you go, 'This is kind of bizarre.' You want people to use this money in the United States to invest more. We are in a good position, but an unusual one. Our good position is we can borrow. And so to invest in the United States, we have to borrow. This doesn't make sense on a broad basis... Changing the tax policy on repatriated funds is one of the areas that President Trump and congressional Republicans have talked about fixing. In a one-page outline issued earlier this month, Trump suggested a one-time tax at a lower rate (perhaps 10 percent) on repatriated funds -- a so-called "repatriation holiday." President Obama proposed a similar repatriation holiday but it never got through Congress, and the results of a 2004 holiday under President George W. Bush did not lead to substantial job growth, according to a 2011 Senate report. Even so, the spectacle of a cash-rich company issuing bonds to fund domestic operations is a great argument for why this kind of tax reform makes sense. show chapters Jim Cramer talks with Tim Cook: The full interview    Wednesday, 3 May 2017 | 7:36 PM ET | 24:04 Matt RosoffEditorial Director, Digital Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AAPL --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

The added bells and whistles will roll out later this year as part of "Fall Creators Update" that will be provided for free to 500 million personal computers, smartphones and tablets powered by Windows 10. Microsoft previewed the update Thursday in Seattle during its annual conference for applications developers. The company didn't specify when it will be available; a preview for early testers was released Thursday. The latest changes come on the heels of a free update that began to roll out last month. "We are building Windows to be the platform that empowers everyone to create," Terry Myerson, Microsoft's top Windows executive, wrote in a blog post . Some of the upcoming tools represent another step in Microsoft's attempt to catch up with two of its biggest rivals, Apple and Google. Along that vein, a new feature called Story Remix will automatically identify the best photos and videos to help people create highlights of their experiences. Microsoft also is opening up Windows 10 so it works better with the smartphones and tablets running on Apple's iOS and Google's Android software. A growing dependence on those mobile devices has reduced the role that Windows-powered PCs play in people's lives. That shift to smartphones and tablets also is one of the reasons the next Windows 10 update will include a multi-faceted clipboard to let you copy text, images and other content on a PC and paste it on a phone, even iPhones and Android, as though the PC and phone were one. The tool is similar to what Apple already offers with Universal Clipboard in iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Another upcoming feature will let you start working on a document on a Windows 10 PC and pick up where you left off on a rival phone. In another concession to the popularity of Apple's products, iTunes software will be added to the Windows Store - an announcement that evoked some of the loudest cheers in Thursday's crowd. That development will be particularly helpful for students using a streamlined version of Windows designed for classrooms. That recently introduced version, Windows 10 S, can't get apps directly from third parties such as Apple, as regular Windows 10 users can. Meanwhile, Microsoft is vying to be more of a trailblazer by expanding its exploration of a new technological frontier that allows people to blend the real world with three-dimensional projections of life-like images. The Redmond, Washington, company calls the emerging field "mixed reality" because it melds the artificial with things that are actually happening around us. The concept is more commonly known as augmented reality. Another format that immerses people in completely fabricated situations is known as virtual reality. Microsoft plans to introduce a new headset and motion controller in time for the holiday season. The equipment, to be made by Acer, will sell as a package for $399, far less than the $3,000 to $5,000 Microsoft charges for another mixed reality headset called HoloLens.

By Oscar Raymundo Staff Writer, Macworld | May 11, 2017 2:13 PM PT Credit: Amazon More like this Amazon Prime Video reportedly coming to the Apple TV, answering countless... Apple snags Amazon Fire TV exec to lead Apple TV efforts It's not too late for Apple TV Video What happens to companies that depend on the iPhone? Apple and Amazon have settled (at least some of) their differences. Amazon Prime Video is officially making its way to the Apple TV. Apple will announce the all-new Amazon Prime Video app for Apple TV at this year’s WWDC keynote on June 5, according to BuzzFeed. Then the app will reportedly hit the tvOS App Store this summer. In addition, Amazon.com will be start selling the Apple TV set-top box again after being banned two years ago. This corroborates an earlier report that Apple and Amazon had reached an agreement to the benefit of both their streaming media strategies. Amazon Prime members who own an Apple TV have another reason to renew their membership, and the Apple gets to put the Apple TV back on Amazon’s massive retail platform. [ Further reading: The best media streaming devices ] This is a big win for Apple. In 2015, Amazon banned the Apple TV from its store because it did not have a Prime Video app. At the time, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said Apple did not offer “acceptable business terms” for them to develop a tvOS app. It’s likely that Bezos and company found it unacceptable that Apple should take a 30 percent cut from all Prime memberships via the App Store. Prime members with an Apple TV have had to use a workaround involving the Amazon Prime Video iOS app and AirPlay in order to watch Amazon originals like Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle. This works fine, but when Netflix, HBO, and Hulu all have companion apps that reside right on the Apple TV’s home screen, it’s easy to forget about Prime Video. Why this matters: Amazon has done a great job developing original programming. (Maybe Tim Cook is a little bit jealous he doesn’t get shout-outs during the Emmys and the Golden Globes.) Amazon’s award-winning originals makes it frustrating for Apple TV viewers that can’t access them as easily as what’s on HBO and Netflix. It’s great to see that Bezos and Cook have stopped being so petty for the sake of their audiences. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Simultaneously, Apple has also lost one of its top sleep experts. According to a report from MobiHealthNews, Apple sleep scientist Roy J.E.M Raymann has departed the company… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover According to his LinkedIn profile, Raymann worked on Apple’s Night Shift display technology, which adjusts the color temperature of displays based on the time of day. Additionally, Raymann also worked on the iOS Bedtime alarm feature and various ResearchKit and HealthKit initiatives. Raymann originally joined Apple back in 2014 and it was believed that he would be working on Apple Watch technology, though that has since turned out not to be the case. Prior to Apple, Raymann was a sleep scientist at Phillips. It appears that Raymann departed Apple in April of this year, taking his talents to SleepScore Labs – a San Diego company that helps people who experience suboptimal sleep. It’s not explicitly clear as to why Raymann left Apple. Apple earlier this week acquired popular iOS sleep tracking platform Beddit. For those unfamiliar, Beddit works by having the user place a small tracker underneath their bedsheet and then providing detailed information about sleep quality via accompanying iOS and Apple Watch applications. While it’s still unclear as to how much Apple paid for Beddit, the company has confirmed the acquisition. Sleep tracking remains one of the most sought after features for Apple Watch and Apple’s acquisition of Beddit likely means that the company is putting an intensified focus on the area. What’s interesting at this point is whether Apple will use a hardware solution like Beddit’s, or if it will simply use the Apple Watch for all sleep tracking. watchOS 4 is likely to be unveiled to the public next month and while it may be wishful thinking, it’s possible that sleep tracking could be a tentpole feature of the update, but we’ll have to wait and see.

A roundup of things you might actually use Screenshot ... Windows Story Remix in action 11 May 2017 at 21:22, Thomas Claburn Build At its Build 2017 developer conference in Seattle, US, on Wednesday, Microsoft turned its attention to Windows and cozied up to competitors. The day before, CEO Satya Nadella said Microsoft now sees its business in the context of edge devices and cloud services, informed by artificial intelligence algorithms. Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group, made clear that Microsoft hasn't forgotten about Windows. He presented a preview of the Windows Fall Creators Update, which will arrive – spoiler alert – this fall, at some point. In a press briefing, Microsoft communications chief Frank Shaw insisted day two should be seen as a continuation of day one, as if none of Microsoft's offerings were more important than others. But it's hard to see Azure as anything other than the favored child with Microsoft's repositioning of Windows as one platform among many. Of course, Windows and Office must be tended and milked for cash, but they don't promise to grow at the same rate as Microsoft's Azure and cloud-related businesses. The conceit of "Windows everywhere" and the Windows-centric worldview implied by the company's home address, One Microsoft Way, has given way to Windows somewhere. Or as Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president in the Operating Systems Group at Microsoft, put it, "Windows PCs will love all your devices." Those who recall Apple's 2001-era Digital Hub strategy may experience a sense of deja vu. The difference is that today the hub endpoints may be platforms in their own right. Nadella's observation that the typical Microsoft customer will have multiple network-connected devices assumes that some of them will not be running Windows. It's a practical acknowledgement that Microsoft products must play nice with Android or iOS devices. It's been evident for several years that Windows uber alles has given way to resignation and realpolitik. At Build 2017, it became obvious. Microsoft has no answer to Android or iOS. So it is accommodating them. Microsoft updated Project Rome, otherwise known as Microsoft's Remote Systems platform, with an iOS SDK. Project Rome consists of a set of APIs on various platforms that link client devices and host services through a Microsoft Account. The software is designed to connect Android, iOS, and UWP apps to the Microsoft Graph. If you can't beat them, capture their data. It has worked, so far, for Facebook. Lamenting that "platform wars have made it harder for customers," Myerson said Microsoft is focused on creativity. There's little doubt that competitive conflict has hemmed in Microsoft's once vast hegemony. Staking a claim as a creative leader represents a different tact, a page out of Apple's playbook. It could work, particularly in light of Apple's failure to break new ground with its recent desktop and notebook computers, not to mention Google's scattershot hardware strategy. Microsoft showed off an app included with the forthcoming version of Windows that lends some credence to its artistic aspirations. Windows Story Remix combines photo and video management capabilities with automated editing and scoring, alongside augmented reality special effects. Think of it as "aiMovie." Using assorted AI-oriented algorithms, it can generate an edited video from multiple video clips, not to mention a soundtrack assembled from audio files. The app can track specific individuals, can recut the video on-demand, and can layer effects so they follow specific objects or people in the video. A demonstration of its capabilities – turning a soccer ball into a fireball in a short clip – prompted more audible enthusiasm than any other announcement at Build. iTunes in the Windows Store The Windows Fall Creators Update comes with a new design scheme, Microsoft Fluent Design System, previously known as Neon. Its goal is to help developers create more expressive and more engaging apps. Certainly, it's an aesthetic improvement. In keeping with the platform detente, iTunes will be coming to the Windows Store. So too will Autodesk Sketchbook and SAP Digital Boardroom. Stranger still, Microsoft, which previously made Ubuntu Linux available through the Windows Store, plans to offer SUSE Linux and Fedora Linux available too. The Windows Store in short has become a Linux store. Microsoft's cross-platform development arm, Xamarin, introduced Xamarin Live Player, a live coding environment for development, testing, and debugging. Live Player requires Visual Studio, or Visual Studio for Mac, and an iOS or Android device. By pairing the mobile device with Visual Studio, via QR code, developers deploy their application to the Live Player app, for iOS or Android, where they can test changes without recompilation and redeployment. Microsoft is upgrading its cross-platform foundation, for code through its forthcoming .NET Standard 2.0 UWP, and for interfaces, via the XAML Standard 1.0, also coming later this year. The cross-platform value proposition – write once, run anywhere – is generally seen as a promise that can't be kept. Developers understand that it often means write once, test everywhere, and lowest common denominator features. But the prospect of cross-platform code combined with cross-platform UI, from a company that offers capable development tools and isn't likely to fold overnight, makes Microsoft's development ecosystem look fairly appealing. And it keeps getting better. The Visual Studio Mobile Center, cloud services for building and managing mobile apps, now supports automated builds, distribution, analytics, and push notifications for UWP users. A preview of the Crash and Test services for UWP application is planned for later this year. The Mobile Center's Build service now works with Bitbucket, GitHub, and Visual Studio Team Services, making it possible to set up a Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Mobile Center has added support for iOS and Android test frameworks XCUITest and Espresso. Its Distribute service can push app builds to app stores or corporate Intune portals. And it has gained a Push service with user segmentation and targeting. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will include a much requested capability, OneDrive Files On-Demand. This allows users of the cloud storage service to access remote files using Windows File Explorer without having to download them and store them locally on a device. This ability to access remote files as if they were local is available from within desktop apps or Windows store apps via the Windows file picker. Files On-Demand supports both OneDrive and SharePoint Online team sites. OneDrive has been bestowed with another feature, Offline Folders, which caches folders on mobile devices and allows them to be accessed even when there's no network connection. Offline Folders are available on Android drives for Office 365 Personal and Home customers and for OneDrive business accounts. Support for iOS devices is expected in a few months. iPhone users may find some use for OneDrive for iMessage, which allows Apple's messaging app to display OneDrive content. Windows 10's next iteration includes a feature called Timeline that provides a visual history of file interactions. It's complemented by a capability called Pick Up Where You Left Off. Using Cortana, you can work a document on your PC, pause, and resume work on another Android, iOS, or Windows device. On a related note, a feature called Clipboard provides copy and paste support across connected devices to open OneDrive files. It sounds promising. Microsoft showed off its forthcoming Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers, peripherals designed for VR and AR applications to track movement within the user's field of view through headset-mounted sensors. The company said it is accepting pre-orders for the Acer ($299) or HP ($329) mixed reality headset from the Microsoft Store. Acer is also planning to selling its headset bundled with the motion controller ($399) during the holiday season. ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments MORE Microsoft Azure Windows Development Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Microsoft touts SQL Server 2017 as 'first RDBMS with built-in AI' Python slithers in next to R 21 Comments Microsoft beefs up Skype for Business as Amazon Chimes in Corporate comms face-off 7 Comments Embrace our cloud, damn you: Microsoft dangles 40% discount on Azure instances Embrace it! *shakes fist* 19 Comments Microsoft rolls the Deis for container wrangling Kubernetes championing continues with gobble of orchestration specialist 2 Comments Microsoft opens Azure India to the world, not just Indian users Those of you targeting Indian users can now do so with lower latency and local data storage UK.gov cuts deal with Microsoft to avoid £15m post-Brexit price hike Exclusive Pan-government deal applies to 200,000 licences 61 Comments Whitepapers Evaluation Guide for Mobile App Security Testing What do you need to look for when identifying, evaluating, and implementing mobile app security testing solutions?

Most tech investors know the story of the “founder” of Silicon Valley -- but these four lesser-known facts might surprise you. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 11, 2017 at 4:44PM Investors are likely familiar with the basic history of HP (NYSE:HPQ), the seminal tech company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a one-car garage in Palo Alto nearly eight decades ago. HP later evolved from a producer of electronic test equipment into the world's largest PC maker, a title which it held for about six years (2007-2013) before being overtaken by Chinese tech giant Lenovo. HP is widely considered the "founder" of Silicon Valley, but it hit many speed bumps in recent years. It changed CEOs three times within two years (2010-2011), pursued the disastrous acquisitions of Compaq, EDS, Palm, and Autonomy, and finally split into two companies -- with HP retaining the PC, printing, and imaging businesses, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise retaining its enterprise hardware and software units. HP's curved all-in-one Envy. Image source: HP. But today, we'll focus on four lesser-known facts about HP which might change your perception about this aging tech giant. 1. Apple might not exist without HP Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak both worked at HP. When Jobs was 12 years old, he wanted to build a frequency counter but lacked the proper components. Instead of asking his parents for help, Jobs looked up then-CEO Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him up. Hewlett was reportedly so impressed with Jobs' boldness that he gave him the parts and offered him a summer job on the assembly line. In a 1994 interview, Jobs said that "most people don't get those experiences because they never ask." A few summers later, Jobs was working at HP again when he met Wozniak, who was working on mainframe computers. Wozniak was reluctant to leave HP to start a new company, and even offered the design of the Apple I to HP five times -- but the idea was rejected each time. Therefore, it's safe to say that without HP bringing these two visionaries together and ultimately rejecting their ideas, today's tech industry might look very different. 2. It's an environmentally friendly company Back in 2006, HP and Apple were skewered by accusations that their laptops contained the highest levels of toxic chemicals among the world's leading PC makers. Those reports prompted both companies to clean up their acts over the following decade. In 2007, HP announced that it had achieved its three-year target of recycling one billion pounds of electronics, toner, and ink cartridges. The following year, it became the first PC maker to publicly release its supply chain emissions data. Those efforts helped it rank highly on Greenpeace's "Guide to Greener Electronics", which ranks companies every few years based on their efforts to reduce emissions, eliminate hazardous substances, recycle obsolete products, and halt the use of unsustainable materials in products and packaging. 3. It killed off Palm two years early When HP bought Palm in 2010, it thought that it could turn around the struggling smartphone brand within three years to compete more effectively against Apple's iPhone and Android devices. The company's Pre smartphones were fairly well-received by reviewers, but consumers shunned them in favor of iOS and Android devices with expanding app ecosystems. Palm's WebOS might have evolved into a much larger ecosystem if HP had completed that three-year plan. Yet Leo Apotheker, who replaced Mark Hurd as CEO in late 2010, abruptly axed the entire project after a single year in 2011. That stunning move turned its newest TouchPad tablet into a fire sale product, dashed hopes for WebOS-powered PCs, and permanently left HP behind the mobile tech curve. 4. It's been fighting with Oracle for the past six years HP sued Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) in 2011 after the company halted software development for the Intel Itanium processor used in HP's high-end enterprise servers. That decision was likely related to Oracle's decision to build its own SPARC-based servers. HP won the lawsuit in 2012, and Oracle was required to continue producing compatible software for Itanium-powered servers. Oracle was subsequently ordered to pay HPE, which inherited the legal battle after the split, a whopping $3 billion in damages. Oracle is currently appealing both the 2012 decision and the damages, so the animosity between these two companies won't fade anytime soon. But here's the ironic twist -- former HP CEO Mark Hurd, who resigned amid allegations of misconduct with an employee, is currently the co-CEO of Oracle. The road ahead Today's HP is a very different company from the one which Hewlett and Packard founded, the one where Jobs and Wozniak worked, and the one which kept tripping over its own feet with ousted CEOs and terrible acquisitions. Instead, it's a much more streamlined company that only sells PCs, printers, and imaging devices. And as I've stated before, this slimmed-down HP is definitely worth a closer look for value-seeking income investors. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Apple’s iTunes will soon be available on Windows Store, according to Terry Myerson, the executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group. During the Build 2017, Terry said that users of Windows 10 Home or Pro and Windows 10 S would have a complete set of iTunes features. These would include Apple Music and full support for Apple’s smartphone – iPhone. Apart from iTunes, Ubuntu OS will also be available to the said store. It started from the Linux Bash Shell that’s been added last year to Windows 10. With it, users can take advantage of this operating system without having to develop a dual-boot scenario. It means that the Fedora and SUSE Linux will also be accessible on Windows Store soon. The announcements were made after the company revealed the next major changes coming to the Windows 10. The arrival of Creators Update will be this fall. Most of the improvements are in the Windows Store. The UWP capabilities are heading to Visual Studio Mobile Center as well. Through UWP, apps can run on Windows 10 regardless of the hardware being used. That means apps can run not just on Windows 10 but also Android and iOS. Spotify is also on its way to the Windows Store. Unfortunately, complete details about them are scarce. With this addition, however, Windows 10 S will become less difficult to use. Moving On The company didn’t have a great time with mobile. Windows Phone may not be dead yet. However, Microsoft is showing that it’s ready to move on. It’s sneaking on iOS and Android devices. Microsoft wants its users to resume their activities regardless of what device they’re using: Windows, iPhone or Android. In the world of Microsoft, it won’t matter anymore what method you’re using. It has a lot of things on the table, and it wants to make them a reality. It also believes that it can make devices running iOS and Android to perform better. MacOS inspire many of the new features of Windows 10. But the company isn’t planning to force you to use its ecosystem. The company wants to fix the associated problems of using a Windows laptop and an iPhone device. Even though Microsoft offers several apps for iOS, apps aren’t always compatible. These latest developments show that the company is not interested in the software you’re using. Rather, it wants to focus on the person behind the screen. However, it’ll be difficult for Microsoft to achieve those goals. The reason for this is that Apple’s ecosystem is restricted. The good thing is that Microsoft won’t stop. The company wants to embrace devices broadly. It’s going to offer users better flexibility allowing them to choose whatever device they wish to use. Microsoft sees itself as the company that organizes cross-platform experience. It’s going to enable you to use tons of devices without having to worry about compatibility issues. Despite these difficulties, Microsoft vowed to try to succeed. “There’s work we can do to help people live in that complex life in a more orchestrated kind of way. We’re going to do a bunch of work that’s focused on the idea of Windows PCs love devices.” – Joe Belfiore Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Jane Danes Jane has a lifelong passion for writing.

Citing sources familiar with the plans, the outlet says that Apple will make the announcement next month at their World Wide Developers Conference. The move signals that the two companies have reached an agreement to end their years-long feud, which not only kept Amazon’s video app off of Apple’s set-top box, but also removed the Apple TV from Amazon’s storefronts. BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowksi, who has an excellent track record reporting on Apple’s future plans, says that the app is expected to go live this summer. Also, as part of the deal, Amazon will resume Apple TV sales at some point. If true, this will be a significant win for Amazon Prime customers using Apple TV. Currently, there is no way to natively access Amazon Prime Video on tvOS. WWDC will take place in San Jose, California and begin on June 5.

Now, a further report from Buzzfeed says the deal between the two firms has been inked and the app will be announced at WWDC on June 5. The source says a release is scheduled for this summer, although it may slip to a little later in the year. The frosting of the relationship between the two companies should also mean the Apple TV will be available to buy from Amazon once again. Related: Apple TV review Amazon removed the hockey puck-like device from its store fronts back in 2015 because it didn’t support Amazon Prime video. However, even when Apple announced tvOS would have its own App Store, Amazon didn’t bother to submit a Prime Video app to Apple, the report says. Given Apple TV supports pretty much every other major streaming platform, it was a surprise to see Prime Video absent from tvOS - especially as there has long been an Amazon Video app for iOS. iPhone or iPad owners were still able to cast Prime Videos to the Apple TV via AirPlay, making the whole standoff seem kind of silly. Now, it seems the two companies have come to an accord that’ll be greeted enthusiastically by Apple TV owners. What’s your favourite way to watch television in this modern age?

(Image: Debashis Sarkar/News18.com) During the second keynote of Build 2017, Microsoft surprised everyone by announcing that Apple would be bringing its iTunes UWP app to Windows Store by the end of this year. "Windows users will get the complete iTunes experience, including Apple Music and the iTunes Store, as well as support for iPhone and other Apple devices on any Windows 10 or Windows 10 S PC," said Microsoft in a statement.

In the dank underground chambers of James Ponsoldt’s The Circle, inside the literal bunkers of a tech conglomerate called The Circle, a fellow named Kalden (John Boyega) pulls Mae Holland (Emily Watson) aside and proclaims, a real act of love in James Ponsoldt’s world, that “you don’t have a cynical bone in your body.” The moment is neither cute nor sweet but just sort of sits in front of us. Watson’s Mae smiles and gives us Hermione’s please-the-professor grin. Is it real? Was it ever? “One of the many problems with The Circle is that it never gets much of a handle on Mae,” wrote Will Leitch in The New Republic. Angie Han, over at Mashable, calls the characters, Mae included, “empty vessels made to parrot diatribes.” This is jarring, as Ponsoldt’s last two movies were able to find rich and believable human expression in deadbeat dads and deadbeat novelists alike. Where many have seen this as the movie’s crushing failure (as testified by its 16% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), I see it as evidence of Ponsoldt’s stunning accomplishment as a narrative filmmaker. Have any of you actually been inside an Apple Store? Like the proverbial gingers, these people have no souls. Great Movie or Greatest Movie? People who like to talk about directors like to talk about careers. The move from low-budget to big, the space in between Whiplash and La La Land. Ponsoldt has been somewhat hard to exactly pin down, following his official ‘breakout’ hit (The Spectacular Now) with a deep nosedive into the preoccupations of the literary and David Foster Wallace-worshipping class (End of the Tour). His decision to take on Dave Eggers’ The Circle was both odd, because the man is box-office poison, and sort of reassuring: Eggers may be a poor man’s Foster Wallace but the contents could be sold as the big league Black Mirror the market is clamoring for. To note, it starred a baker’s dozen of bankable talent; in addition to billion-dollar franchise movie stars Watson and Boyega there was one indie breakout (Ellar Coltrane, of Boyhood fame) and one big wheel to draw in the publicity (Tom Hanks). There was even one dude who Twitter really likes (Patton Oswalt). It was all very much and most critics came in expecting something huge, the kind of middle-range hit the people like to say doesn’t exist anymore. By this note, people will say The Circle has failed, under-performing nearly everything at the box office and surely proving why small movies made in New York by contemplative men and large franchises made in LA by men with smart haircuts are what the world really needs. Get Out. Logan. Whatever. But The Circle also fucking rules. In Ponsoldt’s hands, the mildly large budget Hollywood production (made for $18 mil, which is more than La La Land but less than, you know, Moonlight) relaxes into a visual cornucopia of expensive-looking 21st century imagery, that many reviewers have spent time quibbling about whether it looks more like  Google or Apple. Whatever. The Circle mercifully returns us to the old science-fiction, manufactured not out of cleverness and knowing winks about things that can’t be paid for but one built out of the old brick and mortar that made us the worlds of Blade Runner and Total Recall, thick temples that we yearn to enter. For this reason, Ponsoldt whisks us inside the machinery without wasting too much of our time, on the whole, getting us there. Her family is great (played by Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton, in a small role that Ponsoldt makes heartbreakingly moving) but there is no reason to waste the kind of time with them that the writers over at, say, Doctor Who like to do. There’s also a lot of cool stuff inside this here Circle and Ponsoldt’s choices glimmer: unlike most tech satires, these are jabs aimed at tech consumers (most of us) instead of at the more successful tech overlords (almost none of us). We spot the Dalai Lama on the grounds and indie festival-headliner Beck is summoned to celebrate the latest project of Eamon Bailey, the folksy boss man that Hanks plays: SeeChange. (Here is where the only meaningful criticism of The Circle lies: to celebrate SeeChange Beck plays “Dreams,” one of his more mediocre late-career singles. Winkingly disappointing, like most new technology.) An oozing techno score from Danny Elfman (of “The Simpsons Theme”-fame) keeps things shiny and bouncing, like what a leprechaun DJ would spin between acts at Coachella. I’d work here even if Soylent Green were secretly being manufactured down in the pits. But that’s part of the genius of the set-up: there is no secret. Smashing together all the boring nuance of everyone’s little pet startup-turned-conglomerate into one big mega fortress of tech, the world of The Circle works because it evokes a world that may not be real to anyone who has had a drink with someone who likes to talk about their super-niche start up but is real enough to anyone who’s ever bought an iPhone. All Kalden, a sorta-defecting former co-founder of The Circle, shows Mae deep in the caverns is that The Circle happens to be storing all that info it processes. Big whoop and Ponsoldt doesn’t waste too much time here or with Kalden (pity for Boyega, who has really perfected the art of betraying evil empires, but good for the movie; in Eggers’ novel, Mae and Kalden have lots of horribly-written sex). His interests are, instead, with the ordinary people and their relationship with their ordinary jobs inside a tech conglomerate. How does it make them feel and so forth? The argument has also been made, say, by Christina Warren at Gizmodo, that Ponsoldt’s world is too familiar and, thusly, doesn’t go far enough. “The Circle’s supposed dystopian universe doesn’t feel far off enough to be effective,” she wrote, making the comparisons to products like GoPro and whatever talking camera Amazon is currently cooking up. Aside from holographic screens, there isn’t very much in The Circle that most rich people don’t already use regularly. But most tech dramas, Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror is referenced religiously as is some ’90s tech thriller starring Sandra Bullock, don’t have very much interesting to say about technology. That rating interactions via social media would be awkward? That trolls persecuting perverts is a moral conundrum? Who cares? These are all great dramas that keep people on the edge of their seats, but have nothing to say about the people inside of them besides some tidy Orwell-esque cynicism about human behavior? Ponsoldt, however, uses the pace and hum of the thriller to do what old school thrillers do: rapidly create a visually complex world and, then, immediately reducing it to the elements that he is interested in. Some kind of spy mission, normally. Many have claimed that Ponsoldt’s interests in The Circle can be boiled down to privacy. David Edelstein, writing for Vulture, elucidates it thusly: “The theme of The Circle is transparency versus privacy.” While this might be said of Eggers’ paranoid novel, I don’t buy that Ponsoldt’s interest in the slow erosion of privacy is anything more than superficial. Privacy is long gone and Ponsoldt knows that. What interests him, instead, is how people relate to each other in a perpetually public sphere, i.e. a sphere that is constantly being capitalized. The movie’s aesthetic language speaks to this: by concentrating on the world of one brand, Ponsoldt is able to emphasize its presence everywhere. The little ‘C’ of the movie posters pops up everywhere, from the back of computers and phones à la Apple products to Dad’s t-shirt after Mae signs him up for the company health plan because he’s dying (surveillance state or nah, America hasn’t changed that much). The bright red color scheme, meant to evoke Apple’s love of translucent grey-white or Facebook’s many shades of blue, gives contemporary American technological iconography the feel of Soviet-era Moscow. And SeeChange, the system of cameras spread throughout the world in the style of Google Earth that Bailey introduces, is not some cheesy harbinger of surveillance state doom fresh out of 1984, as many have read it. It’s a harbinger of the commodification of everyday life, all those sponsored Instagram posts brought to three-dimensional life. When Mae is made the star of a live-streamed feed that follows her every move, it’s not because of anyone in The Circle, least of all Bailey, actually cares about what she is doing. Many have compared this plot point, this reality-TV of the every day, to the conceit of Peter Weir’s one-note The Truman Show but it’s a comparison that falls flat. Weir’s interests were in mocking everyday post-suburban ordinariness, jumping onto a crowded bandwagon that included everything from to Magnolia to American Beauty. We are given love interests and we are diligently ensured that Jim Carrey’s Truman is a real dude who just wants a real life. The cold apathetic remove of The Circle, however, prevents us from making these same asinine conclusions. The Circle’s interest in Mae is far more compelling: they want to use her to chance a brand to millions of people around the world, to put an Emma Watson-face on a multi-billion dollar conglomerate that’s under investigation by the Feds. And, in order to sell the product, as many social media managers know, Mae has to be on! She has to be on when she is invited to sit in on a big meeting, which thrills her millions of followers but doesn’t get her out of her entry-level position. She has to be on when she accidentally walks in, digitally, on her parents having sex. When the best friend character, Annie (Karen Gillan), wants to talk about her real feelings or whatnot, those real painful things which we often tune into the interweb precisely to hear from others, she begs Mae to not record her, to not force her to package those feelings into something that’s similarly and performatively on. It’s this self-conscious alienation, between our actual real lives and the version that everyone in media is compelled to be selling, that Ponsoldt masterfully captures. It’s also a space, in both Ponsoldt’s movie and our own, that is, often carefully gendered. The Instagram star, taking photos of their ordinary life, is, most popularly, a woman. The world of tech executives, who make most of the actual money off of this, remains, more often than not, male-dominated. The Circle reproduces this dichotomy perfectly. Mae, after all, becomes a viral sensation not because of any slavish and Silicon Valley celebrated genius-like attribute — Watson plays it perfectly with an ear for all the notes of false-modesty befitting today’s Jennifer Lawrence-era celebrity — but because she is an object of a vaguely-defined lifestyle lust. Ponsoldt depicts the moans of her followers with little tweets (called zings) that surround Watson whenever she’s online. The zings yearn. The zings are a pleading voice that wants to inhabit her life and she, in order to keep her job, must let them and must look like she loves it. Does she secretly hate it, does she yearn for anything else herself? We don’t know because we are, as viewers, just another follower. We realize, as anyone that follows a single blog must, that it is only participating in this walking advertisement that allows her to rise in a male-dominated tech company, where a chummy Oswalt joins the rebellious Boyega and the bearded Hanks as the company’s dick trifecta. Annie, while an executive, is slowly driven crazy in her attempt to compete with her male peers in the boardroom of the company they founded. All Mae has to do is give them, The Circle, her body. Ponsoldt’s twist, which differs significantly from the ending of Eggers’ novel, is that Mae uses that power to turn that objectifying, commoditizing gaze back onto its creators. Earlier in the movie, The Circle leaks the private email correspondence of a senator, coincidentally also a woman, who is forced to resign in controversy — evoking a neat real-world parallel to our own almost-first female president. Mae, exploiting her relationship with Kalden and her newfound audience of millions, trains that arrow on Bailey and his masculine ilk. Their private lives, their private and super-private email correspondences (Watson reading out all this is joyful) are released like doves in the wind. Ponsoldt plays all this like the explosions and blast of the Pixies that greets us at the end of Fight Club, a delightfully absurd euphoria enjoyed by the powerless. Watson’s performance as Mae is nothing short of a work of genius: always buzzy, always excited, always ambitious, she feels like a DJ Khaled of the tech world, both juicily inscrutable because the language they speak is purposeful without meaning. When she comes to the conclusion that the ideology of The Circle must, self-destructively, be turned inward, it is because it is not unlike the patriarchy of Silicon Valley, a holdover of an old social order. Ponsoldt deliberately, as he did in End of the Tour, does not mitigate this performance with useless and tedious characterization. Unlike, say, Spike Jonze’s Her — a movie that also looked at the effects new technology might have on an amiable protagonist played by one of Hollywood’s coolest talents — there is no meaningless love story, there is no personal arc for us to watch characters climb like children at a climbing wall. Where Her reduced the conceit of AI to Scarlett Johansson’s voice in order to show how it related to a writer getting laid, The Circle uses a contemporary surveillance scheme to show how it alters the way people interact with their own lives and each other, evoking an incapacity to create sincere engagement when all engagement is branded. The risk that Ponsoldt takes — unlike even Eggers, who provides a more definitive answer in his ending — is that he does not let us on: the movie’s token anti-technology character, the staple holding together every episode of Black Mirror, is Coltrane’s horrendously boring folk artist who self-consciously martyrs himself, signifying nothing. The deliberate limpness of his performance is yet another genius stroke; a smart parody of off-the-grid subculture, Ponsoldt’s uses him to point to its impotence. Yet, for a movie that spends a considerable amount of its time streaming the personal details of its protagonist’s life to an audience of millions, many have complained that The Circle feels thin. But this merely restates the movie’s ultimate point: as content consumers, we are perpetually alienated from getting ‘a handle’ on anyone. Does Kylie Jenner genuinely enjoy Pepsi? What about the clothes she wears? What about absolutely anything about her as a person? In a world where technology has, as they say, taken over everything, the space for sincere bones, hidden and shown in private light is nonexistent. It’s all gloss and it’s all great. Much like The Circle. The Circle is great. MoviesOpinionsScience Fiction Previous ArticleHear Us Out: What If ‘World War Z 2’ Is Great?

Apps that use the new SKStoreReviewController API can invoke a new standardized prompt offering users to provide a rating or write a review without taking them to the actual App Store. This feature has been available on and off for beta testers and should be available to the public in an upcoming update to iOS 10. These in-app prompts for ratings and reviews can be disabled at once for all apps installed on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch which support the feature. This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for how to disable in-app ratings and review requests in iOS. How to disable in-app ratings and review requests on iPhone and iPad To opt out of receiving these feedback prompts, do the following: 1) Launch Settings on your iOS device. 2) Tap iTunes & App Stores. 3) To disable all in-app prompts for App Store reviews and ratings, flip the switch In-App Ratings & Reviews switch to the OFF position. This will prevent all apps that are installed on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from asking for product feedback in the form of App Store ratings and reviews. Again, this toggle has no bearing on apps on your device that do not use iOS 10.3’s new SKStoreReviewController API. Please think twice before disabling in-app ratings and reviews. As I explained before, the new API streamlines the product feedback experience with standardized prompts limited to three per year per app. As Apple itself suggests, you should help developers and other users know what you think by letting apps ask for product feedback. Like before, your submitted ratings are valid for the App Store territory where you originally purchased the app. You can also leave ratings and write reviews for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch apps directly in App Store, and for macOS apps in Mac App Store. You can also leave ratings for Apple TV apps, but not submit reviews. About in-app ratings and review requests iOS 10.3 beta gives users the power to silence in-app prompts seeking App Store feedback. In the past, developers were free to interrupt the experience and inundate users with pesky prompts asking them to provide a rating or write a review on App Store. With the new SKStoreReviewController API, developers simply choose when they’d like to prompt the user and identify places in their apps where it makes sense to ask for feedback, and the system takes care of the rest. The system allows users to submit a rating through the standardized prompt and authenticate with Touch ID to write and submit a review, all without leaving the app. The API limits these requests to three prompts per app in a 365-day period. The counter is not reset when the app is updated. The hope here is that the new API will encourage developers to strategically ask for feedback for major updates only. Previously, many apps would aggressively ask for feedback after each and every update because App Store erases an app’s average rating with each submitted update. Apps that don’t use the aforesaid API can still put up a bespoke prompt seeking feedback “at appropriate times throughout the user experience,” according to Apple. App makers that use iOS 10.3’s new SKStoreReviewController API save time because the system decides when to pull up these in-app prompts and how they’re rendered. Users benefit from having the standardized prompt and the ability to write a review or submit a rating without leaving the app they’re in. When the user sees an in-app prompt seeking App Store feedback, he or she can authenticate with Touch ID to write and submit a review, right there and then. “The system’s rating prompt offers a familiar, efficient experience that’s designed to engage the user with minimal impact,” explains Apple. As a bonus, developers can at long last respond publicly to App Store reviews. Any questions?

So how did that work out? (Yuriy Humber) the brief Tech companies are now trading like the utilities of old. Photo: iStock Businesstech stocks Tech companies have become a drag on economic growth The volatility of tech stocks has fallen below the volatility of utility stocks By David P. Goldman May 12, 2017 3:48 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 The stock market’s so-called Fear Index, the VIX gauge of implied volatility on S&P index options, traded this week at its all-time low of around 9.75%. Only on a couple of occasions during the past 30 years has VIX dipped this low, and commentators are puzzled by the apparent expectation of market stasis, despite the uncertainty of a new administration, the vagaries of Fed policy, and the worrying fact that US stocks are priced to perfection. There’s a simple answer to the riddle: It isn’t the same market. Once upon a time the US stock market had disruptive challengers changing the economic landscape — Apple, Google, Cisco, Intel and a half dozen other upstarts. The same companies are there, but they have morphed from the equivalent of Luke Skywalker to Jabba the Hut. Tech companies used to be aggressive growth stocks, the kind that young people bought for long-range gain, while retirees stuck to less-volatile instruments like utility stocks. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox The world officially went topsy-turvy this year, when the volatility of tech stocks fell below the volatility of utility stocks. The graph shows the implied volatility of options on the S&P tech sector ETF (ticker XLK) vs. the implied volatility of options on the S&P utilities sector (XLU). Options on volatile stocks cost more than options on stable stocks, because volatility increases the likelihood of a payout. Implied volatility is backed out of the prices of traded options, and reflects investor expectations about future stability. Why would investors expect less volatility from tech stocks than from utilities? Because they are utilities, that is, utilities with neither debt nor regulation. Power, water and sewer companies charge a stable fee to a predictable base of customers. They borrow heavily to build facilities, and are subject to public regulation, such that changes in interest rates and public policy can affect their value. Historically, though, they were widow-and-orphan stocks, the least risky sector of the equity market. In the disruptive days of the 1990s tech boom, the volatility of the S&P technology subsector was two to three times the VIX index. Today the implied volatility of XLK, the tech sector ETF, is actually lower than the VIX. The tech companies have brought down the overall level of market volatility. Tech companies now sit atop a virtual toll booth and impose a charge on a myriad of transactions. Like water and power companies, they have monopolies, although these monopolies are driven by the price of infrastructure and the network effect. Google has the Internet-advertising monopoly. Microsoft has the personal computer software monopoly. Amazon has the Internet sales monopoly. Facebook has the targeted advertising monopoly. And Apple has the oddest monopoly of all: it is the vehicle by which customers assert their individuality by overpaying the largest-capitalization company in the world. Jonathan Taplin observed in the New York Times: “In just 10 years, the world’s five largest companies by market capitalization have all changed, save for one: Microsoft. Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Citigroup and Shell Oil are out and Apple, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon and Facebook have taken their place. They’re all tech companies, and each dominates its corner of the industry: Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market. In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.” No-one can challenge Google, because the network effect self-reinforcing: the more people rely on it for searches, the more comprehensive it becomes. Websites design their content and coding to maximize Google hits, enhancing its monopoly position. Few websites can survive without Google push ads, which means that Google can tax Internet traffic until the cost of advertising makes it unprofitable. No-one can challenge Amazon. The physical cost of its warehouse infrastructure places a formidable threshold in front of any would-be competitor, and it is a brave business indeed that would forego Amazon’s platform for Internet sales. That allows Amazon to charge a toll on roughly half of all E-commerce in the United States. Business startups used to have a shot at the big time. Now they are sharecroppers on the Amazon-Google-Microsoft-Facebook plantation. The monopolies allow them to make a living, but charge them a toll on every transaction steep enough to keep them small. Product quality has nothing to do with it (as any user of Microsoft Windows will attest). The technology itself fosters a winner-take-all environment, and the winner can squeeze future competitors. As Ryan Cooper wrote recently in The Week: “What makes Google’s search dominance profitable is network effects. Without a large internet to index, and a huge number of people looking for things online, even the best imaginable search would be worthless. The upshot here is that both Google’s overwhelming search dominance and their profitable exploitation thereof are almost wholly unmerited in terms of their actual product. Google is a fine tool, but what defines the company is luck. Its profits come from a largely unearned strategic position within a socially-created communication medium.” Ryan Cooper, Jonathan Taplin and other commentators have suggested some form of regulation or anti-monopoly action to break up the monopolies. Google has long anticipated the day in which the sharecroppers would rise up against the plantation house, and tries to insure itself against such action by cultivating political influence. In 2014, it spent more money lobbying than any other US company. Last year The Guardian described Google’s “revolving door” of senior government advisors hired to lubricate relations with European governments. At Barack Obama’s 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver, the Google party was the premiere event with security that rivaled that of the White House (I crashed it by means that I will not here reveal). Most persuasive is the fact that the tech companies trade like monopolies. They walk like a duck, quack like a duck, and fly like a duck. The collapse of market volatility betrays paralysis, not confidence. A market with no volatility has no upside, either. I do not believe that regulation or anti-monopoly action is much of a solution to the problem, although it might mitigate some of the baneful effects of the tech monopoly. The trouble is that the United States is still coasting on the impact of inventions first made practical in the 1960s and 1970s: mass-produced integrated circuits, inexpensive lasers, light-emitting diodes, and the Internet itself (a latecomer in 1983). The rise of Microsoft, Google, Apple and Facebook could not have been anticipated 40 years ago, even after the building-blocks were already on the market. We have yet to invent the next generation of technologies that will displace the existing monopolies. And until we make concerted effort to do so, the American economy will languish in the sort of stasis that the options markets reflect.

Raymann joined Apple as the company was developing the Apple Watch, and at the time, his hiring spurred rumors that the device would have sleep tracking capabilities, which never materialized. Prior to joining Apple, where he served as "Health and Health Technologies Staff," Raymann was at Philips where he founded the Philips Sleep Experience Laboratory, a non-clinical sleep research facility. According to his LinkedIn profile, while at Apple, Raymann worked on Night Shift, the Bedtime alarm, display recommendations and color filters, and HealthKit and ResearchKit. News of Raymann's departure comes just days after Apple acquired Beddit, a company that produces a sensor-equipped sleep monitoring system. It's not yet clear what Apple plans to do with Beddit's technology, but Apple is continuing to sell the Beddit sleep monitor and has updated its privacy policy to note that it is collecting sleep-related data that could influence future projects at the company. 28 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) lars666 11 hours ago at 01:16 pm "Sleep expert" – found my new title.

I noticed the video because it was retweeted by Lisa Jackson, Apple Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. You may wonder why an Apple senior executive is retweeting politically-charged SNL videos. It could be that she’s a huge Melissa McCarthy fan—because yeah—or it could be the Apple product placement at 38 seconds. Here’s the tweet and the video: This week’s host @melissamccarthy feels pretty, oh so pretty. #SNLLiveCoastToCoast pic.twitter.com/dvh4ZmXPmc — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) May 10, 2017 Is This Apple’s SNL Ad? You may remember that SNL is producing an ad for Apple. It’s clearly product placement, but this isn’t the ad, per se. But it is almost certainly a teaser for that ad, which was announced in April as in-show content paid for by Apple. Consider the tweet part of the package. Melissa McCarthy has had a huge hit with her Sean Spicer impression. If it’s no coincidence Apple Watch is featured so specifically, it could be a play on Mr. Spicer’s social media-captured trip to an Apple Store to buy an Apple Watch. I don’t feel too strongly about that angle because that story involved someone asking him what it’s like to work for a fascist. That doesn’t seem the sort of thing Apple would want to step into, but who knows where the skit will go? Lastly, I love this trailer and can’t wait to see the full skit.

The news comes courtesy of BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski, who often accurately shares details on Apple's plans ahead of events. According to Paczkowski, sources of Apple's plans say the company will announce an Amazon Prime Video app during its keynote event. There are tentative plans for the app to go live in the summer, but its official release date could change. With Amazon Prime Video on the Apple TV, Amazon also plans to resume offering the Apple TV through Amazon.com. Amazon stopped offering the Apple TV and the Google Chromecast in 2015, citing Amazon Prime Video incompatibility as the reason why. It is not known when the Apple TV will return to the Amazon website. News of a potential deal between Apple and Amazon that would see the app made available on the Apple TV first surfaced last week. At the time, Apple and Amazon were said to be close to an agreement, and now an agreement has been reached. Amazon Prime Video is one of the only major streaming video services that is currently absent from the Apple TV, and Apple TV owners have long wanted to see the Prime Video app on Apple's device.

Scott Lindsay No comments yet Tech Guru 42 Views Related Selecting a different search engine for Microsoft Edge Re-associating files to open with correct applications Stuck disk, unable to empty trash or Finder freezes? May 11, 2017 Setting up AutoPlay on Mac and PC When you insert a disk or a flash drive, or even connecting a camera, you can automate how some of these open and the program or app used to read the files. A simple feature can save a few clicks every time we use it. Let’s first start with the Mac. From the Apple menu, select System Preferences and then “CDs & DVDs.” For those of you that are familiar with the difference between a Mac and a PC, this illustrates how Microsoft typically builds more options into their operating system than does Apple. However, there is something to be said for simplicity. When you insert a blank CD, what do you want it to do? Did you know, iTunes can burn a disk for you? Select iTunes in the drop-down menu, or whatever you want to have happen. Do this for each of the options. When you come to selecting a DVD Player between more than one that you may use, select Open DVD Player and Finder will automatically open to Applications, allowing you to select your preferred DVD Player. When you have made your selections, just close System Preferences. If you find you don’t like your choices, return and change them. If you find you don’t prefer any of the choices, or if you have multiple choices, it is sometimes easier if you select “Ask what to do.” For those using a PC and Windows 10, there are a few places where we need to go to set up auto play. Click the Start button and then click the Settings icon. Next, click “Devices” and then click “AutoPlay” to the left. At the top, move the slider to turn on “Use AutoPlay for all media and devices.” Next, in the drop-down menus below, make your selections for removable drive and memory card. Now, farther below, click the link: “Default app settings.” On this page, you can make specific choices for your email, maps and others. Click each one you want to change and then make your choice. If you find you would rather start over, you can reset these to the defaults by clicking the “Reset” button. Once you are finished, you can close the settings window. Next, right-click your Start button and click “Control Panel” and then click “AutoPlay.” If AutoPlay isn’t showing, at the top-right, click the drop-down arrow next to “View by” and click “Large icons.” At the top, checkmark “Use AutoPlay for all media and devices.” Next, checkmark “Choose what to do with each type of media.” Now, you can go through all these options and select what you prefer. If you use the scroll button, be sure to click outside a selection after making it. Otherwise, it just scrolls through the drop-down menu options, changing what you just selected. Also, if you are uncertain, or you have differing preferences for a specific media, click “Ask me every time.” Then, after you insert your media, you can make the choice when the box of options opens. Once you make all your choices, click “Save” at the bottom-right and then close the control panel.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Pigs are flying as Apple iTunes, Ubuntu Linux head… Pigs are flying as Apple iTunes, Ubuntu Linux head to the Windows Store By Kevin Parrish — Updated May 11, 2017 2:03 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The wall between Microsoft and Apple is seemingly starting to crumble with the upcoming launch of iTunes on the Windows Store. During Microsoft’s second Build 2017 keynote, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group Terry Myerson announced that iTunes will be coming to the Windows Store. He said Windows 10 Home/Pro and Windows 10 S users will get the “complete” iTunes experience including Apple Music and full support for the iPhone. Myerson also revealed that the Linux-based Ubuntu operating system will be offered through the Windows Store as well. This stems from the Linux Bash Shell feature added to Windows 10 last year, which enables users to install and run Linux-based operating systems without the need to create a dual-boot scenario. That said, SUSE Linux and Fedora are heading to the Windows Store as well. Myerson made these announcements after officially revealing the next major update to Windows 10. Code-named Redstone 3, it will arrive this fall officially dubbed as Fall Creators Update, and will expand on what Microsoft introduced to Windows 10 in the first Creators Update released in April. One of the improvements will be in the Windows Store, which will see new app solutions across multiple platforms. For example, UWP capabilities are coming to Visual Studio Mobile Center. UWP is short for Universal Windows Platform, which is an architecture that enables apps to run on Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile no matter what kind of hardware is running underneath. This new capability will provide a more unified app experience across all Windows 10, Android, and iOS devices. “For consumer apps, we added 35 new payment instruments this year and now support payments in 247 markets globally. We have also seen monthly in-app purchase sales double year over year in the Windows Store,” Myerson added. He went on to talk about specific apps that will appear in the Windows Store. Spotify previously announced its intention to offer a UWP-based app after the introduction of Windows 10 S. Now, Autodesk plans to expand its UWP-based presence in the Store by way of its Autodesk Stingray graphics rendering engine, which will not only take advantage of proprietary UWP features, but support Microsoft’s Windows Mixed Reality platform. “When Autodesk introduced their UWP SketchBook last summer, it became their fastest growing new platform introduction with an average of 35-percent sales growth every month throughout 2017,” Myers said. “Autodesk SketchBook, the de facto application for painting and drawing, was built from the ground up as a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app leveraging the pen and touch capability of Windows 10.” Enterprise application software company SAP plans to invade the Windows Store this month with its SAP Digital Boardroom app. It will be a “next-generation” board portal providing a “single source of truth” for C-level executives wanting real-time contextual information, data summaries, analytic reports, and so on. However, it won’t be based on Microsoft’s UWP platform, but serve as a progressive web app instead. That means it will rely on web-based technologies but deliver an app-like experience. “This allows SAP to reuse their web content and investments to target multiple platforms, while at the same time take advantage of deeper integration with Windows 10,” Myerson said.

The company has applied for a patent that lets you use the digital assistant without having to talk to it. Here’s how Apple describes it in the patent: User input can be received and in response to receiving the user input, the user input can be displayed as a first message in the GUI. A contextual state of the electronic device corresponding to the displayed user input can be stored. The process can cause an action to be performed in accordance with a user intent derived from the user input. A response based on the action can be displayed as a second message in the GUI.

LEARN MORE In case you find that a little hard to understand (I know I did), this means the digital assistant (Siri), will perform an action in response to your input in a text conversation, then respond to the text. The most obvious use for this is environments where talking to Siri aloud is impractical — a very loud environment where Siri can’t hear you, like a sporting event; or a very quiet one where you can’t speak, such as a library (though definitely not a movie theater, you heathen). This might also be helpful for hearing-impaired users or those with speech impediments who might have trouble interacting with the audio-focused assistant.

Amazon Prime Video for Apple TV is expected to be introduced on stage at WWDC next month and launch later this summer, according to the report. Sony A6500 Amazon has long made Prime Video available through an app on iPhones and iPads, but so far Amazon has resisted creating an app for the fourth-generation Apple TV. The apparent feud between Apple and Amazon started back in 2015 when Amazon removed Apple TVs from its online store, citing confusion created by not having an Amazon Prime Video app. At the time, Apple worked privately with companies to add new channels to its TV platform individually and Amazon was pushing its own streaming hardware. Apple later released the current Apple TV which runs tvOS and has its own App Store that works like the iPhone and iPad App Store. Amazon has been able to create an app for a while now (and it’s been rumored before). As part of the new agreement, Buzzfeed says that Apple TV sales will resume on Amazon. As part of the arrangement between the two companies, Amazon — which stopped selling Apple TV devices two years ago, when it also banned Google’s Chromecast devices from its virtual shelves — will resume selling Apple’s set-top box. A hard date for the Apple TV’s return to Amazon and its storefronts couldn’t be learned. Apple’s WWDC keynote is scheduled for Monday, June 5 at 10 am PT where we’ll have full coverage all the announcements including iOS 11, macOS 10.13, and even a possible Amazon Echo competitor.

BuzzFeed News is reporting that an Amazon Video app designed for Apple’s set-top box will be announced at next month’s WWDC keynote. Recode revealed last week that Amazon and Apple were nearing an agreement that would bring to rest their years-long living room standoff. The Amazon app is likely to launch sometime this summer, though BuzzFeed News notes that the release timeframe could change. In exchange, Amazon will resume sales of the Apple TV. The online retail giant halted sales of the device in October 2015 because Apple’s box didn’t offer any way for Prime subscribers to access Amazon’s content. (Google’s Chromecast was also kicked off of Amazon for the same reason.) Keeping its content off the Apple TV for this long has ultimately been Amazon’s decision, however. Last May, CEO Jeff Bezos said that Amazon had yet to release an Apple TV app because the two sides couldn’t land on “acceptable business terms.” It took many months, but these two recent reports suggest that Apple and Amazon have reached a deal that’s acceptable to both. Bringing Amazon to the Apple TV could be essential if Apple plans to release an updated version of the product that supports 4K playback. Amazon is one of the largest sources of 4K movies and TV shows, though a fair amount of content is also available from services like Netflix and YouTube. Both of those companies offer apps for Apple TV.

Here are our favorites. The iPad is often accused of being "just" a big iPhone, and while it's true that the two devices share a number of similarities, there are also some key differences. Take, for instance, some of the Apple apps present on the iPhone but not the iPad. While the phone features built-in apps for voice recording, weather, and more, the same cannot be said for its larger-screened sibling. To that end, here are the best apps that you can get to act as replacements for the missing Apple apps on the iPad. Best weather app - WunderStation There are actually a lot of great and useful weather apps for the iPad, but WunderStation by Weather Underground wins out because of one major factor: flexibility. WunderStation connects you to Weather Underground's network of personal weather stations and provides readouts on everything from temperature to air pressure. Every data point is arranged in squares on a grid, and you can rearrange each square. Want more information on a particular set of data, such as your forecast? Tap the square to expand it and view more detail. In that expanded view, you'll often be able to switch between different types of data views. Check forecasts for the current day or up to 10 days ahead of time, keep an eye on air pressure, and watch the rainfall totals. Free - Download Now Best stocks app - Yahoo Finance Yahoo Finance provides the important stock information you need and helps you keep an eye on financial news throughout your day. As you might expect, you can add your favorite stocks to watch to the app, and watch their progress in real time from opening to closing bell. Check your stock's important stats, such as its market capitalization, 52-week low and high prices, and more. Tap the one or five days, three or six months, and one or five years buttons to see how your chosen stock has performed over time. With Yahoo Finance's Explore tab, you can find important stock watch lists, with each list featuring stocks from the same industry, such as cyber security or pharmaceuticals. Tap the Market tab, and you can track how the markets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia are performing that day. Free - Download Now Best voice recorder - Just Press Record Just Press Record is great for making a quick recording not only on your iPad but on your iPhone, Apple Watch, and Mac as well. The app is dead simple to use, and all you need to do to start recording is open the app and tap the big red record button. You can easily search for past recordings, and those recordings are synced between your devices using iCloud Drive. When you're done recording, Just Press Record can transcribe your audio into text if you want it to. You can even set up the app so it will automatically transcribe recordings, and even specify if it should transcribe all recordings or just short ones. Transcripts sync over iCloud alongside your audio, so transcription only needs to take place once. $4.99 - Download Now Best calculator app - PCalc PCalc offers power and versatility for all manner of calculations and is built for use by students, scientists, programmers, and more. The app features multiple themes so you can customize your calculator just as you'd like. There's also a massive set of other features, including an RPN mode, paper tape, scientific and engineering notation, and support for hexadecimal octal, and binary calculations. PCalc also makes it easy to convert units, from measurements to currency. In addition to multiple themes, you can also manually rearrange PCalc to suit your specific needs, with everything from the function buttons to the number pad able to be moved. $9.99 - Download Now Your favorites These are just our favorite missing app replacements, but we want to hear about yours.

On my iPad, I use ITWC's "The Calculator". It's free, has all of the scientific calculator features, an intuitive history features, and themes (though you either have to buy the packs or watch a video for an individual theme). I've used it for a long time, and have no complaints (and it's free!). 0 1 day ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Microsoft dropped the news in Seattle at its annual Build developers conference, offering that iTunes should be available for PC users by the end of the year. Microsoft said that once the app is released to the Windows Store, users of its just-revealed Windows 10 S operating system will get a "complete" iTunes experience, including Apple Music and full support for iPhone syncing. (There is currently a version of Apple Music for Android.) The refresh is needed because the education-centric 10 S only runs software from within the Windows Store, and apps from Apple or Google are not supported on the new system. It was announced last week that Spotify will also make its way to the Windows 10 store. Enter Debbie Downer: While adding a robust version of iTunes to Microsoft's new OS is a positive thing, it comes at a time when the app's original bread-and-butter -- buying/downloading digital music -- is experiencing a sharp downturn. According to the latest figures from Nielsen Music, digital album sales in the U.S. were down 18.9 percent in the first quarter, and digital tracks dipped a whopping 23.8 percent. iTunes is coming to the Windows Store! #MSBuild #Build2017 pic.twitter.com/R1Eh12rpXc— Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) May 11, 2017 FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

With exclusives like Harry Styles’ documentary and Lars Ulrich’s new show, your potential favorites can be easily missed. With our new “What’s Coming” series, we hope to keep you on top of all the latest and upcoming exclusive releases. We’re a third of the way into May and new films are still being announced for the month with even more coming in June. We’ll be sure to update the list here as new information is released, so be sure to bookmark this page. Let’s dive right in and see what you’ll be able to catch on Apple Music and Beats 1 starting in May and June 2017. TBD Starting off, there are quite a few exclusives that have yet to get confirmed release dates. Carpool Karaoke, originally slated this Spring, has now been delayed to “later this year.” The Planet of the Apps series, is still on for a Spring premiere, but with no more details than that. Dr. Dre’s Vital Signs had been initially reported as Apple Music’s first produced original series. The 30-minute six-episode long series has been described as a “semi-autobiographical” drama following Dr. Dre’s life. News on the series’ release has been quiet over the past year, and no new information has surfaced. A film that premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, and will soon be on Apple Music, is Clive Davis’ The Soundtrack of our Lives. Specific details on the release aren’t yet available. It’s safe to assume that with Apple acquiring the rights to the film, it will most likely focus on a digital release. Last up is the potential of unreleased Prince footage coming to Apple Music. Rights to the footage are currently in discussion amongst other streaming services, so details are sparse. Apple Music George Stroumboulopoulos’ House of Strombo Debuted: April 13th Technically having debuted last month, House of Strombo will be a ten episode long series featuring live house-party concerts. The videos come directly from George Stroumboulopoulos’ home alongside interviews with each of the artists. The first episode is available now featuring A Tribe Called Red. Harry Styles: Behind the Album Release Date: May 15th This exclusive documentary coming to Apple Music is a behind the scenes look at the former boyband member’s upcoming album, Sweet Creature. The debut solo album will be a proving ground for the artist to show that he can be more than a flash in the pan. As Harry Styles describes it, “I kind of wanted to see if I could write something that people liked, without knowing everything about me.” Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A Bad Boy Story Release Date: June 25th Image Credit: Tribeca Film Festival Puff Daddy’s documentary saw its initial showing at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, and will soon find its way onto Apple Music. The documentary follows Sean “Diddy” Combs, aka Puff Daddy, as he reunites with members of his Bad Boy Records label. The group comes together in a three-week rehearsal period to get ready for a sold out show at the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn. Kygo (documentary, title TBD) Release Date: June TBD Image Credit: Golden Hare Group Kygo, Norweigan DJ and house music producer, is set to release his own Apple Music documentary. Sources have confirmed the film will debut sometime in June, but exact details are still unknown. Beats 1 Lars Ulrich: It’s Electric! Debut: May 7th, 3 PM PT Lars Ulrich, Metallica’s drummer, has gotten his own debut radio show starting on Beats 1 this month. The show, It’s Electric! will have a focus on new and obscure music discovery. According to Ulrich, he will be playing “lots of really cool music by mostly bands that you don’t know; a lot of bands I’ve just been introduced to. We don’t believe in boundaries, and we’re open to everything.” For a complete lineup on Beats 1 shows, check out the official online schedule.

But with the iPhone 8 display hogging the headlines, it’s easy to forget that Apple’s next-gen iPhone will bring a lot of compelling features to the table, including advanced 3D sensors capable of best-in-class facial recognition. Don't Miss: Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting Echoing previous reports, The Korea Herald reports that LG Innotek has been tapped to supply the iPhone 8’s 3D camera sensors. The report said the company’s new facility investment worth 269.7 billion won (US$238.50 million) that was announced on April 27 will be dedicated to Apple’s orders. The initial deal size is estimated at about 200 billion won. According to the report, Apple’s implementation of 3D cameras will have a number of varied use-cases, including gaming and facial recognition. And while the iPhone 8 won’t be the first smartphone to feature facial recognition, there’s reason to believe that Apple’s implementation will be the best we’ve seen to date. Facial recognition on Samsung’s S8, for example, only uses “2D technology” and can readily be fooled. Remember, Apple earlier this year acquired an Israeli company called Realface, an innovative startup with really advanced and impressive facial recognition software. In fact, Realface’s technology is so advanced that it reportedly secure enough to be used for biometric authentication, an important tidbit given how easy it’s been to fool facial recognition systems on other handsets. While it’s unclear how much of Realface’s technology will end up on the iPhone 8, the company previously boasted that its advanced software makes use of incredibly reliable deep learning methods capable of delivering unrivaled performance almost instantly. Specifically, Realface boasts that it’s software is able to recognize faces with a 99.67% success rate, which believe it or not, is actually higher than the 97.5% success rate humans are capable of. All in all, the iPhone 8 is shaping up to be the biggest leap forward in iPhone technology we’ve seen in years, and perhaps ever. With an edgeless OLED display and advanced facial recognition, not to mention improved battery life and support for augmented reality, it stands to reason that the iPhone 8 will anchor the most sweeping iPhone refresh Apple has seen to date. And for those curious, below is a demo of Realface’s technology in action.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone SE (2017) or iPhone 7s to feature glass back, vertical rear... Apple iPhone SE (2017) or iPhone 7s to feature glass back, vertical rear camera By Bindu Nair - May 11, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet The iPhone SE may finally be getting a successor if a recent Weibo post is taken at face value. The leak features an image of four back shells said to be that of the second generation of the handset. At first glance, the alleged iPhone SE (2017) shells look fairly authentic, complete with an Apple logo and iPhone signature. The biggest change appears to be the material since it’s clearly glass rather than the metal found in the original. The sheet of paper below the parts reveals that Apple might be utilizing Ion-X glass for the iPhone SE (2017). Coincidentally, the same substance was used for the Apple Watch Sport. This particular type of glass isn’t as resistant to scratches as the sapphire one found on the higher-end models. Also See: iPhone 8 renders hint at all-glass design, thicker body The other major change which stands out is the camera setup. The first iPhone SE had a conventional horizontal placement like all other iPhones in the past. However, the second one could adopt a vertical placement where the LED flash unit sits below the lens. Interestingly enough, the upcoming iPhone 8 is expected to feature a vertical dual lens configuration with the LED flash unit placed in between. This has lead some reports to allege that the back seen above is actually for the iPhone 7s. The iPhone 7s is predicted to look similar to its previous variant but with a glass back to allow for wireless charging. Moreover, the panels in the leak lean more towards an iPhone 7-esque design rather than the iPhone 5S one the original iPhone SE resembled. The iPhone SE (2017), if it does exist, is expected to be announced on June 5 during Apple’s keynote address at the WWDC 2017. Stay tuned for more on the smartphone till then.

The main index touched the 10,000-point mark in the middle of a session earlier this week and closed above the mark yesterday on continued fund inflows that bet on strong demand for Apple Inc’s next iPhone series. “The much-anticipated new iPhone is definitely a driver and will continue to shore up the local bourse,” Hua Nan Securities Co （華南永昌證券） chairman David Chu （儲祥生） said by telephone. Chu declined to speculate on the potential ceiling, saying it is up to foreign institutional players, who increased their holdings in local shares by NT$4.09 billion （U$135.4 million） yesterday. Overbought positions on Monday totaled NT$232.6 billion, making Taiwan one of the most favored markets, Hsu said. Turnover was NT$96.364 billion yesterday on a par with average daily volume this year, Taiwan Stock Exchange （TWSE） data showed. Mutual funds raised their positions by a net NT$137.29 million, while proprietary dealers added a net NT$78 million. Apple had previously disclosed its suppliers, with 40 local companies on the list. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co （台積電）, which supplies processors for iPhones, rose 0.97 percent to NT$207.5, while Largan Precision Co （大立光）, a smartphone camera lens supplier, gained 0.3 percent to NT$4,960, TWSE data showed. The next-generation iPhones, likely to be released in September, are tipped to have a major redesign as Apple marks the 10th anniversary of the devices.

By Caitlin McGarry Staff Writer, Macworld | May 11, 2017 11:30 AM PT Credit: Cardiogram More like this The best fitness trackers at every price point Vi AI Personal Trainer review: Heart rate-tracking Bluetooth earbuds with... Withings Steel HR review: A hybrid smartwatch with heart Video Can the iPhone make better AR than Facebook and Snapchat? | The iPhone Show The Apple Watch has already saved lives with its heart rate-monitoring, but it’s often unintentional. A person might feel symptoms like dizziness or shortness of breath, then check their heart rate to confirm something weird is going on. A team of researchers just proved that the watch’s heart rate sensor can actually detect an early sign of heart disease without any symptoms at all, a development that could change how people use their Apple Watches. The Apple Watch’s heart rate sensor can accurately pick up atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rate that can lead to stroke or heart disease. Atrial fibrillation can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, so the Apple Watch isn’t a diagnostic device. But its accurate heart rate sensor shows there is potential for the watch as a health and fitness tool beyond its basic fitness-tracking features. Developers of the Apple Watch app Cardiogram worked with researchers leading the University of California San Francisco’s Health eHeart study to develop a ResearchKit-based study of their own called mRhythm. On Thursday, Cardiogram and UCSF’s cardiology division are presenting the results of that 14-month study, which collected more than 100 million heart rate data points from more than 6,000 Apple Watch users. Cardiogram developed a machine learning-powered algorithm that can detect atrial fibrillation, which is often asymptomatic. Cardiogram’s algorithm was tested against an in-hospital test called cardioversion. Patients experiencing atrial fibrillation, which affects one in four people in their lifetime and causes 25 percent of all strokes, wore an Apple Watch while undergoing cardioversion to compare outcomes. Both segments, the cardioversion test and the Apple Watch’s heart rate data, were blinded against whether the patients’ heart rates were normal or abnormal, then sent to Cardiogram’s algorithm. The results: the Apple Watch data detected atrial fibrillation 97 percent of the time. Cardiogram developer Brandon Ballinger said the results were surprising. “I don’t think anyone would’ve expected at the beginning of this study that a product you can just walk into an Apple Store and purchase would have 97 percent accuracy,” Ballinger told Macworld. “Apple did a fantastic job with the sensor.” Does that mean the Apple Watch’s optical heart rate sensor is always accurate? Not exactly, said Dr. Gregory Marcus, director of clinical research for UCSF’s cardiology division and lead researcher for the eHeart study. They’re “sufficiently accurate so as to distinguish a consistently irregularly regular rhythm,” Marcus said. Basically, the beats per minute as displayed on the watch screen may not be precise, but the sensor can accurately detect irregularity in those beats. “If you had a certain rate of inaccuracy, presumably on a population level that would be fairly consistent,” Marcus said. “As long as that’s not markedly different, it shouldn’t really matter as long as intermittently it’s getting it right. We’re not using it to tell us what the actual heart rate is, we’re using it to help us discriminate between a normal rhythm and atrial fibrillation.” The future of health apps The fact that Cardiogram has leveraged the Apple Watch’s heart rate data to develop an algorithm that can accurately detect an early symptom of heart disease is major. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that Apple isn’t interested in submitting the watch for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would significantly slow down the speed of hardware development. But Cardiogram’s Ballinger said he’s interested in testing the algorithm his team has developed more extensively and eventually submitting it for FDA approval, so Cardiogram’s watch app will be able to alert users when they should see a doctor. “I think health will be the dominant use case for Apple Watch and other wearables,” Ballinger said. “The average user of Cardiogram opens the app about five times a day. Heart rate data reflects everything that happens in your life. People use it for medical conditions but also everyday things like, ‘How well am I sleeping?’ or, ‘How stressful was this meeting?’ When I show this data to people it usually resonates with them. They say, ‘Oh, I had no idea you can find out all of this stuff from the watch’s heart rate sensor.’ In 10 years it’ll be silly to not have a heart monitor." Cardiogram's current watch app uses your heart rate data to offer lifestyle insights, as other health apps do. But in the not-too-distant future, health apps like Cardiogram will be much more powerful. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

That worries lawmakers Cloud boosts profits at Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Facebook launches digital assistant 'M' in US Microsoft, Apple, Google file legal action against Trump's travel ban Top trends in the technology space in 2016 A few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realised something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction — figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so — I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.   It wasn’t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 per cent of my household’s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What’s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.   This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there’s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: As warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.   This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.   The five are among the most valuable companies on the planet, collectively worth trillions. (Apple reached $800 billion in market capitalisation this week, the first of any public company to do so, and the others may not be far behind.) And despite the picture of Silicon Valley as a roiling sea of disruption, these five have gotten only stronger and richer over time.   Their growth has prompted calls for greater regulation and anti-trust intervention. There’s rising worry, too, over their softer, noneconomic influence over culture and information — for instance, fears over how Facebook might affect democracies — as well as the implicit threat they pose to the jurisdictions of world governments.   These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large — to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.   So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column’s companion quiz.   When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy — but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialise online using Twitter, Apple’s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg’s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.   Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don’t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft’s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I’d hate to lose it.   In third place, full of regrets: Apple. There’s nothing I use more than my iPhone, and close behind are my MacBook and iMac 5K, which may be the best computer I’ve ever owned. Abandoning Apple would prompt deep and truly annoying rearrangements in my life, including braving Samsung’s bad software. But I could do it, grudgingly.   It’s when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It’s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we’ve come to depend on them. In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can’t fathom living without it. Without the world’s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes — email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I’d need after ditching Apple — I’d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).   And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.   When the kids were born, it became my household’s Costco — supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?   ©2017 The New York Times News Service Read More On Amazon | Apple | Facebook | Microsoft | Alphabet | Technology | International PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.

Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?   ©2017 The New York Times News Service Farhad Manjoo | NYT Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 MORE ON MARKETS: Quick Links Stock Market Live Portfolio Commodity Market Upcoming IPO Personal Finance Stock Market News Derivatives Mutual Funds Gold Price Sensex Browse STOCK Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Browse Mutual Funds A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Index Stocks ACC Adani Ports Ambuja Cem.

Apple recently released its iOS 10.3.1 update and the company’s confirmed an iOS 10.3.2 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The iOS 10.3.2 update is in beta ahead of an imminent release date. While most people are focused on iOS 10.3.1 and iOS 10.3.2, others are looking ahead into the future of iOS. iOS 11 rumors have started to emerge and they’ve generated a ton of buzz amongst iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. The iOS 11 update still isn’t confirmed but there are a few things we think you should be aware of as we push deeper into the year. This iOS 11 release roundup covers some of the basics including the potential iOS 11 launch date and the iOS 11 release date. It also takes a look at the devices that could be left behind on iOS 10 and some of the early rumors. We’ll continue to add new information about the iOS 11 release to this roundup so check back for regular updates throughout the year. iOS 11 Launch Date Apple hasn’t announced an iOS 11 launch date yet but it’s easy to predict when we’ll see the company unveil its next operating system. For several years now, Apple’s announced new iOS software during its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) keynote. The company’s confirmed its WWDC 2017 dates so we now have an exact date in mind for the iOS 11 launch. WWDC 2017 is set for early June. WWDC 2017 is confirmed for early June with dates stretching from June 5th to June 9th. The event is moving from San Francisco to San Jose so you won’t see the Moscone Center when you tune into the event live stream. If you’re interested in the iOS 11 update, June 5th is the date to circle on the calendar because that’s when Apple will deliver its annual keynote to developers. Apple typically confirms new iOS software, release windows, and betas during its WWDC keynote announcement so look to be well informed by the end of day on June 5th. iOS 11 Beta Apple typically releases an iOS beta shortly after the conclusion of its WWDC keynote so it’s safe to assume the company will release an iOS 11 beta in early June. We expect the iOS 11 beta to mirror last year’s iOS 10 beta with a release for two different groups of testers. Look for the iOS 11 beta to come to paid developers first before shipping out to those in the free Beta Software Program. Apple’s beta software program is free for anyone with a working Apple ID and it lets the public test new iOS features and performance ahead of the official release date. If you’re interested in trying the early version of iOS 11, now would be a good time to start doing some prep work. iOS 11 Release Date Like the iOS 11 launch date, the iOS 11 release date is fairly predictable. Apple hasn’t confirmed a specific iOS 11 release date and its WWDC announcement will probably come and go without a firm date. We do expect Apple to confirm an iOS 11 release window and we expect the company to tag iOS 11 with a fall release window. The iPhone 8 release date is heavily rumored for September and new iOS software always lands with new iOS-powered hardware. Look for the iOS 11 update to get certified and released shortly before the iPhone 8 is released to the public. So, to recap: iOS 11 launch on June 5th at WWDC 2017. iOS 11 beta release in June for developers. iOS 11 release in the fall alongside the iPhone 8. Will My Device Get iOS 11? “Will my device get iOS 11” is becoming a common question amongst our friends, family and our readers. Apple hasn’t confirmed anything yet but it’s fairly easy to predict which devices will get iOS 11 and which ones may not. Apple’s most recent iPhones and iPads are in. If you own an iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPad Pro, or iPad mini 4, there’s nothing to worry about. You’ll get iOS software updates for a couple more years at least. There are, however, a few devices that are on the fence. The iPhone 5, Apple’s aging former flagship, is one such device. Apple appears to be phasing out 32-bit support with iOS 11 which means 32-bit devices like the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPad 4 are probably on their way out. The first concrete clues started appearing in the iOS 10.2.1 beta and we’ve started to see the idea pickup steam as the year’s gone on. Clips, Apple’s new video editing application, doesn’t support the iPhone or iPhone 5c. It’s a 64-bit application which is another sign Apple’s preparing to kill support for 32-bit apps and devices. We will find out for sure in June. If Apple is dropping support for these devices, it won’t extend an iOS 11 beta to owners. Other popular devices like the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 should be safe from Apple’s axe. iOS 11 Update As for the iOS 11 update itself, details are still pretty scarce. A report from Business Insider claims Apple is planning to add “augmented reality technology into the iPhone’s camera app.” Apple is reportedly exploring AR and mixed reality but it’s unclear if they will make it to the iPhone and iOS in 2017.  One questionable rumor from Israeli site The Verifier suggests Apple will be baking Group FaceTime calls into iOS 11. The report cites “several people familiar with iOS development.” The feature will reportedly allow iOS 11 users to start multi-person calls via a group conversation in iMessage with up to five people allowed in on the call. The site notes that while Apple is working on the feature, it could opt not to release it on iOS 11 and save it for a future update. Another possibility? A full-fledged Dark Mode. Oh look what I found… #darkmodeconfirmed pic.twitter.com/RYcFc162I5 — Andrew Wiik (@Andywiik) June 16, 2016 The feature briefly emerged in the iOS 10 beta but didn’t make it into iOS 10’s final release in September. There’s a chance Apple revives it with iOS 11. The iOS 11 update could also include changes to the iPad. The company is reportedly working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. According to Bloomberg, Apple “has considered allowing users to annotate objects in many applications across the whole operating system, including in Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage.” There’s also chatter about new video features for Apple Music. A profile about Jimmy Iovine in Bloomberg BusinessWeek claims Apple plans to “unveil a new edition of the Music app that better showcases video” alongside its next iOS update, presumably iOS 11. iOS 11 Beta: 7 Things to Expect & 5 Things Not To Expect an iOS 11 Beta Announcement on June 5   1 / 12 If Apple decides to release an iOS 11 beta, and we're very confident it will, you can expect the company to confirm the release during its WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th.  WWDC 2017 kicks off in early June though it will do so from a new location. Apple's taking its annual developer conference to San Jose this year. On June 5th, we expect Tim Cook and other Apple executives to address developers in attendance and the thousands of Apple enthusiasts and consumers watching from home.  The company hasn't said what it will be announcing but that keynote will probably be the launch pad for the iOS 11 update and its beta.  If Apple sticks to its protocol, you can expect an iOS 11 beta release shortly after the conclusion of the WWDC 2017 keynote on June 5th.    1 / 12 3 Responses 02/09/2017 Charlie Smith Reply Hi, I’m a blind iPhone 6 user, and what I’m hoping for, in iOS 11, is more voices for voiceover, the ability to use other text to speech engines, and more voiceover customization settings 02/19/2017 Stonewall012 Reply As of to date there is no 10.3.5. The iPhone 4s did not get ios 10. Please do your research before printing. 04/27/2017 Quinton Wilkerson Reply It would be atrocious if the mini 2 didn’t make the ios 11 cut seeing as how they JUST STOPPED SELLING IT the end of April of THIS YEAR!

A report on Thursday says Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has started to produce the new iPhone 8 processor.More The new processor bound for the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 8 — likely the A11 chip that will succeed Apple's A10 Fusion processor — recently entered production, according to a report. DigiTimes said on Thursday that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company started production of the new advanced chips for Apple's iPhone 8, following a few reported setbacks related to how the processor was stacked inside the phone. DigiTimes has an on-again-off-again track record, but typically has good insight into movements within Apple's supply chain. The report doesn't mention Apple's two other expected devices, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, by name. However, those devices are also expected to pack Apple's next-generation chip. All three phones are expected to launch this year, though recent reports have suggested Apple's high-end iPhone 8 is facing delays. KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this week production delays related to new OLED panels and 3D sensors could present a "worst-case scenario" of iPhone 8 shortages later this year. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are still expected sometime in September, when Apple typically launches its new iPhones.

The added bells and whistles will roll out later this year as part of “Fall Creators Update” that will be provided for free to 500 million personal computers, smartphones and tablets powered by Windows 10. Microsoft previewed the update Thursday in Seattle during its annual conference for applications developers. The company didn’t specify when it will be available; a preview for early testers was released Thursday. The latest changes come on the heels of a free update that began to roll out last month. “We are building Windows to be the platform that empowers everyone to create,” Terry Myerson, Microsoft’s top Windows executive, wrote in a blog post . Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement Some of the upcoming tools represent another step in Microsoft’s attempt to catch up with two of its biggest rivals, Apple and Google. Along that vein, a new feature called Story Remix will automatically identify the best photos and videos to help people create highlights of their experiences. Microsoft also is opening up Windows 10 so it works better with the smartphones and tablets running on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android software. A growing dependence on those mobile devices has reduced the role that Windows-powered PCs play in people’s lives. That shift to smartphones and tablets also is one of the reasons the next Windows 10 update will include a multi-faceted clipboard to let you copy text, images and other content on a PC and paste it on a phone, even iPhones and Android, as though the PC and phone were one. The tool is similar to what Apple already offers with Universal Clipboard in iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Another upcoming feature will let you start working on a document on a Windows 10 PC and pick up where you left off on a rival phone. In another concession to the popularity of Apple’s products, iTunes software will be added to the Windows Store — an announcement that evoked some of the loudest cheers in Thursday’s crowd. That development will be particularly helpful for students using a streamlined version of Windows designed for classrooms. That recently introduced version, Windows 10 S, can’t get apps directly from third parties such as Apple, as regular Windows 10 users can. Meanwhile, Microsoft is vying to be more of a trailblazer by expanding its exploration of a new technological frontier that allows people to blend the real world with three-dimensional projections of life-like images. ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says The Redmond, Washington, company calls the emerging field “mixed reality” because it melds the artificial with things that are actually happening around us. The concept is more commonly known as augmented reality. Another format that immerses people in completely fabricated situations is known as virtual reality. Microsoft plans to introduce a new headset and motion controller in time for the holiday season. The equipment, to be made by Acer, will sell as a package for $399, far less than the $3,000 to $5,000 Microsoft charges for another mixed reality headset called HoloLens.

In June 2016, Tekserve announced it was closing its Manhattan store after 29 years of service. “We love our customers, and we love what we do,” Tekserve CEO Jerry Gepner said when the closure was announced. “But there comes a point where that doesn’t make sense anymore, as much as we love it.” Their wonderful collection of vintage Mac hardware was auctioned off in August 2016. Developer MacPaw purchased the entire collection of 39 Mac computers for a cool $47,000 and gave it a permanent new home at its Ukrainian headquarters. “We think there’s hardly a better place for historical Apple computers than our futuristic Apple-inspired office,” said MacPaw. Check out the video tour of the museum, embedded below. The collection includes original Mac models dated from 1981 to 2017. Here are some of the items on display: 128K Macintosh signed by Steve Wozniak NeXT Cube 20th Anniversary Mac Original iMac 1994 iBook PowerMac G4 Powerbook G4 Aluminum iBook Twelve-inch Powerbook eMac iMac G5 Powerbook G3 All iPhone models There are a few non-Mac items, too, such as the “Iconic” book (an illustrated edition of Apple Design History), Apple’s “Think different” poster collection, the official book “Designed by Apple in California”, plus a couple of WWDC relics. According to MacPaw: As the Tekserve shop grew and became a landmark Apple dealer, the team found themselves surrounded by beautiful Macs of all kinds. In twenty years they decided to turn the best of them, groundbreaking models, as they put it, into a museum-like exhibition. And later, when the shop was shutting down, an Apple Lisa, an alien Nextstation Turbo machine, and the rest of the grand collection had to find a new home on an auction. The prospects looked pretty grim, because a collection like that had a high chance of ending up in some millionaire’s basement. Luckily, MacPaw’s CEO Olexandr Kosovan heard about the auction and made an instant decision. He secretly bought all of the iconic Macintosh computers before the collection was taken apart and sold piece by piece. The museum currently has 70 items, including the 40 items from the Tekserve collection and the first Apple Keeynoard with the help of which the code of CleanMyMac Classic was written by Kosovan himself when he was starting MacPaw back in 2008. Oleksandr Kosovan, MacPaw CEO and Founder said: Apple changed my life in many ways. Driven by Steve’s vision for better and simpler products I was able to implement these ideas in our products development. I cannot say thank Apple enough other than paying this great tribute to the history of iconic Apple products. Developers are planning on adding the few missing models to complete the collection (they welcome classic computer and hardware donations). As an in-office exhibit, this museum is not open to the general public. MacPaw are the developers of proven and successful macOS apps, including CleanMyMac, Gemini and the Setapp service billed as “the Netflix of Mac apps.” Additional photos are available at the MacPaw website.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Osorio/AP/REX/Shutterstock Famed Apple fanboy says ‘Apple no longer the most innovative company’ Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 11th, 2017 at 2:24 PM Share Tweet Walter Isaacson, a noted admirer of Apple and author of Steve Jobs’s official biography, is officially over Apple. In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Alley, Isaacson expressed his opinion that Alphabet and Amazon have overtaken Apple to become the real innovators. Steve Jobs is likely rolling in his perfectly-designed grave. Don't Miss: The OnePlus 5 might be even faster than the Galaxy S8 “Apple is no longer the most innovative of companies,” Isaacson said. “But they are good at execution.” That neatly sums up Apple’s current position: really great at making smartphones, but lacking in new product categories for a while now. Isaacson cites voice assistants as an example of where Apple is falling behind the competition. “I use both Amazon Alexa, and Google Home. … Sometimes I let them compete,” he said. Even though Apple is slated to launch a Siri-powered competitor to Amazon Echo in the near future, Isaacson thinks it’s too late for Apple to own that category in the same way it does the iPhone. Even though he doesn’t know what Apple’s next big thing will be, he does seem to think something is coming. “You could have a great company — and Apple is a great company — without having really a next big thing, but it isn’t in Apple’s DNA to be that way.” Apple has been riding the iPhone gravy train for 10 years now. Despite a few attempts to launch the next big thing — Apple Watch and iPad come to mind — nothing’s come close to rivaling the iPhone’s game-changing success since 2007. Undoubtedly, Apple is working on other categories (Tim Cook sure seems interested in augmented reality) but until the next One More Thing happens, Apple will continue its slow slide into mediocrity.

Apple and LG Innotek got together last year to develop the first-ever 3D facial recognition camera, which will be used for “a variety of applications from biometric authentication to games,” the report said. Read: Apple’s A11 Processor For iPhone 8, 7s, 7s Plus And iPad Refreshes Enter Production LG already supplies Apple with dual-lens camera modules found on the back of the iPhone 7. The upcoming camera is expected to be on the front side of the iPhone 8 and be smaller than the one on the iPhone 7. Both reasons are why LG is building a plant, the report said. LG reportedly invested 269.7 billion won ($239.5 million) in a new facility that will be dedicated to Apple’s orders. The facility was announced at the end of April and had an initial deal price of about 200 billion won ($177.6 million).   KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in February the iPhone 8 will feature a 3D facial recognition camera system. The 3D sensing camera could replace the touch ID feature on current iPhones while other rumors suggest Apple will ditch the physical home button for the iPhone 8. The 3D camera could also support augmented reality capabilities. However, previous reports claimed Himax Technologies would supply 3D sensors for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8. Another report added that optical and photonic products manufacturer Lumentum would supply parts as well. In March, it was reported STMicroelectronics would work on components for the 3D sensors for the new iPhone. The report said the iPhone 8’s release date would be delayed because some key components would not be ready for September. The parts reportedly were being produced by STMicroelectronics in a factory in France. iPhone 8: Features, Rumors, Price, Release Date The iPhone 8 is rumored to come with edge-to-edge OLED display. It was previously rumored Samsung would supply Apple with OLED panels. Apple and Samsung reportedly signed a $9 billion, two-year contract for OLED displays. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date: Apple Could Launch Device In October, According To Supply Chain Reports It was also rumored the iPhone 8 would come with a dual-camera system on the back of the device, which will be placed vertically, unlike the camera system on the iPhone 7 Plus, which is placed horizontally. The 10th anniversary iPhone is also expected to feature an embedded Touch ID, wireless charging and a True Tone display, which automatically adjusts the color and intensity of the device’s display depending on the environment. The iPhone 8 is expected to be revealed in September alongside the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, but various reports have pointed to a delayed launch date. Kuo suggested the much-anticipated device will face "severe supply shortages" when released. The iPhone 8 is rumored to have a price tag exceeding $1,000.   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

By Alex WebbBloomberg Thu., May 11, 2017 In 2010, before he became chief executive officer, Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook said all the company’s gadgets could fit on a table, arguing such focus resulted in better products. At the time, the company’s website offered 14 Apple products. Now, under Cook’s leadership, the lineup has ballooned to 27 products available in more than 200 different versions. The strategy — a departure from co-founder Steve Jobs’ minimalist approach — is helping Apple grow even as the market for its most-important product, smartphones, stalls. Products such as the Apple Watch and AirPod wireless headphones, combined with more versions of the iPhone and surging sales from a growing variety of software services, drove revenue growth in the most-recent quarter. That offset weaker-than-expected phone unit sales and helped Apple’s market value top $1.1 trillion this week — a first for a U.S. company. “There was a concern with the reliance on one product, but they’ve been able to find ways that aren’t necessarily innovative to continue to sustain growth,” said BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk. The services business supports profit margins “while the company is able to maintain growth from peripheral products like AirPods and Watches.” Apple is in a very different position from when Cook made his tabletop comment at an investor conference seven years ago. That fiscal year, revenue jumped 52 per cent as consumers fell over themselves to buy more iPhones. Now, with most developed-world consumers already using smartphones, and Apple’s annual revenue exceeding $274 billion, growth is harder to achieve. Article Continued Below Apple’s “Other Products” are picking up some of the slack. Sales of gadgets like the Watch, AirPods, Beats headphones and Apple TV jumped 31 per cent to $3.9 billion in the fiscal second quarter. Cook said on May 2, that Watch sales almost doubled year-over-year, and compared this appendage of Apple’s business to a Fortune 500 company. The iPad has endured a precipitous three years, with unit sales at about a third of their peak. The response has been to offer a plethora of different options. There’s the iPad Pro, iPad and iPad Mini 4 in with at least 60 different memory, colour and connectivity options. New versions of the MacBook Pro, unveiled in November, meanwhile helped the average price for the laptop range jump by almost $178 to $1,907. That boosted Mac revenue growth to 14 per cent in the most recent quarter, the fastest pace in more than two years. Apple gets almost two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone, compared with 39 per cent in 2010. However, those sales come from 58 different iterations of the device now, up from five flavours in 2010. And changes in iPhone designs are generating new revenue. While the iPhone 7, introduced in September, represented a modest upgrade to its predecessor, it included two significant changes. First, Apple scrapped the 3.5 millimetre headphone jack, an audio staple since the 1950s. Second, the 13.97-centimetre-screen iPhone 7 Plus incorporated an improved dual-camera system that set it apart from the cheaper 11.93-centimetre-screen model, the first time Apple had changed anything beyond memory and screen size between the two handsets. Scrapping the headphone jack encouraged more customers to buy the compatible AirPod headphones, adding to Apple’s Other Products revenue, BTIG’s Piecyk said. Offering a dual camera meanwhile attracted more customers to the larger 7 Plus, helping Apple increase the average sales price for iPhones. That kept revenue from that line growing slightly. “This is the first year that we have a unique feature on the 7 Plus that is not in the 7 and obviously customers are very interested in that feature,” chief financial officer Luca Maestri said in a May 2 interview. “We are seeing more interest in the market for larger displays.” Clever incremental iterations and additions to the hardware portfolio should keep growth ticking over for the time being, and investors expect the next iPhone will sell well. Longer term, there’s no substitute for entirely new categories, and Apple has yet to deliver a major automotive innovation, radical new TV experience, or augmented reality products. While investors wait, the Services business has been the most consistent bright spot over the past year. Here too, Apple is growing the product palette. In 2010, there was iTunes, the App Store, Podcasts and iBooks. Now there’s Apple Music, iCloud, HealthKit, Apple Maps and a dozen more contributing to a virtuous cycle. Every time Apple sells an iPhone to a new customer, the company secures a potential new services subscriber. Each new sign-up makes it more likely that a user will again opt for an iPhone when the time comes to upgrade. Services revenue rose 18 per cent in the recent quarter, and Cook expects the business will double in size by 2020, from last year’s $32.9 billion. This could help keep profit margins high even with the introduction of the iPhone 8, since services revenue is more profitable. While hopes are high for iPhone 8 sales, the recent jump in Apple shares was driven by “greater belief in the company’s franchise value,” UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a recent note titled “Ecosystem Growth Suggests Antifragility.” Read more about: Apple Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « AI Wars are almost reaching Fever Pitch with new Home Devices and Apple Fans look to WWDC 2017 for Apple's Response | Main | Researchers at UCSF and Cardiogram Confirm Apple Watch Sensors are 97% Accurate in Heart Study » May 11, 2017 Apple Invents Future USB-C, Lightning Connectors to light up in the Dark while Providing Status Information   Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple titled "Illuminated Printed Circuit Boards for Connectors." The new system lights up the connector's end so as to act as a light guide making it easier for users to connect a connector to their devices in a dimly lit or dark environment. The system will also provide users with status information and more importantly, will confirm to the user that a device like a power adapter is an official Apple product or a counterfeit.   Patent Background   Apple notes that when a user is in a dark room at night and wants to insert a connector insert into a connector receptacle on an electronic device, it's not always that easy.   Secondly, it may be difficult to tell a status of an electronic device just by observation. For example, it may be difficult to tell if a battery is charged or if the electronic device is in a silent or sleep mode.   Thirdly, once a connector insert is inserted, it may be difficult to determine if the connector insert has made an electrical connection with the connector receptacle. This may be particularly true when audible prompts have been disabled for the electronic device.   Considering these drawbacks, what is needed are connectors that facilitate the mating of corresponding connectors, particularly when ambient lighting is limited. It may also be desirable that status information for a device housing a connector receptacle may be easily determined.   Next-Gen Connectors   Apple's invention relates to providing illumination at a connector receptacle in order to facilitate the insertion of a connector insert by a user. The illumination may be generated on a tongue in the connector receptacle. The illumination may be directed in a manner to illuminate an opening of the connector receptacle, it may be guided out of a front edge of a tongue in the connector receptacle, or it may be directed in other directions.   In Apple's patent FIG. 5 noted above we're able to see a tongue for a connector may be formed of a material that is at least partially transparent or translucent. For example, tongue 500 may be formed of an epoxy, glass fibers in an epoxy, or by using other materials; FIG. 6 illustrates a side view of the connector tongue shown in FIG. 5. Again, light-emitting diode #510 may be located in recess #501.   In the embodiments above, one or more LEDs may be included in, on, or proximate to a connector tongue. The illumination provided by these one or more LEDs may convey visual information to a user. The visual information may be provided to a user through the particular color of light, by a particular sequence of a light pulses, by a sequence of various colors turning off and on, or some combination thereof.   For example, a particular color or pattern of light may mean that the electronic device housing the connector receptacle may have a battery that is charged above a threshold level, is presently being charged, is charged below the threshold level, or has some other charge or charging status. In this and other embodiments of the present invention, a particular color or pattern of light may mean that the electronic device is in a sleep mode, or a silent mode, or is in some other particular state.   Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention may provide a connector system having a connector insert that has a light pipe to direct light from a connector receptacle tongue to an opening in the connector insert housing. Light from the connector receptacle tongue may then be visible to a user. In this way, charging information, status information, or other information provided by the electronic device on the connector receptacle tongue may be visible to a user when a connector insert is inserted into the connector receptacle. In a specific embodiment of the present invention, circuitry in the electronic device may detect that a connector insert has been mated with the connector receptacle.   The circuitry may drive the one or more LEDs to a color or pattern that indicates the connector insert has been mated to the connector receptacle. This may then be visible to a user to confirm that a connection has been made. Examples of such a connector system are shown in the following figures.   The range of connectors covers USB-C, Lightning, Thunderbolt and others that could be used in conjunction with all of Apple's major devices such as the iPhone, iPad, Macs and more.   Connector Authentication   Last October Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Sues Mobile Star for Selling Counterfeit Power Adapters and Charging Cables through Amazon." Apple explained in their lawsuit that counterfeit products could lead to fires and other risks to the public.   In today's patent revelations we see that Apple isn't relying on a lawsuit to fix the problem, they're going to invent a safety system built into genuine Apple connectors that could determine if a device they're connected to is actually a genuine Apple product as advertised.   Apple notes in their filing that "In these and other embodiments of the present invention, other types of data may be conveyed using this or similar connector systems. For example, authentication, identification, or other types of information or data may be transmitted between an electronic device housing the connector receptacle and a remote circuit.   The remote circuit may be located in a connector insert that is inserted into the connector receptacle, a connector insert at a far end of a cable attached to the connector insert, or in a device connected to the electronic device through such a cable. In one specific example, the connector receptacle may be a connector receptacle for a standardized interface, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface including USB-C. The light path through the connector system may be an optional back-channel data path for devices made by a particular manufacturer or group of manufacturers.   In these and other embodiments of the present invention, a first device may recognize that a remote device may be capable of communicating using this back-channel. The first device may then configure itself, the remote device, or both in order to take advantage of a shared capability. These shared capabilities may include the ability to transfer data at non-standard rates, the ability to reconfigure one or more pins to different functions, the ability to operate at non-standard voltages, or other shared capability.   Apple's patent application was filed back in August 2016. Apple's U.S. provisional application No. 62/208,470 was filed back in August 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

The device’s back camera system is different from what is rumored for the iPhone 8. The 10th anniversary device is expected to come with a vertical dual-camera system. Here’s the leaked photo of the iPhone SE or iPhone 7S: It’s unclear whether the leaked image is legitimate, and it’s unknown whether the Ion-X glass display will be featured on the iPhone SE or iPhone 7S. It could be the iPhone 7S, since Apple already released its latest iPhone SE in March. For the most recent iPhone SE version, Apple doubled the capacity of the previous 4-inch iPhone SE models, which came with 16GB and 64GB. The iPhone SE now has capacities of 32GB and 128GB, priced at $399 and $499, respectively. iPhone 7S Rumors Apple is expected to release three models this year, the iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. A previous report said the rumored iPhone 7S, which is expected to measure 4.7 inches, will continue using an aluminum-alloy chassis supplied by Catcher Technology. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the iPhone 7S could pack as much battery capacity as the iPhone 7 Plus. Meanwhile, Barclays analysts said in March Apple will include True Tone displays on all three models to be released this year. Read: iPhone 8 Rumors, Release Date, Delays: Every Leak, Feature We Know About Apple’s 10th Anniversary Phone Other rumors have suggested Apple will not release the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus this year, and that the company has dropped “S” upgrades. Apple reportedly will focus on launching the iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus. iPhone 8 Leaked Images Meanwhile, new renders of the upcoming iPhone 8 apparently were leaked Tuesday. The images, released by MySmartPrice and @OnLeaks, are believed to have come from a factory working on the much-anticipated device. The photos suggest the iPhone 8 will sport an edge-to-edge OLED display and an all-glass back panel as previous rumors have indicated. The images also show a vertical dual camera system and no home button, which indicates Apple could embed the phone’s Touch ID in the display. Other rumors suggest the iPhone 8 will come with a 3D-sensing front camera and wireless charging.

The addition will give the Store a much-needed boost, increasing its visibility. iTunes is one of the world's most popular Windows desktop apps. Microsoft has been proactively working to improve the quality and volume of apps available in the Windows Store over the past few months. The company's Desktop Bridge technology has led to many more developers releasing their existing apps for the store, enabling current "classic" Windows apps to be ported to the sandbox of the Universal Windows Platform. During the Day 1 keynote of its BUILD developers conference in Seattle yesterday, Microsoft said that there are now over 1,000 converted desktop apps in the store. Today, it revealed Apple is working on bringing iTunes to the store, officially converting its desktop app and giving it a store listing. The surprise announcement was entirely unexpected. Apple is known for its reluctance to launch its products on third-party platforms. Aside from the Windows version of iTunes and the Apple Music Android app, the company's presence outside of its own ecosystem is virtually non-existent. Apple placing its trust in the developing walled garden of the Windows Store is a significant win for Microsoft. With scepticism from users still high, the debut of big-name apps will help convince users to abandon their installers and head to the store instead. READ MORE: Microsoft's new UI offers an array of interesting options for Windows 10 Apple's motivations in bringing iTunes to the store haven't been confirmed but the decision is likely to be related to the recent launch of Windows 10 S. This education-focused edition of Windows only runs Store apps. It's possible Apple is converting iTunes so it can continue to attract student users who may now be forced to source their downloads from the Windows Store. iTunes won't be able to singlehandedly change the fortunes of the Windows Store but it could go some way to encouraging users to give it a try. Its one-click installation procedure and sandboxed apps offer a simpler way to install apps while lowering the risk of infection. The Store is still let down by its poor design and downloading issues though, problems which frequently turn people away from the Store. Microsoft is already working on the latter issue and improvements have been delivered in the recent Windows 10 Creators Update. Apps now differentially update so only the parts that have changed are downloaded. The Store's progress bars now actually work too, an advantage for an app built solely to encourage downloads. The former weakness will be addressed by Microsoft's new Fluent Design Language, one of the headline features of the upcoming Windows 10 Fall Update set to be launched later this year. Microsoft is working on an all-encompassing upgrade of the Windows 10 look and feel that should finally give the Store app a lick of paint. It's going to take a lot of work before true desktop apps are the reserve of power users but frontend improvements and the support of Apple will put Microsoft in a much better place to execute its future plans.

About Us Subscriptions You are at:Home»News Pages»E-Headlines»Empathy: Greatest Creator of Energy Empathy: Greatest Creator of Energy 0 By Ann Golden Egle MCC on May 11, 2017 E-Headlines Why is Angela Ahrendts, Apple Retail SVP, one of the highest paid and most sought after executives in the country? Holding the top female executive position at Apple, Ahrendts admits to not being a techie in any sense of the word. Still Apple CEO Tim Cook, worked diligently to steel her away from Burberry? Why? Ahrendts raised Burberry’s stock by a remarkable 300% during her final year as CEO. Yet it was not her retail prowess, but Ahrendts’ leadership skills that Cook was after. Specifically her ability to motivate people. In a recent interview with CBS Morning Show, Ahrendts says this about leadership: “Don’t over think it. Connect with people. Do what you say you’ll do. Be empathetic. Empathy is the greatest creator of energy.” When a person feels seen and heard by you they feel safe with you. Defensiveness and insecurity dissolve. Open discussions lead to creatively dreaming together. Great things result. Some leaders are naturally empathetic. They are rarely too busy to listen when they sense something is important. They remember every step of the ladder they took to reach where they are today and understand the value of those who currently occupy those positions. Other leaders I’ve worked with think ‘empathy’ is some emotional intelligence nonsense. They don’t see the need nor do they have time to develop this skill. Think empathy isn’t a vital leadership skill? Experts disagree. -Bestselling author Simon Sinek’s work with the Marine Corps led to his book Leaders Eat Last: Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don’t. Specifically he discusses understanding and prioritizing the well being of your people. Sinek’s TED Talk has been viewed 30 million times. -Success Magazine published: “Why the Empathetic Leader is the Best Leader” on March 15, 2017 citing the biology of feeling understood and recognized at work. -The Harvard Business Review will publish Empathy (HBR Emotional Intelligence Series) on May 9. Containing segments as: “Why Compassion Is a Better Managerial Tactic Than Toughness”, this book provides research showing how our emotions impact our work motivation, productivity and lives. Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of another, is vital leadership skill. If you wonder where you rank on the empathetic leader scale, here are some traits of a highly empathetic leader. Ask yourself how you measure up. Empathetic Leaders: -Are good listeners. -Are nonjudgmental. -Ask more questions than provide advice. -Understand that we all have different emotions in this moment around the same situation. -Take in the other entire person, not just their professional role. -Pay attention to what’s not being said during important conversations. -Know without words that an employee is struggling. -See when praise is not really heard out of fear or insecurity. Tim Cook, Angela Ahrendts, Simon Sinek, HBR, Success Magazine are a small number of top national leaders who see the need for increased empathy in business today. Do you? I challenge you to select one of my listed empathetic leadership skills and begin to strengthen that skill today.

Even though there have been some rumors to the contrary, many are still expecting Apple to unveil the iPhone 8 in September this year. Rumors about the new iPhone’s features don’t show any signs of stopping, we’re seeing some repeat every couple of weeks. The latest concerns iPhone 8’s facial recognition feature. Word on the street is that LG Innotek is going to be supplying facial recognition cameras for Apple’s next-generation iPhone. LG Innotek is said to be supplying facial recognition cameras for the iPhone 8, it’s manufacturing those camera modules at a new facility dedicated to Apple products. The facility is apparently worth $239 million and Apple’s order alone is believed to be worth $177 million. This isn’t the first time that Apple will be sourcing components from LG Innotek. The company already sources rear dual camera modules for the iPhone 7 Plus from LG Innotek. The rumor also mentions that the facial recognition technology of the iPhone 8 is going to rely on 3D to offer better accuracy than what you can get with the Galaxy S8. The next-generation iPhone is expected to be a big step up from its predecessor. It may have a 5.8 inch edge-to-edge OLED display and may even ditch the home button for a virtual soft button much like the one you get on the Galaxy S8. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

Application no. 20170132019 is entitled “Intelligent automated assistant in a messaging environment,” and it details a way of deeply integrating Siri into Messages. Such combination would enable users to do two things in one interface: communicate and command Siri via text and engage in conversations with friends. “In one example process, a graphical user interface (GUI) having a plurality of previous messages between a user of the electronic device and the digital assistant can be displayed on a display. The plurality of previous messages can be presented in a conversational view,” wrote inventors Petr Karashchuk, Tomas A. Vega Galvez and Thomas R. Gruber. The authors explained that this new invention would basically combine the graphical user interface for text messaging with the ability to converse with Siri. In addition, the voice assistant can also act as a third party in group chats. AppleInsider noted that this proposed system seems to be more advanced than the existing implementations of Siri. The virtual assistant mainly relies on speech recognition to communicate and get commands from users. Furthermore, this would expand Siri’s functionality since Messages supports a variety of communication tools such as text, audio, image and video. This would surely make it easier for users to prompt Siri to do things by just encoding things into the Messages graphical user interface.  It’s clear why Apple is going toward the direction of a text-based UI for its Siri smart assistant. While speech detection does have a high degree of accuracy, it is not free from errors. It is not uncommon for Siri to make mistakes from time to time, especially when there’s noise in the background. Creating this text-based UI would provide users a means to clarify misunderstood queries and commands. This is also beneficial to instances when the user is in a location that demands silence, like a library or a movie theater perhaps.  The proposed system also appears to be very promising as it would allow users to use images, audio and videos when asking for Siri’s assistance. For instance, a user may upload images and ask questions like “Where is this?” “What insect is this?” and “Which company uses this logo” to Siri. The smart assistant would then scan and identify the image before responding to the user. The same thing can be done with audio and videos, as these non-text media can make the conversation with the virtual help flow smoothly. While Apple’s inventors are already seeing the potential of this advancement in Siri’s functionality, it is still not clear if the company is considering the implementation of this system this year. Interestingly, back in March, there was a sketchy rumor from an Israeli site claiming that the iOS 11 operating system will come with changes to Messages, such that the app would have some form of Siri integration.

While Microsoft didn’t show any screenshots of what this experience might look like, Apple may be required to tweak iTunes’ look and feel to match Microsoft’s new Fluent Design system. The development is especially important in light of Windows 10 S, a slimmed down version of Windows 10 for inexpensive Chromebook-like computers aimed at education, because Windows 10 S customers can only install officially sanctioned apps from Windows Store. As a result of the restrictions, many popular apps such as Apple iTunes, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Spotify are currently unavailable on Windows 10 S systems. According to The Verge, iTunes is one of the apps Windows users search for most often on the store. Unless iTunes is available on Windows Store, people in the market for a Surface Laptop, for example, won’t be a be able to synchronize their iOS devices with their Windows 10 S-powered PC unless they upgrade to Windows 10 Pro to remove all restrictions. Windows 10 is now on half a billion devices and Office 365 recently passed its hundred-millionth monthly user, Microsoft revealed at the Build conference.

Alvin R. Cabral Filed on May 11, 2017 | Last updated on May 11, 2017 at 08.19 pm Share More > Vote Apple is leading the way; the company now owns a 15.9 per cent share of the global wearables market Have you wanted to buy one of these wearables but thought they're a bit much - not to mention pointless - for the price? You're not alone. Companies are in two minds about their shelf life. Tick tock. tick tock.... It was a difficult for me to get me started on this piece. But it just took a good, long stare at my wrist to set the gears in motion. I've been using a smartwatch for years now. How do I find it? Well, my answer has gone from 'wow' when I first used it to a 'meh' today. But make no mistake: smartwatches are useful; I don't have to dig into my pocket to get my phone out to check who's calling or texting. A few quarters, though, have fated the smartwatch to a premature, abrupt end. And just when some have probably written them off and begun composing their eulogies, industry reports differ. (Strategy Analytics' May 4 report said global smartwatch shipments leapt 48 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2016, the second straight three-month period it has witnessed growth). And Apple is leading the way; the company now owns a 15.9 per cent share of the global wearables market, thanks to 3.5 million units sold during the January to March period, which is a 59 per cent leap from a year ago following an even bigger 63 per cent rise in the previous three-month period. Apple has never revealed watch sales statistics. Tim Cook and Co, however, were finally able to dethrone Fitbit as the world's dominant force in wearables; Fitbit slid to third place (13.2 per cent), while the runner-up was - surprise! - China's Xiaomi (15.5 per cent). Anyway, here's the more important thing: those two consecutive quarters of growth followed two straight ones of declines (a 51.6 per cent drop in the third quarter of 2016 alone, according to the IDC), which was probably the reason why some were waiting for smartwatches to kick the bucket. (That didn't sit well with Cook; the Apple boss disputed reports in the third quarter last year that watch sales were sliding; "sales growth is off the charts," he said then, but didn't provide any figures to back this up.) There are reasons, however, for those declines: the IDC says companies are realigning their strategy, going as far as calling it "growing pains" for the relatively nascent sector. Add to the fact that Apple didn't launch its Series 2 line until the end of September, Google holding back on Android Wear 2.0 and Samsung's Gear 3 not having been launched yet at that time - then it could be just a mere blip. Statista, meanwhile, has an even bigger idea to pitch: data compiled by the statistics portal show that smartwatch sales are forecast to hit 75 million this year - almost double 2016s 38 million - and again almost double to 141 million in 2018. Take some time to digest that and ask yourself (again) the question being whispered around: are smartwatches on their way to the digital afterlife? Personally, I don't think so. It's either because users have to yet fully grasp what smartwatches can do for them, or manufacturers haven't nailed it - forcing some to delay their offerings or give up on it altogether. "The market for wearables has proved to be insanely volatile," Business Insider's Steve Kovach writes, "claiming victims much faster than we saw with the companies that went kaput following the introduction of the iPhone." Take Shakil Barkat, global product development head for Lenovo's Moto brand. "Wearables do not have broad enough appeal for us to continue to build on it year after year." His quote came as Lenovo declared it wouldn't be touching wearables. And the reason was self-explanatory: like some others, they weren't believers in wearables, for now, at least. We haven't even considered pricing; smartwatches - the best ones, at least - cost a fortune. It's not yet a mass product, but companies are trying to make it affordable for everyone (see: Xiaomi). But take a look around: most people are still wearing traditional watches. Why? Because maybe people just love the simplicity of things. Wrist watches are beautiful - and even more beautiful performing the one task they're made for. Which is exactly watch manufacturer Luco Charles' point, putting it boldly: "When is a watch not a watch? When it's a smartwatch." Which takes us back to the price: a luxury wristwatch is a status symbol. If you had (lots of) cash to spare, would you rather buy a Rolex or that Dh62,450 Apple Watch Edition, which looks so similar to its peers? And let's face it: one per cent of the global population holds almost half of Planet Earth's wealth; you can't blame a good number of the 99 per cent who'd grab a colourful and cool-looking Dh10 watch, right? Some feel smartwatches are too complicated. Come to think of it, traditional timepieces are smart in their own way. And if you want to add some zest, why not go for a Breitling Emergency (which broadcasts a distress signal when you're lost) or the rock-solid Casio G-Shock? Variety's senior Silicon Valley correspondent, Janko Roettgers, goes further in explaining the obvious: "Many of the promises offered by smartwatches are better-solved by other devices." "Want to quickly check your email? Just take out your phone. Need to set a reminder, add something to your shopping list or even quickly look up something? Amazon Echo or Google Home to the rescue." So, there. I see a comparison in what's happening between traditional watches and smartwatches with iTunes and the music industry when Apple's digital music service was first launched; record labels finally realised they had to accept it - begrudgingly - and it became somewhat of a partnership. Some traditional watchmakers are already making forays into the smartwatch arena, trying to strike a win-win situation for everyone. For now, we're in a wait-and-watch mode (pun intended) to see where these high-tech timepieces are headed. As I've mentioned earlier, they're still at the beginning, and with innovation evolving by the second, a lot of new things can bolster smartwatches' case for mass acceptance. We may have heard some sounding death knells for the smartwatch, but the Digital Grim Reaper can wait; it may be premature to hammer the final nails in the coffin.

Thursday, May 11, 2017 by: Earl Garcia Tags: Apple, electronics, mobile phones, rare minerals (Natural News) Apple plans to stop mining rare minerals, metals, and materials in manufacturing its iPhones, MacBooks and all of its other products. The tech giant also vows to make use of 100 percent recycled materials during  production to combat the effects of the depleting mineral resources. However, the company was quick to admit that it has yet to discover how to carry out the initiative. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it. So we’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important, because as a sector we believe it’s where technology should be going,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple SVP of Environmental Policy. Apple’s announcement is in line with its recent progress report, highlighting its recent achievements in environmental protection. However the company notes that only a small portion of its devices use recycled materials. Recent research reveal that rare minerals — such as tantalum, zinc, copper, tungsten and cobalt — used in electronics production are already geared towards complete depletion. One step that the company plans to undertake is to gather parts from devices returned by customers and turn them into high-quality recycled materials. The company is encouraging their customers to recycle their smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices. According to the company, the biggest challenge so far is to recover aluminum from discarded, recycled products without compromising its quality. Depleting resources leave companies no choice but to recycle Apple’s decision to use 100 percent recycled materials may come as no surprise as the earth’s reserves of rare minerals have greatly diminished. In fact, a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Nature cautioned that minerals used in the production of electronic devices such as laptops, mobile phones, and wiring are rapidly decreasing. As part of the review, a team of international experts from academic, government, and industrial institutions across five continents analyzed data and demand estimates on global mineral supply sustainability in the coming years. The research team found that mining exploration failed to keep up with future demand. The experts also noted that recycling these resources will not help in meeting these demands. In addition, the research team found that shifting to a low-carbon society will require large amounts of metals and minerals to develop clean technologies. The experts cautioned that the society currently does not have the means to meet the additional need for raw materials. The findings underscore the need for international coordination to put more focus on exploration efforts, identify various minerals located in different areas, and determine bilateral agreements that various countries may require, the researchers said. The U.S. Geological Survey has also stressed on the changing landscape of mineral use worldwide, pointing out that the use of these resources increased dramatically over the years. “Many mineral commodities have changed in importance over time. Conversely, the use of most metals has skyrocketed during the industrial age, with iron, copper and aluminium being mainstays of much of the world’s economy and infrastructure. Rare earth elements are much more important than they were 30 years ago and are indispensible [sic] in technologies such as smartphones, wind turbines and hybrid cars. Other changes have only recently started developing…World reserves of almost all commodities are greater now than they were 50 or 100 years ago even though large amounts have been produced. This is because the time value of money leads most companies to only drill out 20 or 30 years’ worth of reserves even though much larger resources might be available. Some mines have had 20 years’ worth of ‘reserves’ for more than a century,” said USGS official Dr Lawrence Meinert.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iTunes is coming to the Windows Store (and Windows 10 S is to blame) Chris Davies - May 11, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Microsoft and Apple may not be the most obvious bedfellows, but that isn’t stopping Apple from bringing iTunes to the Windows Store. While the past couple of years has seen Microsoft launch an increasing number of apps on macOS and iOS, Apple is pushing back a little. Announced at BUILD 2017 today, the Cupertino firm’s media and iOS management software will be coming to Microsoft’s download store. From there, you’ll be able to access all the usual iOS device synchronization – like backing up your iPhone or iPad – as well as use Apple Music. Now, iTunes doesn’t have the best of reputations right now, and the software has certainly become more complex since it launched as a music app. All the same, if you want to manage your iPhone from your computer, you’re pretty much stuck with it. Of course, you could always download iTunes for Windows directly from Apple, so you may be wondering why it matters if the app is released through the Windows Store. The answer is Windows 10 S, the new version of the OS that Microsoft announced – along with the Surface Laptop – just a few weeks ago. Although it’ll run full apps, Windows 10 S will only allow people to install them from the Windows Store. That limitation, Microsoft says, has been applied because of safety concerns. After all, the company can check to make sure Windows Store apps aren’t infected by malware or poorly coded. It’s actually something we’ve seen Apple do already with its Mac App Store, though where macOS allows users to install non-Mac App Store apps as long as they agree that they might not be as safe, Microsoft will charge an upgrade fee to convert a Windows 10 S computer to Windows 10 Pro. How many will do that remains to be seen, and it looks like Apple isn’t willing to count on enough coughing up the cash to stay out of the Windows Store. Like Spotify and others, it’s adding its app to the download store for easier installation and updates. More are following suit, too. Microsoft also announced today that Autodesk SketchBook will be joining the Windows Store later this year, as a Universal App, while later this month SAP Digital Boardroom will be added for business users.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Moe Slah New report details one of the iPhone 8’s most hotly anticipated features Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 11th, 2017 at 12:15 PM Share Tweet With good reason, the most anticipated feature the iPhone 8 will bring to the table is a radical new redesign featuring an edge to edge OLED display. But with the iPhone 8 display hogging the headlines, it’s easy to forget that Apple’s next-gen iPhone will bring a lot of compelling features to the table, including advanced 3D sensors capable of best-in-class facial recognition. Don't Miss: Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting Echoing previous reports, The Korea Herald reports that LG Innotek has been tapped to supply the iPhone 8’s 3D camera sensors. The report said the company’s new facility investment worth 269.7 billion won (US$238.50 million) that was announced on April 27 will be dedicated to Apple’s orders. The initial deal size is estimated at about 200 billion won. According to the report, Apple’s implementation of 3D cameras will have a number of varied use-cases, including gaming and facial recognition. And while the iPhone 8 won’t be the first smartphone to feature facial recognition, there’s reason to believe that Apple’s implementation will be the best we’ve seen to date. Facial recognition on Samsung’s S8, for example, only uses “2D technology” and can readily be fooled. Remember, Apple earlier this year acquired an Israeli company called Realface, an innovative startup with really advanced and impressive facial recognition software. In fact, Realface’s technology is so advanced that it reportedly secure enough to be used for biometric authentication, an important tidbit given how easy it’s been to fool facial recognition systems on other handsets. While it’s unclear how much of Realface’s technology will end up on the iPhone 8, the company previously boasted that its advanced software makes use of incredibly reliable deep learning methods capable of delivering unrivaled performance almost instantly. Specifically, Realface boasts that it’s software is able to recognize faces with a 99.67% success rate, which believe it or not, is actually higher than the 97.5% success rate humans are capable of. All in all, the iPhone 8 is shaping up to be the biggest leap forward in iPhone technology we’ve seen in years, and perhaps ever. With an edgeless OLED display and advanced facial recognition, not to mention improved battery life and support for augmented reality, it stands to reason that the iPhone 8 will anchor the most sweeping iPhone refresh Apple has seen to date. And for those curious, below is a demo of Realface’s technology in action.

A report in Korea Economic Daily noted that LG has built a new 269.7-billion won ($238.5 million) facility that will be dedicated to fulfilling Apple’s orders, with the initial order estimate to be about 200 billion won ($177 million). LG already supplies Apple with the rear-facing dual camera module used in the iPhone 7 Plus, and while it’s unclear at this point whether this will continue to be the case with the ‘iPhone 8,’ this deal indicates that LG will at least be providing the front-facing module, which will reportedly be smaller than the current one.

A new report has claimed that the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has begun production of Apple’s A11 processor that is set to power the OLED iPhone 8. TSMC had initially aimed to start production of the chip in April, but due to ‘issues involving stacking components’ it had been delayed –  sources have noted that the issues have since been resolved. Scroll down for video  A new report has claimed that the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has begun production of Apple’s A11 processor that is set to power the OLED iPhone 8 (artist impression)  IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging  - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area'  - A new 'pure white' model  - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition -Premium model could cost $1,000 The latest development regarding the iPhone 8 was published by Digitimes, a newspaper for semiconductor, electronics, computer and communications industries in Taiwan and the Greater China region, which has been sharing numerous reports with ‘insider information’ over the past few months. And the information in the latest reports has suggested that iOS users could purchase the device as soon as October or shortly after the release of the iPhone 7s models, which are also said to be equipped with the A11 processors.  A separate report from Digitimes earlier this month, which was shared by the Economic Daily News, also suggested that Apple would stick to its precious timeline. Sources had said that the firm’s suppliers 'including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), SLP (substrate-like PCB) makers Zhen Ding Technology and Kinsus Interconnect Technology, and battery supplier Simplo Technology, are ready to ramp up related iPhone parts 'starting June – similar to the new report published by the paper.  TSMC would begin fabricating the wafer starts needed for the production of A11 processes on June 10 and deliver the chips in volume quantity in the second half of July, the report indicated. It was also discovered that 'iPhone assemblers Foxconn Electronics, Winstron and Pegatron were accelerating the recruitment and training of new workers in China in preparation of mass production of the new iPhone,' said the report.

Share this article Share Although the iPhone 8 may be released on time, KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo noted on Wednesday that there is a 'rising probability' of the 'worst scenario' for production and shipments of the iPhone 8.  Kuo has touched on delays in the past, but the latest research note shared with 9to5Mac highlights the firm's production troubles due to 'major hardware upgrades' could result in a shortage of devices hitting the market at launch. TSMC had initially aimed to start production of the chip in April, but due to ‘issues involving stacking components’ it had been delayed – sources have noted that the issues has since been resolved (pictured is an artist impression of the iPhone 8)  TIMELINE: TEN YEARS OF IPHONES  2007:  After being unveiled in January, the first iPhone goes on sale amid passionate Apple fan reaction and queues outside retail stores. 2008: On July 11 2008 the second generation iPhone 3G launches, including in a white color option for the first time.  2009: The iPhone 3GS goes on sale in June, and sales for the year reach more than 25 million. 2010: The introduction of the iPhone 4 includes the first major redesign of the iPhone. The front and back casing are both made of glass for the first time, with a steel trim and edges. 2011: The iPhone 4s is introduced, including voice assistant Siri for the first time. 2012: The iPhone 5 ushers in another redesign, this time increasing the screen size to four inches for the first time. 2013:  Another 's' model, this time the iPhone 5s, is launched. The first iPhone to include a fingerprint scanner integrated into the home button, known as Touch ID. 2014: In September the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are unveiled, offering the iPhone in two sizes for the first time – both of which have increased screen sizes on previous generations at 4.7 and 5.5 inches respectively. 2015: In September the 6s and 6s Plus are released, complete with a new pressure sensitive screen. 2016: In September the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are announced, with the Plus housing a dual rear camera for the first time that is designed to capture images to rival that of a digital camera. He has said that there is a 'rising probability of worst-case scenario for iPhone shipments' and has lowered what he had predicted in shipments, 100 million to 110 million units, down to 80 million to 90 million units. We are seeing more evidence that the worst-case scenario forecasted in our April 19 report could materialize, where new iPhone shipments in 2H17F are revised down to 80-90mn units from 100-110mn units (vs. consensus of 100-120mn units),' reads the research note.

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe.

Production was supposed to start in April, but was delayed while production issues were worked out. TSMC starts A11 chip production for iPhone 8 Insider sources speaking with Digitimes said TSMC resolved its production issues and is on track with the A11 chip. The company is Apple’s only supplier for the chip, so it was critical the manufacturing hangups were solved. The iPhone 8 hasn’t been officially announced yet, but there have been plenty of leaks to help build an image of what to expect. In addition to the new A11 processor, the iPhone 8 will sport an OLED screen that runs nearly edge-to-edge, replaces the physical Home button with a virtual version and Touch ID embedded in the display glass. The front and back will be glass that curves into the phone body, plus it’ll have a 3D sensing front-facing camera and dual rear-facing cameras, and wireless charging support. The iPhone 8 will be about the same size as the iPhone 7, but with a much bigger display because there’s more surface space without the physical Home button. Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 8 in September, along with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, at its usual fall launch media event.The 7s and 7s Plus will likely be available a few days after the event, and the iPhone 8 is said to be coming a few weeks after that. The most recent design leak comes from Steve Hemmerstoffer who has a well established reputation for accurate device renderings ahead of product announcements. Hemmerstoffer claims the images he created are based on Apple’s CAD files for the device, and based on his track record they are likely what we’ll see this fall.

In a surprise announcement at the Build developer event today, Microsoft revealed it has been working with Apple to get iTunes listed in the Windows Store. It might not sound like an important addition, but iTunes is one of the most searched for apps that’s currently missing in the Windows Store. Microsoft will also need to attract apps like Adobe’s range of creative apps and Google’s Chrome browser. There are signs that Chrome may never appear on the Windows Store as Google will need to rework its browser to meet Microsoft’s strict app requirements. Windows Store apps that browse the web need to use Microsoft’s Edge engine, and the current Chrome desktop app uses Google’s Blink rendering engine. Google could decide to create a new version of Chrome specifically for the Windows Store as it has done before with iOS, but it’s unlikely. Either way, iTunes is a big addition for regular consumers and a slight boost to Microsoft’s Windows Store efforts. It will still take a lot more than iTunes arriving in the Store to determine the success of its desktop apps in the store, though.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Mass production for Apple's A11 chip begins; will iPhone 8 still be delayed? Mass production of the A11 chip doesn't necessarily confirm iPhone 8's timely production. But, can Apple really afford a delayed release of the new iPhone? Kukil Bora   May 11, 2017 22:01 IST An iPhone is seen on display at a kiosk at an Apple reseller store in Mumbai, India, January 12, 2017. Picture taken January 12, 2017.REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, also known as TSMC, has begun production of the new Apple A11 chip, which will power the next-generation iPhone 8 later this year, a new report said Thursday. TSMC has started producing the new processor after it successfully resolved issues with stacking components that had affected production earlier, DigiTimes reported. According to some previous reports, TSMC wanted to begin A11 chip production in April itself, but it was delayed due to issues with yields. Here's what the DigiTimes report said, based on exclusive information from its sources: TSMC has begun 10nm chip production for Apple's next-generation iPhone 8 series, the sources said. Production was once affected by issues involving stacking components in the backend integrated fan-out packaging process, but they have already been solved, the sources said. Apple is expected to release three new iPhones in 2017, including the premium iPhone 8 and two upgraded versions of the iPhone 7. Rumour has it that variants of the new A11 chip will power each one of this trio as well as the upcoming iPad editions for of this year, including a new 12.9 inch iPad Pro and a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. The existing 64-bit A10 series chip is manufactured using 16nm process. Therefore, assuming that the new A11 chip, based on the 10nm process, will offer significant performance enhancements makes perfect sense. iPhone 8 featuring an A11 chip is not something unexpected, but it's the chip entering production phase that carries more significance as it suggests that Apple's next flagship smartphone may not be delayed for too long as indicated by some previous reports. KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also claimed that full-scale production of the iPhone 8 could be delayed till October or November due to serious yield issues related to manufacturing issues with Samsung's OLED panels and difficulties in adding a Touch ID sensor to the phone's display. As far as the design goes, the iPhone 8 is expected to come with an edge-to-edge display in an attempt to take on the Samsung Galaxy S8. The device could also feature a dual-camera setup with the cameras placed horizontally.

Peter Bright - May 11, 2017 3:45 pm UTC Enlarge / The Retina 5K iMac just got a bit cheaper. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 42 Share this story SEATTLE—With the Xamarin tooling built in to Visual Studio, iOS and Android developers can already use a PC for a big part of their dev process by using the Visual Studio IDE for writing their code. For iOS development, however, there has always been an extra complication: the actual software building and deployment had to take place on a Mac. Visual Studio remotely controls the Apple machine to do this work, so although developers can stay inside the Visual Studio environment they know and love, they still need a Mac on their local network. Xamarin Live Player, announced today, takes the Mac out of the develop/deploy/debug cycle. With Live Player, iOS apps can be deployed directly onto an iPhone or other iDevice from a PC running Visual Studio, where the code can then be tested and debugged. This means that the Mac is no longer needed for that core development cycle. The final build and submission to the App Store will still require a Mac, so you can't go without an Apple system entirely, but what this means is that if you want to develop, as many of us do, on a laptop and aren't on the same network as your Mac, you can. Live Player also supports Android, though this is obviously less of a big deal since direct development and deployment from a PC is already standard for Android. Microsoft believes its Live Player system is entirely compatible with Apple's rules and regulations for App Store apps. Behind the scenes, the Live Player includes an interpreter for .NET code. This means that running an app through Live Player is slower than it would be if natively built on a Mac, but that's not such a big deal for many aspects of user interface development. For those of us who are Mac users anyway, yesterday saw the release of Visual Studio for Mac. Visual Studio for Mac is a different codebase from Visual Studio on Windows, but the two products share things like the compiler and build infrastructure, enabling projects to be shared and co-developed between Mac and PC with no conversion or other hurdles to contend with. Microsoft is also working to better align the various versions of .NET and the XAML user interface development language across its platforms. Later this year, the UWP version of .NET will be updated to support .NET Standard 2.0. Microsoft is also unifying the XAML used for cross-platform Xamarin Forms with that used for UWP. The new XAML, XAML Standard, will allow XAML to be shared (and copy/pasted, the best kind of code reuse) between UWP and Xamarin Forms apps. Finally, Microsoft is continuing to embrace Linux developers and toolchains on Windows. The current Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) comes out of the box with support for Ubuntu; later this year, Microsoft is adding official support for a SUSE userland and a Fedora userland. It'll even be possible to install all three side by side, giving your Windows machine three different Linux personalities simultaneously. The installation of WSL is also simpler, with the three Linux environments all being installed from the Windows Store. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

The Surface Laptop comes with a high pixel density display that’s also touch compatible, runs the latest 7th generation Intel Core i5 and i7 chips, and is thinner and lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Air. But here are a few things you need to know before you click that order button on Microsoft’s website. 1. There Is No USB-C Port The Surface Laptop has a typically-shaped USB 3.0 port found on most computers today, meaning your existing peripherals will work without an adapter. But the world is moving to USB Type-C What Is USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? Ah, the USB plug. It is as ubiquitous now as it is notorious for never being able to be plugged in right the first time. Read More  (USB-C, for short) as we speak, with companies like Apple putting only USB-C ports on its new computers like the 2016 MacBook Pro 13-Inch MacBook Pro With Retina Display Giveaway 13-Inch MacBook Pro With Retina Display Giveaway That's right, a beautiful, Retina display-toting 13-inch MacBook Pro could be yours for the low cost of $0. Read More . Other companies aren’t as aggressive with USB-C yet, but have started including at least one in their high-end models. The Razer Blade Stealth for example, has two USB 3.0 ports and one USB-C port with Thunderbolt 3 support, which lets you connect peripherals like an external graphics card to play high-end games. Android phones are also adopting USB-C aggressively, so you can charge your phone with your computer’s power adapter. The problem here is that people don’t upgrade their computers as often as they upgrade their smartphones. Since you’re spending a $1,000 or more on the Surface Laptop, we assume you’ll want to use it for the next three to five years. And looking at USB-C’s rate of adoption, it might just start getting obsolete sooner than later. 2. You Can Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for Free Like we mentioned earlier, it was odd to see a computer as powerful as the Surface Laptop come pre-installed with Windows 10 S Windows 10 S: Everything You Need to Know Windows 10 S: Everything You Need to Know Windows 10 S is a new stripped-down version of Windows 10 designed for schools. Let's discuss the good and the bad, and decide if you should buy one of the new machines. Read More , an education-focused restricted variant of Windows 10 that can only run apps from Windows Store. Because it won’t run any executable files, Microsoft can optimize the performance and reliability of the OS better, as there won’t be any random apps going rogue in the background. This OS is designed to run on computers that cost as low as $189. There are some sneaky moves Microsoft made with Windows 10 S too, like how you can’t set another browser as your default web browser (it’s set to Microsoft Edge). What’s worse, you can’t even set the default search provider (Bing) in the Edge browser. Also, with Windows 10 S you’re at your favorite app developers’ mercy, as it’s up to them to make a version available in the Windows Store. For example, you can’t use Chrome in Windows 10 S until Google decides to list it on Microsoft’s app store. Fortunately, until 31st December 2017, you can buy a Surface Laptop and pretend it never came with Windows 10 S. This is because you’re are eligible for a free upgrade to the standard, no-holds-barred Windows 10 Pro (after December, the upgrade may cost $49). I don’t see any reason why any Surface Laptop owner won’t want to upgrade and free herself from these restrictions. 3. The 14.5-Hour Battery Life Is “Quoted” One of the biggest claims Microsoft made during the launch presentation of the Surface Laptop’s battery life of “14.5 hours of video playback”. Now that sounds impressive for a computer that’s thinner and lighter than the MacBook Air, has a higher-resolution screen, and yet tops the Air’s rated 12-hour runtime. But there are a couple of factors to consider. First, if you read the fine print at the bottom of the official website, Microsoft does not fully define the testing conditions of that video playback test. For example, how high was the brightness? What was the quality of video playback? We know that Apple claims a 12-hour battery life playing a 1080p HD video at 75 percent screen brightness at the bottom of their page. Next, there’s no comparable claim of how long the Surface Laptop’s battery will last when browsing the web. Apple suggests the same 12-hour battery life when browsing the web over Wi-Fi. I’m not saying that the Surface Laptop’s battery life will be bad, but there’s a good chance it won’t run as long in typical scenarios, where you’re doing more than just watching videos. For example, Microsoft’s updated Surface Book last year claimed a whopping 16 hours of runtime, but if you were to go by the reviews, it doesn’t last as long in the real world. 4. The Base Model Has 4 GB of RAM The Surface Laptop interestingly competes with both the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro 13 non-Touch Bar model (which is said to be the spiritual successor to the MacBook Air). The entry-level $999 SKU of the Surface Laptop is priced the same as the entry-level 13-inch Air, but comes with just 4 GB of RAM. The MacBook Air’s base model comparatively comes with 8 GB RAM. Now, 4 GB of RAM might be fine if you don’t use more than a few apps and tabs in your web browser, but it certainly less for anything more, and especially so when you’re paying $1,000 for it. Also, 4 GB RAM could be enough if you’re planning on using it with Windows 10 S, which is designed to “suspend or even terminate applications to reduce the usage of memory, processor, and battery resources”, as suggested by Ars Technica. But in our experience How Much RAM Do You Really Need? How Much RAM Do You Really Need? RAM is like short term memory. The more you multitask, the more you need. Find out how much your computer has, how to get the most out of it, or how to get more. Read More , we’ve seen that today’s web apps (like Facebook, Gmail, Outlook.com, Google Docs or MS Office Online) are complex and 4 GB RAM sometimes can prove insufficient. To upgrade to the model with 8 GB, the price also goes up to $1,299 (you also get 256 GB of SSD in place of the 128 GB drive). But the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is often discounted to as low as $1,249 on Best Buy. Sure, the Surface Laptop has a touch screen and more color options, but the Pro has a sharper screen, Intel Iris graphics, USB-C ports, a huge glass trackpad, and better syncing with other Apple devices that you may own. This will make the choice harder for some. 5. You’ll Have to Choose Between Color or Specs This is the weirdest decision you’ll have to make when buying the Surface Laptop. You’ve probably already seen that the computer is available in four different colors: Platinum, Graphite Gold, Burgundy, and Cobalt Blue. Want to stick to the entry-level $999 model? You can only get it in Platinum. What’s weirder, say you want to soup it up with the Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM or 512 GB of SSD storage? Again you can only get all of those options in Platinum. Yup, you can’t get those other fancy color options even if you’re willing to drop $2,199 on one. The only configuration where you can choose from any of the four colors from is the 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD option. I can imagine this might be the model that most people will choose, so from a supply-chain point of view, it makes sense for Microsoft to make it available in all colors. It also works to their advantage since people drawn by that deep red or blue color will have to pony up $300 extra over the base model. In conclusion, I don’t mean to dissuade you from purchasing the Surface Laptop if you’re absolutely in love with it. In fact, I’m very happy that Microsoft seems to have hit it on the nail with a computer that could potentially break Apple’s monopoly in the $1,000+ segment. But remember, you’re going to be using this machine for the next couple of years at least, so we hope you’ve made peace with the above. Anyone else have grave misgivings about the Surface Laptop?

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Apple iPad 2017: News and rumors Apple iPad 2017: News and rumors Retailer stock leak indicates Apple could launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in June By Andy Boxall — Updated May 11, 2017 6:55 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple may still be planning a new iPad range, which could include a brand-new screen size, in 2017. You’re forgiven if the Apple iPad has slipped your mind. Apple hasn’t treated its tablet line with the same excitement as the iPhone for a while, and those who already own an iPad are usually pretty happy to continue using the one they have, without upgrading it regularly. Rumors Apple would release new iPad models in 2017 have spread for a while, and although one arrived in March, it didn’t get its own event celebrating it. Does that mean Apple’s finished with the iPad for 2017? Not necessarily. There’s still talk of one with a new screen size coming, and a new Apple Pencil stylus. Here’s everything we think we know about Apple’s 2017 iPad range so far: Apple iPad Pro 2 10.5-inch Now the 9.7-inch iPad has become the entry point into the iPad range, there’s speculation Apple may replace the 9.7-inch iPad Pro with a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. Although it would have a larger screen, the device may have a bezel-less design, and therefore, a very similar body size to the 9.7-inch Pro. The screen size isn’t fixed in stone, and rumors state it may be as small as 10.1-inches, or as large as 10.9-inches, with the 10.5-inch size being most often discussed. Despite initially being rumored for a March 2017 launch and never appearing, there’s still talk of the tablet coming soon. The latest rumored release date is June, following an update to an Apple Authorized Retailer’s stock system, obtained by 9to5Mac. The site lists an Urban Armor Gear Metropolis Folio Case for a 10.5-inch iPad. Crucially, it only mentions iPad — no “Pro.” However, the 12.9-inch Metropolis case supports Apple’s Smart Keyboard and Pencil, so it’s reasonable to assume this one would as well. Still, accessory companies have a habit of planning products based on new devices that haven’t been announced yet, and it’s very possible that’s what we could be looking at here. Back in March, an IHS Markit analyst told Forbes the 10.5-inch tablet would arrive in April, and that production was slated to begin soon. She also mentioned initial supply would be limited, and reiterated the screen would have a thin bezel to reduce the overall size of the device. The existence of a 10.5-inch iPad Pro has been discussed plenty of times. In a tweet, a case manufacturer leaked documents showing one of its early designs for the tablet. While strong evidence, it’s not quite confirmation of the new iPad, as the company could simply be working on the product to ensure it can be produced in a timely fashion should the device become a reality. Although a 10.5-inch screen size is mentioned most, we have heard other rumors. One published by MacOtakara initially went with 10.9-inches, adding the body will measure 7.5mm, but the screen won’t have a bezel, and a home button won’t be on the front. A bezel at the top of the tablet will remain to house a front facing camera and other sensors. Touch ID and the speaker may be built into the space behind the screen. The same site published another rumor in late February, stating a 10.5-inch iPad would be the featured product during a March launch event. It referred to the tablet as the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2. It also mentioned a 9.7-inch iPad Pro in the lineup, going against rumors the 10.5-inch model would replace it. The sometimes unreliable Digitimes publication says Apple’s new 10.5-inch iPad will use the new A10X processor and will take over from the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in the range. Analysts from Barclays also agree Apple is planning to launch a mid-size iPad and reiterated the bezel-free screen rumor, though they also expected it to launch alongside Apple’s new 9.7-inch iPad back in March. Apple iPad Pro 2 9.7-inch There’s some debate as to the fate of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and while some rumors suggest that it will be replaced with a slightly larger device, fresh ones indicate that’s not the case. These new rumors suggest that the device will be updated when Apple refreshes the iPad range, however the update will be minor. The report comes from Mac Otakara, and says that the new device will get an A10X chip with boosted graphics and CPU performance. Apple iPad Pro 2 12.9-inch The iPad Pro 12.9-inch tablet may receive an update in 2017, if rumors are correct. The screen size is expected to stay the same, but the True Tone technology used on the smaller iPad models — where contrast and color are automatically adjusted depending on what’s being shown on screen — may be added to it. Like rumors surrounding the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, the 12.9-inch version may get a new Apple A10X processor, and also a camera upgrade to bring it in line with other iPad models. The body may get 3mm added to its thickness, making it almost 10mm thick, but that would be an odd move unless the device has an even bigger battery inside. A report from MacOtakara published in February 2017 said the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 would launch at an event in March, but this didn’t come true. Apple Pencil 2 Malarie Gokey/Digital Trends Rumors say a new Pencil stylus will accompany the new iPad Pro models upon announcement in 2017. Reports dating back to mid-2016 talk about a Pencil 2, with new annotation features that work across more iOS apps, including Mail, Messages, and Safari. No other rumors regarding features are circulating, but several patents filed by Apple over the past year hint it may bring interchangeable virtual nibs to the Pencil 2, an eraser function on the opposite end of the stylus, and possibly Touch ID support. However, patents don’t always turn into real products or features, so don’t treat this as confirmation. A rumor originating from the supply chain in China stated the Pencil 2 would be announced in March 2017, at the same event where the new iPad Pro models will be revealed. This failed to come true. It’s possible, if talk of a thicker iPad Pro 2 12.9-inch are correct, Apple will build a Pencil storage system into the new version of the tablet. Apple iPad Mini 5/iPad Pro Mini The iPad Mini 4 was revealed in September 2015, and like the iPad Air 2, it’s ready for an update. However, if an iPad Mini 5 is coming, very little is being said. There has been talk of a Pro version refresh, but it’s questionable whether there is any value in making such a device. For now, the silence may mean Apple will only refresh its larger iPad tablets in 2017, and let the Mini 4 live on for another year. However, a February report from MacOtakara mentions a 7.9-inch iPad Pro, indicating Apple may update the tablet to fit in with an expanded Pro model lineup. The specifications, or what will define it as a Pro model, aren’t discussed. Release date Apple announced the new 9.7-inch iPad on March 21 2017, and confirmed the new low-cost model would replace the iPad Air 2. The tablet was revealed in a press release without a full-scale launch event. Rumors had all concentrated on a launch event happening in March or early April for the new iPad range, but such a gathering never occurred. The only rumors outside of these concentrated on shipping dates for new iPad tablets, including the rumored 10.5-inch model. For example, a report from Digitimes indicates that the new 10.5-inch and the 12.9-inch iPads would ship in May or June. It also speculates Apple will hold an event at its newly built Apple Campus in April, where the tablet may be launched. That’s all the news and rumors regarding the 2017 Apple iPad range so far, but we’ll be updating regularly, so check back often. Article originally published on 01-19-2017.

There are even whole blogs dedicated to nothing else. Take, for example, an octopus. The emoji interpretation of what an octopus with a happy face looks like differs slightly if you’re using services operated by Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, HTC, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. Which one is the best? No one knows, but here are one person’s highly subjective opinions: https://nectarlne.tumblr.com/post/156218485148/octopus-emoji-review Brennan told The Verge via Twitter DM she’d never seen emoji reviews trend on Tumblr before, but was later able to find the very first emoji reviews on the site — one blogger briefly discussed Apple’s flushed face and wind chime emoji in 2012 and never posted again. All of the current reviews follow the longer, more elaborate structure, originating from a review of 11 different horse emoji posted in early January. That one was spun off into a much more popular post combining the review structure with the pre-existing Bee Movie meme. From there, the format quickly amassed a small but enthusiastic following, and the most popular posts rack up tens of thousands of likes and reblogs. Including some from yours truly! The idea of analyzing emoji is not new — there have been whole studies dedicated to their use, and the blog Emojinalysis, which gave horoscope-inspired readings based on the recently-used emoji submitted by readers, went viral in 2014. Apple’s fall 2016 emoji updates were widely despised and frequently dissected. But this is the first comprehensive, crowd-sourced review of all emoji, all at once. http://emojinalysis.tumblr.com/post/91094603053/subject-64-dan-30-when-i-was-growing-up-i-had-a One review of Apple’s spaghetti emoji rates it a 7 out of 10, noting, “A classic, nice simple sauce, would eat this no problem. Probably tastes pure and the kids would love it.” Nice! However, another reviewer gave Apple’s bird emoji a 0 out of 5 (the numeric scale has not yet been standardized, it seems), stating, “Pure evil. Excessive gradients only intensify his evil intentions. There is no sweetness in this child of darkness.” Yet another points out that Apple’s unicorn has a neck rash. Google’s lion emoji gets a perfect 5 out of 5: “A good lion friend. Very simplistic and clean. You can trust him.” So does its baby chick emoji: “She looks so determined!! Where is she going? What is she thinking about? I bet she’s gonna do something really important.” But you can’t win them all. Google’s pancakes get a 4 out of 10 because the butter pat on top is too big and that made the reviewer “uncomfortable.” http://anothertiredmonster.tumblr.com/post/156610510939/snake-emoji-review The ram emoji was reviewed by a “ram expert.” That one is really good. Somehow all of the dragon emoji that exist received scores of 10 out of 10. That doesn’t make sense to me, considering the LG dragon only has one leg. But as I said, the blog posts are highly subjective. That doesn’t mean they aren’t useful. They’re particularly useful if you’re just looking for a little chuckle at your desk this morning. Isn’t that what you need? For me: yes, 10 out of 10.

The leader for digital assistant home devices is currently Amazon with Google Home coming in a distant second place. Amazon just introduced a higher-end version of their device called 'Echo Show.' The new version comes with a 7-inch touch display at a killer price of only $230 for one or $360 for a pair.     Winning the home market for AI is important and it's ramping up towards fever pitch as Microsoft announced yesterday during their developer conference that they're working with HP and Intel on delivering more Cortana based devices. There's no doubt that over time their larger PC partners will also introduce products if the ones coming from Harman/Kardon and HP sell well over the holiday season.   It was revealed at Build that Microsoft is working with HP and Intel to bring more Cortana-powered devices to the world. HP will make a device with Cortana inside while Intel will work on a reference design.   It was also revealed yesterday that Intel has been aggressively developing technologies and products for the artificial intelligence (AI) market and has acquired companies including Altera, which focuses on FPGA technology, Nervana Systems for machine learning technologies and Mobileye, the largest ADAS supplier. The CPU giant's new processors codenamed Lake Crest, are currently in testing to be optimized for neural networks.   The company also has a new processor series codenamed Knights Crest that is designed to integrate its Xeon processor with Nervana's technologies.   Microsoft also made it known that other partners working with them include Volvo, Nissan, and BMW, which committed earlier this year to using Microsoft's in-car system with Cortana and Skype inside.   In a new report today we learn that Compal Electronics recently landed orders for a smart voice recognition device tied to AI technologiees that will be tied to 'wearable devices' from a U.S. company.   The device is expected to be released via a brand vendor in the third or fourth quarter and will feature voice and face recognition function and the Cortana system.   Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "Inventec Lands First Order for Apple's Echo-Like Home Device with Siri," followed by a report titled "Apple's SVP Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller thinks that Echo-Like Devices should have a Display."   And lastly, we can't forget that Samsung is likely to enter the race as well now that their digital assistant Bixby launched in South Korea on May first for the Galaxy S8 and likely to hit the U.S. in a few months. Samsung is already adopting Bixby for appliances and it will be coming to their Gear smartwatch and new Galaxy C10 coming to China with a dual lens camera at mid-range pricing that could further hurt iPhone SE sales in that country even further, according to a recent Korean tech report.   Furthermore, we discovered yesterday that the U.S. Patent Office granted Samsung a design patent for an Audio device that no doubt will be for a home device for Bixby that comes with a display on a stand as noted below.   The fever pitch news around AI devices for the home comes as Apple's WWDC 2017 draws nigh. Not to overhype the event, but should Apple happen to announce a new Siri based device for the home in the Echo-class category, it's going to really make the upcoming event a much watch this year. The air will be crackling with excitement.   Such a device is going to fit in beautifully with Apple's HomeKit and help the smart home market accelerate.   Considering that most families will want several such devices laid out around the home, Apple is going to have to price their device aggressively. Amazon has the right idea because it's not just about the smart home, it's about ordering products and services too.   Microsoft has really been on a tear of late introducing new products that excite their base and they're definitely taking the AI war to Apple, just as they are with their mixed reality HoloLens headset.   The War between Microsoft and Apple seemed to be over with Apple crushing Wintel, but the tech giants are waking up and AI is front and center for both Microsoft and Intel.   There's nothing like a healthy tech war to get consumers fired up and this coming holiday season is really going to be interesting as Apple enters the race and goes head to head with Microsoft and their partners along with Amazon, Google and others. It's going to be a real slugfest.   Does Apple have a killer app to reveal next month that will separate the wheat from the chaff? Only time will tell.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Apple Valley man dies after collision on Bear Valley Road Thursday May 11, 2017 at 8:10 AM May 11, 2017 at 4:28 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero APPLE VALLEY — A 58-year-old man involved in two-vehicle collision on Bear Valley Road on Wednesday night died of his injuries at Antelope Valley Hospital, authorities said Thursday. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials said Matthew Marshall, of Apple Valley, was pronounced dead after he was airlifted to the hospital. Authorities say Marshall was driving a Kia Sephia that collided with a Chevrolet Cruze driven by a 20-year-old Adelanto woman at Bear Valley and Algonquin roads. Deputies and firefighters responded a little after 8:20 p.m. and found the force of the collision caused major damage to both vehicles. Marshall, who was trapped inside the Kia, suffered major injuries. He was extricated and airlifted, sheriff’s officials said. The driver of the Cruze, along with three passengers who are all from Apple Valley, were transported to local hospitals with non-life threatening injuries. The collision shut down Bear Valley Road between Mohwak and Navajo roads for several hours as the Apple Valley Sheriff's Station Major Accident Investigation Team worked the scene. The cause of the collision remains under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station at 760-240-7400.

It's not entirely clear if the front-facing camera will also have dual lenses, or retain a single lens in line with previous iPhone models. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities previously said the iPhone 8 will have a "revolutionary" front-facing camera system with 3D sensing capabilities, fueled by algorithms from PrimeSense, an Israeli company that Apple acquired in 2013. PrimeSense was known for developing Microsoft's first Kinect sensor for Xbox. Kuo said the iPhone 8's front camera system will include two infrared modules that are able to determine the location and depth of objects placed in front of it, with potential applications including facial recognition, iris scanning, and some combination of augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality.

Yes, but it also implies that there would be a secure alternative to touchid, and the more i think of it, the more i think apple will put it on the back. This news is actually not that good, why make an alternative to touchid, unless it will be needed in some situations? And about building the factory for iphone 8. I guess that is true. Since iphone 8 won' t come out until next year. I have been saying for weeks now that the rumors about the the (anniversery) Edition that will come out this year and the iphone 8 (2018) are being mixed up.

Apple is working on the iOS 10.3.2 release that we expect as soon as next Monday. Once this new version arrives, Pangu may deliver an iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak tool to the public. After months without much movement on iOS 10 jailbreak tools, there is now mounting evidence that the Pangu iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak tool is coming very soon. Traditionally jailbreak teams wait for the next version of iOS to arrive before releasing a jailbreak tool so that Apple doesn’t know the exact details of the jailbreak for that version. Read: Best Jailbreak Apps & Tweaks Reports on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, outline the potential iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak release from Pangu, a well-known source in the the jailbreak community. If you are on iOS 10.3.1, you should not update to iOS 10.3.2 immediately since there may not be an iOS 10.3.2 jailbreak. In late April we saw a video showing a potential iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak on the iPhone 7. This will reportedly work on all 64-bit iOS devices, including the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Redmond Pie shares the following roughly translated post about the iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak from Weibo, which includes some advice on what you should do; If all things happen accordingly, then Apple should release iOS 10.3.2 to the public next week, but students (slang for followers of) looking to jailbreak should wait, because @PanguTeam is planning to release an iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak tool (codenamed Janus), the average person would expect this tool to be released after iOS 10.3.2 is released to the public. Of course, once again, if you’re not on iOS 10.3.1 (implying if you are below iOS 10.3.1), you should probably not upgrade your firmware just in case this is an Oolong (slang for something being fake). Users who are not jailbroken and not on a version of iOS that can currently be jailbroken should look into upgrading to iOS 10.3.1. If you are already jailbroken, do not upgrade to iOS 10.3.1 at this time, in case this is a fake or simply delayed. Anyone interested in jailbreaking should avoid iOS 10.3.2 for the time being. Pangu is waiting for iOS 10.3.2 to arrive before releasing the new iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak tool, so there is a chance that it will also work on iOS 10.3.2, which they can test on in beta. We could see a Pangu iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak release this month. There is no confirmation of the Pangu iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak from the team’s website or social media accounts. The earlier iOS 10 jailbreak tools came from other sources, but this team is one of the few groups that users should take seriously when there is jailbreak news. This could be the final iOS 10 jailbreak as we don’t expect many more iOS updates before the iOS 11 update announcement at WWDC 2017 and a fall iOS 11 release date. Once that arrives we’ll get an iPhone 8 and be waiting for an iOS 11 jailbreak. Best iOS 10 Themes for iPhone: Cydia Themes for Winterboard & Anemone Aeyris Theme   1 / 11 Ayeris is a stunning iPhone theme that looks great on the iPhone and the larger iPhone 6s Plus as well as older iPhones. The theme is one that we've used for several years, and it still looks great on the slightly tweaked look of iOS 9. There are 300 icons included, system-wide user interface skins, status bar icons and different dock modes.  Ayeris for iOS is $2.99 on Cydia   1 / 11 One Response 05/11/2017 unknown Reply Nothing is to be trusted until Pangu speaks up and tell the truth. Until then, just stick to Yalu102 plus Flex 3’s “Yalu always signed” and you’re good to go. No use going on a wild goose chase. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts New Apple patent highlights potential Siri integration with Messages Christian Zibreg on May 11, 2017 1 The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) today published an interesting patent application filed for by Apple, which indicates that the Cupertino company might be exploring much deep integration between the Siri personal assistant and its iMessage message platform. Titled “Intelligent automated assistant in a messaging environment”, the company’s patent application proposes chatbot-style Siri functionality within the context of the Messages app for those times when using voice-based interactions would be impractical, like in noisy environments such as libraries, movie theaters and so forth. The patent application appears to be an enhanced version of Apple’s prior invention, titled “Virtual assistant in a communication session,” filed for last year and outlining basic Siri-Messages integration via bot-style commands. Today’s patent application includes deep Siri integration with audio, video and image files, as well as with deep links to websites/apps and more. The system could potentially permit users to use image and video recognition with Siri, asking the personal assistant to, say, send an image of a Volkswagen Beetle to a contact or return a text-based web answer. Siri cannot process images in its current form. Other image-related queries could include “Where is this?”, “What insect is this?”, “Which company uses this logo?” and more. Siri would be able to remember user preferences and data, too. In one embodiment, a user sends a picture of a bottle of wine and says, “I like this wine” to have Siri remember this preference. She would also be able to store custom text for later retrieval. Lastly, Apple proposes chatbot-like functionality where the AI-driven assistant would offer its services to chat participants in a manner not unlike the AI assistant in Facebook’s Messenger app. The system could intelligently provide relevant information in the text form about stuff like a nearby restaurant while being able to suggest transportation options and even create an entry in each chat participant’s calendar about an upcoming meeting. Here’s an excerpt from the patent abstract: User input can be received and in response to receiving the user input, the user input can be displayed as a first message in the GUI. A contextual state of the electronic device corresponding to the displayed user input can be stored. The process can cause an action to be performed in accordance with a user intent derived from the user input. A response based on the action can be displayed as a second message in the GUI. Siri currently includes a feature that allows you to edit your queries by typing, but it’s not very practical as it’s only available after the user has initially issued a voice-based command to the personal assistant. Apple’s technology, assuming it sees the light of day, would permit users to review previous Siri interactions in a chronological format. Today’s patent application was first filed for in May 2016 and credits Apple engineers Petr Karashchuk, Tomas A. Vega Galvez and Thomas R. Gruber as its inventors.

Source: https://sputniknews.com/us/201608111044146373-manhunt-on-for-apple-burglars/ Not so long ago we reported about the new project from Apple. We are referring to the “Siri speaker”, a device that will work as a virtual assistant inside your home. Just like Amazon Echo. And according to a report from Bloomberg, Apple employees have been putting the new device to the test for months inside their homes. But, the Siri speaker is pretty much a mystery and not many informations have been leaked. Last September Bloomberg reported that Apple has a new home device but that was it. No timeline or features about the device have circled around the internet, but there are many speculations that could turn out to be true. According to Macrumors.com the sound technology is critical for the California-based company. So Apple will aim to make a better speaker and microphone and it is said that it will have “excellent acoustics performance” and it will have AirPlay supports and some Beats tech. Another rumored feature is facial recognition. This feature will allow the device to recognize each member of the household and adjust to their preferences. Of course we expect to see some third-party integrations. The report says that Apple has sped two years developing the speaker and prototype was ready around September. But after Amazon’s release of the Echo Show, with touch-screen and video-call ability, maybe Apple is considering to add a screen, of they haven’t add one already. And VP Phil Schiller shared a comment in an interview with Gadgets 360, about the value of a screen on gadgets: “The idea of not having a screen, I don’t think suits many situations,” “If you’re asking for directions, you’ll hear them, but can’t see a map.” “I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful. Their intelligence is going to grow. They’re gonna do more for us, but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this” So far we know that there is working prototype, that is being tested by its employees, we know that the audio will be amazingly good and we expect that the design will follow the company’s guidelines. But what we don’t know is the official release date. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo  the speaker might be presented at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference this June.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Reliable leaker claims to reveal iPhone 8 launch timing, and it’s not what we’re expecting Image Source: Gabor Balogh Zach Epstein @zacharye May 11th, 2017 at 9:59 AM Share Tweet This year is shaping up to be the most exciting time period for smartphones in about a decade. When Apple first released the iPhone in 2007, it was a total game-changer that dramatically altered the course of the industry. Now, in 2017, we’re seeing a major shift in design that makes content far more immersive than it has ever been before on smartphones. Devices like the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 are expected to be something of a preview of Apple’s iPhone 8, which should push things even further in this direction. What’s more, the iPhone 8 is expected to toss features like 3D scanning and enhanced augmented reality into the mix. The bad news is that all that tech is expected to come at a cost… or is it? Don't Miss: Your iPhone 7 Plus will last for way more than two days with this insanely thin battery case At this point, we’ve lost count of all the independent reports that have claimed Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 launch will be delayed. The phone is expected to be the first widely-available flagship device to feature a fingerprint scanner that is embedded into the display itself. It would certainly be understandable if manufacturing complexities associated with this major advancement caused Apple to push back the phone’s release, which is exactly what we’ve heard. While the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are said to be on track of the standard September release, Apple is eyeing October or maybe even November for the iPhone 8’s launch, according to recent reports. What’s more, iPhone 8 supply is expected to be hugely constrained at launch, again due to the increased complexity of the phone’s components. Apple can’t even figure out how to make enough AirPods to meet demand five months after launch… so things aren’t looking good for a completely redesigned iPhone. While things still aren’t looking good as far as supply shortages go, a new rumor could bring some good news regarding the iPhone 8’s release timeframe. According to Twitter user @OnLeaks — who has a good track record despite his cringeworthy bio, in which he describes himself as a “Tech Leaks SupaStar” — Apple’s iPhone 8 is actually on track for a September launch. Hirings and trainings for new iPhones production just started at Foxconn… 😏 #iPhone8 pic.twitter.com/vbvqhOSUmX — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) May 11, 2017 In the tweet above, the leaker says that Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn has begun to staff its facilities in preparation for Apple’s next-generation flagship iPhone. Then, in a subsequent tweet, he says that mass production of the iPhone 8 will begin in August ahead of a September launch. According to my sources: DVT started last month. PVT will start between June and July. Final mass production in August for September launch. https://t.co/2M2YyMjyi8 — OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) May 11, 2017 While this could certainly be good news, none of this is even close to being confirmed. But as we mentioned, @OnLeaks’ does have a good track record. If his unnamed sources are accurate though, it’s not all good news. Mass production one month ahead of launch for a phone with as much pent-up demand as the iPhone 8 would undoubtedly lead to severe shortages at launch.

During his tenure at Apple, he helped develop features like Night Shift and Bedtime. Now, he's left the company to join a startup called SleepScore Labs. Christina Farr | @chrissyfarr 16 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters The sleep-monitoring technology market could be a big opportunity for tech companies    16 Hours Ago | 00:51 The man behind some of your favorite sleep features on Apple devices has left the company to focus on a new start-up focused on tracking sleep. In 2014, sleep researcher Roy Raymann joined Apple's growing health team from Philips Research to focus on using mobile technology to track sleep and improve sleep quality. During his three-year tenure, he helped develop Night Shift, a tool for the Mac that shifts display colors to the warmer end of the spectrum after dark, and the bedtime feature in iOS 10 that reminds users when to go to bed and tracks sleep habits. He also worked on Apple's HealthKit, which serves as a centralized system to store health information, including sleep data. "What you see at Apple is a genuine passion for everything related to health, and it's not exclusive to fitness," Raymann told CNBC. Last month, Raymann left the company to head up a start-up called SleepScore Labs. He told CNBC one thing he was excited about was more networking with fellow sleep professionals. "Apple is a little more inward focused," he said. "I was intrigued to be part of a fully dedicated team." Sleep-monitoring technology is a huge potential market for Apple and other technology companies. An estimated 50 to 70 million US adults have sleep or wakefulness disorders, according to the CDC, and millions more intermittent experience periods when they suffer with sleep. A variety of new apps and devices have emerged, claiming to track sleep and provide insights in how users can feel more rested. Some of these are of backed by more evidence than others, said Raymann. Among the highest-quality, according to Raymann, is his new venture. The startup was initially developed by Mehmet Oz, the physician and television personality, and ResMed, a medical device maker. SleepScore's $129.99 sleep sensor integrates with any platform, including iOS and Android. It works by tracking the user's sleep relative to others of a similar age and gender, and then provides advice about how to improve sleep quality. "For consumers, it's not that easy to have insight into what's happening with their sleep," said Raymann. "It's not just about the duration, but also timing and consistency." Raymann said it's not advisable to draw very broad generalizations about sleep, such as a 10,000 steps goal for activity, as solutions will differ for each person. Some users might need to work towards an earlier bedtime, while others should avoid caffeine after noon. Raymann said he will focus on recommendations for users, so they can take steps to improve sleep quality. He also said that a lot of the sleep trackers on the market aren't "particularly accurate," but that SleepScore Labs is backed by a "long track record of data." He declined to comment on Apple's acquisition of Beddit, a sleep monitoring device. Correction: The company's name was misspelled in an earlier version of this article due to an editing error. It is SleepScore Labs.

Name: Subject: Message: EU tech companies accusing Google, Apple, and Facebook of unfair business practices Newsby Mitja Rutnik16 hours ago 5 151 13 Sébastien Bertrand The European Commission has received a number of complaints from tech companies based on the old continent regarding unfair business practices by major players in the market including Apple and Google. That’s why it has started working on a possible law that would address these issues. European companies including Spotify, Rocket Internet, and Deezer, think that search engines and app stores owned by large American companies are abusing their market positions. They often use their power to promote their own services instead of those of the competition and impose imbalanced terms and conditions. With the new law, the European Commission wants to make things right and improve the chances of companies based in the EU of going head to head with the likes of Google, Apple, and Facebook, just to name a few. See also: Google ordered to pay damages for Chrome patent violation February 16, 2017 Spotify, for example, complained last year that Apple rejected an updated version of its popular app, which competes directly with Apple Music. There are apparently plenty more cases like this, which is why the Commission is now stepping in. It wants to come up with a solution that will establish fair practice criteria and set up a system that will help resolve disputes as quickly as possible. The Commission started looking into the claims made by EU companies last year and did share a few of its findings with the public. It believes that platforms owned by Google and others were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to information, as well as not making search result rankings as transparent as they could. As you can imagine, US companies aren’t very happy with the Commission’s initiative. EDiMA, the trade association representing online platforms including Google and Facebook, among others, said that it is both disappointed and astounded. There are also a lot of businesses that support the initiative, especially those in the music industry, which claim that unfair online trading practices have become too common in recent years.

As published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's patent application for an "Intelligent automated assistant in a messaging environment" describes a method of meshing Siri with a graphical user interface designed for text messaging. Importantly, the integration would grant Siri the ability to not only converse with a single user, but also act as a third party in group chats. The proposed system appears much more advanced than current Siri implementations that rely largely on speech recognition. As detailed in today's document, Siri integration would enable users to "talk" to the virtual assistant using any form of communication supported by Messages, which at this time includes text, audio, images and video. Currently, Siri accepts voice commands via device microphones in a dedicated Siri UI. While the assistant can parse natural language input with a high degree of accuracy, mistakes do occur. In such cases, users can modify their query by tapping or selecting confirmation text and typing in the correct information. Siri also lacks the ability to process images in its current form. As noted in the patent application, moving Siri to a messaging environment fosters all-new interactions. For example, a text-based UI is preferable in noisy environments or in quiet locations where audio interactions are not desired, like a library or movie theater. Since Messages, and other messaging apps, present information in a chronological format, users would be able to review previous Siri interactions as traditional text histories. Additionally, Siri can reference available chat histories for contextual clues as it attempts to answer user queries. Currently, the Siri UI deletes a query thread once a session is complete. Like existing implementations, contextual information can go beyond conversation history. For example, device location can be leveraged to answer a question like, "How did the Giants do?" A generated task flow first detects user intent, which in this case is an inquiry into a sports score. Depending on the location of the device, time and team schedule, Siri might return a score for the San Francisco Giants or New York Giants. Subsequent messages can include links to internet websites relating to the sports score, or internal links to other apps.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple's iPhone Is Losing Ground in China Apple needs to worry about the growing dominance of these three Chinese companies. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) May 11, 2017 at 8:46AM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales in China took a massive beating last year, dropping an estimated 23%, which pushed its market share into the single digits, per research from IDC. Now, the latest sales data from the Middle Kingdom indicates that local smartphone players have continued gaining on the iPhone maker. Apple isn't going anywhere in China Market research firm Canalys estimates that Chinese smartphone sales jumped 9% during the first quarter of 2017, but most of the gains were lapped up by just three companies. As it turns out, Huawei, OPPO, and Vivo took the top three spots, accounting for 50% of sales, up from a combined market share of 42% in the prior-year period. Image source: Apple.  Apple stood fourth in the Chinese smartphone hierarchy. Though Canalys didn't reveal the exact sales figure, the Cupertino-based company should have moved more than fifth-ranked Xiaomi's 9 million units. However, Apple's sales couldn't have been close to third-placed Vivo's 17 million shipments, which had 15% share of the market. This is because the iPhone maker's Chinese market share was just 9.6% at the end of 2016, according to IDC's market research, and it faced increased competition from the three local players during the quarter. What's more, the growing dominance of Huawei, OPPO, and Vivo also impacted Apple's global performance as its sales in the first quarter stagnated. The company moved 51.6 million iPhones last quarter, giving it 14.9% of the global smartphone market. Apple, meanwhile, had shipped 51.2 million units in the prior-year period, when it had 15.4% of the market. This isn't good news for Apple investors -- overall smartphone shipments jumped 4.3% year-over-year, but the Chinese top three cornered a bigger share of the market as their combined sales jumped almost 25%. Therefore, the growing dominance of Huawei, OPPO, and Vivo in China -- the world's largest smartphone market, with a third of overall sales -- has translated into gains on the global stage. Can Apple turn the tide? UBS and Gartner estimate that iPhone sales in China will fall in the double digits once again this year, though the company has announced certain steps to turn the tide in its favor. For instance, the company recently announced that it plans to open two new research and development facilities there, in addition to two previously announced centers. In fact, Apple has set aside over $500 million to spend on R&D in China. But Cupertino needs to understand that innovation is not where the problem lies. According to IDC's research manager Anthony Scarsella: Companies have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment. The Chinese companies have been spending a lot of money to advertise that their smartphones can compete with the best at a lower price point. What's more, they have been aggressively trying to grab greater customer attention by opening retail stores and improving customer service. For instance, Huawei had 35,000 retail stores globally a year ago, and decided to open another 15,000 to boost smartphone sales. More specifically, 11,000 of Huawei's stores were on the Chinese mainland in June last year, while Apple had just 40. OPPO's phones, on the other hand, are sold at 200,000 locations in China. Meanwhile, Xiaomi is looking to get into the offline retail act and plans to open 1,000 new retail stores over the next three years. Now, data from Counterpoint Research indicates that 40% of smartphone sales in China take place through the offline store channel, so it is not surprising to see these companies aggressively increasing their point-of-sales presence to grab a bigger pie of the market. On the other hand, Apple doesn't want to open up its store ecosystem to local outlets, limiting its chances of reaching a wider audience. Therefore, the iPhone maker needs a new sales strategy in China. It can consider rapidly expanding its retail presence by spending a lot of money, or allow local dealers to brand, advertise, and sell the iPhone for a fee and get into more stores at a fast pace. Otherwise, it won't be surprising if Apple continues to lose ground in China. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Not only does it come down to the style of the device, but also the look and feel of the operating system. For Apple users, the obvious choice is the Apple Watch, but other options are available as well. Today it has been revealed that Samsung’s smartwatch OS, Tizen, has surpassed Google’s Android Wear, but it still falls far behind Apple’s option. Samsung Chromebook Plus According to a new report from Strategy Analytics (via Tizen Experts), during Q1 of 2017, Samsung’s Tizen OS overtook Google’s Android Wear for the first time with 19% of the overall market compared to Google’s 18%. What’s interesting to note here is that past reports predicted that Samsung’s OS would barely make a dent in the market at this point. As impressive as it is that Tizen has grabbed the number two spot, it still pales in comparison to Apple’s efforts taking a whopping 57% of the market, solely with the Apple Watch. What I found interesting about this change in the market is the availability of hardware. While Tizen only runs on Samsung proprietary devices such as the Gear S3, Gear S2, and Gear Fit devices, which are admittedly pretty great, Android Wear offers many more options. There are well over a dozen completely different Android Wear models on the market today, and many more coming later this year. Obviously, Tizen’s growth only means so much. With Apple controlling the majority of the wearable market, it feels unlikely that Tizen will overtake Apple’s watchOS or even become a stronger competitor, especially if Apple continues to limit the functionality of third-party wearables connected to the iPhone.

The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple’s plans to build a $4 million shipping and receiving warehouse on a vacant lot in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. “We’re excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data center and supporting facilities,” Apple spokesman John Rosenstock said in an email to The Associated Press. “As part of our growth, we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs.” Last week, Apple announced a new $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, but provided few details. As part of a strategy emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, it also released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work — more than half in California’s Silicon Valley. Apple currently has more than 700 workers in Nevada, which Rosentock said is home to the company’s largest solar investment, “powering our data center with clean energy.” The 5-year-old $1 billion data center is located in the Reno Technology Center near the Tracy generating station along U.S. Interstate 80. It’s between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla’s giant battery factory is based about 15 miles (24 km) east of Reno-Sparks. Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data center in 2012. Gov. Brian Sandoval said it was “the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map.” “Apple’s decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home,” he said in a statement Wednesday. The Reno Gazette-Journal reported City Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the downtown land deal Wednesday, calling for an end to unfair tax deals for “some powerful, well-connected corporations and not the rest of us.” Mayor Hillary Schieve and Councilman Paul McKenzie said the whole city will benefit from the developments. “Apple doesn’t just pay, they offer a living wage,” McKenzie said.

Zune Forever: The Diehards Still Obsessed With Microsoft’s Colossal Failure 2017: A Zune Odyssey It's hard to forget the Zune. After all, Microsoft's mid-2000s bid to sink the iPod with an MP3 player of its own was notable for its immense thirst. The Zune, which was clunkier than the iPod and came in black, white, pink, and putrid shit-brown, desperately wanted to be cool. Unluckily, at the time of the Zune's release in 2006, Apple also began airing its "Get a Mac" ads, which cast Microsoft as terminally lame. Still, anti-Apple sentiment was strong even then among the nerds, and so the Zune was an underdog. Microsoft tried to capitalize on this, and counter Apple's messaging, with its own "edgy" ads and stunts like sponsoring a VICE event in Toronto. Read More: The Original Net Artists It didn't work. The writing was on the wall for the Zune as early as 2008, as stores pulled it from shelves and revenues dipped. In 2010, the final model was released, the Zune HD, and in 2012, it was discontinued. The software was abandoned in 2015. Apple won the war and barely broke a sweat. Recently, I became fixated on the idea of someone using a Zune in 2017, which I found absolutely hilarious for reasons even I don't fully understand. What must it be like? Does the modern-day Zune owner feel like a gadget-toting John the Baptist in a desert of Apple products, vaping and sermonizing on Radiohead? I lit the bat signal on Twitter: Zune owners, come forward, if you're out there. To my surprise, my inbox was soon filled with emails from people who claim to still use, and love, their Zunes. So, I called them. Almost everybody had a different reason for getting one, and for hanging on to it. For some, it was the features—you could share tunes with friends, subscribe to a Spotify-like music service, and it could be synced wirelessly (all features the iPod lacked)—and for others, it was simple hatred of Apple. Some kept their Zunes for those same reasons, or the connection is now sentimental. For others, the app-less Zune is a sanctuary from endless smartphone notifications. * Ryan Bordner 27, IT Spokane, Washington I have a Zune in my car that sits on the USB cable and when you turn the car on, it automatically plays. I have [another] one in a dock in my room that has a remote. And when I go on a bike ride, I have a tiny Zune that I put in my pocket and I don't really care if I drop it. I use one for every need. I don't think I'll ever switch because I have the arsenal to future-proof myself. Like, oh, here's another Zune for cheap, so I might as well buy it just in case one breaks. Gretchen Lilly 36, elementary school counselor Kirkland, Washington Sometimes I just want to listen to music and not be interrupted with things that are going on on my phone. It's unplugging, in a way. I like to go for long walks when the weather is nice. There's something nice about, like, I'm just leaving my phone at home and I'm listening to music or a podcast on my Zune, and I'm not being interrupted by other aspects of technology. Photo: Gretchen Lilly Jamey Harris 40, engineer Orlando, Florida If my Zune breaks, definitely look for another Zune first. The thing is, with your phone, if you download an app like Spotify, they're asking for access to data on your phone, it's connected to the internet, and they track your location, which they sell to third-party vendors. But the Zune isn't connected to the internet at all, and what I like about the Zune is the privacy element. Vanyel Harkema 23, game design student San Francisco, California I had a 40GB Zune back in high school, and it got eaten up by the chain of my motorcycle in a freak accident. When I graduated, I found out that they stopped making them, so I had to go to eBay and that's where I got my custom blue Zune. I'm the only one [of my friends] who owns one now. Sometimes the reaction is, "What's a Zune?" or, "Of course you have one, you were built by Microsoft." I think that a lot of younger people still kind of what they are, and they haven't totally faded out of public consciousness. Mary Branscombe Age undisclosed, freelance writer London, UK I still use my Zune HD for a few reasons—one being that I loathe iTunes with the passion of every sun in the known universe. I vastly prefer the Zune device user interface to the iPod user interface in any iteration later than the original iPod nano. I don't need it to be updated because a good interface for playing music continues to be a good interface for playing music. Photo: Sean Davison Sean Davison 44, CAD drafter San Francisco Bay Area, US I've been asked a couple times on the ferry. Someone's like, "What's that?" and I'm like, "It's my Zune!" They say, "Really?" and that's it. No big deal! People have questions but they keep them to themselves I guess. They might look at me and think, "This guy's a dinosaur, what's wrong with this guy?" But it's a convenience thing, I'm telling you. The software still works. They haven't updated it, but it still works. If it works, I just keep using it. JP Accetta Age undisclosed, medical student Miami, Florida The music on my iPhone is always changing, and I use Spotify. But on my Zune, it's the music I've had forever, and it's never going to change. I have a lot of old music that's never going to be deleted. There's a lot of music I put in here forever ago—maybe I backed it up on a hard drive—but it's not in the cloud, and it's not on my computer. It's just here. Photo: Jordan McMahon Jordan McMahon 25, personal trainer Tucson, Arizona I actually woke up the other day to a message from a friend. In my senior year of high school, I did a video of the teachers saying goodbye, and she asked which songs I used. So, I charged my Zune for the first time in months, and I found it. I can use it as a time capsule, and look back and say, this is what I used to listen to. Just nostalgia, for late night drives, that kind of thing. Luke Boyer 30, environmental management Indiana, US I got my Zune in 2005. My girlfriend at the time, who's now my wife, bought it for me as a present. I really wasn't a big fan of Apple, so I was open to other possibilities. I have used it consistently since then. I'm dreading the day my Zune breaks, and I keep putting off that thought. I'm hoping to never have to address that. I would've thought that the battery would be dead by now, so I'm sure its days are numbered. I'll probably see if I can get a replacement Zune online. It's been so good for 12 years, and it's hard to beat that. These interviews have been condensed and edited for content and clarity.

Not even its decidedly flat earnings report last week can change the fact that it is the most valuable publicly traded company of all time. Advertisement With all that cash, and with that huge market cap, plenty of investors and analysts are busy dreaming up ways for Apple to spend that money. For years, they have pontificated that if Apple wants to continue to grow, it needs to make the kind of major mergers and acquisitions that many of its contemporaries—including Google, Microsoft, Facebook—have made, and that means investing billions. Think Facebook’s $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, or Microsoft’s $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, or even AT&T’s proposed $80 billion purchase of Time Warner. Every few months, as Apple’s stock price continues to rise and its cash coffers get more and more full, these calls for action crop back up. Just last week, Citigroup listed seven companies it thinks Apple should eye for takeover bids, including usual favorites like Netflix, Tesla, and Disney. For good measure, Citi threw in some other new takeover targets, including Activision Blizzard, Take Two Interactive, Electronic Arts, and Hulu. Forget that most of these companies don’t make a lick of sense for Apple to acquire (Activision Blizzard, EA, Take Two Interactive), and forget that many are categorically not for sale (Tesla, Netflix), investors are overly focused on Apple spending money. Advertisement “Apple needs to buy ‘x’” rhetoric has reached such fervor, I actually got a pitch in my inbox about a gambling service that’s taking bets about what company is the odds-on favorite for a major acquisition by Apple. Forget that that’s not how M&A works, forget that Apple’s approach to acquisitions is very conservative compared not just to other tech companies, but any company of its size, the fact that shady betting parlors are now taking action on what major deals Apple is going to make proves that the world is insane. What makes this even funnier is that when Apple made its biggest acquisition in its 40 year history for Beats back in 2014, it was only $3 billion; the takeover targets investors and pundits are pushing Apple to make would all be deals ten or twenty times bigger. Historically, Apple is known for making smaller, more strategic investments. Aside from the Beats acquisition, the company’s only big spend in recent years was a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing (the Uber of China that actually forced Uber out of China), and that seemed to be as much about getting a better sense of the Chinese market and potentially making a nice profit, as anything else. The two most important investments Apple has ever made, NeXT (which brought back Steve Jobs and gave Apple the OS that would be the underpinnings for its future products, including the iPhone), and PA Semi (which allowed Apple to design its own mobile processors and chipsets), were comparatively small at under $500 million a piece. Apple is not a company that makes massive acquisitions, and as its financials continue to prove, it doesn’t need to be. And yet, every few months, articles abound about how Apple should spend its money, always with a focus on big splashy deals. Sponsored Over the last six months Forbes, Fortune, Seeking Alpha, Market Watch, CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg, Om Malik, Ben Thompson, Business Insider and many more fonts of brilliant insight I’m surely forgetting have all cracked their knuckles and typed earnest words about how Apple should spend its money. How on earth did Apple ever make money before there were bloggers to advise it on how to do stuff! Some stories go so far as to imply that the fact that Apple isn’t doing big acquisitions like its rivals, as a sign that it’s failing to innovate. Forget about AR or self-driving cars, or the next wave of user interfaces, if you’d listen to these experts, the only path for Apple going forward is for it to spend tens of billions acquiring Netflix, Tesla, or The Walt Disney company. Take Om Malik, the journalist turned venture capitalist. For almost a year, he’s been hammering on about how Apple should buy Netflix, even though the company is very much not for sale. From August: Advertisement Apple—if it really wants to get into content and wants to make a strong statement to the Hollywood establishment that has stymied its television efforts so far—should make a big, bold bet. It should use its massive stock market capitalization and cash hoard to buy Netflix. Putting aside that most of Malik’s reasoning is why it would be good for Apple (he never makes an argument for why Netflix would want to sell), to make this sort of purchase, Apple would have to spend a ridiculous sum of money. Netflix has a current market cap of nearly $70 billion. If you assume a 20 or 30 percent premium for a takeover target (and frankly, that could be low), Apple would probably need to spend close to $100 billion to buy Netflix, which again, is a company that isn’t looking to sell itself. Advertisement It’s a similar story for Tesla, another frequent Apple takeover dream. Again, by all accounts, Tesla is NOT looking to sell itself. If it were, its CEO Elon Musk, who owns more than 20 percent of the company, would undoubtedly want a ridiculous premium, which has a current market cap of $55 billion. That hasn’t stopped people from predicting Apple will do it anyway. Back in February 2015, entrepreneur-turned-investor Jason Calacanis declared that Apple would buy Tesla for $75 billion within 18 months. Twenty-five months later, Elon Musk laughed off the idea that Apple would buy his company. And what would Apple even gain by owning either company? The time for Apple to buy Tesla was back in 2013, when the company was nearly bankrupt and hadn’t become the juggernaut that it is today. In fact, back in 2013, Tesla reportedly had meetings with both Apple and Google, for a reported asking price of under $6 billion. The time to buy Tesla isn’t after you’ve tried to do your own car project (and had to scale back those efforts), it’s before. The time to buy Netflix was probably back in 2011, when the company tried to split itself in half to disastrous results (RIP, Qwikster). And more to the point, why should Apple listen to Jason Calacanis or Om Malik, or me for that matter? Apple has done a pretty good job of building a hugely successful company by following a playbook that often runs counter to the pundits and investment banks. The last people Tim Cook needs to listen to are armchair analysts or investment banks who only wish Apple would consider using their services. Advertisement Advertisement This isn’t a new phenomenon. In the ten years I’ve been covering Apple, these types of stories have persisted (Harry McCracken wrote a great history of Apple not buying things back in 2011). Five years ago, Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote an article for The New York Times about companies Apple should consider buying, back when it was sitting on $118 billion in cash Sorkin wasn’t necessarily advocating Apple make any deals, he was just pointing out what companies would make sense in the context of 2012. It’s actually instructive to look back at lists from years gone by to see just how dumb some of those acquisitions could have been. I mean, let’s say Apple had taken a pointer from Sorkin’s in 2012 and bought Twitter or Dave Morin’s apocalyptic failure Path—would that really have helped the company in any significant way going forward? Buying Research in Motion (the company now known as BlackBerry) could have given Apple access to some in-car tech through QNX, but why do that when you can just hire the guy who created QNX and many of his team members (which Apple did in 2016). So no, Apple does not “need” to buy Netflix, Tesla, Disney, Pandora, Sonos, Twitter, Hulu, 21st Century Fox or anything else. It might! But not because you said so.

According to a report Thursday from Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes, the semiconductor foundry has successfully resolved initial manufacturing issues in the company’s ten-nanometer FinFET process technology. “TSMC has begun 10nm chip production for Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 series,” sources told the publication. “Production was once affected by issues involving stacking components in the backend integrated fan-out packaging process, but they have already been solved.” TSMC is Apple’s exclusive manufacturer of the in-house designed 16-nanometer A10 Fusion chip for the iPhone 7 series. TSMC’s new ten-nanometer process should yield smaller chips that run faster and consume less energy. TSMC has also secured 12-nanometer chip orders (a smaller version of its 16nm technology) from Nvidia, MediaTek, Silicon Motion Technology and HiSilicon. As for TSMC’s 10nm process, the node technology has obtained orders from Apple, MediaTek and HiSilicon, as per sources.

Could this technology mean millions more? (Photo: The Motley Fool) 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE What would you do if you could see the future? If you’re like me, you’d use that knowledge to become one of the richest people on the planet. And more than a decade ago a Japanese businessman, Masayoshi Son, got as close as you can get to seeing the future by scoring a secret meeting with Apple founder Steve Jobs. The two discussed the prospect of an Apple phone and what it could look like. So impressed by Son's vision, Jobs agreed to give him exclusive rights to sell Apple’s phone in Japan – if ever released! Fast-forward to today: Son is now the richest person in Japan. You see, getting a sneak-peek at what's inside Apple’s secretive design lab can be as good as seeing the future. Well, it appears Apple is up to something again, but this time it’s so radically different from its previous “iDevices" that you’ll be stunned. In fact, Apple leased an enormous, 5,000-acre, abandoned military base to serve as testing grounds for this new technology. But while the masses are focusing on Apple’s stake in this coming tech tidal wave, our analysts believe they’ve found a small company that could play a drastically larger role in this field, and it’s only 1/12th the size of Apple. Think about how much more room it has to grow! This modest company is sitting on a gold mine of patents and intellectual property that’s absolutely critical in this new field. Nearly every other company in this new industry will have to pay it to use its technology. Cisco believes this tech will be a $19 trillion market before 2025. General Electric sees an opportunity bigger than the entire economy of China! <!--iframe--> Did you miss Apple stock’s 1,092% run-up since it introduced the iPhone ten short years ago? That kind of performance turned $10,000 invested before its launch into $119,236 today! I missed it, and it’s killing me. If you’re anything like me, you want another chance at fortune-making gains like that.

This suggests that, despite other reports that the iPhone 8 is delayed due to issues with some of the phone's expected components, some parts of the manufacturing process are moving along as planned. DigiTimes said on Thursday that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company started production of the new advanced chips for Apple's iPhone 8, following a few reported setbacks related to how the processor was stacked inside the phone. DigiTimes has an on-again-off-again track record, but typically has good insight into movements within Apple's supply chain. The report doesn't mention Apple's two other expected devices, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, by name. However, those devices are also expected to pack Apple's next-generation chip. All three phones are expected to launch this year, though recent reports have suggested Apple's high-end iPhone 8 is facing delays. KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this week production delays related to new OLED panels and 3D sensors could present a "worst-case scenario" of iPhone 8 shortages later this year. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are still expected sometime in September, when Apple typically launches its new iPhones.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple continues Work on Siri within Messages to assist users in Noisy Environments and more | Main | AI Wars are almost reaching Fever Pitch with new Home Devices and Apple Fans look to WWDC 2017 for Apple's Response » May 11, 2017 LG Innotek to Supply Apple with World's First 3D Facial Recognition Camera for the iPhone 8 In January 2016 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Snaps Up Yet More Talent in the Area of Facial Recognition with their Acquisition of Emotient" Then in February 2017 we learned that Apple acquired another facial recognition company based in Israel called RealFace. Apple began working on facial recognition back in 2011 with their first two patents (one & two) on this feature being published by the U.S. Patent Office in 2012. After hearing rumors about Apple possibly adopting facial recognition for the iPhone 8, we're now learning that LG Innotek, the parts unit of LG Group, will supply facial recognition camera modules for the upcoming iPhone, tentatively called the iPhone 8.   The report said the company's new facility investment worth 269.7 billion won (US$238.50 million) that was announced on April 27 will be dedicated to Apple's orders. The initial deal size is estimated at about 200 billion won (US$177 million).   Apple and LG Innotek, the market leader in the smartphone camera module market, teamed up last year to develop the world's first 3-D facial recognition camera system that can be used for a variety of applications from biometric authentication to games.   LG Innotek supplies rear-facing dual-lens camera module for the iPhone 7 and LG G6. The upcoming facial recognition module will be front-facing and smaller than the current one. That's why the company plans to build a new plant for the production.   By following Apple's patents over the years, it's always great to read about an idea that Apple is working on and then over time see Apple's various teams advance the idea and then finally see the idea come to life is very satisfying. If the new feature hits the iPhone in Q4 2017, then we'll likely see it come to the iPad and Macs in 2018. On Macs it'll be able to match Microsoft's Windows Hello Windows feature. The difference is that few PC companies actually implement this feature. With Apple, the camera is likely to be on most products within 18-24 months.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The Finnish startup posted this news to their website adding that users personal data will be collected, used and disclosed under the Apple Privacy Policy.     The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.   The Finland-based company was founded in 2007 and in late 2015 they launched their products in Apple stores. Their latest product, Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor, automatically tracks your sleep and works with the Beddit app on your iPhone or iPad to help you achieve better sleep.   The Beddit sensor, priced at $150, is placed under the sheet on top of the mattress. It senses and automatically begins tracking when you lie down on the bed collecting and analyzing sleep-related data such as sleep time and efficiency, heart rate, respiration, temperature, movement, snoring, room temperature, and room humidity.     We don't expect Apple to start manufacturing similar products anytime soon, but Beddit might provide them important data. They could also use this technology to incorporate it into the Apple Watch. NEWS SOURCES:Reuters.com Recommended for You HTC reports 9% revenue decline in April, 6.4% drop...

Reuters/Dado Ruvic A couple of the world’s best smartphones go head to head as the Apple iPhone 7 Plus takes on the new Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus in a battery performance showdown. The iOS handset has the biggest iPhone battery yet while the new Galaxy S series addition packs in less power than its predecessor. Read on and find out which phone lasts longer. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus - Battery specs and features The 6.2-inch Samsung handset houses a 3,500 mAh non-removable lithium ion cell. Despite the robust battery, though, the S8 Plus is only able to last a whole day with moderate use. It can extend for a little longer, but the phone must be under certain settings – like reduced brightness, lowered resolution and/or a turned off Always-On Display option – for that to happen. According to Trusted Reviews, native video watching with the Video Enhancer turned on eats through the phone’s battery rather quickly. The new Galaxy handset may need to be charged every night, although customisation and battery-saving modes do a good job of extending battery life. Just like its predecessor, the S8 Plus makes use of the South Korean tech titan’s own Adaptive Charging instead of Qualcomm’s Quick Charge. It takes the phone an hour and 40 minutes to be fully charged from zero. Wireless charging support is available, although it extends charging time by another half hour. Apple iPhone 7 Plus - Battery specs and features The latest 5.5-inch iPhone is powered by a 2,900 mAh non-removable lithium ion battery, which is able to provide up to 21 hours of phone calls and 60 hours of music playback. With moderate use, the Apple flagship can last up to two days before wearing out. Compared to previous iPhone models, the 7 Plus lasts significantly longer thanks to the latest energy-efficient A10 Fusion chipset inside. Unfortunately for users that are into wireless charging, the Apple handset has no such feature. The 7 Plus also has no fast charging support. The smartphone can take more than three hours to reach 100 percent battery level from zero. Unfortunately, the iPhone 7 Plus has no wireless charging support. No fast charging feature is also available on the latest Apple flagship. The iPhone 7 Plus can take over three hours to be fully charged from nil. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus – Battery performance test When TechRadar put the new Galaxy smartphone in a chain of rigorous battery performance tests that included 90 minutes each of web browsing, gaming, YouTube playback and native video watching, the Samsung handset did a great job. After six hours of work, the S8 Plus still had 18 percent battery life. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, didn’t even complete the third task when it experienced the same undertaking. The Apple flagship was thoroughly exhausted before the gaming test was done and finished with a total performance time of four hours and 20 minutes.

The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple’s plans to build a $4 million shipping and receiving warehouse on a vacant lot in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. “We’re excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data center and supporting facilities,” Apple spokesman John Rosenstock said in an email to The Associated Press. “As part of our growth, we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs.” Last week, Apple announced a new $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, but provided few details. As part of a strategy emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, it also released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work – more than half in California’s Silicon Valley. Apple currently has more than 700 workers in Nevada, which Rosentock said is home to the company’s largest solar investment, “powering our data center with clean energy.” The 5-year-old $1 billion data center is located in the Reno Technology Center near the Tracy generating station along U.S. Interstate 80. It’s between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla’s giant battery factory is based about 15 miles (24 km) east of Reno-Sparks. Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data center in 2012. Gov. Brian Sandoval said it was “the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map.” “Apple’s decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home,” he said in a statement Wednesday. The Reno Gazette-Journal reported City Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the downtown land deal Wednesday, calling for an end to unfair tax deals for “some powerful, well-connected corporations and not the rest of us.” Mayor Hillary Schieve and Councilman Paul McKenzie said the whole city will benefit from the developments. “Apple doesn’t just pay, they offer a living wage,” McKenzie said.

Windows 10 is now running on a half-billion devices nearly two years after its release, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed Wednesday during the software maker’s annual conference for applications programmers. That figure is up from 400 million eight months ago, but far short of Microsoft’s goal of putting Windows 10 on 1 billion devices by 2018. The Redmond, Washington, company had already acknowledged it won’t reach that goal in time . Windows 10 represents a comeback for Microsoft after the colossal flop of Windows 8, whose ill-conceived designed deepened a decline in PC sales and contributed to the departure of Nadella’s predecessor, Steve Ballmer. Although it has been easing recently, the PC slump still hasn’t ended. People are increasingly connecting to digital services, checking email and performing other computing tasks on devices powered by Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android instead of Microsoft’s Windows. That’s one the prime reasons Microsoft has been eclipsed by both Apple and Google in the technology industry’s pecking order after dominating throughout the 1990s. Microsoft tried to piggyback on the trend by expanding into smartphones, but those attempts have mostly flopped. It’s the reason Microsoft cites for failing to meet its 1 billion goal in time. Its Surface tablet has done better, but even that product has hit rough patches. Microsoft blamed disappointing Surface sales for a revenue shortfall in its most recent years. As consumers have embraced smartphones, Microsoft increasingly is building its products with business and government agencies in mind, said Gartner analyst Ed Anderson. But Microsoft is still hoping to win over consumers with its digital servant, Cortana, a rival to Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Earlier this week, Microsoft unveiled an internet-connected speaker featuring Cortana in a partnership with Samsung’s Harman Kardon. Microsoft also announced Wednesday that both Intel and HP plan to implant Cortana in upcoming devices, but didn’t provide any further details. Microsoft encouraged programmers Wednesday to design applications that help Cortana do whatever people might want. Both Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home devices are striving to do the same thing.

With many of its competitors putting out octa-core and even deca-core powered phones with as much as 6GB of RAM, Apple’s iPhones at least on paper seem rather “slow” by comparison. However if speed tests are anything to go by, Apple’s iPhones are actually no slouch, especially the iPhone 7 which has managed to blow away the competition in 2016 thanks to its A10 chipset. It is expected that Apple will use a newer chipset for its iPhones later this year and thanks to a report from DigiTimes (via 9to5Mac), it seems that the production of the A11 chipset has already begun. The report claims that TSMC has already started its production of the A11 chipset using the 10nm manufacturing process. It also seems that TSMC will be the sole provider of the A11 chipsets, whereas in the past Apple has sourced from other companies simultaneously, such as with Samsung. It is unclear as to what kind of specs we are looking at with the A11, but presumably it should be faster, more powerful, and more efficient than its predecessor, but we guess we’ll just have to wait for the official benchmarks to find out. Apple’s new iPhones are expected to be announced later this year, but there are some rumors that the iPhone 8 could be delayed, although that remains to be seen. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

Facebook, Or That Social Media ETF? May 08, 2017 Drew Voros Last week, the $774 billion gorilla in the room, Apple, announced its quarterly earnings, and before they reported its typical monster numbers, there were the stories that have become almost routine, such as, “ETFs To Play If You’re Bullish On Apple.” I’m sure we here at ETF.com have been guilty of going down that road, being all-ETF, but placing blind faith into that kind of tunnel vision isn’t always the right move. While passive investing has been proven to be superior over time to stock picking, time frames are important. However, if you’re truly bullish on Apple, shouldn’t you just buy its stock, and move on from trying to figure out which ETF is the best for your bullish Apple feelings? That’s a good question, with no clear answer—unless there's a time line. The general tech sector is a tougher nut to crack in terms of picking winners, and certainly Apple has seen some backsliding in the past, so holding, say, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) rather than being all-in on Apple might make sense—again, depending on your time line. Apple is burning up the performance charts this year, and no doubt contributed to the returns of XLK as its top holding, at 15%. But as reflected in the chart above, XLK is lagging Apple’s year-to-date gain by almost half. The two-year chart of Apple versus XLK, though, tells a different story. XLK is up 34% to Apple’s gain of 22% That’s the thing with tracking performance of any investment: What time frame are you viewing it through?   1 2 3 next last View Full Article   Equity Technology Sectors   Find your next ETF Asset Class: All Asset ClassesAlternativesAsset AllocationCommoditiesCurrencyEquityFixed Income Region: All RegionsAsia-PacificDeveloped MarketsEmerging MarketsEuropeFrontier MarketsGlobalGlobal Ex-U.S.Latin AmericaMiddle East & AfricaNorth America Geography: All GeographiesAfricaArgentinaAsia & Gulf RegionAsia-PacificAsia-Pacific Ex-JapanAustraliaAustriaBelgiumBrazilCaliforniaCanadaChileChinaColombiaDenmarkDeveloped Asia-PacificDeveloped Asia-Pacific Ex-JapanDeveloped EuropeDeveloped MarketsDeveloped Markets Ex-JapanDeveloped Markets Ex-U.S.EgyptEmerging Asia-PacificEmerging EuropeEmerging MarketsEmerging Middle East & AfricaEurozoneFinlandFranceFrontier MarketsFrontier Middle East & AfricaGermanyGlobalGlobal Ex-U.S.GreeceHong KongIndiaIndonesiaIrelandIsraelItalyJapanLatin AmericaMalaysiaMexicoNetherlandsNew YorkNew ZealandNigeriaNordicNorth AmericaNorwayPakistanPeruPhilippinesPolandPortugalQatarRussiaSaudi ArabiaSingaporeSouth AfricaSouth KoreaSoutheast AsiaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandTaiwanThailandTurkeyU.K.U.S.United Arab EmiratesVietnam Category: All CategoriesAbsolute ReturnsAgricultureAsset AllocationAustralian DollarBasket - Emerging MarketsBasket - Global Ex-USBrazilian RealBroad MarketCanadian DollarChinese RenminbiCorporateEnergyEuroGovernment/CreditHigh Dividend YieldIndian RupeeIndustrial MetalsJapanese YenMunicipalsPound SterlingPrecious MetalsSectorSingapore DollarSize and StyleSovereignSwedish KronaSwiss FrancTactical ToolsU.S. Government Focus: All FocusAgenciesAgency MBSAluminumAsia & Gulf RegionAsset-backedAustralian DollarBasic MaterialsBasket - Global Ex-USBrazilian RealBroad MarketBuild America BondsCanadian DollarCarbon CreditsChinese RenminbiCocoaCoffeeConsumer CyclicalsConsumer Non-cyclicalsConvertiblesCopperCornCottonCrude OilDeveloped MarketsEmerging MarketsEnergyEuroExtended MarketFinancialsGasolineGlobal MacroGoldGrainsHealth CareHeating OilHigh Dividend YieldHigh YieldIndian RupeeIndustrialsInflation-ProtectedInvestment GradeJapanese YenLarge CapLeadLivestockLong/ShortMetalsMicro CapMid CapNatural GasNickelPalladiumPlatinumPound SterlingPreferred StockReal EstateSilverSingapore DollarSmall CapSoftsSoybeansSpreadsSugarSwedish KronaSwiss FrancTIPSTarget OutcomeTarget RiskTechnologyTelecommunicationsThemeTinTotal MarketTreasuryUtilitiesVRDOVolatilityWheat Niche: All NichesAerospace & DefenseAggressiveAgricultureAutosBanking and Investment ServicesBanksBiotechBroad MaturitiesBroad-basedCapital AppreciationCasinos / GamingCoalCommunications EquipmentConservativeConstant WeightConstruction & EngineeringConsumerDerivativeEnvironmentEuro STOXX 50 Short-TermFinancial ServicesFloating RateFood and BeverageFront MonthGold MinersGrowthHealth Care Equipment & SuppliesHealth Care Providers & ServicesHedge Fund ReplicationHomebuildingIn SpecieIncomeInflationInfrastructureInsuranceIntermediateInternetLadderedLeisure & RecreationLong-TermLong/Short Broad-basedLong/Short CommoditiesLong/Short CurrencyLong/Short EquityLong/Short VolatilityLow CorrelationMLPsMedia & PublishingMerger ArbitrageMetals & MiningModerateMortgagesNatural GasNatural ResourcesNuclear EnergyOil & GasOil & Gas Equipment & ServicesOil & Gas Exploration & ProductionOptimizedPharmaceuticalsPhones & Handheld DevicesPhysically HeldPrivate EquityRenewable EnergyRestaurants & BarsRetailS&P 500 Mid-TermS&P 500 Short-TermSecond MonthSemiconductorsShippingShort-TermSilver MinersSoftwareSteelTactical Asset AllocationTechnology EquipmentThird MonthTimberToys & GamesTransportationTrend-FollowingUltra-Short TermValueVariableWaterYield Curve CLEAR FILTER SHOW RESULTS Related ETFs Ticker Name YTD% XLK Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund 15.19% SOCL Global X Social Media ETF 27.98% Related ETF Channels Equity, Global, Global X, North America, S&P Technology Select Sector Index, SPDR, Sectors, State Street Global Advisors, Technology, U.S. View the discussion thread.

"We will continue to expand our development, and optimize the business environment. China has a huge market and lots of talent, it is the best investment place for expanding manufacturing,” Li is reported to have said during the visit. Read: Apple iPhones Made In America Could Cost $100-200 More Than China-Made Devices: Analyst Foxconn did not reveal much about the visit, but said in a statement to Reuters Wednesday that the company was “committed to investing” in China. Li’s cozying up to Foxconn follows Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou’s visit to the U.S. in January, when he revealed that the company was considering investing $7 billion towards a U.S.-based display production plant. But, when Gou was asked last month about the plant, he said that he was feeling concerned about manufacturing displays in the U.S. due to the lack of government incentives, labor issues and supply chain hurdles. He did, however meet President Donald Trump towards the end of the month to discuss job creation and investment in the U.S. Li’s visit comes at a time, when manufacturers are seeking alternative avenues for production, due to increased labor costs in the country. Foxconn has already set up a plant in India, where it makes phones for many brands. Apple, whose iPhones are majorly manufactured by Foxconn, recently invested 1 billion in Japanese firm SoftBank’s $1 billion fund, aimed at creating 50,000 jobs in the U.S. Trump has aggressively pursued his campaign promise to get companies to manufacture in the U.S. many companies, including Foxconn, have promised to invest in the country, but the focus has leaned towards high-tech jobs rather than supply chain or manufacturing jobs. His major focus has been Apple. He said in an interview in January, that Apple CEO Tim Cook had told him that the company had its “eyes open” to manufacturing in the U.S. The experts disagree that mass market products such as iPhones could be manufactured in the U.S. at competitive prices. According to Analyst Brian White, who heads the technology hardware and software department at Drexel Hamilton, a New York City institutional brokerage firm, even if Apple sets up the infrastructure to manufacture in the U.S., the iPhones made in the country will still end up costing at least $100-200 more. Read: Will Apple Make iPhones In India? Furthermore, shifting production out of China might not be easy, especially for tech companies such as Foxconn, since manufacturing a device such as an iPhone requires a cluster of suppliers at the same place along with the ease of importing material from abroad. The U.S. doesn’t have any such system in place at the current moment, nor has Trump revealed any plan for one. He had, however, said in his campaign speech that he might impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese-made goods — a move he is yet to act on.

This is good news for fans who are hoping for the next-generation iPhones, especially iPhone 8, to launch on time despite the previous issues the manufacturer faced with the 10nm chip.  Just this Thursday, DigiTimes got insider information about the operations of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which is the sole supplier of Apple’s A11 chips. “TSMC has begun 10nm chip production for Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 series,” the sources told the publication. The sources then pointed out that production of the powerful processor was previously affected by issues pertaining to the “stacking components in the backened integrated fan-out packaging process.”  Previous reports stated that TSMC was going to start producing the A11 chips in April, so that it would have created 50 million units by July. But this plan fell through due to problems with the manufacturing process. This appears to be what the industry sources are referencing in their latest update. Fortunately, it’s clear now that the problems have already been addressed since the Taiwanese company has commenced production of Apple’s new processor. READ: Apple launching 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 at WWDC? According to MacRumors, the A11 processor is expected to be the one to power the first OLED handset from the tech giant, which is currently rumored to be called as “iPhone 8.” The Apple-centric news site also indicated that the new 10nm chip could also be the same processor that Tim Cook’s company will be using for the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus — the “s” upgrades of last year’s models. It’s also possible that Apple would use the same chip for the rumored iPad refreshes this year. Since the start of this year, multiple reports, leaks and schematics have emerged online, and most are suggesting that the next-generation flagship iPhone would be a major redesign compared to last year’s iPhone 7. Just yesterday, we reported about a factory leak that appears to confirm what other sources and tipsters have been saying so far. The leaked material apparently shows an iPhone that has an edge-to-edge OLED display, an all-glass black panel and a vertically aligned dual-camera module. All of these design elements are strongly linked to the rumored and highly anticipated iPhone 8.    It is not surprising that TSMC is the sole maker of the A11 chips for the next-generation iPhones. The world’s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry was also the one that built the A10 chips found on the very successful iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models from last year. Even in the first quarter of this year, the success of the two handsets cannot be ignored. The iPhone 7 shipped 21.5 million units, while the iPhone 7 Plus shipped 17.4 million units within the first three months of 2017, AppleInsider reported this Thursday citing data collected by Strategy Analytics.  READ: Why Apple is choosing Lightning over USB-C for iPhone 8 Meanwhile, aside from Apple, TSMC is also producing 10nm chips for MediaTek and HiSilicon. DigiTimes sources revealed that the Taiwanese company has just obtained orders from the fabless semiconductor companies. The sources added that MediaTek originally planned to come up with the X30 and P35 10nm chips, but the latter was canceled because of the underwhelming support from its major clients.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → MacPaw Unveils Apple Collection, Including Tekserve Items  May 11, 2017May 11, 2017 ⌘ Permalink For 29 years, New York City’s Tekserve was the hub for Mac nerds in the Big Apple. Here is Rick Rojas in The New York Times: Tekserve found its niche in an era when Apple had a much smaller slice of the computer market. Among many of Tekserve’s customers then, Apple computers had a devoted following. “It was the cult of Mac,” said Mr. Gepner, who, before running Tekserve, was a regular customer. He said that customers had gravitated to Tekserve to buy Apple computers, have them serviced or have questions about them answered at a time when computers were more cumbersome to use and help was not simply a Google search away. “It was also a gathering place,” Mr. Gepner said, “where knowledge was shared.” The shop opened up in 1987, just three years after the original Macintosh was introduced. It survived The Very Dark Times of the 1990s, and held its ground as Apple opened more and more retail locations. Its customer base — and the rent bill — were changing, and not for the better. A hallmark of the company’s retail space was its collection of Apple hardware, as Darren Orf at Gizmodo showed off in August of 2016: “We were the un-Apple Store,” [co-founder, Dick Demenus] told Gizmodo in a live interview. “At the Apple Store, everything is new, glitzy, and shiny. We liked to reflect history.” That history—including typewriters, radios, victrolas, cameras, microphones, old IBM programs, phonographs, Coke machines, and a 35-piece collection of Macintosh computers lovingly named the “Mac Museum”—is now on sale. The extensive Apple collection went up for auction. There were some amazing pieces in it, and I hoped at the time that it went to a good home. I can report that is indeed the case. Today, its new caretaker has been announced: MacPaw. The software company is known for products like Setapp and CleanMyMac, and is an active participant in the Mac community at large. As shown in the video, the collection is now at home in a beautiful display at MacPaw’s Ukrainian office: image courtesy of MacPaw #officegoals The company is taking time to restore some of the pieces to working order, and a working space for repairs can be seen in the video. Oleksandr Kosovan, the company’s CEO, said: Apple changed my life in many ways. Driven by Steve’s vision for better and simpler products I was able to implement these ideas in our products development. I cannot say thank Apple enough other than paying this great tribute to the history of iconic Apple products by setting up a Museum. Kosovan bought the collection in secret, before it could be split up into smaller auctions. The MacPaw Museum now boasts 70 pieces, 39 of which came from Tekserve. While it’s not open to the public, the company hopes to continue to grow it in the future. I think what MacPaw has done here is pretty special. No company needs a badass collection of Macs adorning a wall in their office, but that’s not the point of something like this, is it?

Technology Park, spending an additional $1 billion to build and equip the campus in coming years. RENO, Nev. — Apple easily won approval from the Reno City Council on Wednesday for a new agreement allowing it to take advantage of millions of dollars in sales tax abatements as it works to double the size of its massive data center east of Reno. Only Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the agreement that will allow Apple to buy land in downtown Reno instead of lease it to be eligible for a tax break that will bring its sales tax rate down to 0.5%. Popular Searches Macy's Inc M ▼ 24.35 -4.99 -17.01% Telstra Corp Ltd TLSYY ▼ 16.19 -0.24 -1.46% CA Inc CA ▼ 32.04 -0.23 -0.71% Inventure Foods Inc SNAK ▲ 4.01 +0.37 +10.16% The vote came moments after Apple executive Mike Foulkes announced Apple will invest another $1 billion in expanding its data center at the Reno Technology Park in the Truckee River canyon east of Sparks. "We’re excited to announce Apple will be increasing our investment by an additional $1 billion," Foulkes said, saying it will bring "hundreds of jobs in operations and construction." Apple needs the expanded data center to meet its soaring iCloud storage demands. The announcement is the latest in a string of technology company expansions in Northern Nevada, which is becoming home to a thriving data storage industry. Last month, Google purchased 1,210 acres of land at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center for nearly $29.1 million, according to documents filed with Storey County last Friday. Northern Nevada also attracted two high profile data center projects last year. Switch’s SuperNAP colocation data center at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is planned to be the largest data center facility in the world once finished. Apple is also set to get a new neighbor with cloud services company Rackspace planning to build a data center at Reno Technology Park. Apple's original $1 billion data center was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements in 2012. The value of those abatements will increase with the expansion of the data center. Because of a quirk in state law, the state can abate all but 2 percent of the sales tax rate paid by Apple on the computer equipment needed for its data center. Load Error As part of Wednesday's deal, however, Apple will build a warehouse on land in downtown Reno that's part of a tourism improvement district created in 2009. By moving the computer equipment needed for the data center through that warehouse, it will be able to chip another 1.5 percent off its sales tax rate. Foulkes said Apple plans to spend $4 million on the warehouse. "We think it will be the most beautiful building in that corridor," he said. Usually Apple does not put signage on "high security buildings," but Foulkes said the company will make an exception for the downtown warehouse to appease the Reno City Council. Council members hope the Apple warehouse will spur additional development in the downtrodden corner of downtown known as the Tessera District. Rather than a nondescript warehouse, they want it to advertise that Apple is a downtown business. The Tessera developers originally planned a $350 million mixed-use development that would includes hotels, retail shops and office buildings. Partner Steve Polikalas said that vision has changed after the recession. Tessera developers now hope to develop an "innovation district" that is home to technology and research companies that want to be close to the University of Nevada, Reno. Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve applauded Apple's decision to build in downtown Reno, noting the company helped spur a rapid expansion of technology companies in Northern Nevada. Brekhus, an outspoken opponent of tax abatements, disagreed. She questioned whether the 2012 city council abused its discretion is approving a tourism tax abatement for a warehouse. She wanted to halt the agreement, noting Nevada residents have had to bear tax increases that will be abated for Apple under the old agreement. "Let's send the message...that we are ending this unfair advantage of tax deals for some powerful, well-connected corporations and not for the rest of us," Brekhus said. Nevada's economic development director Steve Hill said the council was powerless to change the tax abatement deal. Even if the council hadn't approved the change from a lease to a sale for the downtown land, Apple still would have been eligible for the tax break. "Nothing that you would do today would change the agreement from five years ago," Hill said. Councilman Paul McKenzie, who also has been a vocal critic of tax abatements, said he probably would have opposed the deal five years ago. But since then, he said the construction of the Apple data center kept many construction workers employed with a "living wage" during the severe recession. "I can tell you and everybody listening today that I know a lot of guys wouldn’t have been eating the last five years if not for Apple," McKenzie said. "The gone to work on that project, made a living wage and fed their families. It’s been a true benefit to the community." Apple's expansion is expected to generate 100 permanent jobs and 300 construction jobs. The company already has about 717 employees in the state, mostly from its five retail stores. Gov. Brian Sandoval praised the expansion announcement. “Apple was the first major economic development success in Northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map," he said in a statement. "Apple’s decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home.”   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Another Wireless Charging Patent comes to light covering the iPhone, MacBook & more | Main | LG Innotek to Supply Apple with World's First 3D Facial Recognition Camera for the iPhone 8 » May 11, 2017 Apple continues Work on Siri within Messages to assist users in Noisy Environments and more   Apple's first patent application regarding Siri working with Messages surfaced back in November 2016 in our report titled "Apple Patent Shows Siri being used in an iMessage Thread to Send Funds to a Friend using Apple Pay." Today, the U.S. Patent Office revealed more of Apple's work on Siri for Messages where users could interact with Siri via Messages if they're in a quite library or in a very noisy environment and still get Siri's assistance and more.   Apple's patent FIG. 3 published in November and noted above shows us a method of an iPhone utilizing Siri to assist with a communication session; In FIGS. 6A-6E noted above we're able to see a full example of Siri assisting participants of a communication session to complete a financial transaction.   In today's patent application regarding Siri on Messages we learn the following:   "It can be desirable to implement a digital assistant in a messaging environment. The messaging platform can enable multiple modes of input (e.g., text, audio, images, video, etc.) to be sent and received.   A user request can thus define a request to the digital assistant using a combination of inputs (e.g., image and text). As described herein, this can increase the functionality and capabilities of the digital assistant, thereby providing a richer interactive experience between a user and a digital assistant.   In addition, the messaging platform is a visual interface which permits interactions in a broader range of environments than voice/audio based platforms. A digital assistant in a message environment can thus enable greater accessibility to the digital assistant.   In particular, Siri (the digital assistant) can be accessible in noisy environments or in environments where audio output is not desired (e.g., the library).   Further, the messaging platform can be a conversational interface where short concise communications are exchanged between two or more parties and presented in a chronological format.   A digital assistant in a message environment can thus enable the digital assistant to be a participant in a multi-party conversation where the benefits associated with the digital assistant can be shared among the multiple participants.   Moreover, the chronological format enables a user to conveniently review previous interactions with the digital assistant and utilize the contextual history associated with the previous interactions to define a wider range of tasks.   In the example illustrated in FIG. 12G below, the media object displayed in message #1214 (e.g., at block 1106) can be an audio clip of a media item (e.g., a song, movie, soundtrack, etc.). In the present example, the audio clip can be a sung portion of the United States national anthem. The text of the second user input displayed in message #1216 (e.g., at block 1112) can be a request to perform a search based on the song corresponding to the audio clip (e.g., "What's this song?", "Who sang this?", "When was this song released?", etc.). Based on the audio clip and the text, it can be determined at block #1114 that the user intent includes performing audio recognition on the media item to identify the song in the audio clip. In this example, a determination can be obtained at block #1132 that the user intent requires performing audio processing (e.g., audio recognition) on the media object. In response to obtaining a determination that the user intent requires performing audio processing on the media object, block #1134 can be performed.   As shown in Apple's patent FIG. 12H above, the media object of block #1106 can be a picture of a bottle of wine (e.g., displayed as message 1220) and the text of block #1110 (e.g., displayed as message 1222) can define the user's opinion or preference for the wine (e.g., "I like this wine" or "This wine has vivid flavors of ground spice with hints of raspberry fruit and lemon zest"). In another example, the media object can be a picture of the parking space number at which the user parked his or her car and the text of block can indicate that the user parked at the location associated with the contents of the media object (e.g., "I parked here."). In the examples described above, it can be determined that the user intent is to store data that associated the defined attribute to the media object for future retrieval. Based on this user intent, it can be determined at block #1132 that the user intent does not require performing audio processing on the media object. In response to obtaining a determination that the user intent does not require performing audio processing on the media object, the electronic device can cause an action to be performed at block #1140 in accordance with the user intent of block #1114.   Apple's patent application 20170132019 was filed back in May 2016. For more details about this invention, click here. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

The stock dropped 10 percent in Hong Kong, wiping out HK$14.2 billion ($1.8 billion) of market value. Gotham, founded by New York-based Daniel Yu, questioned AAC’s profit margins and alleged that the company engaged in undisclosed transactions with related parties that aren’t listed in Apple’s supplier list. Share this story File image Before today, AAC was this year’s best-performing stock on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index with a 58 percent gain. "We’re intrigued by it because its margins are higher, smoother than some of the best companies in the world,” Yu said in a phone interview. “In my experience, that usually means that the company is a truly world-changing, excellent, high-competitive company or something else. And based on our investigation, we think the facts support the latter possibility." AAC denied the allegations, calling the report “inaccurate and misleading.” The company is seeking legal advice and reserves the right to take action, it said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange. The Shenzhen-based producer of miniaturized speakers and receivers for mobile phones is scheduled to report results for the three months ended March on Friday. Apple couldn’t immediately comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Some analysts questioned Gotham’s conclusions. BOC International Holdings Ltd.’s Tony Zhang, who has a buy rating on AAC, called the report “groundless” and said many of Apple suppliers enjoy high profit margins. His critique was echoed by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.’s David Dai. “I read the report,” said Dai, who has a market perform recommendation on AAC. “There is no hard evidence there, only speculation.” This is Gotham’s first target in Asia. Named after the city where comic-book hero Batman fights crime, Gotham began publicly betting against companies after Yu got burned by an investment in mortgage lender Freddie Mac in 2008. The firm’s report on Quindell Plc triggered a 39 percent one-day drop in the UK technology firm in April 2014, while its July 2014 report on Let’s Gowex SA preceded the Spanish Wi-Fi provider’s filing for insolvency and its CEO resigning after admitting he reported false financial results for at least four years. Earnings Uncertainty Shares in Gotham’s most recent target, Aurelius Equity Opportunities SE, have fallen about 28 percent in Frankfurt since Gotham published a 68-page note in March questioning the company’s accounting. The German firm, which provides loans to distressed companies, has said that Gotham’s allegations were unfounded, and that Gotham’s report primarily consists of “manipulation of facts known and already published.” Short sellers based in the US are increasingly turning their attention to companies listed in Asia. Carson Block’s Muddy Waters said in December it was betting against its first Japanese target, the precision motor maker Nidec Corp. Muddy Waters published a report on China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co. later that month. Read also: Apple takes on SA-based reseller over trademarks Huishan Dairy’s shares have been frozen since they tumbled 85 percent on March 24, and Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission on Monday took the rare step of saying the stock can’t resume trading without its approval. Gotham said it plans to publish more reports on AAC “in the near future.” Yu declined to provide further details on timing. The outlook for AAC’s shares will depend on the company’s success in responding to Gotham’s allegations, said Ben Kwong, executive director at KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Some investors are skeptical of their earnings after the report, while some are finding excuse to sell after share price has gone up a lot,” Kwong said. “No one likes uncertainty.” Bloomberg Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Brian Molefe to return to head Eskom 2 Arrested pastor’s posh Durban den of sin 3 Large swells shut KZN beaches 4 #RIPKarabo: He killed and burned my daughter, says dad 5 Family gets R35 000 ransom demand for #CourtneyPeters Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

How to stop macOS Photos from re-uploading all your images and videos Video Can the iPhone make better AR than Facebook and Snapchat? | The iPhone Show Regina Bell has a conflict set of needs relative to how Apple structures photo storage and cloud-based sync and access: My iPad is running out of storage space. If I move photos to an external drive and delete the original photos from Photos, will they still be accessed by iCloud? She’d also like to keep her photos in an iCloud Photo Library, but separate out the pictures she takes on her iPad. You might not get quite what you want here using only Apple products, but you could reach the right solution with Google or Amazon. The first option is to use the optimized option for iCloud Photo Library. In Settings > iCloud > Photos flip the Optimize iPhone/iPad Storage switch to on. This allows iOS to dump the full-resolution version of images and videos once they’re uploaded if the storage is needed for your iOS device. That might be the solution you need, but with only 32GB on your iPad, you still might constantly push up against the limit even with thumbnails. While you can copy images from your iPad to a Mac's internal or external storage, you can’t access images from a drive (even a USB thumb drive with an adapter) from your iPad. And Apple only lets you sync a single Photos library on the Mac with iCloud Photo Library, no matter on which drives you store the libraries. What you could choose is not to sync your iPad to iCloud Photo Library at all, but rather pick Google Photos or Amazon Drive, both of which have solid iOS apps and use inexpensive or free cloud storage and can upload media automatically as you create it. Amazon Prime customers get unlimited photo storage and 5GB of video (and other file) storage at no cost; that’s $12 a year for everyone else. Unlimited storage for everything is $60 for all customers. Google includes unlimited photo and video service if you agree to let it downsample images above 16 megapixels and videos above 1080p. Otherwise, you get 15GB across its mail, drive, and photo services, and can pay for additional storage. Once uploaded, the Google and Amazon apps don’t delete the media from your iOS device; you still have to manage that part. But you can then view all your uploaded pictures and movies from Google and Amazon iOS apps and websites. Google and Amazon’s apps act more like a view into cloud storage instead of a sync service, so the amount of data consumed on your device is relatively little.

Because Apple provided only rudimentary patent figures, it simply appeared to be a patent covering the Apple Watch charger and that's why I didn't cover it in April. However, when taking a closer look at the details this morning, I noticed that Apple clearly notes that the charger is for an iPhone and other devices. One part of the device that you think is the Apple Watch charger is actually a component that is to be incorporated within an iPhone or other Apple device as highlighted below.   Apple's patent FIG. 1A depicts a front perspective view of an example inductive power transfer system in an unmated configuration. The system may include an inductive power receiver #104 and an inductive power transmitter #102.   In various implementations and embodiments, either or both of the inductive power transmitter and the inductive power receiver #104 may be included within or as a component of any kind or type of electronic device such as cell phones, smart phones, tablet computers, laptop computers, wearable devices, navigation devices, sports devices, health devices, medical devices, accessory devices, peripheral input devices, and so on.   For example, the inductive power receiver #104 may be included within the housing of a cellular telephone. In such an example, the inductive power receiver may be entirely or partially concealed by the housing of the cellular telephone.   In other examples, the inductive power receiver 104 may be included along a back surface of an electronic device. In still other embodiments, the inductive power receiver may be included as an accessory for an electronic device. For example, the inductive power receiver may also be included within a protective case for a cellular telephone.   Apple's patent application 20170110911 was filed back in December 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time. Apple has many patents on wireless charging and it's unknown which method that they'll eventually adopt. To review Apple's other concepts, see our Wireless Charging archive here.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Tested: The truth behind the MacBook Pro's 'terrible' battery life Review: MacBook Air 1.86GHz Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac The MacBook Air has been such a hit for Apple the past few years that even Microsoft is making one. Starting at $999, the Surface Laptop sure looks good–it’s got a MacBook Air price, a wedge shape, weighs 2.76 pounds, the latest Intel core i5 processor, and a high-resolution display. Given that Apple hasn’t updated the MacBook Air in ages, the Surface Laptop attacks Apple at a vulnerable spot right in the midst of a product transition. Well played by Microsoft, but if you look a bit closer it sure looks like Apple’s got the Surface Laptop surrounded. The $999 laptop If there’s any place that Microsoft has got Apple over a barrel, at least for the moment, it’s at what you can buy for $999. The processors in the MacBook Air are two generations behind those in the Surface Laptop, and the Air’s screen isn’t Retina. Pexels The MacBook Air is a great deal, but will never get a better screen. But look closer: The Air’s got 8GB of RAM to the Surface Laptop’s 4GB. Microsoft cut the base specs of the Surface Laptop to the bone to get it to $999, and Apple doesn’t seem to be willing to ship a computer with 4GB of RAM anymore. The Surface Laptop also only has a single USB 3 port, while the Air has two. And while the Surface Laptop’s Mini DisplayPort works fine with external displays, the MacBook Air’s pulls double duty as a Thunderbolt 2 port. Still, the Surface Laptop is a modern computer and the Air is a couple of years out of date. If there’s any glaring weakness in Apple’s laptop line, it’s the company’s inability (or refusal) to bring its new, updated MacBook models to within hailing distance of the $999 price of the MacBook Air. Until Apple can do that, I guess the MacBook Air will keep kicking around? At some point it seems like Apple will need to bite the bullet and make a MacBook available for $999 or $1099, just so it can send the Air to the graveyard at last. In the meantime, Microsoft is there–with a high-resolution screen, if not a whole lot of RAM. The MacBook versus the Surface Laptop The true successor of the MacBook Air is, of course, the MacBook. And at $1299, the MacBook and Surface Laptop are pretty similar. The MacBook is three-quarters of a pound lighter, though its Intel m5 processor isn’t as powerful as the i5 processor on the Surface Laptop. Both devices offer 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, onboard Intel graphics, and a choice of colors. The Surface Laptop’s got a slightly larger screen, while the MacBook’s is a slightly higher resolution. Jason Snell The single-port MacBook stacks up to the $1299 Surface Laptop pretty well.  These are very similar laptops, though Apple has traded some weight and thinness for some processor power. Each has a single USB port, though Microsoft’s port doesn’t need to double as a charging connector or video-out port. But Apple’s choice of USB-C makes it seem like a more forward-thinking design; Microsoft’s single USB–3 connector already seems old school. In the end, it’s clear that with a single refresh–an extra port here, a newer processor family there–the MacBook is more than a match for the Surface Laptop at $1299, unless you believe that most regular users would prefer an extra three-quarters of a pound in exchange for a little more processor power. I don’t, to be honest. The MacBook Pro versus the Surface Laptop Apple The MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar has a couple advantages over the Surface Laptop, but also a higher price.  Around $1499, things get even more interesting. Because Apple chose to brand its 13-inch laptop without a Touch Bar as a part of the MacBook Pro family, it’s easy to forget that it is in many ways also a successor to the MacBook Air. While the MacBook traded weight for processor power, the 13-inch MacBook Pro (without Touch Bar) kept the weight–but kept the processor power, too. Unfortunately, its similarities in terms of specs are a bit lost in the price tag, which is $500 higher than the starting price of the MacBook Air. Still, compare it to the Surface Laptop: With 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, it’s in the ballpark–albeit $200 more expensive than that $1299 Surface Laptop model. The specs are the same, the displays are similar, and the MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports with support for Thunderbolt 3. Apple’s advantages When comparing Macs to PCs it’s easy to lose track of the biggest differentiator–Macs run macOS, and PCs run Windows. The fact is, if you prefer to run Windows, the Surface Laptop appears to be a great piece of hardware to run it on. If you prefer macOS–well, only Apple’s laptops will do that, and that’s part of their appeal. Jorge Arzac/IDG The Surface Laptop comes in four colors: Burgundy, Platinum, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gold. It is interesting that the Surface Laptop runs Windows 10 S, a variant of Windows 10 that will only run software that appears in the Windows App Store. One of the great advantages of the PC is that it can run the massive catalog of Windows software that’s out there–but the Surface Laptop won’t do that unless you pay for a full version of Windows 10, at which point Microsoft says your experience may degrade. It’s weird. In the end, though, what does the arrival of the Surface Laptop tell us about the current state of affairs in the world of Mac laptops? Apple’s got two solid answers to the Surface Laptop in the MacBook and the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar–one optimized for size, the other for speed. The MacBook could sure use an update, and it wouldn’t hurt if the MacBook Pro’s starting price got shaved down a little bit. At some point, Apple needs to sell a modern laptop within hailing distance of $1000. But I appreciate Apple’s refusal thus far to sell a $999 starter MacBook with the weak specs of the Surface Laptop–128GB of storage is tight, and 4GB of RAM is not so great either. In the meantime, the MacBook’s positioned quite nicely… it just needs an update. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Find out how to get them all with our guide to Netflix's hidden features. 1. Watch the good stuff from the US First it was thicker hamburgers, then cheaper cars. And now Americans get a superior Netflix service too - with our transatlantic cousins getting newer TV shows and a far broader range of movies. You can circumvent these regional restrictions on the UK service, however, by using a network service like Media Hint. Stranger Things Credit: Curtis Baker It only works on computers – but for around £2.50 a month (or £25 a year) it will allow you to access Netflix in other countries too. An alternative free option which does the same thing is the Hola unblocker browser plugin, which works with Chrome, Firefox or the Android OS (although some reports suggest it is secretly selling users' bandwidth to hackers). Either way, be warned: accessing Netflix in other countries is a violation of your user agreement, so attempt at your own risk. If you want to access US Netflix via your Xbox, PlayStation, Apple TV or iPad, then it’s fractionally fiddlier - in that you’ll need to manually change your DNS settings to fool your system into believing you are based elsewhere. On an Apple TV, for example, go into your Settings, go to General, then Network. Select your Network Name, then select Configure DNS, and Manual. From there, enter a new DNS code – these are subject to change, but Netflix Fixer posts regular updates about valid codes, as does Droidkit. If these free ones fail to work, or you don't like the sound of it, then try a paid-for service such as Unblock Us, which does the same for $4.99 (£3.20) a month (there’s also a free trial). But again, be aware you’re violating your service agreement. 2. Kill the buffering – via the secret menu Is Walter White pixellating before your very eyes? Is Frank Underwood buffering continuously? Netflix is supposed to automatically calibrate your streaming depending on your connection – but you can bypass that via a secret settings menu. kill the buffering On a computer, just click on any video while pressing Shift+Alt (Shift+Option+Click on a Mac), and under “Stream Manager” you can manually adjust the bandwidth usage. There is also an option to adjust how the audio and video synchronises, just in case the dialogue and actors’ mouth movements have parted company. List: the 85 best movies on Netflix UK 3. Kill the buffering – via an even more secret menu If you’re on a Smart TV, Blu-ray Player, or game console, you’ll need to reset your Netflix application. But oddly, this requires a code similar to the old Konami Code of videogaming lore. Launch Netflix, and on your controller or remote, press the following: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, Up, Up, Up, Up. This brings up a secret debug menu of your general information (plus, if you're on Xbox, technical information such as AV stats, a frame rate counter, a log and so on). Tweak the settings from here, or take the option to deactivate then relaunch the app – allowing you to change the settings and eliminate the buffering. 4. Check your resolutions Knowing how to stream movies in HD only matters if you're actually getting HD. So check what you’re actually watching by going to Your Account page. Select Playback Settings, and under Data Usage, select High. Then click Save. But be warned: High Definition munches through data – so make sure it doesn’t devour your allowance. 5. Choose your viewing time carefully According to Digital Trends, one factor influences video quality above all others: the time of day - whether that time falls under typical peak hours when everyone else is watching and clogging the system. “Getting HD (720p) at 9 in the evening, for example, was next to impossible,” they reported, “let alone 1080p Super HD.” Bingeing on Mad Men at 4am, therefore, will see better results – but then, you knew that already. List: the 25 best films on Amazon Prime 6. Avoid spoilers and other irritants Netflix pet hates: everyone has them. But now, chances are, they’ll be sorted out by Flixplus – a worthwhile Chrome browser extension created by the Lifehacker website team specifically to root out all the annoying Netflix features. Among the 18 tweaks it offers, Flixplus can hide potential spoiler images and text snippets, remove duplicate recommendations, disable that irritating Facebook integration prompt and even show IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings. And it has just been updated to cope with the new Netflix menu system. Get it here. 7. Stream better by setting up a VPN This trick originated in the US – where some broadband providers have been accused of “choking off” data at peak times, so the video quality of services like Netlfix plummets. But Virtual Private Networks may yet prove useful in the UK as video streaming gets more popular. In short, by connecting via a remote network, they allow you to circumnavigate any gateway your ISP (Internet Service Provider) may have imposed – ensuring connections speeds that are, in some cases, 10x faster than normal. But it does require some technical expertise – a step-by-step guide can be found here. 8. Make the subtitles legible Oh, Netflix minions: for all the work you put in to adding accurate subtitles, you then dash it all by making the typeface too small, or the text colour too light, for you to read easily. Changing the default yellow sans-serif font is easy, however - go to Your Account then, under Your Profile, select Subtitle Appearance. In the pop-up box, change and preview until you're satisfied. 9. Use Keystroke Shortcuts Streaming from your laptop or computer? Let your fingers do the navigating for precise, easy control. Hit Spacebar or Enter keys to pause/play. ‘PgDn’ also pauses, while ‘PgUp’ plays. F enables full-screen viewing, while Esc takes you out of it. Hold Shift and the Left Arrow to rewind, while Shift and the Right Arrow fast-forwards. Up and Down Arrows change volume, while M toggles for mute. 10. Access the Apple TV “bonus” features If you’re watching via Apple’s little black hockey puck of delight, then try hitting the Up arrow twice on its remote while viewing – it brings up a banner with a thumbnail image, description, and rating. Pressing down is more useful though: it brings up a progress bar, notched with chapters. And if you hit the left or right arrow you can leap forward or back 2–6 minutes depending on the length of the title. List: the 20 best free movies on YouTube 11. Watch Netflix with friends - anywhere Desperate to share your theory on why Claire Underwood is the real brutal epicentre of House Of Cards? Try Rabbit, a group chat service which, unlike similar services like Google Hangouts, allows you to launch a window where you and your other “guests” can watch and discuss Netflix together. Or, indeed, anything you’re watching through a browser – YouTube, Hulu, badger webcams and so on. It also means only one of you needs a Netflix account, although the legality of doing this is what lawyers might describe as “murky”. Credit: The Netflix app Rabbit 12. Access Netflix’s internal catalogue While your viewing habits – and more specifically, the ratings you give programmes – teach the Netflix algorithms what to suggest on your listings, sometimes you’re just in the mood for… a Critically-acclaimed Understated French Drama. We all do. Instead of painstakingly searching out such a creature, however, Netflix have helpfully, but secretly, created a vast number of category IDs that you simply type into the search bar instead. These enable quick access to broad groups like Cult TV Shows (74652) or esoteric listings like Visually-striking Martial Arts Movies (3196). Luckily, you can find updated ID lists here and here. Those French dramas, by the way, are under 3949. See below. Netflix: The codes that unlock 1000s of hidden movies and TV shows 13. Improve your viewing choices Paralysed by the sheer choice on offer? Netflix’s built-in star rating offers a rough guide as to the quality of the movie/show – but when you really need the wisdom of a larger crowd, try the Chrome extension Netflix Enhancer. The recently-revised tool allows you to see a film's Rotten Tomatoes score as well as its IMDb rating – not to mention access to other IMDb content as well as any trailers. Still indecisive? Try Netflix Roulette. Put in an actor, a genre, or another determining factor, and hey - who knows what you’ll end up watching.

While there were plenty of apologies, there were too few details about how they plan to correct course. A month ago, on Apr. 4, Apple did something unusual. Three senior execs sat down with five reliable (meaning no clickbait) bloggers to discuss the state of the Mac. On the Apple side are Phil Schiller (senior vice president of worldwide marketing), Craig Federighi (senior vice president of software), and John Ternus (vice president of hardware). The web writers are Ina Fried (Axios), John Gruber (Daring Fireball), John Paczkowski (BuzzFeed), Matthew Panzarino (Tech Crunch), and Lance Ulanoff (Mashable). A Tech Crunch transcript of the exchange is here. Tempting as it was, I postponed commenting on the event because I wanted to add the perspective afforded by Apple’s latest quarterly numbers, released on May 4. As it turned out, Microsoft latest financials have also added useful context. The most interesting part of the discussion centered on the Mac Pro “mystery”: Why has Apple seemingly abandoned the device? As John Gruber put it: There’s a contingent of the pro market [whose] theory is that Apple doesn’t care about Mac Pro users anymore….In broad strokes, their theory is that Apple wants everyone to switch to iPads. And that the Mac has some sort of end of life on the horizon…I know you’re going to say it’s not true. John Gruber doesn’t buy that theory, nor do I, but Apple’s actions haven’t made faith in the Mac’s future an easy stance. Turning to the confab, three things stand out from from the 8,000 words transcript. First, we have the Jimmy Swaggart confession: Indeed, we have sinned against thee, thou Mac Pro faithful. The top-of-the-line Mac was announced in June 2013—and won’t have a successor until 2018. Then there’s the contorted explanation for Apple’s puzzling failure to come up with a Mac Pro successor: “We designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner,” “We were boxed by a circle.” Mostly, we have vague reassurances to Mac users who have been kept on hold: Craig Federighi: …It’s understandable that some people who love their Macs so much and see something new that Apple is talking about in the form of iPad, creating in some of them a sense of insecurity: “What does this mean to me, what does this mean to the product I love?” So I understand how that would come out in the form of concern that this is happening, but this is not happening. The Mac is—we say it over and over, we’re saying it again here—a huge part of our future, we’re deeply invested in it. Apple’s commitment to the Mac is restated for the umpteenth time, with an unsubtle You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet tease (particularly regarding the iMac and an inexplicably absent Apple large external screen). But how long must we wait for our eyes to be opened? Without any hard details on future Macs—Pro or not—the Apple execs’ attempt to console their flock was a mission impossible, a Dance of The Seven Veils meant to arouse without actual contact. In the meantime, Microsoft has smartly positioned itself as the home of creators with its new Surface devices, particularly the striking Surface Studio. To drive the point home, the company released a Windows iteration called the Creators Update. (As an amateur Kremlinologist, my hat is off to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and especially to chief propagandist Frank X. Shaw.) Fortunately for Apple, reality just came to the rescue. Microsoft’s quarterly numbers paint a sobering picture for the Redmond company: Surface sales dropped 26% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Meanwhile, Mac units grew 4%, revenue 14%, and Average System Price (ASP), went from $1,270 to $1,390: (Provided by author) Apple’s Developer’s Conference (WWDC) will be held in four weeks. We’ll be treated to the usual discussion of whether the iPad is a laptop replacement, of course, but Mac talk could prove to be even more interesting. In particular, will Apple announce an ARM-based Mac? A Mac laptop that’s powered by a home grown A11 or A12 processor is technically feasible. The A10 processor inside my iPhone is no less powerful than the Intel processor inside my MacBook. But in practical terms, unfortunately, it might not make sense. Considering the continued decline of classical PCs, I don’t think Apple can go all the way and design an Ax processor for high-end Macs. Further, bifurcating the Mac line with, one the one hand, Ax-based MacBooks and, on the other, Intel-based iMacs/Mac Pros doesn’t make a sensible picture. To borrow from our dearly departed Steve Jobs, Mac PCs—whether late 2017 iMacs or Mac Pros in 2018—will continue to be trucks. The “open” Mac Pro design will easily accommodate bigger, faster everything with its multiple Intel processors and GPUs, near-infinite storage, easy hardware updates and, ahem, a motley crew of heathen non-USB-C connectors. I’m ready to print more OPEN MAC T-shirts and dig up my old license plate: (Provided by author) (Authenticity of the image above not guaranteed, but I did have such a license plate.) The cars in Steve’s metaphors are Mac laptops, destined to be progressively cannibalized by iPads. Such cars are tightly integrated—no lifting the hood and tinkering with the engine or suspension. Trucks—Mac Pros—are modular, welcoming computer age shade-tree mechanics. Muting the noise, it’s a simple-to-understand future: one solidified, if in smaller numbers, at the high end; and unclear at the shifting border between Mac laptops and iPads.

The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple’s plans to build a $4 million shipping and receiving warehouse on a vacant lot in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. “We’re excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data center and supporting facilities,” Apple spokesman John Rosenstock said in an email to The Associated Press. “As part of our growth, we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs.” Last week, Apple announced a new $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, but provided few details. As part of a strategy emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, it also released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work — more than half in California’s Silicon Valley. Apple currently has more than 700 workers in Nevada, which Rosentock said is home to the company’s largest solar investment, “powering our data center with clean energy.” The 5-year-old $1 billion data center is located in the Reno Technology Center near the Tracy generating station along U.S. Interstate 80. It’s between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla’s giant battery factory is based about 15 miles (24 km) east of Reno-Sparks. Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data center in 2012. Gov. Brian Sandoval said it was “the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map.” “Apple’s decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home,” he said in a statement Wednesday. The Reno Gazette-Journal reported City Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the downtown land deal Wednesday, calling for an end to unfair tax deals for “some powerful, well-connected corporations and not the rest of us.” Mayor Hillary Schieve and Councilman Paul McKenzie said the whole city will benefit from the developments.”Apple doesn’t just pay, they offer a living wage,” McKenzie said.

We like this definition. Available to download at no cost and earning “love the concept” praise from Apple WatchCast, Mount Burnmore transforms each player’s active energy (i.e. their calories burned as registered by their Apple Watch Activity App) into game energy, which is then used to rotate blocks that clear a route to the top of a mountain. Cupertino, CA (PRWEB) May 11, 2017 When it comes to wearable gaming apps, many Apple Watch users so far have been pretty underwhelmed instead of totally impressed. Well, that’s all changed, because developer Sydvesti has just released what could be the most interesting, challenging and creative Apple Watch game to date: Mount Burnmore. Available to download at no cost and earning “love the concept” praise from Apple WatchCast, Mount Burnmore is a phenomenally unique game that transforms each player’s active energy (i.e. their calories burned as registered by their Apple Watch Activity App) into game energy, which is then used to rotate blocks that clear a route to the top of a mountain. Players can compete against others in ongoing flag challenges, which unlocks new mountains to climb. There are also daily challenges to win useful game items — like a pickaxe to smash away blocks, energy boosts, and more — and the app features Game Center integration. “What people around the world love most about Mount Burnmore, is that it’s an enjoyable and challenging way to get fit, and tap into remarkable potential of wearable technology through gamification,” commented Olli Kallakivi of Sydvesti. “People can strive and improve their own performance and score, or they can compete against other players around the world through daily challenges and the leaderboard. It’s simple to understand, fun to play, and a great way to appreciate and exploit what the amazing Apple Watch can truly do.” Mount Burnmore, the phenomenal new puzzle game for Apple Watch that transforms calories burned into game energy, is available from the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/app/mount-burnmore/id1154862438.

There have been numerous leaks and speculations so far. A new leak suggests that Apple could be working on a new iPhone SE. The iPhone SE, an iPhone 5/5S lookalike with new internals, was launched last year in March and this year new 32 GB and 128 GB storage variants of the handsets were launched. Now thanks to a Weibo user, we now have a leaked image which is said to be the back panel of an upcoming iPhone. Now the name is not confirmed, but if this is the second generation iPhone SE, it confirms the fact that Apple will move on from metal to a glass finish. If you notice, even the camera arrangement is vertical, with the lens on top left and the LED flash unit just below it. The leaked image also shows a sheet that has the term ‘Ion-X Glass’. This is the same material that Apple uses for its Apple Watch Sports. It is said to be more flexible, lighter and less expensive than sapphire glass however it is also more prone to scratches. The iPhone SE is the cheapest offering from Apple so it won’t be come as a surprise if Apple does go for this glass.

However, based on reports, it appears that the upcoming Note 8 will be the true killer Samsung smartphone. This isn’t good news for Apple, which many people thought would have the advantage just three months ago due to Samsung’s rotten luck in 2016. In August 2016, Samsung released what many believed was the best mobile device to-date: the Galaxy Note 7. The smartphone not only had a slick polished glass build, but the screen was beautiful, the camera took excellent pictures and videos, and the device was more fluid than any other Android smartphone. It also had a battery that soon started exploding on some people. The Galaxy Note 7 soon became known as the Galaxy Nuke 7. Samsung’s debacle gave ammunition to Apple, which released what some thought was an inferior iPhone 7 Plus. It looked like Apple took the smartphone crown back for good, but Samsung released the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in late April to high critical acclaim and sales. The Galaxy S8+, in particular, brings back the excitement in smartphones, especially with its 6.2-inch curved screen that has the vividness of a living, breathing entity. There are a couple minor flaws, but the upcoming Galaxy Note 8, which is expected to be released around the same time as the iPhone 8, is expected to fix them. One of the flaws with the S8 series is the fingerprint reader, which is right next to the camera and is, at times, hard to reach. At worst, it forces one to accidentally smudge the camera lens. As The Investor notes, Samsung originally planned to embed the fingerprint scanner underneath the S8 display but didn’t have enough time to perfect the technology. According to most sources, the new fingerprint scanner will debut on the Note 8. Another flaw—or at least a disappointment—is the fact that the S8 series only has a single-lens camera. While early prototypes of the S8+ had a dual-lens camera, Samsung left it off the final version in order to leave space for the fingerprint reader. Most sources say a dual-lens camera, which allows one to take 2x zoom optical shots, will make an appearance on the Galaxy Note 8. The main thing that sets Samsung’s Galaxy Note series apart from other smartphones is that it has a stylus, which has become more like a pen through each upgrade. Using S Note with Samsung’s S Pen on the Note 7 was close to writing on paper—it reproduced the smoothness, pressure points, and even the ink of a pen. So far, there haven’t been any indications that the S Pen capabilities will be upgraded, but this certainly won’t be a problem. The only thing that could stop the Note 8 from taking the smartphone crown will be the iPhone 8. According to MacRumors and other sites, the higher-end version of Apple’s next iPhone could have a 5.8-inch AMOLED edge-to-edge display (shorter than the 6.2-inch display on S8+), a glass body, and a fingerprint scanner under the screen. The iPhone already runs faster than any Android smartphone, but the new high-end version, in particular, is said to run Apple’s faster A11 chip. The highest-end version of the iPhone 8 could have some augmented reality features as well. It appears that, once again, Apple is playing catch-up with Samsung. But since this is the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone, Apple will go out of their way to exceed expectations. But can Apple meet the likely heavy demand? According to many sources, including 9To5Mac, Apple has experienced many delays and production difficulties with its new smartphone. In fact, the highest-end version with the OLED display may not come out until November or December. It is also possible that the shortage of supplies may make the iPhone 8 Plus (or whatever it will be called) very difficult to find for several months. Many impatient smartphone buyers may opt for the Galaxy Note 8 instead. Whatever Apple’s problems are, they certainly aren’t as bad as Samsung’s were at the very beginning of the year. But Samsung made a huge comeback, and the Note 8 could help the Korean company do something nobody thought would happen again—become the number one smartphone manufacturer in the world. Whatever happens, both Samsung and Apple have already made 2017 the most exciting year for smartphones in at least a decade.

Of course, the media has all but forgotten the device, since it’s not quite as appealing or as impressive as Apple’s flagship iPhones. Perhaps the design is one big reason for the lack of attention. The iPhone 5s lookalike that sports iPhone 6s internals and lower pricing still became quite popular with some customers, but Apple decided not to release a new model this past March. However, a new leak from Asia suggests Apple may update the iPhone SE with a big redesign in the near future. Don't Miss: This is how Samsung will stop the Galaxy Note7R from exploding. An image posted over on Weibo shows what appears to be the rear panel of an iPhone SE, according to the person who leaked it. What’s immediately noticeable is that it features cutouts that would fit a vertical camera assembly. However, we’re probably looking at a camera and flash setup, rather than a vertical dual lens camera akin to what we’re expecting on the iPhone 8. A Google Translate translation of the message reveals that the person who posted the image says the iPhone SE component is made of glass, just like what we’re expecting to see from the iPhone 8’s rear shell, and maybe even the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. The new SE could be unveiled at WWDC 2017, the Weibo user also suggests. That said, if the new glass panel is there to enable wireless charging, it’s doubtful that the phone will debut before the iPhone 8 in September. As for the phone’s name, if real, it’s unclear what it’s going to be. Will Apple sell the device as iPhone SE? iPhone SE 2 doesn’t sound right at all. Maybe we’re looking at an iPhone SE Series 2 model, a naming scheme that Apple has adopted for the Apple Watch family. Trending right now: If the iPhone 8 looks this good, Samsung is in trouble Did the iPhone 8 just leak in a brand new music video? This is how Samsung will stop the Galaxy Note7R from exploding.

Reuters/Andrew Kelly Apple has acquired Beddit, which is known for its sleep tracking hardware and software. The Mac maker hasn’t made it known how much it paid for the acquisition or what it plans to do with the newly gained technology, but the tech giant should be able to boost the company’s wellness efforts and the Apple Watch with it. Beddit quietly announced that it has been acquired by Apple in a privacy policy update. It then gave a heads-up to its users about the change via an update for the Beddit iOS app. According to the new policy, the users’ personal data will now be “collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy.” Although no further details have been announced regarding the purchase, Beddit users can apparently carry on and use the products in the long run. Beddit presently has a sleep monitor that can be hidden under the sheet while it tracks quality and quantity of sleep, heart rate, breathing, snoring and environmental factors. Now what exactly does Apple plan to do with Beddit? Apple Insider believes that the Cupertino, California-based tech titan is likely going to include the Beddit team in its budding biomedical engineering group. The iPhone maker may also incorporate some kind of sleep tracking feature into the Apple Watch, although with the current wearable’s battery, that’s a bit of a stretch. Apple has delved more into health and wellness ever since it launched HealthKit and the Apple Watch, which is now being promoted as an all-around fitness device. Beddit’s sensor makes use of ballistocardiography (BCG) to assess the mechanical activity of the lungs, heart, and other body functions. BCG is a non-invasive monitoring tool that’s comparable to the Apple Watch’s light-based photoplethysmography that monitors heart rate. BCG quantifies the impulse produced by the blood’s acceleration though the circulatory system when the heart beats. That’s how it provides abundant info about the body. Mac Rumors believes that Apple is fascinated with the sensor technology that the Beddit equips. Apple has reportedly employed the services of medical experts with BCG experience, although the data collected may also prove to be relevant as the company has made up its mind to continue marketing the Beddit sensor. Apple can use Beddit’s technology for a handful of purposes. It can boost sleep research for HealthKit as well as CareKit. The company can likewise incorporate more enhanced health and wellness features and sleep-monitoring functionality not only into the Apple Watch, but also its future wearables.

TSMC will be the sole supplier of A11 chips for the upcoming iPhone refresh. The A11 chip is also expected to be included in the iPhone 7s spec bump phones, which will seemingly use the same chassis design as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, although this is not universally supported by the rumors. The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here As usual, Apple has designed the A11 layout to its proprietary custom specification and then relies on a third party to fabricate the components. Most benchmarks show Apple’s custom CPU designs as the best in the smartphone industry as far as performance is concerned. Digitimes acknowledges that there were some production issues but notes these issues have now been resolved. TSMC has begun 10nm chip production for Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 series, the sources said. Production was once affected by issues involving stacking components in the backend integrated fan-out packaging process, but they have already been solved, the sources said. Other reports have indicated that the iPhone 8 will pack in 3 GB RAM, which is the same as the iPhone 7 Plus. Yield issues for the iPhone 8 have been widely reported in recent weeks. On Tuesday, KGI claimed that mass production of the iPhone 8 may not start until October or November. A separate report has also suggested that the device may not go on sale until October. Variants of the Apple A11 chip may also appear in Apple’s upcoming iPad revisions. The company is expected to debut a new 12.9 inch iPad Pro and a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro at some point in the year. It is also possible that if these iPads launch sooner rather than later, that they use an ‘A10X’ chip or similar instead.

In the dank underground chambers of James Ponsoldt’s The Circle, inside the literal bunkers of a tech conglomerate called The Circle, a fellow named Kalden (John Boyega) pulls Mae Holland (Emily Watson) aside and proclaims, a real act of love in James Ponsoldt’s world, that “you don’t have a cynical bone in your body.” The moment is neither cute nor sweet but just sort of sits in front of us. Watson’s Mae smiles and gives us Hermione’s please-the-professor grin. Is it real? Was it ever? “One of the many problems with The Circle is that it never gets much of a handle on Mae,” wrote Will Leitch in The New Republic. Angie Han, over at Mashable, calls the characters, Mae included, “empty vessels made to parrot diatribes.” This is jarring, as Ponsoldt’s last two movies were able to find rich and believable human expression in deadbeat dads and deadbeat novelists alike. Where many have seen this as the movie’s crushing failure (as testified by its 16% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), I see it as evidence of Ponsoldt’s stunning accomplishment as a narrative filmmaker. Have any of you actually been inside an Apple Store? Like the proverbial gingers, these people have no souls. Great Movie or Greatest Movie? People who like to talk about directors like to talk about careers. The move from low-budget to big, the space in between Whiplash and La La Land. Ponsoldt has been somewhat hard to exactly pin down, following his official ‘breakout’ hit (The Spectacular Now) with a deep nosedive into the preoccupations of the literary and David Foster Wallace-worshipping class (End of the Tour). His decision to take on Dave Eggers’ The Circle was both odd, because the man is box-office poison, and sort of reassuring: Eggers may be a poor man’s Foster Wallace but the contents could be sold as the big league Black Mirror the market is clamoring for. To note, it starred a baker’s dozen of bankable talent; in addition to billion-dollar franchise movie stars Watson and Boyega there was one indie breakout (Ellar Coltrane, of Boyhood fame) and one big wheel to draw in the publicity (Tom Hanks). There was even one dude who Twitter really likes (Patton Oswalt). It was all very much and most critics came in expecting something huge, the kind of middle-range hit the people like to say doesn’t exist anymore. By this note, people will say The Circle has failed, under-performing nearly everything at the box office and surely proving why small movies made in New York by contemplative men and large franchises made in LA by men with smart haircuts are what the world really needs. Get Out. Logan. Whatever. But The Circle also fucking rules. In Ponsoldt’s hands, the mildly large budget Hollywood production (made for $18 mil, which is more than La La Land but less than, you know, Moonlight) relaxes into a visual cornucopia of expensive-looking 21st century imagery, that many reviewers have spent time quibbling about whether it looks more like  Google or Apple. Whatever. The Circle mercifully returns us to the old science-fiction, manufactured not out of cleverness and knowing winks about things that can’t be paid for but one built out of the old brick and mortar that made us the worlds of Blade Runner and Total Recall, thick temples that we yearn to enter. For this reason, Ponsoldt whisks us inside the machinery without wasting too much of our time, on the whole, getting us there. Her family is great (played by Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton, in a small role that Ponsoldt makes heartbreakingly moving) but there is no reason to waste the kind of time with them that the writers over at, say, Doctor Who like to do. There’s also a lot of cool stuff inside this here Circle and Ponsoldt’s choices glimmer: unlike most tech satires, these are jabs aimed at tech consumers (most of us) instead of at the more successful tech overlords (almost none of us). We spot the Dalai Lama on the grounds and indie festival-headliner Beck is summoned to celebrate the latest project of Eamon Bailey, the folksy boss man that Hanks plays: SeeChange. (Here is where the only meaningful criticism of The Circle lies: to celebrate SeeChange Beck plays “Dreams,” one of his more mediocre late-career singles. Winkingly disappointing, like most new technology.) An oozing techno score from Danny Elfman (of “The Simpsons Theme”-fame) keeps things shiny and bouncing, like what a leprechaun DJ would spin between acts at Coachella. I’d work here even if Soylent Green were secretly being manufactured down in the pits. But that’s part of the genius of the set-up: there is no secret. Smashing together all the boring nuance of everyone’s little pet startup-turned-conglomerate into one big mega fortress of tech, the world of The Circle works because it evokes a world that may not be real to anyone who has had a drink with someone who likes to talk about their super-niche start up but is real enough to anyone who’s ever bought an iPhone. All Kalden, a sorta-defecting former co-founder of The Circle, shows Mae deep in the caverns is that The Circle happens to be storing all that info it processes. Big whoop and Ponsoldt doesn’t waste too much time here or with Kalden (pity for Boyega, who has really perfected the art of betraying evil empires, but good for the movie; in Eggers’ novel, Mae and Kalden have lots of horribly-written sex). His interests are, instead, with the ordinary people and their relationship with their ordinary jobs inside a tech conglomerate. How does it make them feel and so forth? The argument has also been made, say, by Christina Warren at Gizmodo, that Ponsoldt’s world is too familiar and, thusly, doesn’t go far enough. “The Circle’s supposed dystopian universe doesn’t feel far off enough to be effective,” she wrote, making the comparisons to products like GoPro and whatever talking camera Amazon is currently cooking up. Aside from holographic screens, there isn’t very much in The Circle that most rich people don’t already use regularly. But most tech dramas, Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror is referenced religiously as is some ’90s tech thriller starring Sandra Bullock, don’t have very much interesting to say about technology. That rating interactions via social media would be awkward? That trolls persecuting perverts is a moral conundrum? Who cares? These are all great dramas that keep people on the edge of their seats, but have nothing to say about the people inside of them besides some tidy Orwell-esque cynicism about human behavior? Ponsoldt, however, uses the pace and hum of the thriller to do what old school thrillers do: rapidly create a visually complex world and, then, immediately reducing it to the elements that he is interested in. Some kind of spy mission, normally. Many have claimed that Ponsoldt’s interests in The Circle can be boiled down to privacy. David Edelstein, writing for Vulture, elucidates it thusly: “The theme of The Circle is transparency versus privacy.” While this might be said of Eggers’ paranoid novel, I don’t buy that Ponsoldt’s interest in the slow erosion of privacy is anything more than superficial. Privacy is long gone and Ponsoldt knows that. What interests him, instead, is how people relate to each other in a perpetually public sphere, i.e. a sphere that is constantly being capitalized. The movie’s aesthetic language speaks to this: by concentrating on the world of one brand, Ponsoldt is able to emphasize its presence everywhere. The little ‘C’ of the movie posters pops up everywhere, from the back of computers and phones à la Apple products to Dad’s t-shirt after Mae signs him up for the company health plan because he’s dying (surveillance state or nah, America hasn’t changed that much). The bright red color scheme, meant to evoke Apple’s love of translucent grey-white or Facebook’s many shades of blue, gives contemporary American technological iconography the feel of Soviet-era Moscow. And SeeChange, the system of cameras spread throughout the world in the style of Google Earth that Bailey introduces, is not some cheesy harbinger of surveillance state doom fresh out of 1984, as many have read it. It’s a harbinger of the commodification of everyday life, all those sponsored Instagram posts brought to three-dimensional life. When Mae is made the star of a live-streamed feed that follows her every move, it’s not because of anyone in The Circle, least of all Bailey, actually cares about what she is doing. Many have compared this plot point, this reality-TV of the every day, to the conceit of Peter Weir’s one-note The Truman Show but it’s a comparison that falls flat. Weir’s interests were in mocking everyday post-suburban ordinariness, jumping onto a crowded bandwagon that included everything from to Magnolia to American Beauty. We are given love interests and we are diligently ensured that Jim Carrey’s Truman is a real dude who just wants a real life. The cold apathetic remove of The Circle, however, prevents us from making these same asinine conclusions. The Circle’s interest in Mae is far more compelling: they want to use her to chance a brand to millions of people around the world, to put an Emma Watson-face on a multi-billion dollar conglomerate that’s under investigation by the Feds. And, in order to sell the product, as many social media managers know, Mae has to be on! She has to be on when she is invited to sit in on a big meeting, which thrills her millions of followers but doesn’t get her out of her entry-level position. She has to be on when she accidentally walks in, digitally, on her parents having sex. When the best friend character, Annie (Karen Gillan), wants to talk about her real feelings or whatnot, those real painful things which we often tune into the interweb precisely to hear from others, she begs Mae to not record her, to not force her to package those feelings into something that’s similarly and performatively on. It’s this self-conscious alienation, between our actual real lives and the version that everyone in media is compelled to be selling, that Ponsoldt masterfully captures. It’s also a space, in both Ponsoldt’s movie and our own, that is, often carefully gendered. The Instagram star, taking photos of their ordinary life, is, most popularly, a woman. The world of tech executives, who make most of the actual money off of this, remains, more often than not, male-dominated. The Circle reproduces this dichotomy perfectly. Mae, after all, becomes a viral sensation not because of any slavish and Silicon Valley celebrated genius-like attribute — Watson plays it perfectly with an ear for all the notes of false-modesty befitting today’s Jennifer Lawrence-era celebrity — but because she is an object of a vaguely-defined lifestyle lust. Ponsoldt depicts the moans of her followers with little tweets (called zings) that surround Watson whenever she’s online. The zings yearn. The zings are a pleading voice that wants to inhabit her life and she, in order to keep her job, must let them and must look like she loves it. Does she secretly hate it, does she yearn for anything else herself? We don’t know because we are, as viewers, just another follower. We realize, as anyone that follows a single blog must, that it is only participating in this walking advertisement that allows her to rise in a male-dominated tech company, where a chummy Oswalt joins the rebellious Boyega and the bearded Hanks as the company’s dick trifecta. Annie, while an executive, is slowly driven crazy in her attempt to compete with her male peers in the boardroom of the company they founded. All Mae has to do is give them, The Circle, her body. Ponsoldt’s twist, which differs significantly from the ending of Eggers’ novel, is that Mae uses that power to turn that objectifying, commoditizing gaze back onto its creators. Earlier in the movie, The Circle leaks the private email correspondence of a senator, coincidentally also a woman, who is forced to resign in controversy — evoking a neat real-world parallel to our own almost-first female president. Mae, exploiting her relationship with Kalden and her newfound audience of millions, trains that arrow on Bailey and his masculine ilk. Their private lives, their private and super-private email correspondences (Watson reading out all this is joyful) are released like doves in the wind. Ponsoldt plays all this like the explosions and blast of the Pixies that greets us at the end of Fight Club, a delightfully absurd euphoria enjoyed by the powerless. Watson’s performance as Mae is nothing short of a work of genius: always buzzy, always excited, always ambitious, she feels like a DJ Khaled of the tech world, both juicily inscrutable because the language they speak is purposeful without meaning. When she comes to the conclusion that the ideology of The Circle must, self-destructively, be turned inward, it is because it is not unlike the patriarchy of Silicon Valley, a holdover of an old social order. Ponsoldt deliberately, as he did in End of the Tour, does not mitigate this performance with useless and tedious characterization. Unlike, say, Spike Jonze’s Her — a movie that also looked at the effects new technology might have on an amiable protagonist played by one of Hollywood’s coolest talents — there is no meaningless love story, there is no personal arc for us to watch characters climb like children at a climbing wall. Where Her reduced the conceit of AI to Scarlett Johansson’s voice in order to show how it related to a writer getting laid, The Circle uses a contemporary surveillance scheme to show how it alters the way people interact with their own lives and each other, evoking an incapacity to create sincere engagement when all engagement is branded. The risk that Ponsoldt takes — unlike even Eggers, who provides a more definitive answer in his ending — is that he does not let us on: the movie’s token anti-technology character, the staple holding together every episode of Black Mirror, is Coltrane’s horrendously boring folk artist who self-consciously martyrs himself, signifying nothing. The deliberate limpness of his performance is yet another genius stroke; a smart parody of off-the-grid subculture, Ponsoldt’s uses him to point to its impotence. Yet, for a movie that spends a considerable amount of its time streaming the personal details of its protagonist’s life to an audience of millions, many have complained that The Circle feels thin. But this merely restates the movie’s ultimate point: as content consumers, we are perpetually alienated from getting ‘a handle’ on anyone. Does Kylie Jenner genuinely enjoy Pepsi? What about the clothes she wears? What about absolutely anything about her as a person? In a world where technology has, as they say, taken over everything, the space for sincere bones, hidden and shown in private light is nonexistent. It’s all gloss and it’s all great. Much like The Circle. The Circle is great. MoviesOpinionsScience Fiction Previous ArticleHear Us Out: What If ‘World War Z 2’ Is Great?

The leaked stock report is allegedly from an Apple Authorised Reseller, and subsequently shared with 9to5Mac, and shows an Under Armour Gear Metropolis Folio case for an "iPad 10.5". The UAG case is noted as being new for June 2017, which would tie in with Apple's WWDC 2017 conference. Apple iPad 10.5 tipped for early 2017, could have A10X processor Apple WWDC 2017: When is it, where to watch and what to expect? 9to5Mac Apple usually reserves WWDC for software announcements, although the company is expected to unveil a Siri-powered smart speaker. Unveiling a new iPad as well may be a step too far. The same case is mentioned above that listing, and is available for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The listing for the 10.5-inch iPad doesn't explicitly state it's for a Pro version of Apple's tablet. However the Metropolis case is compatible with Apple's Smart Keyboard, which can only be used with the Pro model, so we can make an educated guess and assume the 10.5-inch listing is for an iPad Pro. Apple only released a new version of the regular iPad in March this year, so we'd be surprised if a new screen size for that is released just a few months later. The Pro on the other hand hasn't had a refresh since it was first announced in March 2016. We've also heard on two previous occasions that Apple was looking to develop a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, dating back to November 2016. A 10.5-inch iPad Pro would obviously provide more screen real estate than the 9.7-inch model, and would be cheaper than the 12.9-inch variant, so would provide a good middle-ground. iPad Pro 2 not expected until May or even June, says report Of course, Under Armour Gear may be producing the cases based on the same rumours and wants to beat other case makers to the punch. So as with any rumour, we'd suggest taking this one with a pinch of salt for now.

Experts and the heads of some high-growth SMEs share their advice, from not going it alone to thinking carefully about hires. Entrepreneurs often believe that the success of their business depends on the strength of their product or service. While there's some truth in that, many overlook one key variable: themselves. Professor Hari Mann, programme director for driving growth and innovation at Ashridge Executive Education, says that the success of a company heavily depends on the person, or people, leading it.  He adds that leaders of rapidly growing companies – or scale-ups – need to develop a “growth mindset”. They believe that their company will be a success and instill this confidence in those around them. "Entrepreneurs with a growth mindset are interested in employee satisfaction, not just work performance,” he explains. “In these companies, there are high levels of collaboration. People aren't fearful of failure, because they see that it goes hand in hand with growth, which comes from trying things out and accepting that they sometimes don't work.” Join the community | Share your small business story Culture is key and emanates from the role model at the top, he says. Employees need to be empowered by their managers and given "space, time and resources to explore and think about their own ideas”. Nurture beats nature Crucially, Professor Mann believes that leadership can be learned, citing Apple boss Steve Jobs as a prime example. He describes how, during his early days, the Apple boss was an aggressive and abrasive character. But, during his second period at the tech giant, he emerged as an inspiring and motivational leader. "You can change your leadership style," says Professor Mann. "Steve Jobs in the early days had a very different style of leadership to what he had in later life. Apple later became a highly collaborative company." Dr Lynda Shaw, a business psychologist who advises managers and entrepreneurs, says that business leaders must work on their communication skills, both speaking and listening. She also suggests that business owners actively seek out coaches and mentors to help them reflect and develop greater self awareness. "When a business grows rapidly, it is important to grow with the business. I see many who have been on the board of directors for years, starting out when the business was small. The problems come when those people don't develop their skills as the company develops," she says. Don't go it alone Ben Grech is the chief executive of student accommodation company, Uniplaces, which has grown rapidly into a 130 person-strong organisation since it was founded in 2012. But Mr Grech hasn't done this alone, having established the business with two capable partners, Mariano Kostelec and Miguel Amaro. He says that this has broadened the skill set of the management team and made rapid international growth possible. He advises entrepreneurs to think very carefully about their early hires. "We are focused on giving people the right tools and environment to do their best work and then stepping out of the way. But this only works when you hire people who are truly self motivated and naturally take ownership for their role," he says. You have to let some people go. We've fired a lot of people and that's importantChris McCullough, Rota Geek Chris McCullough is the co-founder of HR business, RotaGeek, which has doubled headcount to 18 over the past year and posted user growth of more than 500pc. Mr McCullough, who was previously a medical doctor, says that running a business is stressful, but years of working in hospitals prepared him well. "There are a lot of parallels between running a fast growth business and working in A&E," he says. "You're working with a high functioning team – people who are very good at what they do. "You're managing and communicating effectively with them, and making lots of decisions with incomplete information. Managed risk is key to what we do.” Mr McCullough spent time on the Wayra start-up accelerator programme organised by telecoms giant Telefonica, which took a stake in the business. It was here, he explains, that the business model took shape and where he became a more confident leader. "I knew nothing about the business or start-up world," admits Mr McCullough. "I always felt like a fraud, or an impostor, and wasn't sure what to do in situations. That's a healthy attitude to have, but it took about a year to build that confidence."    Hiring the right staff is key, but so is firing the wrong ones, he adds: "You have to let some people go. We've fired a lot of people and that's important. Working in a start-up is an odd thing and doesn't suit everyone." Transitioning from jack-of-all-trades Rachel Carrell is the founder of online childminder service, Koru Kids, which helps parents share nannies. She was previoulsy chief executive of healthcare business, Dr Thom, having been hired by its board 12 years after it was founded. She says that entrepreneurs must recognise that starting a business and running an established one are very different things.    "You spend a lot more time doing things when you're a start-up, whereas the CEO spends a lot more time managing people," explains Ms Carrell. "By the time I arrived at Dr Thom, the team had figured out 80pc of it and I was there to figure out how to scale up and polish the surface." She agrees that culture is critical and advises business owners to think carefully about their early hires. Entrepreneurs must develop trusting relationships with their staff, because the boss can't always be present. "The culture is what people do when the CEO leaves the room," she warns.

Meanwhile, global smartphone shipments increased to 353.3 million units in Q1 2017 from 333.1 million units in Q1 2016. Apple might have lost some significant market share in India but in global terms, the company continues to rule the smartphone market. A recent research done by folks at Strategic Analytics have claimed that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in the first quarter of 2017. Apple sold 21.5 million units in Q1 2017 capturing a total market share of 6.1 percent. Meanwhile, global smartphone shipments increased to 353.3 million units in Q1 2017 from 333.1 million units in Q1 2016.   “Global smartphone shipments reached a robust 353.3 million units in Q1 2017. The top-five most popular models together accounted for 1 in 6 of all smartphones shipped worldwide during the quarter.” - said Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics.   Interestingly, the second spot was taken by the elder sibling i.e. iPhone 7 Plus with 17.4 million units sold capturing a market share of 4.9 percent. Apple iPhone 7 Plus was more popular in most regions including India, courtesy of its bigger 5.5-inch display and a dual-camera at the back.   Apart from the two iPhones, the third spot was taken by Oppo’s R9s. The company shipped 8.9 million units of the R9s with a market share of 2.5 percent.   OPPO is largely unknown in the Western world, but its brand is wildly popular in China and growing rapidly across India. The R9s is OPPO’s flagship 4G device with key features such as dual-SIM connectivity and fingerprint security.” - said Neil.   The fourth and fifth spot were taken by Samsung’s budget friendly offering i.e. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) and Galaxy J5 (2016) which managed a sale volume of 6.1 million and 5 million respectively. Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016) sales doubled up from Q1 2016 while all the other smartphones in the list were launched post-Q1 2016. The Galaxy J3 grabbed a market share of 1.7 percent while the Galaxy J5 took 1.4 percent.   This is interesting to note as Apple was reported to lose out on crucial sales figures recently because there is too much hype about the next iPhone. Apple will be celebrating its 10 years of iPhone and the upcoming member to the list does look promising.

The company told CNBC that this investment is separate from the $1 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing that CEO Tim Cook revealed to "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer in an interview last week. Apple has already invested over $1 billion in the facility, and more than 700 employees work there, the company told CNBC. The Reno City Council approved the expansion Wednesday afternoon, as previously reported by the Reno Gazette-Journal. In a statement to CNBC, Apple said: Apple is incredibly proud to support more than two million American jobs across all 50 states. In Nevada, we have over 700 employees, 65 suppliers, five retail stores and our thriving app ecosystem is responsible for almost 8,000 additional jobs. Nevada is also home to our largest solar investment, powering our data center with clean energy. We're excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1B investment to expand our data center and supporting facilities. As part of our growth we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs. Sally ShinSan Francisco Bureau Chief

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query EU to push Apple, Google to treat app developers fairly May 11, 2017 - 12:52 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - The European Union's executive is planning a possible law to deal with complaints about unfair trading practices by leading online players such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O), Reuters said. The European Commission said on Wednesday, May 10 in a mid-term review of its digital strategy that it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook (FB.O). European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet (RKET.DE) and Deezer (DZR.PA) have complained that online platforms - such as search engines and app stores - abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on Apple's iOS software. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple, Google and Facebook, said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms ‘key gatekeepers’ deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. James Waterworth, vice president of lobby group CCIA Europe which includes Google, Facebook and eBay (EBAY.O), said the Commission should use "flexible tools like competition law to resolve any problems on a case by case basis." However, some in the music industry welcomed the initiative, saying unfair trading practices had become commonplace in the online environment. "There is a ‘power gap’ that distorts competition – it needs to be addressed and we hope the Commission’s upcoming proposals in this area will be up to the task," said Helen Smith of IMPALA, the Independent Music Companies Association.

Shobhit Varma   |   @shobhit_tech Last Updated: MAY 12, 2017 New Delhi Email Author The iPhone 5s, which was launched back in 2013, will soon be available in India for a lucrative price of Rs 15,000. With the price cut, Apple aims to gain a sizeable footing in the lower mid-range smartphone market, currently dominated by Xiaomi, Lenovo and Motorola. While the iPhone 5s is already available online for as low as Rs 17,000, this will be an official price cut  that will be applicable to both online as well as offline sales channels. The iPhone 5s was launched way back in 2013 and was the first iPhone to come with a fingerprint sensor and a 64-bit processor. The iPhone 5s has stood the test of time and is still extremely popular in India. In fact, a recent report suggests that the 5s is the most popular premium smartphone in the country. Also Read: iPhone 8 rumour roundup: True Tone OLED display, wireless charging and more Is the iPhone 5s - a four year old model - still worth it in 2017? The answer to that question can range from a resounding yes to an absolute no, depending on your use case scenario and what you want from a smartphone. Why you should buy the iPhone 5s Even in 2017, the iPhone 5s is an extremely capable smartphone. It runs on Apple's A7 processor and comes with 1GB of RAM and a 1,558mAh battery. While these specifications look far behind the times on paper, in actuality, the 5s can still stand tall amongst the budget/mid-range Androids of the world when it comes to performance. These days every Android OEM is hard at work trying to stuff as much RAM, internal storage and the best processor possible into their smartphones in order to extract maximum performance. What most manufacturers fail to understand is that software optimisation is as, if not more important that blind specifications alone. The iPhone has always lagged behind its Android counterparts in terms of specifications but has always trounced them in terms of performance thanks to superb software optimisation. The iPhone 5s has stood the test of time and is still extremely popular in India. In fact, a recent report suggests that the 5s is the most popular premium smartphone in the country. The same holds true for the iPhone 5s. The smartphone was and is still a fast smartphone. The iPhone 5s has aged very well and also comes with the peace of mind associated with most Apple smartphones. The old adage that an iPhone 'just works' is actually true. While the 5s won't amaze you with flagship level performance, it is still a very solid and reliable smartphone that is more than capable of handling day to day tasks. The 1GB of RAM can be a bit of bottleneck when it comes to heavy multi-tasking, but in general use is more than enough thanks to Apple's excellent memory management. In addition, the iPhone 5s also comes with a very capable Retina display, that still looks excellent. In fact, the last four years have not seen any dramatic improvement in Apple's display technology with the iPhone 7 still having almost the same display resolution as the 5s. The 8MP camera on the iPhone 5s has also aged very well. While it cannot compare to the flagships of today, the camera is as good and in many ways better than what you will found in other smartphones in this price range. Add to that the fact that the 5s also comes with 120fps slow motion video capture capabilities, and you have yourself a fairly decent shooter that will not let you down in most circumstances. What also helps the iPhone 5s's cause is the fact that it runs on Apple's latest iOS 10 software and might also be eligible for the iOS 11 update due this fall. Can you even think of an Android manufacturer supporting their smartphone for this long? However, we do not recommend updating the smartphone further as historically newer updates, while compatible with old iPhones, tend to slow them down considerably.  Lastly, the iPhone 5s was the first iPhone to come with a fingerprint sensor and was arguably the smartphone that started the fingerprint sensor craze. Four years later, the first generation TouchID sensor on the 5s, while not as fast as the one found on the iPhone 7, is still very accurate. Why you should skip the iPhone 5s There are some downsides to buying the iPhone 5s in 2017 as well. Unlike the iPhone SE and iPhone 7, which come with 32GB of internal storage as standard, the iPhone 5s comes with a meager 16GB of internal storage and no expandable storage support. Almost all Android competitors offer expandable storage support and some even come with 32GB of internal storage as standard. What might also deter users is the fact that the iPhone 5s comes with a tiny 4-inch display which is far behind the industry average. Users these days are gravitating towards smartphones with bigger and bigger displays. However, this might be a positive for some who want a smartphone that they can use with one hand and are sick of the large screen devices found today. The iPhone 5s is no longer a flagship smartphone capable of fighting it out with the big boys but is still a very capable device that can give mid-range Android phones a fair fight For those who use their devices very intensively should also skip the iPhone 5s as the A7 and 1GB RAM combination, while fine for day to day use, is just not powerful enough for heavy gaming, intense multi-tasking and intensive use. Another reason for skipping the iPhone 5s is Apple's very own iPhone SE, which comes with 32GB of internal storage, the much newer Apple A9 processor and an improved 12MP rear camera for Rs 20,999. Verdict Users buying the iPhone 5s should be aware of what they are investing into - the 5s is no longer a flagship smartphone capable of fighting it out with the big boys but is still a very capable device that can give mid-range Android smartphones a fair fight. With the iPhone 5s, you get a very solid and dependable smartphone with an above average camera, solid build quality, a good fingerprint sensor and an iconic design. Many Android smartphones out there might offer more power and grunt, but few will offer the peace of mind the 5s will.   Also Read: 5 reasons why Nokia 6, 5, 3 could be the most important phones of the year in India For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Vodafone offers 28GB data and free calls for Rs 346, offer only until March 15 Apple iPhone 6 at Rs 28,999 isn't such a good idea.

Beddit has updated the privacy section of its website to note the acquisition and confirm that consumer data is now subject to Apple’s own privacy policy. Beddit’s latest product is the Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor, which is sold in the Apple Store. It’s a sensor-equipped strip that slides under a bedsheet and tracks nocturnal movements through a technique called ballistocardiography; the main advantage is that you don’t need to wear an activity tracker or remember to use it at all. As reported last year that Apple plans to add sleep-tracking to the Apple Watch. The Beddit acquisition could point to some sort of official solution to the gap in functionality, or Apple may plan to make use of Beddit’s software and data for future products or features. Or, as with other acquisitions in the company’s past, Apple may simply be buying Beddit out as a way to hire some or all of its engineers.

Technology Park, spending an additional $1 billion to build and equip the campus in coming years. RENO, Nev. — Apple easily won approval from the Reno City Council on Wednesday for a new agreement allowing it to take advantage of millions of dollars in sales tax abatements as it works to double the size of its massive data center east of Reno. Only Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the agreement that will allow Apple to buy land in downtown Reno instead of lease it to be eligible for a tax break that will bring its sales tax rate down to 0.5%. Load Error The vote came moments after Apple executive Mike Foulkes announced Apple will invest another $1 billion in expanding its data center at the Reno Technology Park in the Truckee River canyon east of Sparks. "We’re excited to announce Apple will be increasing our investment by an additional $1 billion," Foulkes said, saying it will bring "hundreds of jobs in operations and construction." Apple needs the expanded data center to meet its soaring iCloud storage demands. The announcement is the latest in a string of technology company expansions in Northern Nevada, which is becoming home to a thriving data storage industry. Last month, Google purchased 1,210 acres of land at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center for nearly $29.1 million, according to documents filed with Storey County last Friday. Northern Nevada also attracted two high profile data center projects last year. Switch’s SuperNAP colocation data center at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is planned to be the largest data center facility in the world once finished. Apple is also set to get a new neighbor with cloud services company Rackspace planning to build a data center at Reno Technology Park. Apple's original $1 billion data center was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements in 2012. The value of those abatements will increase with the expansion of the data center. Because of a quirk in state law, the state can abate all but 2 percent of the sales tax rate paid by Apple on the computer equipment needed for its data center. As part of Wednesday's deal, however, Apple will build a warehouse on land in downtown Reno that's part of a tourism improvement district created in 2009. By moving the computer equipment needed for the data center through that warehouse, it will be able to chip another 1.5 percent off its sales tax rate. Foulkes said Apple plans to spend $4 million on the warehouse. "We think it will be the most beautiful building in that corridor," he said. Usually Apple does not put signage on "high security buildings," but Foulkes said the company will make an exception for the downtown warehouse to appease the Reno City Council. Council members hope the Apple warehouse will spur additional development in the downtrodden corner of downtown known as the Tessera District. Rather than a nondescript warehouse, they want it to advertise that Apple is a downtown business. The Tessera developers originally planned a $350 million mixed-use development that would includes hotels, retail shops and office buildings. Partner Steve Polikalas said that vision has changed after the recession. Tessera developers now hope to develop an "innovation district" that is home to technology and research companies that want to be close to the University of Nevada, Reno. Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve applauded Apple's decision to build in downtown Reno, noting the company helped spur a rapid expansion of technology companies in Northern Nevada. Brekhus, an outspoken opponent of tax abatements, disagreed. She questioned whether the 2012 city council abused its discretion is approving a tourism tax abatement for a warehouse. She wanted to halt the agreement, noting Nevada residents have had to bear tax increases that will be abated for Apple under the old agreement. "Let's send the message...that we are ending this unfair advantage of tax deals for some powerful, well-connected corporations and not for the rest of us," Brekhus said. Nevada's economic development director Steve Hill said the council was powerless to change the tax abatement deal. Even if the council hadn't approved the change from a lease to a sale for the downtown land, Apple still would have been eligible for the tax break. "Nothing that you would do today would change the agreement from five years ago," Hill said. Councilman Paul McKenzie, who also has been a vocal critic of tax abatements, said he probably would have opposed the deal five years ago. But since then, he said the construction of the Apple data center kept many construction workers employed with a "living wage" during the severe recession. "I can tell you and everybody listening today that I know a lot of guys wouldn’t have been eating the last five years if not for Apple," McKenzie said. "The gone to work on that project, made a living wage and fed their families. It’s been a true benefit to the community." Apple's expansion is expected to generate 100 permanent jobs and 300 construction jobs. The company already has about 717 employees in the state, mostly from its five retail stores. Gov. Brian Sandoval praised the expansion announcement. “Apple was the first major economic development success in Northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map," he said in a statement. "Apple’s decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home.”   Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

As Fitbit talks up its big plans for smartwatches, Fossil has already found out that the market is tough to crack. By Emily Bary May 10, 2017 5:24 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Pixabay Folks in the fashion and tech worlds alike are trying pretty hard to crack wearables, but it seems like no one quite knows what’s working. Just a few months ago, the sentiment was that smartwatches were out and basic fitness trackers were the future. “Simplicity is a driving factor,” one market research firm argued. Nowadays, everyone’s saying it’s a smartwatch world. Apple, which sells watches, overtook Fitbit, which mainly sells trackers, in terms of shipments during the first quarter, recent third-party data showed. And Fitbit is in the midst of a “transition year,” in which it plans to put a renewed focus on watches. More from Barron’s Next How Apple Is Trying to Fix This Weak Link Breaking Down the Apple Watch’s ‘Best Quarter Ever’ Have Wearables Peaked in the U.S? Another company in transition is Fossil, a traditional watchmaker that’s also trying to change focus and emphasize smartwatches. The company just posted a disastrous earnings report in which traditional watch sales continued to decline. Fossil also said that wearable sales (comprised mainly of smartwatches) fell short of the company’s own projections, though the category “helped to mitigate the decline in traditional watches.” So Fossil finds itself in a painful middle ground. The company’s stock fell 20.4% Wednesday. Investors might be more worried about the company’s projection for future earnings, though. Fossil’s profit forecast for the current quarter and the current year came in well below Wall Street’s expectations. “We’re determining that wearables are a bit more of a seasonal business than traditional watches,” CFO Dennis Secor said. Fossil, like Fitbit, hopes that transitioning to the latest supposedly trendy thing will fix a struggling business. Recent results from both companies suggest that hopping aboard on the latest tech trend takes some time, and investors rarely like to wait. In the last 12 months, shares of both Fitbit and Fossil are down 55%. Big Picture: Fossil and Fitbit both hope that smartwatches can fix their ailing businesses. The transition has been painful.

When Apple launched a budget 9.7-inch tablet instead in March, calling it just the iPad, it dampened the buzz around the Pro 2 a little. A new leak however, suggests the premium tablet might still be in the works after all. A Boy Genius Report Wednesday showed a leaked screenshot, supposedly of an inventory list for Urban Armor Gear iPad Pro cases. In it, the iPad Pro 10.5-inch is listed thrice with a due date of June 2017.  The June date deserves special attention due to Apple hosting its World Wide Developers Conference from June 5-9 in San Jose, raising the possibility of the tablet being announced at the event.  Read: 10.5-Inch iPad Pro 2 Enters Limited Production: Report Urban Armor Gear manufactures cases for the iPad and had a special UAG Metropolis Folio case listed for the tablet in three color combinations. The case comes with a special holder for the Apple Pencil and is compatible with the Apple smart keyboard. The fact that a large case manufacturer like Urban Armor is taking the possibility of a 10.5-inch iPad seriously lends weight to the rumors about the device's existence. The iPad Pro 10.5-inch first emerged in an August, 2016 report by KGI Securities. The device has ever since been highly anticipated. Over time, rumors and leaks about the device have suggested how the device might look and what features it might include: An edge-to-edge display: Since the iPad Pro 10.5-inch is rumored to be the company’s most premium tablet till date, it  expected to have a bezel-less display. Such a display for a tablet makes more sense than on a smartphone, given the usable screen area is the most important feature for tablet users. Display-embedded fingerprint sensor: Apple is expected to opt for a display-embedded fingerprint sensor for both the iPad Pro 10.5-inch and iPhone 8. This might differentiate the company from its major rival Samsung, which could not include the feature on its Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship. Touch Bar: One of the major features of the new iPad is expected to be a secondary Touch Bar display, just like one on the MacBook Pro 2016 model. It is supposed to act like a bar with visual shortcuts to virtual functions such as emojis. Apple A10X Processor: The new tablet is expected to have an Apple A10X processor, which is much more powerful than the A9 one on the iPad. Read: iPad Pro 2: 7 Expected Specs 12-megapixel camera: The 10.5-inch Apple iPad Pro is expected to have a 12-megapixel rear camera with features such as Live Photos, 4K video recording, 63-pixel Panorama, auto HDR and 4K recording. iOS 10.3: The device is expected to come with iOS 10.3 out-of-the-box, just like the iPad. No 3.5mm audio jack: The new tablet is expected to launch sans the 3.5mm audio jack and instead have a lightening port like iPhone 7. The iPad Pro 10.5-inch is expected to be priced at $799, more than double the pricing of the iPad. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

 Apple isn't working on a car — it's working on something much bigger Jim Edwards May 11, 2017, 3:10 AM 70,732 facebook linkedin twitter email print That big screen in the middle of the dashboard looks useful.David van der Mark / Flickr, CC Apple is behaving in a really strange way regarding the mythical "Apple Car." After hiring 1,000 people to work on a secret program called Project Titan, which many believed to be the development of a car, the company laid off hundreds of them late last year. Observers interpreted that as one of Apple's periodic experiments: The company looked at what it would take to build a car and then decided not to. And yet, Business Insider's Sam Shead recently discovered a secret Apple office in Berlin that — sources tell us — is devoted mostly to transportation. The engineers there were hired from car companies, and some are working on mapping projects. So is Apple working on a car or not? UBS analyst Steven Milunovich hosted a conversation with Horace Dediu (of Asymco.com) and Neil Cybart (of AboveAvalon.com) recently. He asked them what they thought was going on inside Project Titan. They raised four issues: Transportation — "$5tn narrowly or $15tn broadly defined" — is a bigger market than either IT or healthcare, two industries that Apple is already deep into. "Car ownership will plummet with autonomous driving." And "the company is building expertise in core sensor, driving, and mapping technologies." In sum, "Project Titan is likely to be a transportation platform — not a car but the entire experience," Milunovich wrote. The $5 trillion size of the market is crucial. Apple can enter only massive markets if it wants to continue growing. Apple is so huge that those markets need to be in the multiple billions of dollars; otherwise there is no point. (The Apple Watch, for instance, is the biggest wearable tech device on earth and yet inside Apple's universe has barely moved the needle.) The other key notion here is that Apple might be looking at "a transportation platform ... the entire experience." It will need an iOS.Steve Jurvetson / Wikimedia CC Think about that. If the cars of the future are driverless, what will we do inside them as they ferry us around? We will need entertainment, communications, and work-productivity apps to keep us occupied. Apple already does those on its other devices. The car will need navigation information, Wi-Fi, broadband connectivity, and probably its own operating system. Apple already does those, too. Put that together with one other piece of gossip coming out of the Apple archipelago: that Apple is developing a smart speaker product with a screen that people can use in their home. Apple already does that — it's called the iPad, and it has Siri. If there is a new opportunity for a standalone product in the kitchen that you yell at while you are cooking, then Apple is already steps away. Apple Homekit might be the embryonic seed of that. It would not be a huge reach to replicate the iPad/smart speaker/Homekit experience as a product that controls and operates your car and gives you a familiar iOS-like interface to communicate with. Look at the dashboard of a Tesla (above). A huge chunk of it is basically just a computer screen. It is highly unlikely that Apple will let that new space go to waste.

Home > News By Company > Remote Keylogger 63012 Tweet   The Remote Keylogger Development Team Announces An Update to the Official iPhone Keylogger The Most Popular Parental Monitoring Software Application Just got More Powerful   Apple Spy App Keylogger for iOS   Latest iPhone Running the Keylogger Application   The iPhone Keylogger Apple Keylogger for iOS(EMAILWIRE.COM, May 11, 2017 ) San Francisco, CA -- Monitoring a child's cell phone activity has become more important than ever, with teen suicides on the increase due increased social media exposure. Parents face challenges that go beyond the high school cafeteria and the most astute teachers may have no idea what types of cyber bullying a student may be dealing with. While a typical cell phone keylogger is often targeted to Android or another OS (operating system), the iPhone 10 is the phone of choice for young teens. Apple's latest iPhone launch took a surprising amount of market share over the 2016 holiday season boasting a 6.4% growth. The latest iOS offers new features, options and levels of security resulting in new and more complex form of jailbreaking the iPhone for keylogging purposes. Because of this many concerned parents have been under-represented when it comes to keylogger applications for the new iPhone. Very few keyloggers are compatible with Apple's phone, and the ones that are often dysfunctional after an iOS update or charge expensive monthly subscription fees to keep the software up to date. For this reason the developers of The Remote Keylogger have created a keylogger for iPhone that solves most of these problems. The keylogger has a much more convenient installation method. It can be installed physically or even via iCloud or iTunes. Additionally there is no jailbreaking required, although the reports and information gathered will vary between the installation types, the software will function and update automatically and invisibly. This is of significant importance as the iPhone iOS has no 3rd party security applications or open source opportunities to build them. All of Apples encryption and security are in-house and no 3rd party application is approved without a software audit and review. Although this may sounds like a reasonable solution, however it severely limits the flexibility of iOS updates as well as solutions. This has backfired somewhat on the Apple platform as iPhone spy applications have become easier to install and configure on the devices without the owners permission or knowledge. Another large improvement to the application is that it is finally available for a low one-time fee. Users of the iPad and iPhone keylogger can enjoy the software and even install months after purchase and expect it to function no differently today than a year from now. This is huge improvement over competing products as many charge up to $50.00 per month and more. The latest version developed for iOS 10 includes a WhatsApp Spy for iPhone, iChat, captures photos and videos and even tracks a child's GPS location ensuring their safety nearly anywhere. If the device is offline the iPhone will continue to gather data and reports and will invisibly send them to the software's remote control panel which it accessible anywhere the parent has online access and from any device. Interested iOS users can learn more about the most powerful iPhone Keylogger by visiting the developer's website. They can also subscribe for free updates and check the software's change log which is constantly being updated to reflect development progress.

Organising your files might not seem like a psychedelic experience now, but in 1968, when Douglas Engelbart first demonstrated a futuristic world of windows, hypertext links and video conferencing to a rapt audience in San Francisco, they must have thought they were tripping. Especially because he was summoning this dark magic onto a big screen using a strange rounded controller on the end of a wire, which he called his “mouse”. Like many California tech visionaries of the time, Engelbart was an enthusiastic advocate for the mind-expanding benefits of LSD. As head of the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center at the Stanford Research Institute, he and his team would drop acid under test conditions in the hope of inspiring new breakthroughs. His own technological epiphanies while tripping seem to have been limited: in one session, after staring at a blank wall in fascination for hours, he came up with the “tinkle toy”, a potty-training aid in the form of a miniature water wheel that would spin and tinkle when peed on. But he remained convinced that the drug opened doors to alternative realities, including one where people could control computers through screens. Facebook Twitter Pinterest This way to the future … a page from Susan Kare’s sketchbook. Photograph: kareprints.com/Design Museum In a grainy black and white film of his 1968 conference demonstration – since known in the tech hall of fame as “The Mother of All Demos” – Engelbart calmly introduces the embryonic forms of what would become word processing, email, Skype and Google Docs, all shown on a screen with scalable windows controlled by a mouse. For computer scientist Alan Kay, who would go on to develop these ideas at the Xerox PARC research institute, it changed everything. “The demo was one of the greatest experiences of my life,” he later said. “To me, it was Moses opening the Red Sea. It reset the whole conception of what was reasonable to think about in personal computing.” Engelbart’s video will be on display in the London Design Museum’s forthcoming exhibition, California: Designing Freedom, a show that aims to shine a kaleidoscopic spotlight on the cross fertilisation of counterculture and tech culture on America’s “left coast” over the last 50 years. “Think of ‘California design’ and you tend to think of Charles and Ray Eames and the world of mid-century modernism,” says curator Justin McGuirk. “We wanted to focus on what came next, and show how the hippie movement combined with the hacker culture to develop tools of personal liberation.” From skateboards and LSD blotting paper tabs to iPhones and Google’s self-driving car, the exhibition will unpick the west coast ethos that has fostered the development of devices for escapism and self-sufficiency. It shows how, as frontier territory on the edge of a continent, California has always incubated a culture of self-reliance and reinvention, as a place that attracts people fond of fantasy, freedom and rebellion – and how they have mobilised design to meet these ends. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Friendly face … Susan Kare’s Mac welcome icon greeted users booting up. Photograph: kareprints.com/Design Museum The development of user interface design is one of the most fascinating threads in the story, and one of the least obvious, because it has become second nature to us all. “These things now seem so intuitive,” says co-curator Brendan McGetrick, “that a computer document looks like a white piece of paper with text on it, that it sits on an office-like ‘desktop’, that you delete things by dragging them into a trash can. It didn’t have to be this way – these are the results of specific design decisions.” The now-ubiquitous desktop metaphor first emerged from Kay’s Xerox PARC work in the form of the Alto computer in 1973, and later the Star in 1981, the first device to use windows, icons and drop-down menus. It is shown in the exhibition as an early mock-up with pieces of paper pasted on to a slate. On a tour of the Xerox facility in 1979, a 24-year-old Steve Jobs was captivated. “I thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen in my life,” he said. “Within 10 minutes, it was obvious to me that all computers would work like this someday.” It turned out that Jobs, Steve Wozniak and his hippie chums from the Homebrew Computer Club, who together founded Apple in 1976, had a better knack for communicating the potential of this new technology than the corporate folks at Xerox. A quick comparison of their TV adverts tells you everything you need to know about the importance of design and marketing to the commercial fate of the two companies. While the 1981 ad for the Xerox Star is set in a workaday office, and methodically explains how the computer will revolutionise secretarial work and filing, Apple’s 1984 commercial for the first Macintosh was a thrilling teaser directed by Ridley Scott, showing a room of grey human automatons being lectured by a Big Brother figure on a big screen – which is then dramatically shattered by dashing female athlete hurtling a big hammer. Apple, it seemed to say, would provide salvation. The Mac would be the disruptive tool to achieving ultimate personal freedom. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alternative realities … LSD tabs with a California design. Photograph: Design Museum In the grid-ruled notebooks of graphic designer Susan Kare, also on show, it is possible to see how Apple understood the importance of humour and familiarity in translating something that had always been the preserve of big corporations and the military into something people would welcome into their homes – and be able to understand. Kare famously developed the smiling Mac icon, displayed as the computer booted up, along with the lasso, paint-bucket and trash can, transforming the cold and intimidating early desktop computers into something friendly. The Apple 1’s handmade wooden case, also on show, was a direct link to the hippie, maker culture of the communes. It is a theme that continued in the “skeuomorphic” design of Apple icons and software, with digital tools aping their real-world counterparts, be it calculator buttons or the yellow squares of sticky Post-it notes. In a world where our smartphones are often the first things we touch in the morning and the last things we touch at night, and toddlers grow up pinching and swiping before they can read, priorities have changed. As Apple’s chief designer Jony Ive recalls, when he and his team sat down to redesign the iPhone operating system in 2012, it did away with many of the classic skeuomorphic elements: “We understood that people had already become comfortable with touching glass, they didn’t need physical buttons, they understood the benefits. So there was an incredible liberty in not having to reference the physical world so literally. We were trying to create an environment that was less specific. It got design out of the way.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Having ignored design for a decade, Google recently united the graphical language of its different platforms with the launch of Material Design. In an exhibit that comes as a surprising time-warp, the paper and cardboard mock-ups of its new icons are on show, revealing how the design team modelled the new interface and developed lighting rigs to cast accurate shadows, with the aim of creating an illusion of layers of paper-like cards sliding around inside your device. It was a process that produced some interesting outcomes: why should buttons appear to press down when you touch the screen, when there’s no sense of pressing something beyond the glass? So instead they hover upwards, as if subject to a magical magnetic attraction from your finger. With Silicon Valley tech companies pumping increasingly hefty resources into voice recognition technology, McGetrick says the next frontier for user interface will be aural, building on our new surreal world of people shouting across the room to summon help from Siri, Alexa and Cortana. “We’re entering a new phase where we decreasingly need screens,” he says. “The trajectory of miniaturisation is crystal clear, from computers to laptops to digital organisers to phones to watches. The end-game is that technology will become invisible and we’ll have Google inside our heads.” California: Designing Freedom is at the Design Museum, London, 24 May–15 October.

Submit Apple Plans $1 Billion Expansion at Data Centre in Nevada Over 50% of Our Employees in US Are Locals: HCL Technologies Verizon Beats AT&T to Buy Spectrum Holder Straight Path India to Monitor Ocean Pollution With Automated System News18 » Tech 2-min read Apple Plans $1 Billion Expansion at Data Centre in Nevada Associated Press Updated: May 11, 2017, 12:42 PM IST Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data centre in 2012. (Image: Reuters) Apple announced plans Wednesday for a $1 billion (roughly Rs. 6,454 crores) expansion of its massive data centre east of Reno, doubling its investment and roughly tripling its workforce at the technology campus where company officials expect to hire 100 additional workers. The announcement came as the Reno City Council approved Apple's plans to build a $4 million shipping and receiving warehouse on a vacant lot in downtown Reno that will make it eligible for millions of dollars in tax breaks. "We're excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data centre and supporting facilities," Apple spokesman John Rosenstock said in an email to The Associated Press. "As part of our growth, we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs." sponsored Coolpad Note 5 (Royal Gold,... ₹ 10,999.00 Coolpad Note 5 Lite (Space... ₹ 8,199.00 TechArt™ 2.5D Ultra Thin UNBREAKABLE... ₹ 599.00 Last week, Apple announced a new $1 billion fund aimed at creating more US manufacturing jobs, but provided few details. As part of a strategy emphasizing its role in the US economy, it also released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 US employees work - more than half in California's Silicon Valley. Apple currently has more than 700 workers in Nevada, which Rosentock said is home to the company's largest solar investment, "powering our data centre with clean energy." The 5-year-old $1 billion data centre is located in the Reno Technology Centre near the Tracy generating station along U.S. Interstate 80. It's between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Centre where Tesla's giant battery factory is based about 15 miles (24 km) east of Reno-Sparks. Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data centre in 2012. Gov. Brian Sandoval said it was "the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map." "Apple's decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home," he said in a statement Wednesday. The Reno Gazette-Journal reported City Councilwoman Jenny Brekhus voted against the downtown land deal Wednesday, calling for an end to unfair tax deals for "some powerful, well-connected corporations and not the rest of us." Mayor Hillary Schieve and Councilman Paul McKenzie said the whole city will benefit from the developments. "Apple doesn't just pay, they offer a living wage," McKenzie said.
