 Why the iPhone is losing ground in China Meng Jing, South China Morning Post May 5, 2017, 12:12 AM 1,021 facebook linkedin twitter email print South China Morning Post Cheap “me-too” smartphones are no longer the only thing Apple can blame for iPhone’s falling sales in China as the country’s most successful manufacturers are quietly gaining ground in the premium market as well. Apple, which has long dominated China’s top 10 bestselling high-end smartphone list, saw the most number of Chinese rivals break into the category priced over 4,000 yuan (US$579.9) in the quarter ended in March, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Apple still occupies five spots in the top 10 list with its iPhone 7 Plus 128G being the top seller among all premium smartphones in China, the world largest smartphone market. However, four Chinese models – three from Huawei Technologies and one by Vivo – have made it into the list with one spot left for Samsung Electronics. “The top 10 premium phone list was practically a duopoly by Apple and Samsung until Huawei became the first Chinese game changer in the high-end crowd about one year ago. The first quarter of 2017 is the first time that we see Vivo get into the list,” said James Yan, Beijing-based research director of Counterpoint Technology. Chinese smartphone brands have been tightening their grip in China, grabbing local market share and squeezing out Apple and Samsung by producing cheaper phones with not so cheap features. But an increasing number of them, such as Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, have started to take the high-end market seriously as competing aggressively for razor-thin margins in the low-end market is no longer in their best interest. Research from IDC shows the average selling price of Android phones in China continued to rise in the first quarter of 2017 largely due to the increasing desire of consumers for key flagship models made by Huawei, Oppo and Vivo – China’s top three smartphone makers in terms of shipments for the quarter ended March. South China Morning Post “Consumers are seeking to upgrade their smartphones to seek a better user experience and these companies offer models that can meet their demand,” said IDC in a research note released on Thursday. IDC also said the key flagship models released by these Chinese companies have more upgraded specifications such as dual cameras and OLED screens that have driven up average selling prices. Apple, which reported on Wednesday its fifth consecutive quarter of revenue decline for its greater China business, has seen a double-digit fall in iPhone’s first-quarter sales in China, which was a major source of growth before last year. Data from IDC showed that it ranked fourth in the China market in the first quarter with 9.2 per cent market share compared with 11 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016. “But we believe that Chinese consumers are holding out for the launch of Apple’s 10-year anniversary iPhone at the end of the year, and this will help Apple to see a rebound in the China smartphone market,” said Tay Xiaohan, a senior market analyst with IDC Asia-Pacific.

I don't think they want to have that conversation, says Elon Musk The Tesla CEO laughed off the possibility of any such deal taking place. By Agamoni Ghosh May 5, 2017 06:49 BST Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceXReuters Investors have for long suggested that Apple should buy Tesla, more so after the iPhone maker managed to add an additional $10bn (£7.74bn) to its bank account during the first three months of 2017. The cash in hand for the Cupertino-based tech giant now totals more than a quarter of a trillion dollars sending market analysts into speculation over whether Apple plans to acquire Tesla anytime soon. While Apple has not responded to any such deal or even the possibility of a deal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was recently asked if he would consider the prospects of partnering with the firm. Musk laughed off the suggestion and clarified that no such thing seems likely. "Yeah, I don't think they want to have that conversation," Musk responded. "At least I've not heard any indication that they do. Obviously Apple continues to make some great products and, yeah, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it's cool. I mean... I don't know what else to say." Industry watchers have earlier said that Apple's self-driving car software developments can be used for Tesla's cars and both companies could benefit from the same. Musk has, however, said Tesla needed to focus on building its first mass-market vehicle, the Model 3 and did not know if a buyer was interested in the same. "I'd be very concerned in any kind of acquisition scenario, whoever it is, that we would become distracted from that task which has always been the driving goal of Tesla," he said earlier.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 15 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth nothing that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top tog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k... Normally I generate eighty bucks each hr and even work for three to 4 hours majority of the days.And wonderful thing about this is exactly that one could manage time when you work and for how long as you like and you achieve a paycheck per week. ---->>>LEARN MORE Regarding It here-> http://s.id/272 mfofofipf Kumnaa The most recent Nexus 7 is almost 4 years old now though :( Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Cars Image Source: Tesla Elon Musk laughs off the idea of Apple buying Tesla Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 4th, 2017 at 11:03 PM Share Tweet During the first three months of 2017, Apple managed to add a cool $10 billion to its bank account. When the company released its earnings report earlier this week, it revealed that its cash on hand now totals more than a quarter of a trillion dollars, or $256.8 billion to be exact. While the vast majority of that case resides overseas — and subject to high taxation rates barring a new tax holiday from the Trump administration — Apple’s tremendous cash position naturally has many wondering what it plans to do with all of that money. Don't Miss: The best new Android feature might finally launch soon Naturally, some analysts reflexively like to claim that Apple needs to make a large-scale acquisition, whether it be Disney or Netflix. Indeed, one of the longer standing suggestions from analysts is that Apple might want to pick up Tesla. After all, with Tesla currently embodying what Apple presumably wanted to accomplish with Project Titan, an Apple-Tesla merger would seem to make sense, at least from a culture and strategic perspective. Financially, however, the numbers just don’t add up. As it stands now, Tesla’s market cap is in the $46 billion range, and it’s beyond unlikely that Apple would shell out that kind of cash for the company. Even if we imagine a scenario where Tesla starts making real quarterly profits — the company lost $1.33 per share last quarter — the economic realities and low gross margins associated with the auto industry wouldn’t help Apple move the needle from a profit perspective. Nonetheless, that didn’t stop Morgan Stanley analyst Adan Jonas from asking Tesla CEO Elon Musk about a potential Apple buyout during the company’s earnings conference call yesterday. Jonas’ question reads: Apple has enough net cash I think to buy Tesla, like more than three times over. Is there anything that Apple does or has, besides having more money than they know what to do with, that could be helpful in Tesla’s mission to accelerate the transition to shared autonomy and sustainable transport? Could they be the type of firm you could partner with, and is this something you could talk to Tim about? Upon hearing the question, Musk laughed and let out an audible “Ha!” before replying “Yeah, I don’t think they want to have that conversation,” Musk answered. “At least I’ve not heard any indication that they do. Obviously Apple continues to make some great products and, yeah, I mean, I use their phone and their laptop, it’s cool. I mean… I don’t know what else to say.” Jonas followed up, asking if Tesla viewed Apple as more of a competitor or a potential partner, to which Musk replied: “I mean, I don’t know what they’re going to do on the car front. Yeah, it’s not clear.” For what it’s worth, Musk reportedly met with Apple’s mergers and acquisitions chief Adrian Perica back in 2013, though it’s unclear what was discussed between the two. Musk a few years later confirmed meeting with Apple, but said that he couldn’t “on whether those [meetings] revolved around any kind of acquisition.” For what it’s worth, an Apple/Tesla buyout would have made much more economic sense in mid-2013 back when Tesla’s market cap was still in the $4 billion range.

The Cupertino, California company will announce the fund’s first investment later in May, Cook said during an interview on CNBC. Cook also said Apple plans to fund programmes that could include teaching people how to write computer code to create apps, and will release more details about the effort this summer. Share this story Apple CEO Tim Cook waves as he arrives on stage to deliver his keynote address at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California The announcements were the latest in a series of disclosures to highlight how Apple, the world’s largest company by market valuation, contributes to job creation in the US. Apple came under fire from President Donald Trump because it makes most of its products in China. In February during the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Cook said Apple spent $50 billion in 2016 with its US suppliers, which include firms like 3M and Corning. Read also: Apple fans pause on buying iPhones Cook reiterated that point during the CNBC interview, along with Apple’s claim that it has created 2 million jobs in the US, 80 000 of which are directly at Apple and the rest coming from suppliers and software developers for the company’s app ecosystem.  Reuters Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 LOOK: Baby born clutching his mother's birth control coil 2 Zuma protester witch-hunt 3 #ZumaDA: President off the hook if he swops focus 4 Woman stabbed on way to work 5 What was up with Whatsapp?

Reuters/Stephen Lam Apple is now the number one wearables seller in the world. The company shipped approximately 3.5 million Apple Watch units during the first quarter of this year. According to new research stats, the Mac maker’s watch shipments went beyond those by rival Fitbit from January to March 2017. This paved the way for Apple to grab almost 16 percent worldwide marketshare and become the world’s top wearables merchant. Fitbit drops to third place with an estimated 2.9 million shipments of its wearables while Xiaomi plays second fiddle to Apple with about 3.4 million wearable units shipped. The roughly 3.5 million watch shipments by Apple is a major improvement over the 2.2 million wearable shipments of last year’s first quarter. The Cupertino, California tech giant grew its watch business compared to Fitbit, which saw its shipments go down from nearly 4.5 million units between January and March 2016. However, Apple holds a slim global marketshare margin over Xiaomi, which owns 15.5 percent of the pie, considering the Chinese company’s drop in shipments. During the first quarter of 2016, Xiaomi captured almost 21 percent of the marketshare compared to Apple’s 12 percent. Still, it doesn’t compare to Fitbit’s collapse. The San Francisco, California-based consumer electronics company went from 24.7 percent in 2016’s first quarter to 13.2 percent between January and March 2017. “Fitbit shipped 2.9 million wearables worldwide in Q1 2017, falling a huge 36 percent annually from 4.5 million in Q1 2016,” said Cliff Raskind, Director at independent research and consulting firm Strategy Analytics. “Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market. Fitbit's shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Not once has Apple fully publicised the precise number of wearables it has sold. The smartwatch just gets included on the “other products” list in quarterly earnings reports. The said list – which includes the Apple TV, iPod, Beats products and other Apple and third party accessories – only represent 5 percent of the company’s overall revenue as of the moment. On a more interesting note, Apple revealed in its annual Environmental Responsibility Report a couple of weeks ago how the company goes to great lengths to make sure its wearables are safe to use (see related story below). The company even creates artificial sweat to test Apple Watch bands.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: DongleGate Isn't Hurting Apple's MacBook Pro Sales Despite vocal complaints, customers are still buying Apple's newest laptop. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) May 4, 2017 at 10:29PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has garnered all sorts of criticism in recent months following the introduction of the new MacBook Pros that exclusively use USB-C ports. That requires users to buy and carry around a collection of dongles for devices that use older standards. There have been conflicting third-party data points. Slice Intelligence said last year that demand was soaring, quickly overtaking sales of competing laptops. A rumor last month suggested that sales of the older MacBook Pro model with traditional ports "went through the roof" following the introduction, and "shot up even higher" once reviews started getting published. Well, investors now have some data on the matter, directly from Apple. New MacBook Pros. Image source: Apple. Highest Mac ASPs in nearly a decade On the earnings call earlier this week, Apple said that "strong demand for our new MacBook Pros" contributed to the robust results in the Mac business. Total Mac units were up 4% to 4.2 million, and Mac revenue grew an even stronger 14% to $5.8 billion. That outsized increase in revenue is thanks to a meaningful jump in average selling prices (ASPs). Mac ASPs hit $1,392 during the quarter -- the highest level in nearly a decade. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. The Mac hit a March quarter revenue record. The new MacBook Pros launched alongside a price bump -- not uncommon for when Apple introduces redesigned products to help absorb the higher cost curve -- and start at $1,499 for the 13-inch model without a Touch Bar. The 15-inch model starts at $2,399 but reaches up to $4,299 if you add all the bells and whistles. Then you could easily spend another $100 to $200 on dongles alone (which are technically recognized in the other products segment and don't affect Mac ASP). On the call, CFO Luca Maestri noted, "Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market." Apple stopped disclosing the mix of laptops vs. desktops years ago, so we don't know how many laptops Apple shipped in unit terms, but consumers have been shifting to laptops since the dawn of time. Still, it's safe to say that the new MacBook Pros are indeed proving quite popular, and that becomes abundantly clear when looking at ASP trends. Besides, it's not as if there was some catalyst driving sales of other high-end Macs, and it's clear that the Mac Pro isn't aging well. Apple's used to it Ultimately, Apple is accustomed to this sort of backlash, which arises every few years when it forces some new standard upon consumers and the industry at large. When Apple kicked off the USB-C transition with the 12-inch MacBook, marketing chief Phil Schiller told Mashable, "We found that the best thing we could do is push boundaries beyond what's expected, beyond what's comfortable sometimes." CEO Tim Cook also likes to tell a story of his first day at Apple in the late '90s. When he showed up, there were customers protesting outside because Steve Jobs had axed the Newton. Cook's takeaway was that Apple customers are often quite vocal and passionate, so much that they would go protest at Apple headquarters, but that passion translates into loyalty. Professionals may have vocally protested against dongles, but they're still buying MacBook Pros. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Apple saw its iPhone shipments in China slide 26.7% on year to 9.6 million units in the first quarter, accounting for a 9.2% share compared to 11% of a quarter earlier and 12.7% of a year earlier, the data showed. Echoing the data, Apple revenues generated from the China market declined 12% on year to US$16.2 billion in the January-March period, according to Apple's latest financial report. However, Huawei managed to ramp up its shipments by 25.5% on year to 20.8 million units in the first quarter and reclaimed the top-vendor position from the local rival Oppo. Huawei also saw its share climb to 20% in the quarter, up from 16.8% a quarter earlier and 16% a year earlier, IDC said. Oppo ranked second with shipments totaling 18.9 million units for an 18.2% share, while Vivo shipped 14.6 million and took third position with a 14.1% share. Huawei has established more than 1,000 experience shops in core cities in China recently to counter the established channels set up by Oppo and Vivo, according to sources from Taiwan's handset supply chain. Huawei also aims to set up over 15,000 retail shops globally, the sources added. Oppo currently has a total of over 200,000 online and offline sales outlets in China, while Vivo has 250,000 offline sales outlets, indicated the sources. Overall, 104.1 million smartphones were shipped to the China market in the first quarter of 2017, representing a mere 1% on-year growth, IDC said.

(YouTube/Apple) Share Written by Josh Horwitz 3 hours ago China is changing. Apple is changing. And with that, Apple’s depiction of China is changing. On May 1 Apple released an advertisement titled “The City,” on YouTube. The advertisement features a young Chinese couple taking selfies (using the iPhone 7 Plus’s touted “portrait mode”) as they eat noodles, visit the aquarium, and wander the streets of Shanghai. The voice of Karen O of the Brooklyn band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs plays in the background, and in the end, the text “focus on what you love” appears on screen. It’s a markedly different approach than two previous Apple ads featuring China. “The City” highlights Shanghai’s cosmopolitanism and appears to be aimed at an audience of global citizens wherever they are—it’s part of a broader campaign that has included an AirPods ad shot in Mexico City, and a Portrait Mode ad shot in Spain. The two earlier China ads, though, carefully highlighted themes for a different kind of Chinese viewer. Apple’s first TV spot for China, titled “The Old Record” in English, arrived in 2015. It’s an adaptation of Apple’s 2014 Christmas-themed advertisement, but with Chinese flourishes. In it, a young Chinese woman digitizes a vinyl recording of an old Chinese pop song (“Forever Smiling” by Pan Dihua, popular in the 1960s) as a gift to her grandmother. The set consists of a old Shanghai alleyway and a dusty apartment that looks nothing like the the modern flats most Chinese iPhone owners live in. Apple published the ad in time for Chinese New Year. Its second Chinese spot, released last year during Chinese New Year, featured pop musicians—Li Zongsheng, Li Jianqing, and Bai An—recording a New Year tune over an iPad. The ad was stylized much like a music video, with Chinese lyrics to the song appearing at the bottom of the screen. By comparison, Apple’s new “The City” ad takes a very different direction. It treats China as a motif for global hipsterdom, one equally relatable to jetsetting foreigners watching it on YouTube, and the Chinese with enough money and leisure time to frolic around with an iPhone. What explains the change in direction? It’s possible Apple found that its target Chinese customers relate more to the urban playground Shanghai of “The City” than the Shanghai depicted in “The Old Song.” While carrier subsidies help make the iPhone more affordable for the average Chinese person, the country’s smartphone market is largely dominated by low and mid-tier Android devices. Consumers that can comfortably afford an iPhone are likely just as steeped in international pop culture and indie US bands as they are in Chinese pop culture. Overseas brands and production studios are also sensing that the Chinese feel pandered to when they see movies peppered with not-so-subtle nods to Chinese culture. The Great Wall, for example, a Hollywood-China co-production that pits Matt Damon alongside a Chinese cast in an action film filled with historical references, got trashed by Chinese film critics. One common critique from reviewers was that references to Chinese culture felt forced and insincere. Apple is in a very different position in China now than it was two years ago. After a monster reception for the iPhone 6 series, the company has suffered negative sales growth in the country for five quarters in a row. The slump appears likely to continue for the at least rest of the year, as most Chinese consumers who wanted to buy an iPhone now already have one. Unless the iPhone 8 contains noticeable improvements on the iPhone 7, many consumers will likely hold off replacing their still-functional old devices. And those that will buy a new phone are more likely to have Karen O in their iTunes than Pan Dihua.

The latest report released by Strategy Analytics showed Friday the gap of the average selling price between the two tech giants’ long-term evolution phones widened to a record-breaking $465 in the fourth quarter of last year. Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy S8, which was launched in the second quarter this year, was not included in the research. In the October to December period, the average selling price of Apple‘s LTE phones peaked to $692, while that of Samsung’s LTE phones stood at $227.  During the period, Apple‘s iPhone 7 enjoyed a boom while Samsung had to fill in the gap left by the discontinued Note 7 with its low-end phones. “The widening gap between the two handset makers is not temporary and it is likely to further rise,” the SA report said. The widening price gap is driven by the differing sales strategies of Apple and Samsung. Apple, which has focused on premium phones, has maintained an average selling price of around $600 since 2012, with the price now closer to $700. Samsung, which has unveiled diverse phone models, has lowered its average selling price of $438 in 2012 to around $200 now. Samsung has increased market share in emerging nations with its budget phones, including the Galaxy A, J and C series, while targeting the premium phone market with the Galaxy S series.

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 15 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth nothing that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top tog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display. Data is preliminary and subject to change. Company shipments are branded device shipments and exclude OEM sales for all companies.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k... Normally I generate eighty bucks each hr and even work for three to 4 hours majority of the days.And wonderful thing about this is exactly that one could manage time when you work and for how long as you like and you achieve a paycheck per week. ---->>>LEARN MORE Regarding It here-> http://s.id/272 mfofofipf Kumnaa The most recent Nexus 7 is almost 4 years old now though :( Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small.

According to a report by Bloomberg, Qualcomm is preparing an appeal asking the United States International Trade Commission (ITA) to block iPhone imports into the country. The past couple of years have been tough for Qualcomm, legally speaking. In February of 2015, the chipmaker paid 900 million dollars to settle an anti-trust dispute in China, in December it paid 800-million-dollars to settle an anti-trust dispute in South Korea, and in January the FTC sued it for bullying the industry. The root of Apple and Qualcomm’s feud can be found with Qualcomm’s cellular communications technology patents that licensees acquire for a hefty royalty fee that Apple recently decided to withhold. Why is Apple withholding Qualcomm’s royalty fees? An investor asked Apple CEO Tim Cook the same question at Apple's earnings call this week, and he responded: Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That’s both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don’t believe that a – I don’t believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we’re withholding royalties, you can’t pay something when there’s a dispute about the amount. You don’t know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn’t been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we’re depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we’re pursuing this is that Qualcomm’s trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it’s one small part of what an iPhone is. It’s not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don’t think that’s right, and so we’re taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we’re in the right, and I’m sure they believe that they are. And that’s what courts are for. And so we’ll let it go with that. Apple, with the iPhone 7, also started using Intel’s modems, but didn’t abandon Qualcomm entirely. In tests, iPhones with Qualcomm’s modems were not only establishing a stronger LTE connection but also provided an overall 30% increase in performance. Just days after FTC sued Qualcomm, Apple followed with three lawsuits, first in the US, then in China, and finally in the UK. In March, Qualcomm countersued Apple, alleging that the iPhone-maker misrepresented its chips’ performance against Intel. The USITC may seem like the next logical step after these recent court disputes, but it remains unconfirmed at the time of this writing. In an email to Mashable, USITC Public Affairs Officer Peg O’Laughlin said that "no complaint has been filed with the Commission at this time.” Qualcomm and Apple’s feud is a convoluted mess, but it has only just started to unfold.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple joins ‘Made in America’ trend with $1 billion fund to promote US manufacturing Susie Ochs 5 May, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Manufacturing jobs (any jobs, really) are a hot-button topic these days and our President has made no secret of his desire for big companies, Apple in particular, to make more products here. In a Wednesday interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC’s Mad Money, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple is creating a fund to promote advanced manufacturing in the United States, and seeding it with $1 billion to start. CBNC.com has the video and a complete transcript of the wide-ranging conversation, and it’s worth a watch. These are the points that most piqued our interest (and one that just made us laugh). On creating jobs Cramer asks Cook straight up, “You’re a huge company. What are you doing to create jobs?” Cook responds that Apple has created two million jobs in the US, a stat he’s also mentioned in Tuesday’s Q2 earnings call. But this time he breaks it down, and naturally those workers aren’t all wearing Apple logos on their shirts. Still, a lot of them are: Cook speaks of 25,000 employees doing R&D; 6,000 at Apple’s facility in Austin, Texas; plus all the employees at Apple’s retail stores. That’s nowhere near two million, but Cook also counts US suppliers who make components here, like Corning glass and 3M adhesives used in iPhones and iPads. Cook also gives Apple credit for its huge developer community. “And this developer community is almost 1.5 million people now,” he says. “These are folks from really small businesses, a party of one, to larger companies. And they’re writing apps that change the world. And we’re giving them the platform. And we’ve created an incredible store that allows them to sell their product in 155 countries in the world. It’s a really unbelievable empowering experience as a new business.” Apple already invests in the developer community in different ways, from its new developer centre in India to smaller gestures like offering WWDC scholarships and letting newbie developers tinker with Xcode before paying for the Developer Program. Cook also tells Cramer that Apple will be putting more money behind teaching people to code, with announcements to come this summer. (Bet on WWDC.) But Cook goes on: “In the other category, manufacturing, we asked ourselves, ‘How can we get more people to do advanced manufacturing in the United States?’ And I’m proud to tell you that we’re creating an advanced manufacturing fund. We’re initially putting $1 billion in the fund.” The fund will invest in small American companies manufacturing products here. Cook says Apple will announce the first investment from the fund this month. Apple could focus on companies that make components, but we selfishly hope the fund’s investments lead to more advanced accessories for our favourite Apple gadgets, like smart bands for the Apple Watch, new kinds of HomeKit devices, or wireless charging accessories. On taxes When Cramer points out the $1 billion in seed money is a small slice of Apple’s $256 billion cash reserve, Cook points out that to get $1 billion in cash in the US, Apple would have to borrow some of it. “It’s $1 billion of our US money, which we have to borrow to get. That’s another whole topic,” he says. The other topic, of course, is taxes. Most of Apple’s cash reserves are held overseas, and Trump has spoken about a deal to let American companies in a similar position bring some of that cash home while getting a break on the taxes. Cramer continues, “You know, President Trump’s saying, ‘we’ve got to give him repatriation. Who knows what he’ll do with all that money over there. We’ve got to give them the tax break.’ I mean, would you work closely with the President to get some of these things done so that you can do more job creation?” Cook’s response is affirmative, of course. “I actually think comprehensive tax reform is so important to this economy. If you think about it, many, many companies now sell globally. If you sell globally, you earn money globally. If you earn money globally, you can’t bring it back into the United States unless you pay 35 percent plus your state tax. And you look at this and you go, ‘this is kind of bizarre.’ You want people to use this money in the United States to invest more.” “We are in a good position, but an unusual one,” Cook continues. “Our good position is we can borrow. And so to invest in the United States, we have to borrow. This doesn’t make sense on a broad basis, and the administration, you saw that they’re really getting this, and want to bring this back. And I hope that that comes to pass.” Hinting at new products? Apple doesn’t talk about products in the pipeline, but that doesn’t stop every interviewer from asking anyway. Cramer asks about everything. Tim demurs every time. “Car?” Cramer tries. “I can’t say,” Cook replies. “I can’t say that.” When Cramer asks about Health, Cook mentions losing 30 pounds with the help of his Apple Watch, then Cramer quickly moves on to artificial intelligence. Cook: “I don’t want to get into details, but there’s a lot more there.” Cook himself then brings up augmented reality, but only to give his vague stock answer: “This is something we’re really excited about.” Cramer even plays the Dad Card, pleading with Cook for the release date of the next iPhone, “because I want to get my daughter a new phone. I just need to know when.” (Nice try, Cramer – does any parent really want to get their kid a new phone? Or did he mean he wants his own new phone and will give his old one to the kid?) Cook tells him to get an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus.

Apple captured 16 percent market share and became the world's largest wearables vendor, overtaking Fitbit and staying slightly ahead of Xiaomi who sells bottom line devices. Steven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, "Global wearables shipments reached 22.0 million units in Q1 2017, rising 21 percent annually from 18.2 million in Q1 2016. Stronger demand for new smartwatch models in North America, Western Europe and Asia drove the uptick."   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said, "Apple shipped 3.5 million wearables worldwide in Q1 2017, rising 59 percent annually from 2.2 million units in Q1 2016. Apple captured 16 percent global market share and overtook Fitbit to become the world's largest wearables vendor. The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence. Xiaomi shipped 3.4 million wearables for 15 percent market share worldwide in Q1 2017. Demand for its popular Mi Band fitness range was broadly flat across its core markets of Asia."   Cliff Raskind, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, "Fitbit shipped 2.9 million wearables worldwide in Q1 2017, falling a huge 36 percent annually from 4.5 million in Q1 2016. Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitness bands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market. Fitbit's shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year."   According to a report by ABI Research last month "The enterprise smartwatch market is set to see a large amount of growth, reaching nearly 14 million shipments in 2022, up from just over 2 million in 2017." This is definitely a market Apple will be pursuing.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The change -- hinted at by InvenSense’s finance chief in August -- comes as the San Jose, California-based maker of motion-sensing chips seeks to complete its $1.3 billion sale to TDK Corp., a deal partly aimed at boosting the Japanese company’s business with Apple. InvenSense shares declined more than 5 percent in extended trading Thursday. Bosch may supply as much as half of these components for the new iPhone, with InvenSense supplying the rest, the person said. Bosch already supplies barometric pressure sensors for the iPhone, according to product teardowns by iFixit and other firms that analyze the guts of gadgets. Representatives for Apple, InvenSense and Bosch declined to comment. TDK didn’t respond to requests for comment outside of normal business hours in Japan. The risks of losing Apple as a customer were recently highlighted by chip developer Imagination Technologies Plc., which said in April that the iPhone maker would stop using its intellectual property within two years. The U.K. company’s stock plunged as much as 69 percent. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook tries to source components from at least two suppliers, making it easier to negotiate cheaper prices. Apple accounts for about 60 percent of InvenSense revenue, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis. Apple is expected to unveil a major upgrade to the iPhone later this year to mark the 10th anniversary of the groundbreaking device. Analysts expect consumers to buy millions of the new gadgets, generating huge orders for component suppliers. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The components produced by Bosch and InvenSense contain gyroscopes and accelerometers. Gyroscopes can tell if a phone is being held horizontally or vertically, being shaken, or pointing in a particular direction. An accelerometer detects different movements, such as side-to-side motion. Together, the sensors help measure step count, and they’re useful for mobile games and augmented reality applications. In the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, these were supplied exclusively by InvenSense, according to teardowns. InvenSense Chief Financial Officer Mark Dentinger said at an August investor conference that as recently as 2014 it was dominant "by a considerable margin" at the top end of the smartphone market. “We’re still the largest player, but we are splitting some share now with our primary competitor,” he added. “Historically, it’s unlikely that most of our customers will have just one supplier over a long, long period of time.” TDK, which rose to prominence on cassette tapes in the 1970s, has since expanded into batteries, automotive components and now the Internet of Things. The Tokyo-based company received regulatory clearance to acquire InvenSense on April 18. Apple was already one of TDK’s biggest customers before the Japanese company agreed to buy InvenSense in December. “We aim to become a strong player in the sensor business with InvenSense as our perfect partner,” TDK CEO Shigenao Ishiguro said at the time.

The S&P 500 technology index, which includes Apple Inc, will hit US$5 trillion in about two months if its growth of 16 per cent so far in 2017 continues at the same pace. Apple is already the world's most valuable publicly traded company, and its weight within the S&P 500 in recent decades has been rivalled only by Exxon Mobil and Microsoft. The iPhone maker's market capitalisation recently reached a record US$774 billion after increasing 27 per cent so far in 2017. If Apple continues to grow at that rate, its market capitalisation will hit US$1 trillion in October. “Investors see the big numbers, the hoopla surrounding hitting one of these arbitrary levels...” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. "Hitting those milestones often attracts more investors,” she added. Apple accounted for as much as 4.9 per cent of the S&P 500 in September 2012, but its share of the index has since slipped to 3.8 per cent. In comparison, Exxon Mobil accounted for 5.3 per cent of the S&P 500 in December 2008, while Microsoft briefly accounted for 4.9 per cent of the index in 2000. Apple recently accounted for 15.1 per cent of the S&P 500 technology index, down from a peak of 21.8 per cent in 2012. The technology index recently traded at 17.4 times expected earnings, down a little from a month ago but otherwise near highs not seen since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Shares of Apple edged down 0.3 per cent on Wednesday after the company reported its March-quarter results on Tuesday and said sales of iPhones fell, surprising investors. Still, at least four analysts raised their share price target for Apple. While global smartphone sales have lost steam in recent years, investors remain optimistic that Apple will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with new models that give a major boost to sales. The median analyst 12-month price target for Apple on Wednesday was US$160. Hitting that target implies a 9 per cent rise from current levels, which would put Apple's market capitalisation at US$836 billion, excluding the effect of potential stock buybacks. Still, analyst price targets are a poor predictor of stock performance, and a stock's past performance often says little about what it will do in the future. In February, Warren Buffett told CNBC that Apple was likely to hit a US$1 trillion market value before his own holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of US$410 billion after its stock rose 2 per cent so far in 2017. Steep stock gains driven by optimism about upcoming iPhones are unlikely to continue at the same pace, said Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities. But he recommends the stock and even increased his own price target to US$160 from US$155 following Apple's quarterly report. “It's a value play that should be bought at current levels,” Seyrafi said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World buying US diesel as fast as refiners can make it Bank of Japan, Bank Negara to conclude US$3b swap arrangement Ringgit opens lower against US dollar Bursa retreats after opening marginally higher GE CEO warns against US protectionism, wants level playing field Firefly says cut Penang flights due to weak ringgit, competition Bitcoin soars above US$1,400 to all-time high Singapore Air may land unfamiliar net-debt spot by 2018 Ringgit rebounds as Asia’s FX laggards turn leaders of pack Manufacturing sector improves after two years Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Hawn, Russell honoured with twin Walk of Fame stars Reuters Video: VR to help patients suffering from balance problems Reuters Video: Twin sisters give birth to boys on same day Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles Apple to create US$1b advanced US manufacturing fund Apple posts surprise dip in iPhone sales, shares fall (VIDEO) Apple touts greater use of recycled metal in gadgets China targets lives-streaming apps in new Apple encroachment (VIDEO) Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone’s 10th anniversary Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Through participatory and immersive experiences, the Center will tell Barack and Michelle Obama’s story, while lifting the hood on the mechanics of change and inspiring visitors to spark their own. You don’t lift the hood on mechanics. You lift the hood on a car, and mechanics work under that hood. And are users really going to “spark their own” “mechanics of change”? Will the mechanics be bending over when they get sparked? Honestly, the whole site is full of hollow-sounding, Orwellian deadness, and the projects is obviously going to suck up a great deal of money (for Google VR to handle those “participatory and immersive experiences,” for example). Ka-ching. “This evening, Obama discusses his Center and his two-terms in the White House in a closed-to-the press dinner before Chicago’s wealthy and civic elite, the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago” [Chicago Sun-Times]. “The dinner will take place at The Chicago Club, 81 E. Van Buren. Obama’s speech was not publicly announced by either the Obama Foundation or his post-presidential office. Obama has come under some criticism for taking a $400,000 speaking engagement later this year. An Obama source told the Sun-Times Obama is not charging for his appearance before the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.” Well, no. He’s collecting for it, right? I mean, come on. 2020 “Stars turn out for Planned Parenthood gala honoring Clinton” [AP]. It’s like she never left, isn’t it? Readers, this is perhaps the time to explain that last night I had a dream, and this was my dream: I was speaking to Hillary Clinton — she was wearing a tweedy, Chanel-style heather-colored jacket — and told her that while I supported her in 2008 (true!), “I don’t think you should run in 2020.” Although she said nothing, her face froze; her body language was very, very negative. The bright side is that now I can file all the Clinton stories under 2020. “I Tattooed Chelsea Clinton’s Face on My Body and I Regret Nothing” [Vice]. 2016 Post Mortem “The first thing I remember feeling about the 2016 US election was a kind of speechlessness. On 9 November, no one had any idea what to say in the bars and pubs in New York. Conversations could take place only in the form of mutual interrogation. No one had any declarative sentences to offer. The only consensus was that no one knew what happened” [Guardian]. “That consensus is now gone – every woman on the street can riff on the Russians, James Comey and the creaky electoral system – but the anxiety remains. The engine of all argument right now is a very bitter sort of fear we felt right after the whole thing blew up.” “We”? “ Every woman”? Our Famously Free Press “Facebook enters war against psy-ops and fake news, acknowledges election hijinks” [Ars Technica]. OK, if state-sponsored psy-ops in the news-flow need to be eradicated, does that include the Bush administration’s WMDs operation? “There are two big problems with America’s news and information landscape: concentration of media, and new ways for the powerful to game it” [The Atlantic].

Let’s be open to the possibility that protesting to try to get college administrators to do stuff doesn’t translate well to other political environments… “The Zogby Poll: Trump overall approval down, but up among Hispanics” [Zogby Analytics]. Stats Watch Readers: Lots of material today, because I’m including yesterday’s Stats, too. –lambert Productivity and Costs, Q1 2017 (First Estimate): “It took more hours to produce at a slower rate in the latest quarter in what is yet another unfavorable productivity report” [Econoday]. “Weak productivity raises the cost of labor which came in well above expectations at an annualized 3.0 percent.” You say “raises the cost of labor” like that’s a bad thing! Factory Orders, March 2017: “Factory orders, like much of the economy, fizzled in March, up only 0.2 percent and skewed higher for a third month in a row by aircraft” [Econoday]. “Aircraft had a weak year last year and have been making up lost ground so far this year. But how long Boeing can give total orders a lift is uncertain, and the performance of the wider factory sector, despite sky high strength in many anecdotal reports, has been no better than mixed.” And but: “According to the seasonally adjusted data, it was military aircraft that caused the increase” [Econintersect]. “The data in this series is noisy so I would rely on the unadjusted 3 month rolling averages which was improved. Note that when one inflation adjusts, the numbers are good but not as good as the headlines. Backlog improved – but remains in contraction year-over-year.” ADP Employment Report, April 2017 (yesterday): “ADP’s estimate isn’t going to rattle any nerves ahead of April employment, at 177,000 and right in line with expectations for what is expected to be solid payroll growth in Friday’s report” [Econoday]. “There is little immediate reaction to today’s results.” Jobless Claims, week of April 29, 2017: “Week-to-week volatility has been pronounced but the trend in jobless claims is clearly favorable” [Econoday]. Gallup Good Jobs Rate, April 2017: “The U.S. workforce participation rate essentially held steady at 67.6 percent in April, little changed from 67.8 percent in March. The rate is roughly the same as a year ago, when workforce participation was 67.3 percent” [Econoday]. “The percentage of the population who is underemployed rose to 14.0 percent in April, up from 13.5 percent last month. The current underemployment rate is roughly equal to that of January (14.1 percent) and February (13.9 percent), as well as a year ago (13.8 percent). Underemployment is still far better than its high point of 20.3 percent recorded in March 2010.” Challenger Job-Cut Report, April 2017: “Challenger’s layoff count for April is a moderate 36,602, right in line with recent trend and pointing to healthy conditions in the labor market ahead of tomorrow’s employment report” [Econoday]. “Retail has been at the top of the layoff list all year and is once again in April, at 11,669. Next is autos at 3,424 and health care at 3,153.” And: “Employers have announced a total of 162,803 planned job cuts through the first four months of 2017. That is down 35 percent from the 249,061 job cuts tracked during the same period a year ago. It is the lowest January-April total since 2014, when the opening four months of the year saw 161,639 job cuts” [Econintersect]. Gallup U.S. Job Creation Index, April 17 (yesterday): “Gallup’s job creation index reading was plus 36 in April, one point off the record high of plus 37 in March. The Midwest led the regions at plus 42 — the first time any region has topped plus 40 in the nine-year history of the index” [Econoday]. “Workers in the Midwest became increasingly likely to say their companies were hiring rather than firing in April, even as workers elsewhere reported more stagnant job creation patterns. In the other three U.S. regions, the East, South and West, the job creation index dropped one point each from March.” Hmm. Trump country. Purchasing Managers’ Services Index, April 2017 (yesterday): “Order growth is described as subdued and, in what is a negative indication for Friday’s employment report, the sample reported the weakest growth in hiring in nearly 7 years” [Econoday]. “Despite the late April bounce in the headline, there are plenty of red signals in this report that don’t point to a second quarter surge for the economy.” Institute For Supply Management Non-Manufacturing Index, April 2017 (yesterday): “Two different samples and two very different results from PMI services, which was released earlier this morning and was very soft, and ISM non-manufacturing which is pointing to sharp acceleration” [Econoday]. “O]ne detail both this report and PMI services do agree on is that hiring during April was slow. This is not a positive indication for Friday’s employment report where solid growth is the expectation.” But: “This suggests faster expansion in April than in March” [Calculated Risk]. International Trade, March 2017: “Breaking down the data between goods and services shows a small widening in the goods deficit to $65.5 billion offset in part by a modest looking but still constructive $0.4 billion dollar rise in the surplus on services. The overall decline in exports and imports is a concern, but today’s report has several positives, not only the surplus on services but also the rise in capital goods exports” [Econoday]. “On the import side most components are lower especially capital goods in what, along with capital goods shipments and nonresidential construction spending, is another contrast with the first-quarter GDP surge in nonresidential investment.” And but: “But the data in this series wobbles and the 3 month rolling averages are the best way to look at this series. The 3 month averages are accelerating” [Econintersect]. “This data will have minimal impact on 1Q2017 GDP.” And: “Exports are 15% above the pre-recession peak and up 9% compared to March 2016; imports are 1% above the pre-recession peak, and up 7% compared to March 2016” [Calculated Risk]. “In general, trade has been picking up, but has declined slightly the last two months.” Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, week of April 20, 2017: “The consumer comfort index, like other confidence readings, continues to hold at expansion highs” [Econoday]. MBA Mortgage Applications, week of April 28, 2017 (yesterday): “Rose a seasonally adjusted 4 percent” [Econoday]. “The strong rebound in purchase applications stands in sharp contrast to refinancing.” Credit: “Borrowing by small U.S. firms stalled in March, as business owners remained cautious about investing amid policy uncertainty, data released on Monday showed” [Reuters]. Retail: “Retail Bankruptcies Are Rising Fast: 10 Companies That May Be Next” [247 Wall Street]. This article is dangerously close to stock-picking, but I’m including it because — granted, I may be showing my age, here — the only brand I recognize is Sears. And you can certainly argue that Sears — despite owning the most depressing store I have ever entered, at the Bangor Mall — is a “squillionaire with bright ideas” story, not an “Internet’s killing retail” story. Auto: “[Motor vehicle sales were] low and worse than expected, and inline with the deceleration in bank auto lending, as previously discussed, which doesn’t bode well for other sales measures tied to credit expansion” [Mosler Economics]. Auto: “Big Summer Shutdowns Loom for U.S. Auto Plants as Sales Sputter” [Bloomberg]. “Manufacturers used to shut plants for a week or two in July for maintenance and to keep inventories in check. As sales boomed in recent years, most factories cranked out cars without a break. This summer, widespread closures may be back, and for weeks longer than before. The reason: four straight months of declining sales and little expectation the trend will reverse anytime soon.” This too is Trump country. Auto: “A surprising drop in U.S. auto demand is sending shudders through the industry’s global supply chain. GM’s sales declined 5.8% in April from a year ago, and Ford and Fiat Chrysler reported drops of around 7%, leaving a glut of unsold cars and trucks on dealers’ lots. The weak figures threaten a nearly eight-year winning streaK for the auto industry, and some manufacturers are already shutting down some production… Auto makers have already scaled back work on passenger cars as fuel prices have remained low, shifting factory output to gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs. But demand for those vehicles is looking shaky as well, putting assembly-line workers and parts suppliers on notice” [Wall Street Journal]. Shipping: “Significance of Stack Date and why it is important” [Shipping and Freight Resource]. For container geeks. And something to consider for those trying to automate the supplly chain… Shipping: “Leading shippers are increasingly using supply chains as strategic tools – as a business enabler, revenue driver and differentiator, according to supply chain expert and author Mark Millar, who says the latest strategic thinking is that “supply chain is the business” of many companies that are not ostensibly logistics specialists” [Lloyd’s List]. “‘Twenty-first-century supply chains have transformed into worldwide inter-connected supply-and-demand networks – exposed to the vulnerabilities of our uncertain world – and with profound interdependencies,’ he adds. ‘This has led to greater deployment of collaborative partnerships, frequently involving outsourcing and off-shoring, creating elongated webs that embrace multiple stakeholders.'” The author is a consultant talking his deck. But it’s an interesting deck. Shipping: “The U.S. maritime regulator has rejected an application by Japan’s three biggest shipping companies to operate as a merged company while their transaction is still being finalized back home” [Wall Street Journal]. The Bezzle: “Uber’s ‘upfront’ pricing is helping it overcharge passengers” [Quartz]. An Uber driver agreed to share their data: “Over 165 trips from early March to early April, Uber overcharged this driver’s passengers by a total of $85.54. In other words, the total upfront fares paid by riders were that much higher than the fares used to calculate driver pay. The company lost money overall on UberPool, its carpooling service, but more than made it up by overcharging customers who booked trips on UberX and its other private ride options.” The Bezzle: “Uber and Waymo Duel at Key Hearing Over Driverless Car Technology” [New York Times]. “At stake is what Uber and Waymo both believe could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity in the transportation industry in which autonomous cars move people around without the need or expense of human drivers.” The Bezzle: “Major NYC Crime Ring Used Fake Uber Drivers to Hide Drug Deals: Sources” [NBC New York]. “As part of the operation, the six suspects placed fake Uber logos and stickers on vehicles to fit into the neighborhoods and not raise suspicions, according to sources. Heroin and cocaine were sold to more than 100 customers in upper Manhattan and the Bronx, the sources said. The dealers weren’t drivers for Uber and it appears they didn’t use the Uber app, but they did utilize the company’s logo to disguise their vehicles while making deliveries, sources said.” That’s so meta. Is there something about the sharing economy that attracts crooks?

The provision, part of a last-minute amendment, lets states obtain waivers from certain Affordable Care Act insurance regulations. Insurers in states that obtain the waivers could be freed from a regulation mandating that they cover 10 particular types of health services, among them maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health treatment and hospitalization.” “Proposed High Risk Pool Funding Likely Insufficient to Cover Insurance Needs for Individuals with Pre-Existing Conditions” [Avalere] “Compare Proposals to Replace The Affordable Care Act” [Kaiser Health News]. “Infographic: How Does U.S. Health Care Stack Up to the Developed World?” [Foreign Policy].

They found that there had been a sudden and dramatic increase in the amount of wastewater injected in the first half of 2013 at some of the wells.

This represents an increase from 12% in 2013. In contrast, only 4% of those living in households earning $100,000 or more fell into this category in either year.

Donate $25$50$75$100 00200 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Water Cooler on May 4, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Irises can be transplanted pretty easily. We split out our bulbs last year and I think we had a 100% transplant success with a whole mess of them. They are really great blooms. Smells like you’re getting away with something. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 4, 2017 at 3:04 pm Apparently irises are not tasty to deer and elk, making them good plantings for Wildland-Urban Interface areas [this is an actual term used in California codes]. Though I’ve heard of elk ripping them out, giving the irises a couple of chews, spitting them out — ptui! — then moving on to tastier lawns. It’s their version of wine tasting: sniff, swirl in the mouth, expectorate. Reply ↓ polecat May 4, 2017 at 5:44 pm Al parts of the Iris are poisonous …. so don’t lick your fingers after transplanting … especially children ! Make sure they wear gloves, and wash up after helping in the garden !! Reply ↓ a different chris May 4, 2017 at 3:45 pm >Irises can be transplanted pretty easily I would like to have Irises again, but I was always forced to transplant since I might get a decent 2nd year but after that grass has always completely invaded the iris patch. Since they pretty much sit on the ground surface I couldn’t mulch them like I could stuff like peonies. So how do you keep the grass from invading? Or do I just have a particularly virulent form of grass? Reply ↓ Ivy May 4, 2017 at 7:58 pm Strip off the grass, a healthy workout that avoids the use of Roundup. Then put down landscape mesh with holes for the irises, and add mulch. Reply ↓ JohnnyGL May 4, 2017 at 2:19 pm https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-will-democrats-demand-of-their-2020-nominee/ Interesting read to see where the 538 pundits see things. First part on health care and min wage, they all agree that the Dem base and electorate are moving left on econ issues and the 2020 nominee will probably need to reflect that change. My favorite part is how Nate Silver himself rapidly transitions from Single-Payer to something called a “supercharged public option”. I don’t know about the rest of the Nakedcap community, but I’m always in favor of anything that’s “supercharged”. I mean, it can’t be another bait-and-switch, can it???? LOL?!?!?! In other news, none of them seem terribly convinced by Cuomo or Booker. Much like the rest of the public, I suppose. Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 2:48 pm Having seen Booker in action, I would not count him out. I may not get it, but the guy has both charisma, crowd and individual people skills. Cuomo, has about as much chance of being President as Jeb Bush did after Trump. But it is nice of Nate to finally notice that 1.) the majority of the public has already moved ‘far left’ as defined today on certain core issues like having health care and getting a long over due raise, and 2.) that politicians also have to notice that. Too bad he hasn’t figured out they are not so accepting of pretty words signifying nothing like ‘Affordable Care’. Reply ↓ Uahsenaa May 4, 2017 at 4:38 pm Booker is decent in person, but he has the massive albatross of Wall Street money hanging around his neck, just like Clinton. Not to mention, he’s already been called out several times for some of his dodgier votes in the Senate. It wouldn’t take a whole lot for a primary opponent to paint him the way Sanders did Clinton, and he wouldn’t necessarily have the benefit of a predetermined DNC coronation to protect him from that criticism like she did in the 2016 primaries. If single-payer wins out in CA, then it will be much harder for those aspiring to progressive-hood to hide behind weasel policies like the public option, be it super-charged or no. And free college tuition (admittedly, of a limited sort) has already made headway in New York. The Overton window has moved substantially just since the election. Primary Dems will be hard-pressed to pretend the political landscape even resembles that of 2016, much less 2008, when things like the public option were de rigeur.

I don’t care how many sidewalks he shoveled in Newark. A majority of voters in those states are wise to the neoliberal game. If Brexit (and the likely result of the French runoff) are any clue, the austerity and ID politics blend is completely played out.

If he was the Democratic governor of Wyoming despite his New York roots, that would be one thing,but he has been governor of New York and has not developed anything beyond appearing to really want to run for President. Sanders did best among people who receive their news from the internet which means they have unfiltered access to his past. They don’t rely on Maddow. Sanders isn’t just some guy saying nice things. He has a record much like Hillary. One has fought for women and children, and one, as Jimmy Dore put it, sounded like a female Bill O’Reilly in the 90’s. Going forward, candidates will not be able to hide from the past. The Clintons are gone beyond spoilers, and no Democrat holds popular power anymore.

Reply ↓ allan May 4, 2017 at 2:24 pm Anti-antidote: Noise pollution is invading even the most protected natural areas [Science] The great outdoors is becoming a lot less peaceful. Noise pollution from humans has doubled sound levels in more than half of all protected areas in the United States—from local nature reserves to national parks—and it has made some places ten times louder, according to a new study. And the cacophony isn’t just bad for animals using natural sounds to hunt and forage—it could also be detrimental to human health. … The excess noise can do more than just annoy park visitors. It can also undo the benefits of spending time in nature, like improved mood and memory retention. For plants and animals, the ruckus can disrupt entire communities. Some plants need silence for seed dispersal—revving cars can scare away rodents that might otherwise do the job. Animals need silence to hear predators approaching or to communicate with their mates: A bird whose song would normally travel 100 meters would, with a tenfold increase in noise, have its melody stifled to a 10-meter radius. “In so many landscapes, both people and other organisms are living in shrunken perceptual worlds,” says Clinton Francis, an ecologist at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, who was not involved in the work. … Where some see “shrunken perceptual worlds” others see disruptive investment opportunities. Like access to fresh water, silence is not a human right but rather a scarce commodity that needs to be price discovered.

It took me a day to figure out what was SO different: no airplanes ever flew overhead the whole 5 days I was there. I told my friends about how lucky they are – well they do call Aus the Lucky Country for a reason – and they couldn’t quite relate to my excitement… albeit they “got” it intellectually.

Reply ↓ Big River Bandido May 4, 2017 at 6:26 pm That quote rings so true with me, and I admit don’t get enough time in nature because there’s so little of it in my urban neighborhood. But why shouldn’t “citizens” (residents of cities) also have the benefit of “peace and quiet space”? Amtrak’s Quiet Car is a great idea. Too bad Amtrak doesn’t really want it and won’t enforce their own policy to make it function, but their charade is exemplary of how the mob mentality has degraded public manners and the civility of the common space, and how institutions just don’t give a rat. Whether you’re in an open or enclosed area, the noise level in urban public spaces is out of control, and a great contributor to antisocial behavior in those environments. The constant screams of sirens, the paranoid wailing of car alarms, and the bleating and blaring from teevees and radios plays like the soundtrack of a psychotic nightmare which deprives people of sleep and peace of mind. One siren or car alarm in my neighborhood can ruin the sleep of a thousand people in four city blocks, and the sound travels a lot farther than that. I dread trips to the grocery store, for fear of being force-fed yet another insipid, skin-crawling record by Michael Bublé or Adam Lambert. And is there any wonder that travelers at the major airports are stressed out? If you go to LaGuardia or JFK or O’Hare, you can hear all kinds of music in the shops and terminal corridor speakers: “four on the floor” disco, EDM, urban contemporary, and so-called “chart hits”. All at once, along with teevees and cell phones. There’s a teevee monitor for CNN mounted into the ceilings — every fifteen to twenty feet. Often, Wolf Blitzer’s so loud he drowns out the announcements for your flight. If only there was so much as a square meter where you could wait for a flight and hear *none* of that, other than the announcements, but there isn’t, anywhere. And if somehow you *do* manage to find such a space, you can be sure that some asshole in a pinstriped suit and penny loafers, negotiating his next deal into his cell phone, will come and take the seat next to you — or, if there’s no seat there, he’ll pace up and down by the windows so that his voice bounces off the glass and can be heard by everyone at the gate. Oh, and those scenarios I just described? That’s what it’s like at 5AM. The rest of the day, it’s even worse. Sadly, one of the most offensive weapons of noise pollution is music — an art form intended to uplift and which at its best still does — but in its common and debased form it is used (and abused) like a stimulant. It’s like music only in the way that fast food is like…food. All these “commercial messages” compete for eyes and ears which mostly aren’t watching, and certainly aren’t listening, although that’s not the same thing as not hearing. Reply ↓ WhyPrivate?

While this terrible bill that’s going to make a bad situation worse is all on the GOP, the Democrats paved the way for it when they did have power. If this bill passes, and all the Democrats got is “In 2018, when we win the elections, we’ll restore Obamacare!”, AHCA is here to stay. Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 3:18 pm Well I will, largely because they doubled down on protect the ACA rather than saying: “okay this didn’t work because we tried ‘market based’ reform designed by Republicans rather than noticing what has worked the world over and going for single payer. You want it repealed, we understand why. Despite being better for some than we had before it is still too expensive and ends up denying too many care. What we want in America is Medicare for All. Now. And any repeal that is not single payer along the lines of Medicare for All is going to be just as bad OR worse than ACA, and will ultimately cost the American people personally and as taxpayers far too much money much of which will go into the pockets of Insurance company executives whose whole reason for business is to sell you insurance you don’t use, either because you don’t need it OR because they can deny you access to the health care you are paying to be able to get.” Reply ↓ PH May 4, 2017 at 6:28 pm None of the Dem candidates in GA special election put that on their campaign website. There are taboos that politicians and political consultants and even, some casual wingnuts running for Congress on a whim dare not say because they are convinced voters will not go along.

Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 6:06 pm There were many things that could have been used to get Lieberman to go along, none of it bully pulpit, all of it big stick.

But then Barry and Joe were besties, so much that Lieberman faced NO payback from the Dems for telling the world to vote for John McCain. They were on the same page, along with Baucus and the Emanuel brothers, and… Could Medicare for All be passed? Maybe not all at once, but they certainly could have done Medikids (which because of child health issues included prenatal and obstetrics) and maybe lowered the Medicare entry age to 50 or 55. With a plan leaked on every front page in America to continue to move towards covering every America after passage. There was a route for this. But frankly the reason we got the Heritage/Dole/Romney plan as rewritten by Insurance/pharma/private medical was BECAUSE it was the Republican plan and they thought it was going to be a win/win bipartisan health reform- the legacy of a lifetime. After they figured out it was going to be all theirs they couldn’t back out. I’ve always figured they just did it to avoid the embarrassment, walked away and hoped it would work the way the Republicans had said it would despite all evidence to the contrary. Reply ↓ Darius May 4, 2017 at 6:07 pm Why do nonRepublicans keep ignoring budget reconciliation? Is this willful self-disempowerment? The bill passed today is a budget reconciliation bill.

Most of the Democrats would have followed him anywhere in early 2009. The Republicans were afraid of him for the five minutes it took them to get his number. Even some of them may have been intimidated into voting for it the way Republicans intimidated a number of Democrats into voting for the Bush tax cuts. The Republicans never got 60 senators to vote for Bush’s tax cuts. They used budget reconciliation each time. The Republicans know all this. Democrats either don’t know this or don’t want to. Please people. Know basic procedure. Obama didn’t have to jump through hoops to pass a basic liberal agenda.

Reply ↓ Marina Bart May 4, 2017 at 8:06 pm Don’t forget that Obama and the Democratic establishment helped Lieberman the “independent” beat the actual Democratic candidate who was to Lieberman’s left, when Connecticut rejected Lieberman in the primary. They were working towards what they wanted: a situation where they could use more openly corporate sell-outs like Lieberman and Baucus as faux obstacles to make sure they had an excuse to not give citizens what they wanted and needed. It wasn’t an accident, and Obama wasn’t victimized by the Republicans. He started backtracking on every single of one his campaign promises practically the second the votes came in election night. Of course, he had already privately done this. It’s just that it started being revealed at that point.

Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 4, 2017 at 4:27 pm From the CNN article in the Links: Prior to the health reform law, consumers who have or who previously had medical issues — even if it were years earlier and completely resolved — could be denied coverage or charged much more in premiums. Obamacare remedies that by requiring insurers to cover everyone and charge them the same amount, regardless of their health history. Also, it mandates all policies cover 10 essential health benefits, including prescription drugs, hospitalization and doctors’ visits, so the sick could be assured their treatments are covered. “The rules under Obamacare were comprehensive,” said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation. This expansive coverage, however, comes with a high price tag. It bumps up the cost of premiums for everyone. That’s why the conservative Freedom Caucus set its sights on getting rid of these popular provisions. Related: Key GOP lawmakers flip on health care after Trump meeting Under the most recent version of the GOP repeal bill, states would be allowed to opt out of requiring insurers to cover everyone at the same price and to offer all 10 essential health benefits in all policies. This would likely lead insurers to jack up rates for those with pre-existing conditions who didn’t maintain continuous coverage and to offer skimpy plans that don’t pay for the treatments the sick need.</blockquote ——- 1. Is it still a plan if it doesn't offer 'doctors visits?' That is scary. And I have to ask, is it me not reading it correctly, or is it on the writer? 2. It bumps up the cost of premiums for everyone…those popular provisions. Probably the situation is more complex. Intuitively, more costly for everyone is not often associated with being popular. 3. jack up rates for those with pre-existing conditions who didn't maintain continuous coverage. Those with pre-existing conditions are today covered for those who are not paying a penalty. They are in 'continuous' coverage, are they not? And the risk is jacked up rates – that is, a money issue. The difference between Medicare for All, and Free Medicare for All is also a money issue. Reply ↓ Ian May 4, 2017 at 4:30 pm This is a gift to the corporate democrats as it provides cover for and shifts blame to the GOP in regards to a system that was well on its way to painfully dying. The people that keep focus on single payer will be blamed even more as well for worsening the situation. A lot more revisionism is coming our way as the terrible reality that was Obama will be made out to look like Trump is the root cause of what is going on. As stated earlier, if Trump wanted to destroy the Dems all he’d have to do is let ACA be run by the Dems and let that run it’s natural course, now the GOP own it. As shown by the first commenter. Political Kabuki. Reply ↓ Kaleckim May 4, 2017 at 5:15 pm I don’t buy the logic. The ACA was deeply flawed and not sustainable. How does that justify though creating a much worse program? Besides, the program being universal doesn’t matter to these right wing jackals. Social Security has been successful, near universal and popular, and yet they’ve been trying to privatize it for decades. They’ll try soon I’m sure. Reply ↓ Pat May 4, 2017 at 6:15 pm Unfortunately so many of them ran for so long on repealing Obamacare, they are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Their voters are not as stupid as Democrats are, they recognize that the fillibuster is bull. They are doing it to save face. Really look at what they are doing they are throwing it all to the states. The STATES are going to make it all worse. And when they go to run in 2018 or 20 or 22, they can face those voters and say I wasn’t the one that decided to do X, it was the state legislature and the governor. We gave them the tools to make it better, it isn’t my/our fault if they haven’t. It was the only way they could figure to get out of being the ones that said that because your kid had X they could be denied insurance (forget afford it, get it at all). Or your spouse…or you. Meanwhile they let the hurry up and die or get a job or win the lottery folks vote to let that happen as well. Reply ↓ Ian May 4, 2017 at 7:50 pm The Repubs need the Dems the same as the Dems need the Repubs. Back when Obama took over the Dems could have wiped out the Repubs if they had set forth in instituting even a modicum of policies that materially benefited ie. progressive policies the general populace, but they didn’t. They fundamentally betrayed their base and the people that voted them in leading to the rise of the Repubs which further hamstrung the Dems from being able to act in the interests of the general populace. Neither party has any interest in seeing the other party defeated as that continuing conflict allows for the fundamental continual betrayel of governing while behaving like a failed state and provides cover for both sides.The Dems need a boost to remain competitive and on a side note I personally think that Trump is sick of the job and wants to lose for the 2nd term. I don’t think he has the stomach to be a mass murdering war criminal like Bush or Clinton did and do. Reply ↓ Ian May 4, 2017 at 7:54 pm And betraying their bases is damn profitable for all involved.

Reply ↓ Ian May 4, 2017 at 8:29 pm This is my take, come 2018 2020, ACA is still in place and unrepealed. Where would the Dems be despite whatever the Repubs did, when the actual progressives could point to a collapsed ACA with severe escalating rates, terrible deductables and terrible networks. How would the Corporate Dems survive that when it is in essence their baby? The AHCA looks like it cut out some of the most popular elements and some of the most expensive ones too, worsening it but likely reducing the rate of escalating costs and preserving the exploitative crap built into it. So yes it is noticebly worse, but it also means the Dems get cover and the core of the system put in place is saved. Now the Dems will be able to point to ACA and say we were better off while the Repubs delay the death spiral and both sides strangle the progressives. Please correct me if I am wrong as I willingly admit, I rarely feel qualified too comment on this site and am always open to more complete perspectives. David Carl Grimes May 4, 2017 at 4:41 pm Why repeal Obamacare? Why not let it die a natural death? If there aren’t enough healthy people to subsidize the sick, then Obamacare will enter (or maybe has already entered) a death spiral. If it does, then the Democrats, Obama in particular, own that failure. Or does Trump need this win politically? Reply ↓ polecat May 4, 2017 at 6:25 pm I and mine did our best to hasten the demise of the ACA by giving it the one fingered salute this year ( by not paying into the extortionate individual mandate) !! .. and if the corrupt Senate, and by extension Pres.

We’d be stuck with the ACA which isn’t great but … True we might have single payer in a decade or so (possibly) as they may be pushing blowback as this is a bridge to far in a way the ACA wasn’t quite. But the mean time is a mean time indeed – so mostly try not to die before then, even if you think you have health insurance now, because you may not soon enough. Reply ↓ Marina Bart May 4, 2017 at 8:16 pm The ACA is dying anyway, it wouldn’t last ten years no matter what. It’s doing very little good as it is right now, and it’s doing it by handing huge amounts of grifter cash to the insurance industry, while setting a pretty creepy precedent about forcing citizens to give private companies money without getting anything back in return. And we’d be openly at war, right now, on the Russian Front, if Hillary had won. We’d be in an open shooting war in Syria, with the New York Times screaming about how it’s a fight for freedom and babies — even more than it already is. TPP would be the law of the land, which means the law of the global corporate ruling empire. Even if the Senate passes AHCA — which would hurt my family, I think (haven’t checked the details, but we’re vulnerable in couple of different ways) — I have no regrets about Hillary losing. None. She’s have the privatization of Social Security fast-tracked, too. I’m not sure the Freedom Caucus would have saved us again. She didn’t have Obama’s financial need to hide his venality while in office. She’s already been paid for what she was supposed to do. Reply ↓ Adamski May 4, 2017 at 8:30 pm Bernie 2020.

Or really they have some kind of expertise, such as it is, but also their own interest etc. going on there. I never bought we would be at war with Russia. Where the Trump administration will score in warlike-ness in general is a question for which we don’t have enough information to answer yet. Whether TPP comes back in some other form is a question for which we don’t have enough information to answer yet, the European one (TTIP) does not seem completely dead yet. One can say it’s a reprieve, but if this breather doesn’t even last a couple of years before one of these trade agreements is forced on us (Congress does still have Fast Track), it’s hard to say it was one at all frankly. AHCA can harm family members here too, in the long run if they need expanded Medicaid and it isn’t there. Since they still are able to afford ACA plans at present, as for changes to ACA plans like pre-existing conditions, I think blue states are going to block a lot of this stuff in their states (that’s not a certainty but I think it’s highly probable). So if it’s left up to the states, I think those living in deep blue states might avoid much of the purely insurance based changes. Red states are going to be ENTIRELY 3rd world by the time Republicans are done with them. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 4, 2017 at 4:48 pm Given Hillary and Bill’s political record and high negatives, yes, the people who put up those grifters are part of the problem. The people who ignored the lessons of previous policy attempts, including the warnings of the architect of social security about means tested unwieldy bureaucracies, are part of the problem. They are capable of knowing better and chose not to. They are not part of the solution going forward. Worrying about Obama’s legacy is a waste of time. People need to be honest about what ACA is and what its limitation are and why people were lied to {and they were lied to.} If you don’t $500, you don’t have insurance. This is most households.

Reply ↓ Vatch May 4, 2017 at 4:25 pm If the Democrats had used their power in 2009 to pass something good, we wouldn’t be worrying about repeal. Even if the Democrats had passed something good in 2009 or 2010, instead of The Thing that they did pass, the Republicans would still be trying to repeal it. They would probably claim that is costs too much or that it is socialism, so it must be repealed. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorMay 4, 2017 at 4:27 pm These things aren’t static.

Reply ↓ Vatch May 4, 2017 at 4:58 pm What you say is quite possible. But we’ll never know; it’s also possible that the Republicans would have won the Presidency in 2012, because Medicare for All would have proved that Obama is a socialist. We underestimate the power of big money in politics at our peril. People frequently vote against their interests, and many people simply don’t vote, which is also against their interests. Reply ↓ Vatch May 4, 2017 at 5:05 pm Clarification: When I said “Medicare for All would have proved that Obama is a socialist”, I meant that this is what Republicans would have claimed, and many people would have believed them.

Reply ↓ Jeff W May 4, 2017 at 5:23 pm “…it’s also possible that the Republicans would have won the Presidency in 2012, because Medicare for All would have proved that Obama is a socialist.” That’s possible but far more unlikely.

Actually, a lot of people did and do care, unfortunately. Try changing the mind of a person who believes that Social Security will be bankrupt 20 years from now.

Everyone in the US can (presumably) go to the doctor or the hospital without worrying about co-pays, co-insurance, co-deductibles. No one’s dealing with what’s in-network or out-of-network. No one has to fight with the insurance company about insurance claims or even be concerned that his or her insurance premium is paid on time. No one is going bankrupt because of medical bills. The Republicans are stuck with arguing that whatever system they’re proposing is somehow better than that. Reply ↓ Oregoncharles May 5, 2017 at 1:26 am Medicare has ” co-pays, co-insurance, co-deductibles.” The co-insurance can be quite substantial – I wound up paying an unexpected $1500 when I had surgery. The hospital had not predicted that. Granted, that was cheap surgery; but a lot of people would have been in deep trouble faced with that expense. It didn’t improve our situation any, either. Hence the call for IMPROVED Medicare for All. Reply ↓ Big River Bandido May 4, 2017 at 7:20 pm Programs that are truly universal are politically impervious because when everyone gains from the program, the constituency to defend the program mobilizes very naturally. ACA is a political sitting duck for two primary reasons: it benefits only *some* people, naturally alienating everyone else; and it’s designed not to deliver health care to people who need it, but to deliver health care customers to the insurance companies. That’s a much harder thing to defend. In my view, not worth defending at all — partly because its very presence tamps down the obvious appeal of the better solution, Medicare For All. Reply ↓ Praedor May 4, 2017 at 10:10 pm It would be politically impossible to repeal single-payer once it’s passed. EVERYONE having healthcare would scream bloody murder (and literally commit justified bloody murder) if the GOP tried to take healthcare away from so many people. Howls of outrage.

I encourage you to watch it. He really has the pulse of Wisconsin and I think the nation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJTN_BFNea0&ab_channel=Wis.community This entry is a game changer. Mike is Wisconsin’s Bernie Sanders. We have a non-partisan candidate who can run circles around the current Republican administration. I know many in the Dem party will support him. Some won’t and will throw daggers, but they don’t have the power of the people. Mike has broad support with grassroots people. He is the read deal.

Lots of time to decide how to do that. That choice alone will be interesting. There is a contested race for the chair of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin. Major challenger is a Bernie supporter. He was a Bernie delegate. The current chair was a Hillary delegate. That came after she said she would vote for whoever won the primary. Bernie won the primary. Lots of bad feelings about that switch. State Republicans are busy saying the Dems are in disarray. They even have a website with that name. It will all be interesting.

I’m friends with plenty of the often maligned “artisanal pickle maker” types who populate northern Brooklyn and I’ll say this about them; they’re socially aware, generally from flyover, and they arrived here that way. They didn’t have a Saul of Tarsus conversion the minute they stepped off the greyhound at the port authority bus terminal. They also have lots of friends just like them who visit them here in Brooklyn, but can’t/won’t move here for a variety of reasons.

Reply ↓ different clue May 5, 2017 at 1:37 am There is nothing inherently wrong with artisan pickle makers if they actually get some artisanal pickles made and sold. If they can sell artisanal pickles at an artisanal price to artisanal pickle eaters, they can turn around and pay an artisanal organic price to organic artisanal cucumber growers. The organic artisanal cucumbers growers can use the money thereby earned to buy artisanal soil supplements and ammendments and artisanal organic plant foods. The people selling those organitisanal inputs can then turn around and buy shinola stuff instead of shit-stuff in their own lives. The money-as-medium-of-exchange can be kept flowing in circulateral currents while mediating and permitting the flow of organic artisanal goods and services in circulateral counter-currents. Well . . . it can work if enough people are ready to pay a shinola price for shinola pickles to make it work to the extent of supporting little local micro-economies scattered in various places. And keep the artisanal pickle makers surviving until Middle America decides that It Too deserves an artisanal pickle, if it is ready to pay the price. Is it a pure joke? Nothing but a joke? Maybe not. Here is a local bussiness making artisanal sauerkrauts and other artisanal fermented foods. They buy shinola vegetables from shinola farmers to make their shinola fermentafood. The fermentables cost a shinola price. If these artisans are paying a shinola price to the shinola farmers for the shinola vegetables, then they are making a start toward growing a little counter-mainstream shinolaconomy here in College Townville. http://thebrinery.com/#sthash.a92x9uIZ.dpbs Reply ↓ marym May 4, 2017 at 3:39 pm Senate won’t vote on House-passed healthcare bill Senate Republicans said Thursday they won’t vote on the House-passed bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, but will write their own legislation instead. “The safest thing to say is there will be a Senate bill, but it will look at what the House has done and see how much of that we can incorporate in a product that works for us in reconciliation,” said Sen.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Reports Second Quarter Results CUPERTINO, California — May 2, 2017 — Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Apple also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the Company’s program to return capital to shareholders and is extending the program timeframe by four quarters.  Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017. From the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 through March 2017, Apple has returned over $211 billion to shareholders, including $151 billion in share repurchases. The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding the program. The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis. Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter:   revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion other income/(expense) of $450 million tax rate of 25.5 percent Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2017 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on May 2, 2017 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/.

It’s called “woven technology,” or tech that’s woven right into fabric. Tech giant Google has partnered with the original jeans-maker Levi’s to showcase just how this technology could change everyday life. This partnership marks an inflection point in wearables. The launch of the Apple Watch was a watershed moment, marking the mainstreaming of wearables. Yet the sales numbers were not astronomical – the new product line generated only $1.7 billion for Apple in fiscal year 2015. Rather than ring the death knell for wearables, fashion is now pushing the category further. The promise of a new revolution driven by technology-integrated clothing is intoxicating. The latest example of wearable fashion moving from experimental to practical is Google and Levi’s new Trucker Jacket. The jacket infuses Google’s Project Jacquard technology into the jacket, which then acts as an interface for a smartphone tucked away in a biker’s pocket. In travel, this could be a revolution that increases operational efficiency of front-line staff while also boosting accuracy of the behind-the-scenes crews moving the industry forward every day. Levi’s and Google might just be on to something: here are four ways that woven tech could save travel suppliers money while enhancing the traveler experience in new and innovative ways. De-clustering customer support staff The introduction of tablets to the customer service workflow liberated staff from desks and led to the now-familiar “roving” customer service representative. Whether it’s the Virgin agent wearing Google Glass or the hotel clerk checking guests in on an iPad strapped to his wrist, technology has made customer service mobile. Google Glass even promised a new level of personalization for passengers in an experimental application with Virgin. Woven technology holds a similar promise. Uniforms come with built-in interfaces that connect to specific systems, liberating data and empowering front-line customer support staff. Rather than limit the customer service function to one area of the enterprise, the ubiquitous uniforms expand the scope and definition of customer support. Employees become hosts and brand ambassadors regardless of title. For example, a hotel experiencing a rush of incoming guests could temporarily re-assign a concierge or bellman to work the line. With the PMS right there on the sleeve, the employee can jump right in. And as the trend shifts to self check-in, the employee mix will shift to be more general support.The guest will walk straight to the door, and simply “sleeve in” to the room. Real-time data dispersal Embedded wearables liberate data from silos, bringing data to the employee in a direct and portable fashion. The employee benefits from real-time information pushed right to the uniform, and the durability of woven technology reduces costs associated with tech breakage. For example, a baggage handler can scan tags without a handheld barcode reader, or a wing walker could use her arms as the light cones for guiding planes to and from gates — while enjoying better visibility at night due to embedded LEDs. An airline could partner to create a fashion-forward accessory for flight attendants that shares all passenger information on a touch-responsive sleeve. Rather than walk the aisle asking first class passengers what they’d like for dinner, attendants could see exactly what meal each passenger had selected before boarding. Traveler experience is improved, as is operational efficiency. One existing concept of using wearables to personalize the travel experience is the “Happiness Blanket” from British Airways. The blanket translates passengers’ brainwaves into a color-coded representation of their state-of-mind. Woven tech facilitates this sort of “soft” customer service, allowing employees to adapt quickly and accurately to customers’ well-being. Reinvigorating the travel consultant Travel consultants often seek new ways of engaging with clients, especially during a journey. The proliferation of messaging services has increased complexity when communicating with clients; woven technology could bring this communication right to the traveler’s sleeve while in destination. This connection means that a consultant could quickly route updated information to the traveler and then use soft vibrations to alert the customer of a change in itinerary. Or the consultant dives into deep personalization through the use of wearable itineraries. The consultant, often an expert in the places being visited by the client, builds itineraries that deliver directions, background, and personal recommendations to clients. With GPS, these itineraries would prompt and nudge the traveler when a recommended experience is nearby. Improving the speed and accuracy of security A sensor embedded in luggage includes a unique code identifying that bag. Rather than rely on paper bag tags, each bag is simply tied to a PNR. This bag could be registered by different people; each time, the bag is registered to that new PNR and tracked. This gives security screeners a new level of data about a bag’s history, while also assuring travelers of the bag’s location at all times via a traveler-facing app integration. Barcode scanning could shift from having to rely on the smartphone, with either a sleeve- or skin-based interface eliminating the need to hand over an expensive smartphone. Passports already contain small chips embedded with traveler data, so an embedded sensor specific to travel could even replace ID altogether. Similar to PreCheck, travelers could purchase a line of garments that eliminates the need for ID through uniquely coded embedded chips. Realistically… There’s something intriguing about the personal touch of engaging with a digital interface on a textured surface. This woven interface suggests a new dimension of “bespoke itineraries” in travel, where a tailored fit happens twice: once upon purchasing a garment and then again when the garment personalizes the digital experience. Of course, like all emerging technologies, there will be certain use cases that are more economically viable than others. If the fashion remains elusive to the mainstream, then the impact remains niche to the luxury traveler. Standards also come into play, as any embedded sensor must be interoperable with others. A true wearable interface would also need to offer a larger screen with little interference due to fabric type. Regardless of use, the fashion designers and the technologists have come together to infuse technology in one of the last untouched realms of modern society: right into the fabric on our backs. And as the cost of chips go down and processing power goes up, the sky’s the limit as far as imagining just how technology could weave into the fabric of our travel experience.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Nick Vivion Nick Vivion is a writer and strategist.

With the potential loss of Apple -- which accounts for about half of the U.K.-based company’s revenue -- looming large, Imagination is fighting for its survival. Not coincidentally, the company revealed plans to sell two businesses. Going on the block are MIPS, whose CPU business is focused on embedded processor market, and Ensigma, which offers IP licensing for connectivity in mobile computing. These moves mark the end of Imagination’s ambitious dream to compete with its rival ARM as an IP licensing powerhouse with GPU, CPU and connectivity technologies. Imagination today says it now hopes to “concentrate its resources on PowerVR and strengthen Imagination’s balance sheet.” Despite Imagination’s stated plan to sell off MIPS and Ensigma to save its PowerVR business, many industry observers believe Imagination might eventually go up for sale. Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, told EE Times, “I expect that after the issues with Apple are resolved, Imagination itself will be sold. The results of the Apple resolution will determine Imagination's value at that time.” Disputes with Apple Imagination said last month that Apple had notified the firm it was developing its own graphics chips, Apple would no longer use Imagination's processing designs in 15 months to two years’ time. Imagination’s discussions with Apple thus far apparently yielded very little progress. In a statement issued Thursday, the company said, “Imagination has been unable to make satisfactory progress with Apple to date regarding alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement.” Imagination “has therefore commenced the dispute resolution procedure under the licence agreement with a view to reaching an agreement through a more structured process,” the company added. Asked what such “a more structured process” entails, an Imagination spokeswoman declined to elaborate. In April, Imagination expressed doubts that Apple could go it alone without violating Imagination’s patents. Although industry analysts foresaw possible legal action against Apple, sources tell EE Times that Imagination isn’t currently planning any lawsuits. It’s widely understood that Imagination would face major challenges proving that Apple is infringing Imagination’s graphics engine IP. This is largely because Apple’s own new graphics chips -- which Apple claimed do not use Imagination’s processing designs -- won’t reach the market for more than a year. While Apple has every incentive to stall negotiations, it’s hard to imagine how Imagination could possibly make any breakthrough in discussions with Apple. Who will buy MIPS? Over the past month, Imagination’s board reviewed its business composition and decided dump MIPS and Ensigma. Industry debate now shifts inevitably to who might eventually acquire MIPS. Krewell told us, “MIPS is still a classic CPU design with scalability and an established software ecosystem.” Krewell expects that a design house (such as Cadence, Mentor or Synopsys) will look at it. He added, “It's also possible that a leading customer like Microchip would consider buying out its license. MIPS has also been used by a number of Chinese vendors and it could be bought by a Chinese entity.” In Krewell’s opinion, there's “still an opportunity for MIPS in the market, even though it's a diminished one.” Imagination's First Half, FY2017 Results PowerVR generated 67 percent of Imagination's revenue in 1H, FY17, which ended in Dec., 2016.

Now, Strategy Analytics is out with its latest numbers, reporting that Apple sold 3.5 million Apple Watch units during the most recent quarter… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover According to the data, global wearables shipments rose to 22 million units during Q1 2017 (Apple’s fiscal Q2), up 21 percent from 18.2 million during the first quarter of 2016. Apple saw the biggest jump, increasing its shipments from 2.2 million during Q1 2016 to 3.5 million during Q1 2017. This 59 percent annual rise saw Apple capture 16 percent of the global market, overtaking Fitbit to become the world’s largest wearables vendor. Strategy Analytics attributes this growth to strong performance for the Apple Watch Series 2 thanks to its “enhanced styling, intensive marketing, and a good retail presence. Just as notable as Apple’s rise, however, is Fitbit’s fall. The once-dominant wearables company saw its shipments fall to 2.9 million, down from 4.5 million in Q1 2016. Strategy Analytics blames this fall on slowing demand for its fitness bands and “late entry to the emerging smartwatch market.” Fitbit’s performance saw it come in at number three in the wearables market, with Xiaomi capturing the second spot with 3.4 million shipments and 15.5 percent of the market. Fitbit, on the other hand, fell to 13.2 percent. Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said: “Apple captured 16 percent global marketshare and overtook Fitbit to become the world’s largest wearables vendor. The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence. Xiaomi shipped 3.4 million wearables for 15 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. Demand for its popular Mi Band fitness range was broadly flat across its core markets of Asia.” Apple CEO Tim Cook talked up the performance of Apple Watch during Apple’s recent earnings call, saying that Apple saw shipments of the device nearly double year-over-year. Cook attributed the strong performance of Apple Watch to feature such as fitness and health tracking. View the breakdown of the wearables market in the below chart and read the full press release below. Steven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global wearables shipments reached 22.0 million units in Q1 2017, rising 21 percent annually from 18.2 million in Q1 2016. Stronger demand for new smartwatch models in North America, Western Europe and Asia drove the uptick.” Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “Apple shipped 3.5 million wearables worldwide in Q1 2017, rising 59 percent annually from 2.2 million units in Q1 2016. Apple captured 16 percent global marketshare and overtook Fitbit to become the world’s largest wearables vendor.

Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitnessbands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market. Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Exhibit 1: Global Wearables Vendor Shipments and Marketshare in Q1 2017 1 The full report, Global Wearables Vendor Market Share by Region: Q1 2017, is published by the Strategy Analytics Wearable Device Ecosystems (WDE) service, details of which can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/n29s7tt.

Salesforce arguably was the first kid on the block with a partner program of this kind in which buyers could access a large community of apps based on a single standard from a single store. It's worth remembering, for instance, that the "AppStore" was a Salesforce property that Marc Benioff gave to Steve Jobs when Apple announced its store. At the time it seemed as though Benioff's respect for Jobs got in the way of a good business decision, but history shows it was a shrewd move. An app store, as Apple has managed it, replicated a traditional hierarchical retail model. However, Benioff's next iteration, the AppExchange, was a closer approximation of the give and take of a bourse -- a software bourse, if you like, in which we are all potential buyers and sellers. Salesforce partners are just as likely to incorporate other partners' apps in their offerings as to sell their own. That's the better model, and the idea that Salesforce has nurtured carefully and updated this week. $389B Ecosystem Platform is not limited to customer-facing apps, though. The number of apps on the AppExchange -- like FinancialForce and others for enterprise resource planning or back office, or Xactly for incentive compensation management -- gives ample evidence for the wisdom of supporting any business application with a platform. That's why the AppExchange and the partner program that animates it are so important. My poster child for platform-based apps is a company called "nCino," which specializes in bank operations and has a great story to tell about business loan origination. It has managed to winnow a seven-week manual loan origination process down to 10 minutes or less, demonstrating not only the power of its apps, but also the power of the platform to enable the flexibility needed to do the job. That's not exactly CRM -- or is it? The point is that the platform and the partner program have come into their own because they enable business leaders to imagine their businesses with far fewer limits to their creativity. Consequently, even though the Salesforce Partner program had been successful, it was up for some retooling. New automation helps partners onboard quickly, and automated information dissemination makes it easier than ever to get the information you need to fine-tune a business. On the other hand, automated learning systems embodied in the Trailhead program make it easy to train a workforce to go after platform opportunities. Training might be the key to everything else for Salesforce, because the learning modules are available to anyone regardless of whether they are employed by a partner. I've seen estimates as high as 350,000 job openings for people with Salesforce skills. Self-paced learning systems are a fine way to reach some markets. Surprisingly, the announcement also put a number on the size of the ecosystem, and it wasn't small. At $389 billion, the Salesforce Economy dwarfs the parent company's revenues and concretely demonstrates the value of leveraging the Salesforce1 Platform. At this level, there's room for many partners selling complementary apps, or even apps that have little or nothing to do with CRM. Partner Progress Score At the recent CRM Evolution conference, I spoke about business agility and the importance of platform-based applications to support it. The logic is simple: Apps support processes and platform, which contain components that make applications modern like workflow, analytics, collaboration and journey mapping. Building all of these components into a customer-facing app is both hard and tedious. In my opinion, you can't have an agile business if you need to stitch all of this componentry together by hand -- hence, the value of a platform. The Salesforce announcement also mentions some partner program technical fixes that any vendor will need to make from time to time. New partner pricing and algorithms to score a partner's business along four dimensions now are in place, including customer success, product success, team readiness and giving back. What would a Salesforce program be without an effort to give something back to the world? Salesforce also is lowering the baseline percent-net-revenue (PNR) model for all new AppExchange Partner Program partners from 25 percent to 15 percent. In all, these tweaks help to reinforce the bourse model of the partner program. Virtually all partners start small, and the changes will support that. Some partners stay small because of the niches they've adopted. However, other partners like nothing better than to get big. The changes made to the program will help all of them -- and Salesforce -- to address that $389 billion channel opportunity. At the same time, $100 million in startup funding should ensure that the pipeline of emerging companies remains full.

The announcement, which Cook made Wednesday on CNBC, comes after months of focus by President Donald Trump on jobs, manufacturing and the global economy. Cook did not appear to suggest that his company’s decision was influenced by Trump. But the president has showered praise on companies such as Carrier, Softbank and Charter Communications for promising to hire more American workers – even if some of those pledges predated Trump’s tenure. Unlike those firms, Apple’s announcement was not a hiring promise; the company simply said that it was hoping to promote U.S. manufacturing with its new fund. “We’ve talked to a company we’re going to invest in already,” Cook said. Apple intends to invest in programs that can train workers how to code, Cook added. But that much of the money for this effort will be borrowed rather than drawn from its substantial cash reserves. Cook has spoken previously about the shortage of U.S. workers who can perform advanced manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing differs from typical manufacturing in that it often requires specialized skills to produce highly engineered components that go into Apple’s products. “The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills,” Cook told “60 Minutes” in 2015. “I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.” Apple has taken some steps to highlight a commitment to U.S. jobs. In 2013, the company announced that it would begin manufacturing its high-end Mac Pro computer in Texas. But in recent years, the Mac Pro’s reputation has faltered amid complaints that the device is difficult to upgrade and poorly suited for next-generation computing. The share of Apple customers who use the Mac Pro are in the single digits, according to company execs in a recent interview with a number of Silicon Valley journalists – raising questions about the state of Apple’s U.S. manufacturing presence. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment for this story. Cook said Apple would release more details about its plans for the manufacturing fund later this month. Even as it pledges to spend big on what Trump views as a major priority, Apple and other tech companies still have billions of dollars in revenues stashed overseas. Bringing that money home would likely incur a hefty tax bill – which is why Trump has proposed slashing corporate tax rates in a way that encourages businesses to repatriate those funds. Cook said that he’s hopeful the Trump administration can succeed with that push. Labor economists say that restoring U.S. manufacturing jobs will be difficult at a time when automation is increasingly threatening to replace many workers. Businesses may move their factories back to the United States, but because American workers are still more expensive to employ than robots, those corporate decisions may not lead to an uptick in hiring. “The mentality is, ‘Can we increase our output first by becoming more efficient by using better technology as the first resort?’ ” Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organization, told the Los Angeles Times. Analysts predict that even highly specialized industries such as law or radiology may be shaken up by artificial intelligence. And the trend isn’t just problematic for older workers; by 2030, more than a third of all U.S. jobs may be done by robots, according to a recent study by the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Sheriff: Maine weatherman who died would have been charged in sexual assault case Jordan’s Snack Bar closed for the year after family member’s death Lincoln’s town manager faces criminal charges for alleged trespass Flooding hitting sections of Golden Road and Millinocket YouTube parents who pulled disturbing ‘pranks’ on their kids have lost custody LePage’s misguided bill would do nothing to reverse Maine’s deadly heroin crisis Why Down East Maine is the ultimate marine tourism destination Friday, May 5, 2017: LePage on wrong side of history, education surtax misinformation, impeach Trump This bill could take away from Maine voters a powerful tool to hold politicians accountable Katahdin hearing Report: Former UMaine tight end to interview for Bills’ GM vacancy Red Sox permanently ban fan who allegedly used racial slur Huston’s versatility a source of stability behind the plate for Husson UMaine baseball team cruises past Colby College Bangor Municipal Golf Course offering PGA Sports Academy/Junior League THE BDN BUZZ Why the Google Docs phishing attack is particularly sneaky THE FOGHORN Medical marijuana patients and providers protected from federal prosecution under new spending bill CULTURE SHOCK American Folk Festival announces first five artists for 2017 festival #MAINE Maine’s not so boring after all AH THE THINGS I'VE DONE!

That’s more than the GDP of some small countries, and one of the easiest ways to understand just how rich Apple is. But that $250 billion figure is actually a little more impressive than it should be. Apple’s money is held overseas, but it still needs to spend cash in the US. To get around paying tax, Apple has been borrowing money, and it’s currently sitting on nearly $100 billion in debt. Don't Miss: This sophisticated phishing scam has the entire internet terrified As the WSJ notes, Apple raised an eye-watering $11 billion in debt last quarter, bringing the total to around $100 billion. That number is set to increase: Apple is ramping up its share buyback program, and the new $1 billion investment fund it announced last night will be funded by debt. Apple opened up orders for its latest bond program this afternoon, and is said to already have raised $22 billion more. This doesn’t mean Apple is doomed, or that its cash fund is underwhelming: $150 billion in net assets is still nothing to sneeze at, and is bigger than the market cap of most other companies. But it’s worth bearing in mind in the context of Apple’s ballooning stock price. A lot of that interest has been generated by rumors of a one-off overseas earnings tax break, which would allow companies like Apple to repatriate cash at a 10% rate or so, rather than the usual 35%. Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook have talked before, possibly about a one-off tax break, but plans can’t be that far advanced if Apple is raising another $22 billion in the US.

In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth nothing that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top tog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!? Who would ever pay that for a freaking tablet? Nicholas Conrad You're forgetting about the Nexus 7 Leonardo Coleman I initiated freelancing over world wide web, participating in some fundamental assignments which mainly needed a personal computer and also having access to internet in addition to Now I am more delighted than ever... half a year have gone by since i begun this and additionally i had income total of $36k... Normally I generate eighty bucks each hr and even work for three to 4 hours majority of the days.And wonderful thing about this is exactly that one could manage time when you work and for how long as you like and you achieve a paycheck per week. ---->>>LEARN MORE Regarding It here-> http://s.id/272 mfofofipf Kumnaa The most recent Nexus 7 is almost 4 years old now though :( Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small.

That’s the kind of experience residents of the developing Delano community in Eastwood Village in Irvine will enjoy when they start moving into their new townhomes at the end of June. Delano will be the first neighborhood in the nation to offer Apple’s smart home technology, called HomeKit, as standard features, homebuilder Brookfield Residential announced this week.

(Photo by Tomoya Shimura, Orange County Register/SCNG) Residents will be able to control their front door lock, lighting and thermostat using Apple’s Home app on their iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. They can also just ask Siri to execute the tasks. “Our industry has been doing the same thing for many many many years — arguably well — but it hasn’t made as many leaps into the future as it might ought to have done,” said Adrian Foley, chief operating officer of Brookfield’s California region. “I think this connected home opportunity is a great platform for us to leap forward into the future and really distance ourselves from the used home market looking forward.” Apple and other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon and Samsung, are competing to take a lead in what’s dubbed the “smart home” or “connected home” market. For instance, Amazon has introduced Echo, a voice-activated speaker that can work as a hub to control amenities in the house. In 2016, Apple announced Brookfield, Lennar and KB Home would begin offering homes with HomeKit built in. These national homebuilders have since built homes featuring the Apple technology, but it was optional. Now, all new Southern California homes by Brookfield will have Lutron Caseta lighting, a Honeywell Lyric T6 thermostat, Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt door lock and Ubiquiti wireless access point connected to HomeKit, according to the company. All homes come with Apple TV, which will work as a hub to control smart devices away from home. These features would cost $2,500-$3,000 if homeowners on their own ask professionals to install them, Brookfield officials said. Homebuyers can also add options like smart blinds. Using HomeKit, residents can create custom scenes, such as “TV Time,” “Good Night” and “Good Morning.” Lights, thermostats and TV will work in sync when homeowners say these commands to Siri on their Apple devices. Moreover, homeowners can configure HomeKit so that the front door unlocks and air conditioning turns on when they arrive home. Brookfield chose to work with Apple because HomeKit has end-to-end encryption, which reduces the risk of hacking, Foley said. Offering smart home technologies as standard features may give Brookfield a competitive edge in an industry where builders are looking for every possible way to differentiate themselves from others — at least for the moment, said John McManus, vice president and editorial director of Residential Group at Hanley Wood in Washington, D.C. But some experts believe consumers want to customize smart homes to their own tastes by choosing their favorite brands and products rather than get a built-in package, McManus said. Also, built-in hardware and software could easily become obsolete because technology is changing rapidly. “Any new bold initiative adds risk to it,” McManus said. “They can be right, they can be wrong.” Experts say the smart home market hasn’t matured yet, with no clear winners and fragmented technology that’s hard for a layperson to figure out. Many consumers still don’t feel or understand its value, they say. Still, the number of connected homes is expected to grow to 29 million this year from 17 million in 2015, according to McKinsey & Co. The trend will continue as more millennials, who are often early adopters of new technology, become homebuyers, McManus said. “There’s going to be a tipping point where these solutions will be in a majority of the homes,” he said. “They won’t be an anomaly, they’ll be a majority.” Brookfield officials said some of the smart home features at Delano work with Android devices, as well as Amazon Echo and Google Home. The company plans on adding more options to HomeKit in the future, such as an automatic garage door, Foley said. “What we are talking about today is just the base of goods, and really the offering is going to get wider and wider as those products become available,” he said. “The concept is just to get people used to a home that speaks to you while you are living in it, as opposed to a home that just sits there being shelter.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 7:50 PM increase font size Apple to fund advanced manufacturing The company plans to spend $1 billion, with some of that money already earmarked for investment. By Brian FungThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article Apple says that it intends to bolster the U.S. manufacturing sector by creating a $1 billion “advanced manufacturing fund” – with some of that initial money going toward a company the tech giant is prepared to partner with, chief executive Tim Cook said. The announcement, which Cook made Wednesday on CNBC, comes after months of focus by President Trump on jobs, manufacturing and the global economy. Cook did not appear to suggest that his company’s decision was influenced by Trump. But the president has showered praise on companies such as Carrier, Softbank and Charter Communications for promising to hire more American workers – even if some of those pledges predated Trump’s tenure. Tim Cook Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Unlike those firms, Apple’s announcement was not a hiring promise; the company simply said that it was hoping to promote U.S. manufacturing with its new fund. “We’ve talked to a company we’re going to invest in already,” Cook said. Apple intends to invest in programs that can train workers how to code, Cook said. But that much of the money for this effort will be borrowed rather than drawn from its substantial cash reserves. Cook has spoken previously about the shortage of U.S. workers who can perform advanced manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing differs from typical manufacturing in that it often requires specialized skills to produce highly engineered components that go into Apple’s products. “The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills,” Cook told “60 Minutes” in 2015. “I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.” Apple has taken some steps to highlight a commitment to U.S. jobs. In 2013, the company announced that it would begin manufacturing its high-end Mac Pro computer in Texas. But in recent years, the Mac Pro’s reputation has faltered amid complaints that the device is difficult to upgrade and poorly suited for next-generation computing. The share of Apple customers who use the Mac Pro are in the single digits, according to company execs in a recent interview with a number of Silicon Valley journalists – raising questions about the state of Apple’s U.S. manufacturing presence. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment for this story. Cook said Apple would release more details about its plans for the manufacturing fund later this month. Even as it pledges to spend big on what Trump views as a major priority, Apple and other tech companies still have billions of dollars in revenues stashed overseas. Bringing that money home would likely incur a hefty tax bill – which is why Trump has proposed slashing corporate tax rates in a way that encourages businesses to repatriate those funds. Cook said that he’s hopeful the Trump administration can succeed with that push. Labor economists say that restoring U.S. manufacturing jobs will be difficult at a time when automation is increasingly threatening to replace many workers. Businesses may move their factories back to the United States, but because American workers are still more expensive to employ than robots, those corporate decisions may not lead to an uptick in hiring. “The mentality is, ‘Can we increase our output first by becoming more efficient by using better technology as the first resort?’ ” Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations, told the Los Angeles Times. Analysts predict that even highly specialized industries such as law or radiology may be shaken up by artificial intelligence. And the trend isn’t just problematic for older workers; by 2030, more than a third of all U.S. jobs may be done by robots, according to a recent study by the consulting firmPricewaterhouseCoopers.

You should also note Apple has $250 billion in cash. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Between the Lines | May 4, 2017 -- 23:34 GMT (16:34 PDT) | Topic: Tech Industry Apple CEO Tim Cook recently announced on CNBC that Apple would start a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing American jobs. That sounds impressive ... until you consider Apple has $250 billion in cash. Apple CEO Tim Cook is investing a billion dollars, a tiny fraction of Apple's cash reserves, into a project meant to lead to US manufacturing jobs. Apple Cook told Mad Money host Jim Cramer this move could be the "the ripple in the pond. Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them." More apple iPhone 8 may not have the killer feature we've been hoping for Here's why you must back up your iPhone and iPad before upgrading to iOS 10.3 Apple to iPhone owners: We're working fast to block CIA's iOS hacks Is Apple's 'next big thing' the iPhone Pro? 10 things Steve Jobs would hate about Apple today Cook, however, gave no specifics about these jobs. Indeed, there was no explicit promise of jobs at all. Instead, Cook simply said he hoped Apple's billion-dollar "advanced manufacturing fund" would create new jobs. These jobs may not be with Apple. "We've talked to a company we're going to invest in already," Cook said. In the past, Cook said American employees don't have the right job skills for 21st century manufacturing. He told 60 Minutes in 2015 that "the US, over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we're currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields." Apple has often been criticized for manufacturing its iPhones and other hardware in China. Then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump last year said, "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries." After Trump was elected, he promised he would "get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China." A billion bucks won't do this. That said, Foxconn, Apple's biggest OEM partner and primary iPhone builder, is in preliminary talks to expand in the US. This followed Trump demanding Apple bring its manufacturing to the US. In 2014, Foxconn considered expanding into the US expansion with full-scale factories. Nothing came of this proposal. Cook made no reference to Trump during his TV spot. So, what will a billion do? Apple promises it will reveal more of its plans later in May. If I were a betting man, I'd put money on Apple helping Foxconn build its first iPhone factory in the States.

Business Technology Will Qualcomm seek an iPhone ban in escalating patent dispute with Apple? The patent dispute between Apple and Qualcomm escalated last week with Apple blocked royalty payments, sparking speculation about how Qualcomm will respond. Associated Press The patent dispute between Apple and Qualcomm escalated last week with Apple blocked royalty payments, sparking speculation about how Qualcomm will respond. The patent dispute between Apple and Qualcomm escalated last week with Apple blocked royalty payments, sparking speculation about how Qualcomm will respond. (Associated Press) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Now that Apple has blocked royalty payments to Qualcomm in an increasing fierce legal battle over patents, what is the San Diego chipmaker going to do to hit back? The company hasn’t made a move yet. But late Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported that Qualcomm is planning to retaliate by asking a U.S. International Trade Commission to ban imports of iPhones, which are made by contract manufacturers in Asia. The report cited “a person familiar with the company’s strategy.” Qualcomm had no comment. Last week, Qualcomm cut its revenue and profit forecasts after Apple informed the company that it has stopped reimbursing Foxconn and other Asia contract makers of iPhones for the patent royalties that they pay to Qualcomm. If Qualcomm doesn’t fight back, other smartphone firms may stop paying patent royalties as well, according to analysts. Already, Qualcomm announced that an unnamed company didn’t pay $150 million in patent royalties owed during the quarter ended March 30. Analysts believe the company is Samsung. “We would not be surprised to see Qualcomm take a stand given Apple’s recent behavior,” said Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon in a research note. “Indeed, we can’t see that (Qualcomm has) much of a choice given the threat of contagion.” Asked about the risk of Qualcomm seeking an iPhone ban, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said Tuesday during the company’s earnings conference call that it has not received a fair and reasonable patent licensing offer from Qualcomm. “I don’t believe anyone is going to enjoin the iPhone based on that,” he said. “I think there is plenty of case law around that subject. But we shall see.” Cook added that Apple decided to withhold royalties because it doesn’t know how much to pay. “They think we owe some amount. We think we owe a different amount,” he said. “There hasn’t been a meeting of the minds there, so at this point we need a court to decide that -- unless we are able to, over time, settle between us.” In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, saying it forces smartphone makers to pay too much for use of its 3G/4G standards essential patents, which are required to be licensed under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm counters that its royalty rates, which top out at roughly 5 percent of the device price, have been negotiated through hundreds of agreements spanning two decades. According to Qualcomm, its licensing business model allowed Apple to enter the smartphone market a decade ago and reap billions in profits with little or no investment in core cellular technology. There are advantages to patent holders, particularly those with standards essential patents like Qualcomm, in seeking an injunction from the ITC – an administrative agency – rather than going through the federal district courts, said Jonathan Barnett, an intellectual property law professor at the University of Southern California. First, the ITC moves faster – typically ruling in 15 to 18 months instead of an average of 2.5 years for federal court patent cases to reach trial, he said. Second, some district courts have suggested that standards essential patent holders shouldn’t be entitled to injunctions that ban imports of infringing products. They should only be eligible for damages. “The patent holder has a greater expectation of obtaining injunctive relief through the ITC, which is the only remedy it can issue,” said Barnett. Analysts, however, think it could be a difficult task to win a ban on iPhones. In 2013, the ITC blocked imports of some older model iPhones during a long-running patent dispute with Samsung. The Obama administration overturned the ruling before it took effect. “Apple and Samsung, in this protracted legal battle they’ve had over the last 10 years, they have tried at various points to get an injunction against each other’s products in various countries, and they have never been able to do that,” said Timothy Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co. Arcuri believes Qualcomm would have better luck in China. The company recently negotiated patent licensing terms with China’s anti- monopoly regulator. The country’s top smartphone makers are all paying patent royalties to Qualcomm. “If I were Qualcomm, I would go to China because it is the more likely country to say (to Apple) our licensees are paying and you’re not,” he said. “The Chinese government would love any opportunity to ban the import of iPhones. That would be good for the domestic brands.” Qualcomm also could retaliate by refusing to sell cellular modem chips to Apple’s contract manufacturers. But analysts think that is unlikely, in part because it would support Apple’s legal claim that Qualcomm uses its market dominance in cellular radios to force smartphone makers, who are afraid of losing chip supply, to pay too much for its patents. Qualcomm’s stock ended trading Thursday up 42 cents at $54.91 on the Nasdaq exchange.

Now it's chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone.   Microsoft Corp., a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday.  The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple’s MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market—and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop’s affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience—including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the $999 machine’s evolution, starting from the first prototype—little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices—to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus.  The team’s pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. “This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team,” said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes.  Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer's main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfiber that’s more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colors, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn’t stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because “it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling.”  The designers couldn’t poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many “anechoic” chambers, rooms that don't let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that’s tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the “S” came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware—a selling point long touted by Apple’s iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google’s Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be “same on commencement day as it is on graduation day.” (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won’t be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft’s app store.  “Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft,” Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state.  The slick computer, which will be available June 15, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch—and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn’t had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better.  Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team “created what we know our customers are asking for.” Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple’s OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft’s first real laptop. “In the end,” he said, “it’s going to appeal to everyone.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

With 2017 marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone – a big deal to us humans, who are big fans of well-rounded numbers – expectations are high for the device that ushered in the age of smartphones, with features like wireless charging and shrunken bezels rumored to make a debut. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, those expectations are what caused a dip in expected earnings for the Cupertino company in Q2. "We are seeing a kind of delay in purchasing behavior that we think is a consequence of the number of rumors and reports about future products," said Cook, indicating that “iPhone 8” rumors surfacing months before the iPhone 7 had more consequences than just potentially wrong predictions. Furthermore, the idea that an iPhone 7s – the a typical half-step releases in the year between major iPhone overhauls - has been all but dismissed. However, new rumors suggest that turning a decade old may not amount to any significant changes after all and an iPhone 7s will appear as usual. On the other hand, rumors persist that it’s still possible for Apple to pull a Microsoft, skip the 7s and dive right into the iPhone 8, but even those rumors say that a delay is on the horizon, with some reports suggesting that there might not even be an iPhone release in 2017. As always, rumors are just rumors, and rumors of an imminent Apple demise of one kind or another is nothing new. I would even say it would be weird not to have an annual doomsday prediction for the iPhone. Still, it’s something that’s almost inevitable at some point, so it’s always interesting when these sort of rumors pop up. Depending on how things play out in reality, I could see rumors really giving Apple a real run for their money this year. They’re pretty much damned if they do and damned if they don’t, but I think the case of a somewhat insignificant iPhone 7s launch would be much worse than the alternative. Not only has the hype surrounding an “iPhone 8” reached the point of no return, but I think an iPhone 7s would prove to be too much “sameness”, even for Apple’s standards, which brings about another theory as to why the iPhone 7 may not have sold well: It was simply not a significant enough upgrade from the 6S. Aesthetically speaking, the iPhone 7 looked much like the iPhone 6S, which was identical to the iPhone 6. Three years of nearly the same design with little more than spec bumps makes for a hard sell, especially since Apple supports its phones for about three years with software updates. The iPhone 7 was also the first iPhone to controversially have the 3.5mm headphone jack removed. All in all, not a terrific year for Apple on the innovation front, and I think reintroducing innovation as more than just a cliché buzz word is going to be the key for Apple to remain relevant at this point. While the thought of “iPhone 8” means very little without an official product, I think the idea of having something so superior that the “7s” moniker wouldn’t give it justice is paramount for the iPhone to have a good year, whenever that year may be. If that means Apple needs to have a later release then so be it, because I feel that an earlier release of a 7s would probably not fare well. The rumors are just that strong with this release. The stakes are too high. It also might not be a terrible idea to wait a little longer for a release if that means coming out with a better phone that has more significant upgrades. I think we’re at a crossroads of sorts when it comes to smartphone technology. We’re past the days of taking giant leaps in smartphone technology every 6 months, but before whatever next big wave of technological advancements. Perhaps it’s time we stop expecting some grand spectacle to surface every year. It’s impossible to say what will happen, but the heat is undoubtedly on Apple to make their next flagship something worth recommending again. Unfortunately, it seems that rumors have made this task a lot harder than it would normally be. Personally I’m rooting for an iPhone 8 release, but at the risk of missing out on those sweet holiday sales in Q4, I wouldn’t be surprised for just another “S” variant.

When the Apple Watch launched, one of its most promising features was its app support. The App Store, after all, had been a key factor in the iPhone becoming all conquering, and there was a real chance of kickstarting a wearable revolution with the same trick. Well, maybe not, it turns out. While the Apple Watch is still the most popular wearable around, it's a small pond that isn't growing much. Worse, it appears that a number of high profile apps are withdrawing their support for the small screen. Apple Insider has spotted a number of apps – including Google Maps, Amazon and eBay – that have quietly withdrawn support for the Apple Watch. While Google has said that the company “expect to support it again in the future”, for now the Maps feature which sends directions straight to the wrist has been removed without explanation in the release notes. Amazon and eBay both removed Apple Watch support from their respective iOS apps in April, too. While I imagine nobody will cry for the loss of the Amazon wrist shopping, missing notifications when you're outbid on eBay could prove a touch more infuriating. American retailer Target, Apple Insider notes, has also removed Apple Watch support, though their standalone Cartwheel app still supports the wearable.   What does all this mean? Well, the most likely explanation is that nobody is using the features, making it a bit pointless to waste time and resources supporting them through each Apple Watch and iOS update. It's important to note that's not the same thing as the Apple Watch being an unappealing product – just that the original use case Apple envisaged wasn't matched by real world behaviour. Regular people almost always use technology in a way that's more basic than innovators would like. Reluctantly, it seems that the app creators are paring back their ambitions to match how real people use their services in the real world, where technology is just means to an end rather than the universal answer to everything.

RUGABER, Associated Press Published: May 4, 2017, 4:03 PM A   A SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the fund in an interview on CNBC, but didn’t say how the fund will invest that money or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple’s billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire “thousands of employees, thousands more in the future” in the U.S., although he didn’t specify how quickly that will happen. Apple’s U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps.

Peter Ho Published 10 hours ago More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/42zH Copy This is an excerpt from a IPS-Nathan lecture by Peter Ho, senior adviser to the Centre for Strategic Futures. The former head of civil service is the 2016/17 S R Nathan Fellow for the Study of Singapore. He talks about how citizen empowerment and changing expectations require governments to adapt. They must shift from a model of delivering 'government to you' and 'government of you' to 'government with you'. In 2010, my friend, the futurist Peter Schwartz, described Singapore as the "Apple of Nations". He was not using apple in its idiomatic form, but favourably comparing Singapore as a nation to Apple the company, which was then - as now - an inspiring paragon of innovation. Apple is famous for its innovative and revolutionary products. Many think that this year, Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company in terms of market cap. It was high praise from Schwartz. But of course, it begs the question of whether we can truly be the Apple of Nations, or whether we are in reality just a Little Red Dot. Schwartz, who is no rosy-eyed admirer of Singapore, also warned: "The difference between Apple and Singapore is that the people of Singapore don't know how good they have it. They don't know just what a remarkable entity has been created here. They don't share yet that sense of passion that the people at Apple do." This concern was echoed in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's 2016 National Day Rally speech, when he said: "What I would like to have is that we be blessed with a divine discontent - always not quite satisfied with what we have, always driven to do better. "At the same time, we have the wisdom to count our blessings so that we know how precious Singapore is and we know how to enjoy it and to protect it." BIG GOVERNMENT VERSUS SMALL GOVERNMENT Thrust into an unwelcome and unwanted independence (in 1965), the Singapore Government was in a hurry to turn the precarious situation around, and to transform Singapore into a "modern metropolis", in the matchless pledge of Mr Lee Kuan Yew in 1965. With better access to information and higher expectations of governments, the view that "government knows best" is increasingly being challenged. The writer argues that governments should move toward a collaborative approach to policy-making, and connect, consult, and co-create with the people and private sectors.  ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG So, it is not surprising that in the beginning, governance in Singapore was characterised by big government - if you will - through strong regulation, seeking compliance with policy rules, and maintaining as efficient a system as possible, in order to get things moving and to get them done. Through this approach, the Government embarked on a number of major initiatives that helped to lay the foundations for Singapore's prosperity and stability. These included a massive public housing programme; heavy investments in infrastructure - in public transport, our port and airport; and an activist, government-led approach to attract foreign investments and build up the capabilities to support higher value-added activities. In these and many other policy domains, the visible hand of government was as critical as the invisible hand of markets. The Government's interventions enabled new markets and industries to develop. They also helped to ensure that economic growth throughout the 1970s and 1980s benefited all segments of the population. GOVERNMENT VERSUS GOVERNANCE Today, citizens and businesses alike have far higher expectations of government than before. Access to information has increased dramatically in scope and speed as a result of the Internet revolution. Social networking platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have empowered citizens to express their views. Virtual communities are beginning to shape the debate and context of public policy issues. The view that "government knows best" that perhaps characterised the situation in the beginning is increasingly challenged in today's world, in which citizens and businesses can easily gain access to much of the information that governments used to monopolise and control in the past. THE FUTURE OF GOVERNMENT IN SINGAPORE Today, the quality of government in Singapore is routinely listed at the top of a host of global rankings. That Singapore is already operating at the leading edge in many areas of governance means that it is no longer enough for Government policymakers just to copy and adapt from elsewhere. For many of the emergent issues that we have to deal with, Singapore will have to evolve its own strategies and approaches. To achieve real breakthroughs, the Government will have to depend more and more on its own innovations. And as a result, the Government will have to assume new levels of entrepreneurship with its attendant risks and uncertainties. A government that explores will also at times have to sacrifice some degree of efficiency in service of discovery. And it will need to become expert at conducting bounded experiments. Indeed, the emergent, complex issues of the 21st century suggest the need for a new paradigm in governance - one that is Whole-of-Government, networked, innovative, exploratory and resilient in the way it confronts the challenges of our time - challenges rooted in complexity and accelerating change. What is the appropriate model of governance for Singapore going forward? The coming years will see a growing need for governance - which requires collaboration across the public, private and people sectors - rather than government acting as the sole, or dominant, player. Today, the Government faces a myriad of complex public policy issues in which the trade-offs are much more difficult to make, because each could lead to unintended consequences and risks. Many of these public policy issues exceed the capacity of government working alone. Instead, they require the active contribution of private and people sectors. A government-centric approach focused on efficiency and productivity will likely give way to a broader approach that leverages on the collective capacity of non-government actors, in order to achieve results of higher public value and at a lower overall cost for society. How government interacts with the private and the people sectors will in turn determine how big a role each of these sectors will play. It is often overlooked that the Singapore Government has been a world leader in the engagement of the private sector. A succession of five economic reviews - the Economic Committee of 1986, the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness of 1998, the Economic Review Committee of 2003, the Economic Strategies Committee of 2008 and, most recently, the Committee on the Future Economy of 2016 - saw the public and private sectors coming together every few years to produce far-reaching policy recommendations for Singapore's long-term economic competitiveness. FREE MARKET VERSUS MARKET INTERVENTION A major factor that determines the size of our government has been our belief that free market forces should determine prices and economic outcomes. This is the approach that is the foundation of small government. But in Singapore, faith in the market has not been uncritical or absolute. Instead, the Government recognises that in certain cases, unfettered market forces can result in excessive volatility, negative externalities and under-provision of merit goods, like education, as well as public goods, like defence. The economist Dani Rodrik outlined a framework that can be usefully applied to understanding how Singapore has chosen to blend the work of markets and government. First, the Government has sought to enable markets. This includes ensuring rule of law, property rights and public infrastructure - functions that most governments perform. In Singapore, enabling markets has also included industrial policy and capability development, subjects of some controversy in policy circles around the world, especially among proponents of small government that believe in the laissez-faire approach. Second, the Government has sought to regulate markets. This includes supervision of the financial sector, competition regulation and taxation of negative externalities, such as high charges for car ownership and road usage, and sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco products - and maybe in future, taxes on sugary drinks. But a key feature of Singapore's approach has been the shift towards lighter regulation accompanied by risk-based supervision, most recently exemplified by MAS' (the Monetary Authority of Singapore's) fintech regulatory sandbox. Third, the Government has sought to stabilise markets. This is the bread and butter of macroeconomic management. Singapore's basic approach in monetary and fiscal policy is not far different from global practices. But its efforts to address asset price inflation and credit crises are interesting examples of targeted interventions that harness market forces. Fourth, the Government has sought to legitimise markets. Globalisation, free trade and open markets lead to significant dislocations. Some of the sharpest debates over the role of governments centre on this: To what extent should governments facilitate adjustments, redistribute incomes or provide social safety nets, so as to maintain public support for market-oriented policies? ENGAGING THE PEOPLE SECTOR Complementing government and markets is the role that society will play in tackling the great challenges and wicked problems of the 21st century. A key part of this governance process will be growing mutual engagement between the public and people sectors. In his 2011 National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong underscored the importance of such engagement, pointing out that the nation needs to "harness diverse views and ideas, put aside personal interest and forge common goals". This is especially important because people's expectations have changed - and are changing, continuously. WHY EXPECTATIONS ARE CHANGING I think there are a couple of reasons for this development. The first reason is that as government policies lead to improvements, the needs of the people change in tandem. This is explained by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Maslow's proposition was that after the basic physiological needs of a person are met, more complex psychological needs will have to be fulfilled. At the top of this hierarchy of needs are the need for self-actualisation, which is to realise the individual's potential, and transcendence, which is helping others achieve self-actualisation. So, if you accept this proposition, then after government has delivered on the basic needs of food, security, shelter, transport and health, expectations of the people are going to change, not in demanding more of the basic needs, but in fulfilling their more psychic needs in the upper reaches of Maslow's hierarchy, including social, emotional and self-actualisation needs. The challenge for governments everywhere is that success in delivering the material goods of life - housing, food and so on - is no guarantee that it can be successful in delivering "the good life", however defined. I suppose the reverse is true as well, although it is hard to imagine the good life without the basic necessities of liveability. THIRD GENERATION SINGAPOREANS The second reason is what I term the third-generation effect. Singapore is now 51 years old and into its third generation of Singaporeans. The first generation of Singaporeans lived through the turbulence and uncertainties of Merger and Separation. The next generation started life on a firmer footing, but at the same time imbibed from their parents a sense of the vulnerabilities. But the third generation of Singaporeans have known only the affluence and success of Singapore. For them, the uncertainties of the 60s and 70s are abstractions from their school history books. When their grandparents speak of the turmoil and danger that they experienced, they shrug their shoulders because it is an experience outside theirs. Of course, they are hardly to blame for this, and they certainly need not apologise for it. Singapore's founding generation made the sacrifices in order that their children and grandchildren would enjoy peace and prosperity. But clearly, what persuaded their parents and grandparents will not wash with the third generation. But as long as we are all in this together - and I hope that they feel they are in this together - the hopes and dreams of our youth must also appreciate the tough realities that endure. By all means, dream, but dream with your eyes wide open. So, communicating to the third generation will require fresh arguments and different approaches. PEOPLE EMPOWERMENT Citizens today feel empowered, because of the social media and higher levels of educational achievement. Indeed, Singaporeans today are much better educated than their grandparents. In 1965, the cohort participation rate for university education was a minuscule 3 per cent. Today, it is 30 per cent. The non-profit group Ground Up Initiative (GUI) points precisely to how attitudes are changing in Singapore. GUI operates a 26,000 sq m "Kampong Kampus" space in Khatib, with the aim of reconnecting urbanites to the natural environment. The group's founder, Mr Tay Lai Hock, said: "I think the top should set the example, but I also believe, you first and foremost, must take responsibility for your own life...Don't blame anybody. Don't blame the Government... I have a choice to decide that even though they have made this policy, I don't want to be a victim of their policies." THE BUKIT BROWN CASE STUDY In 2011, the Land Transport Authority announced plans to construct a road that would cut through Bukit Brown, the oldest cemetery in Singapore. Heritage groups protested, while the Government maintained its position on needing land in land-scarce Singapore. When Bukit Brown Cemetery was placed on the World Monuments Watch in 2013, one member of the group All Things Bukit Brown said: "I hope it shows that we are serious, that we want a seat at the table, just so we can present what we have heard from the community, what we have heard from the people who have encouraged us... You want development, but let's have a discussion, perhaps." The Government has to deal with an electorate that feels empowered, demanding and actively seeks participation. In this regard, Our Singapore Conversation, launched in 2013, signalled the Government's commitment to listening to the people's views. THE CASE OF THE MISSING PM2.5 By looking at issues from the perspective of end-users - namely the citizen - the government is able to design better policies than if they were just developed using the usual top-down approach. During the 2013 haze, experts had advised the Government to consider releasing another indicator besides the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) readings: the PM2.5 readings, which measure particles smaller than 2.5 microns. This is because PM2.5 particles greatly affect people with heart disease, as well as children and the elderly. When the haze began, the Government published the three-hour PSI readings and 24-hour PM2.5. But netizens and doctors pointed out that the PSI did not factor in PM2.5 readings as air quality indicators. Members of the public also expressed concern that the PSI values appeared different from what they had observed. Singaporeans even resorted to taking their own real-time air quality readings with commercial equipment. The Government said at first that it would be confusing for the public to have too many figures to read. But in the end, because of persistence of the public, NEA (the National Environment Agency) began providing more information on PM2.5, and from June 20, 2013, publishing the PSI and PM2.5 figures hourly, six days after the haze began. And eventually, from April 1, 2014, Singapore moved to an integrated air quality reporting index, with PM2.5 incorporated into the PSI as its sixth pollutant parameter. GOVERNMENT WITH YOU I have spent some time explaining how and why society in Singapore is evolving, and how government itself has to evolve in tandem. Put simply, it means a shift from the paternalistic and interventionist "government to you" and "government for you" to "government with you". The imperative is for government to move towards a collaborative approach to policy-making, and be prepared to connect, consult, and co-create with the people and the private sectors. Peter Ho's fourth and final IPS-Nathan lecture, titled The Future: Governance, Unintended Consequences and the Redemption of Hope is on May 17.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Apple isn’t as rich as it seems Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 4th, 2017 at 6:13 PM Share Tweet As part of its earnings announcement this week, Apple revealed that it’s sitting on $258 billion of cash, mostly overseas. That’s more than the GDP of some small countries, and one of the easiest ways to understand just how rich Apple is. But that $250 billion figure is actually a little more impressive than it should be. Apple’s money is held overseas, but it still needs to spend cash in the US. To get around paying tax, Apple has been borrowing money, and it’s currently sitting on nearly $100 billion in debt. Don't Miss: This sophisticated phishing scam has the entire internet terrified As the WSJ notes, Apple raised an eye-watering $11 billion in debt last quarter, bringing the total to around $100 billion. That number is set to increase: Apple is ramping up its share buyback program, and the new $1 billion investment fund it announced last night will be funded by debt. Apple opened up orders for its latest bond program this afternoon, and is said to already have raised $22 billion more. This doesn’t mean Apple is doomed, or that its cash fund is underwhelming: $150 billion in net assets is still nothing to sneeze at, and is bigger than the market cap of most other companies. But it’s worth bearing in mind in the context of Apple’s ballooning stock price. A lot of that interest has been generated by rumors of a one-off overseas earnings tax break, which would allow companies like Apple to repatriate cash at a 10% rate or so, rather than the usual 35%. Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook have talked before, possibly about a one-off tax break, but plans can’t be that far advanced if Apple is raising another $22 billion in the US.

Ever since the European Commission demanded that Apple repay $14.2 billion in back taxes to Ireland, I’ve been waiting for some kind of change. Sure, Apple’s two Irish subsidiaries, accused of the commission of paying almost no tax, are appealing the decision with help from Ireland itself and from Luxembourg, famous for its own sweetheart tax deals with multinational companies. Still, one might have expected Apple to reconsider its tax arrangements in view of the legal risk – and perhaps to pay more tax in Ireland and elsewhere outside the U.S. According to the company’s latest report, Apple’s effective tax rate in the quarter through the end of March was down to 24.9 percent from 25.6 percent the year before. I’ve described before how Apple gets to that number. It makes provisions for U.S. taxes in case it repatriates some of the overseas profits – something that may never happen – and separate provisions for very low foreign tax payments. For example, in 2016 it booked a $2.1 billion foreign tax provision on $41.1 billion in foreign income – at a rate of 5.2 percent, down from 6.1 percent in 2015. On these terms, it makes no sense for Apple to jump at President Donald Trump’s proposed one-time tax of 10 percent on profits – it’s cheaper to pay the foreign tax and the 3 percent interest on the bonds it issues to move the money to the U.S. Repatriation also appears to be unattractive for Google’s parent, Alphabet, which isn’t as specific about its tax reporting but which had an effective tax rate of 19.3 percent in 2016. It explains in its annual filing that the difference with the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent comes from paying less in other jurisdictions. If indeed Alphabet paid 35 percent on its U.S. earnings, and if its foreign operations are roughly as profitable as its domestic ones, U.S. taxes would amount to about $4 billion last year, leaving about $600 million for the rest of the world – on almost $11 billion of income, close to the rate Apple is paying. Facebook, for its part, reported paying $195 million in foreign income taxes last year. If its foreign operations are as profitable as its domestic ones, that’s less than a 3 percent effective rate. It’s remarkable that despite all the talk in Europe and elsewhere about the U.S. tech giants barely paying any taxes, nothing is changing. Late last year, the French Constitutional Council blocked a proposal for a “Google tax” on digital companies’ local operations because it felt the legislation unfairly singled out tech firms. Alphabet, like Apple, continues to fight European tax assessments on a case-by-case basis. Most recently, it’s been trying to settle a dispute with the Italian authorities involving up to 300 million euros in back taxes for 2009 through 2013. It’s clearly less expensive to bargain out such settlements than to submit to European countries’ normal tax regimes. Some European countries are trying to get at the U.S. tech companies’ profits indirectly. Austrian legislators believe they have figured out an ironclad way to make companies such as Alphabet and Facebook pay tax on the ads they show in Austria. They want to treat the companies’ business as barter transactions – services provided in exchange for users’ personal data; that would expose the companies to the Austrian tax on advertising revenue and to the value-added tax. Obviously, these attempts, too, will be challenged by some of the world’s most competent lawyers. The world outside the U.S. continues to subsidize the Silicon Valley giants. Governments are either outwitted in the courts, shamed into believing that a harder line would mean stifling innovation, or persuaded to accept settlements that don’t cover the lost tax revenue. Leveling the playing field would require more of a joint effort, for example, from the European Union or groups such as G-20. Luckily for the tech firms, that has proved elusive.

Apple captured 16 percent marketshare and became the world’s largest wearables vendor, overtaking Fitbit. Steven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global wearables shipments reached 22.0 million units in Q1 2017, rising 21 percent annually from 18.2 million in Q1 2016. Stronger demand for new smartwatch models in North America, Western Europe and Asia drove the uptick.” Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “Apple shipped 3.5 million wearables worldwide in Q1 2017, rising 59 percent annually from 2.2 million units in Q1 2016. Apple captured 16 percent global marketshare and overtook Fitbit to become the world’s largest wearables vendor. The new Apple Watch Series 2 is selling relatively well in the US, UK and elsewhere, due to enhanced styling, intensive marketing and a good retail presence. Xiaomi shipped 3.4 million wearables for 15 percent marketshare worldwide in Q1 2017. Demand for its popular Mi Band fitness range was broadly flat across its core markets of Asia.” Cliff Raskind, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “Fitbit shipped 2.9 million wearables worldwide in Q1 2017, falling a huge 36 percent annually from 4.5 million in Q1 2016. Fitbit has lost its wearables leadership to Apple, due to slowing demand for its fitnessbands and a late entry to the emerging smartwatch market. Fitbit’s shipments, revenue, pricing and profit are all shrinking at the moment and the company has a major fight on its hands to recover this year.” Exhibit 1: Global Wearables Vendor Shipments and Marketshare in Q1 2017 1 Global Wearables Vendor Shipments (Milions of Units)       Q1 ’16       Q1 ’17 Apple       2.2       3.5 Xiaomi 3.8 3.4 Fitbit 4.5 2.9 Others       7.7       12.2 Total       18.2       22.0   Global Wearables Vendor Marketshare %       Q1 ’16       Q1 ’17 Apple 12.1% 15.9% Xiaomi 20.9% 15.5% Fitbit 24.7% 13.2% Others       42.3%       55.5% Total       100.0%       100.0%   Total Growth YoY (%) 74% 21%   Source: Strategy Analytics   The full report, Global Wearables Vendor Market Share by Region: Q1 2017, is published by the Strategy Analytics Wearable Device Ecosystems (WDE) service, details of which can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/n29s7tt.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. For the first time, the tech giant released a breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that most of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more manufacturing jobs Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report came after years of complaints about labor practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company's major contractors in China, drew more attention to Apple's reliance on overseas factories. Apple to also issues a separate "supplier responsibility" report reviewing the labor conditions in those facilities. The Wednesday report on U.S jobs is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple's iPhone "ecosystem." That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps.

Apple left the iPhone 4s behind on iOS 9.3.5. The popular 4-inch device will never get iOS 10 and we don’t expect Apple to roll out a surprise iOS 11 update. This means it won’t get any new features, security patches or bug fixes to alleviate the iPhone 4s problems still plaguing users in 2017. iPhone 4s problems include abnormal battery drain, broken Wi-Fi, finicky Bluetooth connectivity, UI lag, random reboots, and an assortment of bugs and other performance problems. If you’re running into trouble on your iPhone 4s, you can’t rely on Apple to fix your problems. Unless you live near an Apple Store, you’ll need to fix the issue(s) yourself. This list of fixes covers the most common iPhone 4s problems. Some of these remedies will take you a few seconds to complete. Others are a little more involved. How to Fix iPhone 4s Battery Life Problems Battery drain is one of the more common iPhone 4s issues and it’s a problem that you can fix in just a few minutes. Apple’s iOS updates have been known to cause abnormal battery drain but there’s a good chance it’s not the operating system causing the abnormal battery drain on your device. Third-party apps and bad habits are typically the culprits. While there are a ton of things that people recommend, we think these are the fixes iPhone 4s users should try. These fixes range from small tweaks to your settings to changes in daily overall use. All of them have the potential to fix bad iPhone 4s battery life and we highly recommend looking at them before throwing your phone against the wall or into the ocean. How to Fix iPhone 4s Wi-Fi Issues iPhone 4s continue to complain about a wide variety of issues from grayed out Wi-Fi to unstable connections. These are extremely common. There is no guaranteed fix for iPhone 4s Wi-Fi issues but there are a few things that users can try before performing a factory reset, replacing a router, or taking the iPhone 4s down to an Apple Store. These fixes have been passed down from the iOS 7 and iOS 8 updates and they’ve worked for tons of people in the past. The first thing iPhone 4s users will want to try is resetting network settings. This is an extremely easy process though it could take a couple of minutes to complete. iPhone 4s users need to set aside some time to ensure that the process goes smoothly. To do this, open up the iPhone 4s and head to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. You will need the passcode for the iPhone and again, a few minutes of time because the phone is going to reboot itself to complete the changes. Those of you performing this fix will also want to track down commonly used Wi-Fi passwords because this process will force you to enter them once it completes. If that doesn’t fix things, iPhone 4s users can also try turning off Wi-Fi Networking. To do that, head to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > System Services. Toggle them off and reboot the phone. Once the phone’s rebooted there’s a chance Wi-Fi will be functioning normally again. How to Fix iPhone 4s Cellular Data Issues We continue to see complaints about iPhone 4s cellular data issues. Slow connections, no connections and other random problems have plagued users for years. To try and fix these cellular data issues, users will first want to try restarting the iPhone 4s. This has worked for us in the past. If that fix doesn’t work, try toggling cellular data on and off. This has worked for us in the past. To do that, Cellular > Cellular Data > Toggle Off. Finally, if none of that works, try flipping Airplane Mode on, waiting 30 seconds, and then flipping it off. This, like the other fixes, has worked to dislodge cellular data issues on the iPhone in the past. If none of that works, make sure that there isn’t an outage in your area. You’ll need to check in with your service provider for details. How to Fix iPhone 4s Bluetooth Problems Bluetooth problems are among the most common iPhone 4s problems and we’ve heard numerous complaints from iPhone 4s users in the many months since the iOS 9 release date. If you’re dealing with Bluetooth problems the first thing to do is to toggle Bluetooth off and then on again. You might also want to restart your phone. If this doesn’t work, try forgetting all of your Bluetooth connections. To do that, go into Bluetooth, tap the blue i in the circle and tap Forget This Device. If that doesn’t work, you’ll want to “Reset All Settings”. To do this, open up the iPhone 4s and head to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. This will cause your device to forget Wi-Fi passwords so make sure you have those handy. How to Fix iPhone 4s App Issues We’ve been getting a lot of complaints about various applications crashing and freezing. To fix these, make sure the applications on you iPhone 4s are updated with the latest bug fixes. It’s easy to forget about installing app updates so we recommend turning on automatic updates to ensure that you’re always up-to-date. To turn on Automatic app updates, head into Settings > iTunes & App Store > Toggle Automatic Downloads to On. If you’re updated and the app still isn’t working properly, try reinstalling it. If that doesn’t help, complain to the developer. Most developers encourage feedback and yours could help it come up with a fix in a future software update. How to Improve Performance on iPhone 4s Some iPhone 4s users have seen a drop in overall performance after installing the iOS 9 operating system. Lag and crashes are common issues. There are some ways to speed up the performance on the iPhone 4s should it get a little choppy after an upgrade or out of the blue. We’ve outlined a number of different strategies including reducing animations and pretty effects, resetting settings, or restoring back to factory settings. How to Fix iPhone 4s Landscape Issues If your iPhone 4s gets stuck in landscape mode, there are a few fixes to try. Try resetting your phone. This fixed the issue for us when it started happening when the device was on iOS 8. You can also lock the device’s orientation in portrait. This way, the device will remain in portrait mode when trying to use a third-party app or the camera. To lock the iPhone 4s in portrait mode, pull up Control Center from the bottom of the phone, look for the lock in the top right corner, and hit that. This will lock the screen so that it won’t move out of portrait mode when you shift the device. How to Fix iPhone 4s iMessage Problems We’ve been running into a number of iMessage problems on the iPhone 4s. Messages sometimes fail to send, even when in good coverage areas and we often get messages hours and sometimes days late. If this happens, the first thing to try is toggling iMessage off and on. If that doesn’t work, try rebooting the phone. If neither of those work, it’s time to reset the device’s network settings. To do that, head into Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. The iPhone 4s will reboot. And while the stored Wi-Fi networks will be lost, reentering a Wi-Fi password is a small price to pay for working iMessages. How to Fix iPhone 4s Random Reboots iPhone 4s users continue to see random reboots on iOS 9 and older iOS software. This is a very common iPhone problem. Unfortunately, they can be hard to fix. First, try restarting the iPhone 4s. This helped us when we encountered random reboots on the iPhone in iOS 7 and iOS 8. We also recommend performing a reset on all settings. To do that, Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. It also might be worth it to uninstall recent apps if the problems just started. We’ve also heard that performing a full on factory reset cures these issues but that should be a last ditch resort. How to Fix iPhone 4s Keyboard Lag We’ve encountered the occasional keyboard lag on the iPhone 4s when shooting off an email or iMessage. There are a few things iPhone 4s users can try to solve these problems should they pop up during email or messaging. First, try turning off Documents & Data in iCloud. To do this, Settings > iCloud > Documents & Data. If everything returns to normal, it should be okay to flip that back on. If that doesn’t work, try resetting all settings. To do that, General > Reset > Reset All Settings. How to Fix iPhone 4s Problems If Nothing Else Works If none of these fixes work and Apple’s discussion forums fail you, we have two recommendations. First, take the iPhone 4s to a Genius Bar at the local Apple Store. They might be able to diagnose your problem in a matter of minutes. Those that can’t or don’t want to go that route will want to consider performing a factory reset. Factory resets will wipe the iPhone 4s clean but it could work wonders for your iPhone 4s’ performance. To do that, choose Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Again, this will wipe everything from the iPhone 4s so make a back up before doing this, even though we don’t recommend installing from a restore. Setting all of this up is extremely consuming, but it may be the fastest way to fix the worst iPhone 4s problems. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 66 Responses 11/13/2014 sharon carrington Reply I am not able to call out on on my iphone 4s calls can come in 11/21/2014 joe Reply Ok my iphone 4s keeps crashing when I open an app the word and picture gets pixalated, my safari mail and games keeps crashing, to top it all off when I dial out it returns back to the dial scrern can’t send out text messages.

Neither my carrier nor Apple support know what to do. 2 year shelf life. I will never buy Apple in my future. 02/06/2016 tpa Reply To autumn, the only solution I have found for this is to plug it into a mains charger, then it comes back to life; hardly an ideal scenario for a mobile device. Apple support no help and as problems are intermittent and not user repeatable taking it to an Apple shop could just be a waste of money. Other problems relate to refusal to send or receive SMS. Also delayed sending, despite timer showing it sent until iMessage turned off then on again. Unfortunately it appears Apple is beginning to mimic Microsoft in introducing issues it is not prepared to resolve. 02/15/2016 Mxolisi Reply My iPhone 4s just shut down and doesn’t come on , how can i fix it please help 02/26/2016 karthik Reply i hav prob. on my iphone 4s. suddenly network service stopped. searching …. is showing . two time switched off and restarted even though searching only show … where is the signal that. place. i tried to replace the sim (twice)..

The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus currently run iOS 10.3.1 and many users are running into trouble on the most up-to-date version of iOS 10. iPhone 6s users on older versions of iOS 10 and iOS 9 are also running into trouble with their software. Help is on the way but some of you might not be able to wait for Apple and its next iOS update. Today, we want to take a look at iPhone 6s problems and offer some resources to those of you running into trouble. We also want to make sure that you’re prepared for the future, just in case you run into an issue with your phone. iPhone 6s Problems As we push into 2017 we continue to hear about iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus problems. iPhone 6s iCloud Restore problems are among the most common iPhone 6s problems and they’re giving new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus users headaches. Users are reporting long restore times that seem to go on forever. Fortunately, the process actually won’t take forever and we’ve found a potential fix to try. If you’re running into an iPhone 6s iCloud restore problem, you’ll want to set your phone up as new, install the iOS 10 update, choose restore, and then restore from iCloud. One other note. If you are having trouble activating your new iPhone 6s, try restarting the device or trying another connection. We’ve been hearing complaints about iOS 10 downloads getting stuck during the installation process. If this happens during your install, you’ll want to hold down the power button and home button at the same time. The phone will reboot and the download should continue properly. The iPhone 6s problems go beyond activation issues, problems with iCloud restore and software update installation issues. iPhone 6s users are complaining about Slide to Update issues (you can find a fix for this here), problems with iMessages, overheating issues, abnormal battery drain, Wi-Fi problems, Bluetooth issues, random reboots, UI lag, and a whole lot more. Apple’s discussion forums continue to fill up with complaints about the iPhone 6s and we expect more complaints to emerge throughout the year as Apple releases new software for the former flagship smartphones. iPhone 6s battery is such garbage.. — dakoda (@DCrabtree52) May 3, 2017 If this is your first iPhone, or if you’re planning to install a new iOS update you’ll want to take a look at our list of things to do before installing an iOS update and at our reasons to and not to install the latest iOS update. You’ll also want to take a look at the first iPhone 6s settings to change. How to Fix iPhone 6s Problems If you’re running into iPhone 6s problems, there’s no need to panic. We continue to update our list of fixes for common iOS 9 problems and iOS 10 problems and those are great places to start if you run into a software-related problem on your device. These fixes include ways to improve iOS 9 battery life, iOS 10 battery life, fix poor Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth issues, and plenty more. We’ve also put together some ways to improve iOS 10’s performance on your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. If you notice lag or random freezes, start there. It’s also important to note that some iOS-related problems will dissipate after a couple of days. For instance, battery life tends to settle after a few days with a new device or iOS update. If your iPhone 6s problems persist after a few days, that’s when you’re going to need to take action. How to Downgrade If an iOS update isn’t performing to your standards on the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus you can downgrade to an older version of iOS. For a limited time. Apple isn’t signing off on any iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus iOS updates which means you don’t have this option right now. The company typically signs off on older updates for a week or two before pulling the cord. Once that happens, the downgrade loophole will close up and you’ll be left with whatever version of iOS you’re on. We’ve put together a step-by-step guide that will take you through the downgrade process once it opens back up. We highly recommend getting familiar with it right now so that you can take advantage of the loophole in the future if you need to. Additional Resources If your needs go beyond our list of fixes or the downgrade process, know that you have a ton of resources at your disposal. If you’re in need of a fix or advice or feedback about new iPhone 6s iOS updates, you’ll want to check out Apple’s Discussion Forums. It’s a fantastic resource for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s problems. Bookmark it so that you can use it going forward. We’ve also found the MacRumors community to be a great resource so its in your best interest to stop by there as well. Social media websites like Twitter are also places to look for fixes and advice regarding problems with the iPhone 6s. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. @AppleSupport I purchased iPhone 6s on 18th November 2016 within 6 month earphone it's not working…! I'm really pissed off — Faiyaz Ahmed (@SFAhmed91) May 1, 2017 Your last line of defense is going to be Apple itself. The company runs an active Apple Support account on Twitter and it’s worth a try if you’re having an issue. If you can’t fix your iPhone 6s problem on your own, you’ll want to make an appointment to see a Genius at an Apple Store. They can run diagnostics that you might not be able to do at home and if you’re under warranty, you might be able to get a new phone. What’s Next Apple’s next update for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be its iOS 10.3.2 update. The update is currently in beta but it doesn’t have a public release date. We expect it to be released soon. If you’re unable to fix your iPhone 6s problems on your own, be on the lookout for it. It should include some bug fixes for lingering iOS 10 problems. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 37 Responses 09/25/2015 Jade Reply Any reports of problems with photos saving to camera roll, or notifications not working? (Plenty of storage space for camera roll) I too experienced the never ending iCloud restore for my new 6s 02/21/2016 Lynn Device Reply I had to restart the iCloud download three times until it finally worked, I have the 6S plus. 09/26/2015 Will.I.Aint Reply If anybody having the ‘slide to upgrade’ error and then get the activation code sent to your phone that won’t turn on. I got it solved with apple, just hold home button and side power button and release right when it turns off. then only hold down the home button while its off and plug it in while its still off. Oh all with iTunes open. It’ll bring you to a restore or update screen, choose restore. Accept all the info and it’ll go through a FULL restore and d.l. the software fix i assume. The only thing is it is a full restore so contact, media, apps, will all be removed. 09/26/2015 KCSunshine Reply Will I Aint – Thanks for the tip. I’m trying now. How long did the full restore take? 09/27/2015 Robert Long Reply I had a battery problem after restoring to last settings. Found the problem of lagging and drain to be caused by slow to dead download of music to the new phone. Left is on charge all night and 5 hours latter it only downloaded 500 songs out of 3000. I will associate it with just too many people doing the same thing and the iCloud servers not keeping up with demand. I turned iCloud off and did the rest with iTunes from the macbook pro and uploaded everything from there old school style and since then it has only dropped 3% batt over the past 10 hours. I would recommend people restore from PC backups and wait till the servers cool down before going the over the air route. 10/01/2015 Let Vio Reply Who can help me?

Kept getting the message iCloud Backup Failed There was a problem enabling iCloud Backup. I backed my phone on iTunes, upgraded to the iphone 6s and restored it from iTunes. No issues with the activation, nor the iTunes back up. I still cannot do an iCloud back up as I keep getting the same error message. Any ideas on how to fix this? I deleted the latest iCloud back up, and I see I have plenty of storage, so I am not sure if this is even a phone issue or an apple issue.

But how wise it is to take on Apple by invoking a dispute procedure that could end up in the courts is debatable. The US giant is well on its way to becoming a trillion-dollar outfit, having seen its value soar 27 per cent so far this year to $774 billion. Suffering: British tech-tyro Imagination has been bullied by Apple into taking some bold steps to save itself from the knacker’s yard, Alex Bummer says Indeed, even before anyone has seen the next generation iPhone, Apple shares constitute a whopping 15 per cent of the Standard & Poor’s 500 technology index.  With valuations among the big tech stocks heading towards $5 trillion, lifted higher by Facebook’s 47 per cent revenue boost overnight, the power of Silicon Valley has become irresistible. When someone suggested to Apple boss Tim Cook that the clunky Apple watch may not have been the great breakthrough hoped for, he shot back noting that with revenues of $5 billion to $6 billion it could already be in the S&P 500 as an independent enterprise.

Who makes the best posh estate - Audi, Mercedes or Volvo? We... WAVERTON PORTFOLIO: Fund increases UK exposure in... Share this article Share All of this illustrates the scale of the task which Imagination (in which I hold shares) finds itself. Apple is no stranger to patent disputes and has been in almost permanent war with rival Samsung. It even boasts to have gone to court and won against the FBI when the authorities demanded a back door key into the iPhone as part of the inquiry into the San Bernardino killings in 2015. Imagination has few other choices than to seek remedies from Apple, which is among its biggest shareholders and supplies 50 per cent of its revenues. Reaching for the sky: Apple shares constitute a whopping 15 per cent of the Standard & Poor’s 500 technology index The solution it is proposing to keep itself afloat is to jettison other parts of the enterprise.  It wants to sell two promising divisions - the embedded processor unit MIPS and the Ensigma mobile offshoot. When companies embark on panicky sales of key units, you fear the end is nigh. This was the strategy followed by HMV as it headed for insolvency. What Imagination really needs now is to sell itself as a whole to smart managers (such as those at engineering group Melrose) who know how to invest in and rebuild underperforming enterprises in double quick time and find a better home for them. It would be unfortunate if, as a result of ineptitude at the top, Imagination is allowed to embark on a slide to oblivion. Spanish shadow First-quarter numbers from HSBC showed a bank prospering in a faster growing global economy. Adjusted profits at £4.6 billion for the first quarter were 12 per cent up and the group’s refocus on its traditional hinterland in China is paying off. But as so often for the banks, the past continues to haunt. HSBC has been through hell and back in the US because of money laundering at its former Mexico subsidiary. Now the Spanish High Court has moved against it as a result of a money laundering case triggered by the whistle-blower Hervé Falciani.  He has exposed all kinds of nastiness funnelled through HSBC’s Geneva private bank. Court documents in Spain show that two former heads of private banking, Chris Meares and Clive Bannister, are under scrutiny as suspects. The former chairman of the private bank, Peter Widmer, also has been named. Meares already has testified before the Commons over alleged tax avoidance by HSBC’s private bank. The Spanish intervention will be a cause for anxiety among investors in the quoted ‘zombie’ insurer Phoenix, where as chief executive Clive Bannister is credited with a good job. Erasing a rancid decade will be a key task for Mark Tucker when he slides into the chairman’s seat at HSBC in October. Hat-trick or own goal? City analysts hailed this week’s strong business surveys as evidence the UK will resume strong growth in the second quarter. ‘A hat-trick of strong purchasing managers indexes,’ said the EY Item Club which uses the same model as the Treasury. ‘The sharpest rise in business activity since December 2016,’ according to Markit/Cips, which collects the data. ‘Good news at the start of Q2,’ say Berenberg. Goldman Sachs calculates Britain is expanding at a sturdy 2.2 per cent clip. All of this is somewhat different to how the economy is seen through the lens of the London Evening Standard, now edited by George Osborne who this time last year occupied Number 11. ‘Gloom over mortgages, car sales as inflation hits the consumer,’ noted the headline across a double-page spread.

In the Trading With Cody Chat Room today, people are upset about our losses in Gigamon and the fact that I'm cutting those losses this week. "Hi Cody as you have probably read myself and few others have been discussing exit strategies on some stocks. I have one I use but am curious on what you think. I'm not talking about stocks like Apple and Google and Amazon and Facebbook but stocks like GIMO, FIT, and even FSLR, AMBA. Why let these run down 50% or more without some kind of risk control which, for me, is needed in investing or trading?" And "I was right there with you on $FIT, and took my lumps too, so I feel you pain on both stocks (although I have not sold $GIMO yet). Both of those names are good reasons for the discussion that we have been having on the board about trying to be strategic in having an exit plan as well. I think one thing we really cannot afford to do in our portfolios have big losers. It would be really good if we could get some feedback from Cody on how to handle these stocks that lose a lot of value, fast." Look, if there were some sort of a magical system that could prevent me from ever buying any stocks that I end having to sell for a loss, I would do it. Don't you think Bill Ackman would have spent a billion dollars to find that magical system that would have kept him from losing 90% of his investment, a loss of $4 billion, in his fund's largest position, Valeant, from 2015 to 2017? One of the systems we can use, and which I have indeed used on Fitbit last year and Gimo this week -- cutting our losses and moving on. You might think you can simply employ some sort of "I'll always sell if the stock is down 20%" or something. But then you'd have sold Apple and Google and Amazon and Facebook many times over the years while I've held onto them and trusted in my analysis. You'll simply never be able to find a system that would enable you to sell out of a stock before it drops 30% or 50% or more and then be able to get back into it before it goes back up 3-fold or 5-fold or 100-fold like Apple has since we bought back in March 2003. I always hearken back to the memories of $AAPL, $GOOG, $FB and $AMZN having been down 50% or more at many points during the many years that I've been owning those names. If you try to out-trade the long-term value creation of investing in Revolutionary Companies you'll end up missing most of the 1000%, 10,000% returns over the years. My analysis is my best risk control, by which I mean that analyzing stocks and trends and getting positioned for the big cycles in the market properly is the best way for me to control risk. Not trying to control risk through trading in and out of individual stocks -- which is simply impossible to do consistently over many years and decades. So yea, it's easy to be like: FB and Apple and Amazon and Google are mega-cap stocks and they're different than non-mega cap stocks. But I'm here to remind you that I was buying -- investing (not trading) each and every one of those four stocks long before they were mega-caps. Facebook's market cap when I bought it: $50BB. Market cap now: $440BB Apple Market cap when I bought it: $4BB. Market cap now: $770BB Google - Market cap when I bought it: $30BB. Market cap now: $670BB Amazon - Market cap when I bought it (though I have bought and sold this stock entirely several times over the years since I first bought it -- regrettably, because I'd have made much more money if I'd just held it): $70BB Market cap now: $450BB Want some more context? Here are the market caps of some of our stocks not named Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook right now: Nvidia's market cap when I bought it a couple years ago: $18 billion. Market cap now: $60 billion. Axogen's market cap when I bought it about three years ago: $120 million. Market cap now: $400 million First Solar's market cap when I bought a few years ago: $3 billion Market cap right now: $3.6 billion Ambarella's market cap when I bought it a few years ago: $800 million. Market cap now: $1.9 billion Sony's market cap when I bought it a few years ago: $15 billion. Market cap now: $42 billion Palo Alto's market cap when I bought a few months ago: $13 billion. Market cap right now: $11 billion Snap Chat's market cap when I bought a few weeks ago: $23 billion. Market cap now: $25 billion. And as for the losers mentioned above: Fitbit's market cap when I bought it: $5 billion. Market cap when I sold it: $2 billion. Gigamon's market cap when I bought it: $1.6 billion. Market cap now as I'm selling it: $1.2 billion Certainly I've had other stocks I'd sold for a loss over the years, but that's part of cutting your losses. But you can see that our many winners that we've let ride over time, even as they've had pullbacks of 30% or 50% or more over that time frame, because we trusted our analysis and didn't try to create a system where one doesn't exist. I mean, let's keep it real here -- how many other writers, investors or money managers can point to the fact that they bought each of the four largest and most valuable stocks on the planet long before they were the four largest and most valuable stocks on the planet. I do want to be clear though -- I hate losses just as much as you guys do and I'm trying every day to do everything I can to avoid them! This article was written by Cody Willard for on .

Schwartz Updated 4:38 pm, Thursday, May 4, 2017 Photo: Richard Drew, Associated Press Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed the creation of the $1 billion fund during a television interview. Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed the creation of the $1 billion fund during a television interview. Photo: Richard Drew, Associated Press Apple announces $1 billion fund to create US manufacturing jobs 1 / 1 Back to Gallery While on the campaign trail last year, Donald Trump lamented the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and set his sights on companies like Apple to help rectify the situation. “I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,” he said. On Wednesday, Apple appeared to meet Trump halfway. While it did not announce a new manufacturing facility with thousands of jobs, Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, said it plans to dedicate resources to American job creation with a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. The company said it would announce the first investment from its new fund this month. Latest business videos The fund “can be the ripple in the pond,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during an interview with CNBC in which he announced the new fund. “Those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them.” In introducing the fund, Apple joined a growing list of companies that have said in recent months that they will add, promote or keep jobs — many of them related to manufacturing — in the United States. Carrier, a furnace maker that had been excoriated by Trump for potentially outsourcing jobs to Mexico, decided to keep 800 of 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis. SoftBank, a Japanese company that has invested in many businesses worldwide, told Trump it would use a $100 billion technology fund to create 50,000 American jobs. This week, Infosys, a tech outsourcing company in India, said it would hire up to 10,000 American workers. Some critics have suggested that the Trump administration is too focused on manufacturing, as opposed to more quickly cultivating service occupations — in the leisure and hospitality or health care industries, for instance. But for the roughly two-thirds of Americans who lack a four-year college degree, manufacturing remains one of the few sectors that can deliver a middle-class income. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical factory worker earns more than $26 an hour, compared with $14 an hour for the average hotel or food services employee. Even if more manufacturing jobs are created, however, there may be too few Americans with manufacturing skills to fill them. LinkedIn’s most recent monthly report on employment trends found there are not enough people with manufacturing skills in areas like New York City, Los Angeles and Denver, which lack the industrial bases found in cities like Cleveland and Detroit. Many high school graduates have avoided going into the sector as it has shed jobs, creating a labor shortage as workers retire. Apple’s focus with its new fund is on a slice of the industry known as advanced manufacturing. That typically involves the production of specialized products in sectors like technology, aerospace, automobiles, sustainable energy and medical equipment. In some cases, that means making much smaller batches than mass-production-oriented assembly lines churn out, or using robotics and 3-D printing to create custom items. Cook’s announcement of the fund came midway through his interview with Jim Cramer of CNBC, when he was asked what he was doing to create jobs. Cook answered that Apple had asked itself, “How can we get more people to do advanced manufacturing in the United States?” Cook did not address whether creation of the fund was influenced by Trump’s policies and statements on manufacturing. Asked by Cramer about working with the president, Cook said there are always issues to agree on and disagree on with any administration in any country. “You look to find common ground,” he said, and try to influence areas where there is disagreement. Cook added that Apple would announce what it plans to do to support its current employees and add to their ranks, and to aid the software developers who make apps for Apple’s phones, watches and computers. Apple, which reported its quarterly earnings Tuesday, had $257 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of April 1, so a $1 billion fund is relatively paltry for the company. Much of Apple’s cash is held overseas, but Cook told CNBC that the company will use “U.S. money” for the fund. An Apple spokesman said he did not have anything to add beyond what Cook said during the interview. Katie Benner and Nelson D. Schwartz are New York Times writers.

According to a Bloomberg report, Qualcomm is planning to ask the International Trade Commission to ban the import of iPhones from Asia. Citing an anonymous person familiar with Qualcomm’s company strategy, Bloomberg writes that the chip maker is threatening to block all handsets from entering the US ahead of Apple’s anticipated new devices this fall. The legal dispute began at the start of this year when the FTC filed a complaint over allegations of Qualcomm's anti-competitive practices. Apple then sued Qualcomm for about $1 billion, claiming it had been "charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with." Last month, Qualcomm countersued Apple, denying the iPhone maker’s allegation in a 134-page filing, while accusing it of breach of contract and interfering with agreements Qualcomm has with other companies. Qualcomm recently revealed Apple was withholding royalty payments as a result of the dispute, forcing it to cut revenue outlook by $500 million. Speaking about the case, CEO Tim Cook said he’s always hated litigation and is open to settling Qualcomm’s lawsuit, but expects a lengthy legal battle. “They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with, and so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID, or advanced displays, or cameras, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason, and the more expensive it would be for us to innovate,” said Cook. Whether the ITC really would do something as extreme as ban iPhone imports remains to be seen, but there’s no doubting that such an action would hit Apple very hard in the pocket.

In an interview with Mad Money’s Jim Cramer, CEO Tim Cook said the fund would help Apple be “the ripple in the pond, because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them.” The move could go some way towards placating President Trump, who has repeatedly called for US companies to move manufacturing jobs from overseas locations such as China back to American soil. The first beneficiary of the fund will be announced later in May. Cook didn’t go into specifics, but he did say Apple has “talked to a company that we’re going to invest in.” Cook said Apple would borrow the $1 billion rather than using the cash it has stored overseas, as this method is cheaper than paying taxes to bring the money back into the US. Apple reportedly has about $256.8 billion cash on hand, but 93 percent of that is held abroad. While there have been some reports that Apple could bring iPhone production to the US, the chances of it moving its large-scale manufacturing operations from China seems highly unlikely. In another part of the interview, Cook said rumors about the upcoming iPhone 8 were having a negative effect on iPhone 7 sales. “There are more rumors floating and more press articles and mentions of new things. And when that happens a percentage of people delay,” said the CEO. “And so yeah, we see a piece of that. That probably affects us more in China than other places because there’s a tendency there to buy the latest thing.” Related Reads Apple's latest iTunes update adds movie Extras to Mac and Apple TV Apple invites third-party developers to its headquarters to help finish up Apple Watch apps Apple seeds fourth iOS 8.2 beta to developers, references Apple Watch 4 comments 57 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Samsung could replace Intel as the world's largest chip maker later this year Facebook's $8.03 billion revenue beats quarterly estimates as site closes in on 2 billion users Gaming PC sales growing fast in the US Popular 22 comments The Best Monitors: Top 4K, enthusiast, gaming, and budget choices Radeon RX 580 vs. GeForce GTX 1060: 27 Game Battle Load Comments 4 ...

Fiji Time: 7:09 PM on Friday 5 May Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business $2b fund for Apple partners Reuters Friday, May 05, 2017 APPLE Inc plans to create a $US1-billion ($F2b) fund to invest in US companies that perform advanced manufacturing, chief executive officer Tim Cook said yesterday, on the iPhone maker's latest effort to show how it is creating US jobs. The Cupertino, California company will announce the fund's first investment later in May, Mr Cook said during an interview on CNBC. Mr Cook also said Apple planned to fund programs that could include teaching people how to write computer code to create apps, and would release more details about the effort this summer. The announcements were the latest in a series of disclosures to highlight how Apple, the world's largest company by market valuation, contributes to job creation in the US. Apple came under fire from President Donald Trump during his campaign because it makes most of its products in China. In February, during the company's annual shareholder meeting, Mr Cook said Apple spent $50b in 2016 with its US suppliers, which include firms like 3M Co and Corning Inc, the first time Apple has disclosed the metric.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple, Inc.'s 10.5% Dividend Increase Is Disappointing Apple just announced another double-digit dividend increase. However, that still leaves it with a below-average yield, despite its strong balance sheet and ample free cash flow. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) May 4, 2017 at 5:20PM As expected, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) updated its capital return program earlier this week, in conjunction with its second quarter earnings report. As part of this update, Apple raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to $0.63, effective this month. Since reinstituting its dividend in 2012, Apple has increased it at an average annual rate of 10.7%. Thus, this year's increase is right in line with the recent trend. Nevertheless, Apple's decision to offer a relatively modest dividend increase is disappointing in light of the company's strong cash flow, low payout ratio, and surging stock price. The dividend yield is fading In the past few quarters, Apple has stabilized its revenue and earnings. Looking ahead, the launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year is widely expected to drive a return to strong growth. As a result, Apple stock has skyrocketed more than 50% over the past year. Apple Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Not surprisingly, Apple investors are ecstatic about this recent run of strong stock gains. However, one side effect is a decline in Apple's dividend yield. When Apple raised its quarterly dividend to $0.57/share a little more than a year ago, that gave the stock a 2.2% annual yield. By contrast, even after the recent 10.5% dividend increase, Apple's yield has fallen to 1.7%. Apple now sports a dividend yield that is below the average for the S&P 500 (currently around 2%). The company could clearly afford to pay far more, based on its strong earnings and cash flow. Apple can afford more Wall Street analysts expect Apple to post earnings per share of about $9 in the current 2017 fiscal year, followed by EPS of more than $10 in fiscal 2018. That puts its payout ratio at 28% for this year and less than 25% for next year, based on the new annual payout of $2.52/share. Apple's dividend payout ratio is quite low. Image source: Apple. To be fair, Apple generates 65% of its revenue outside the U.S. Under current U.S. tax law, it would have to pay steep repatriation taxes of up to 35% in order to use cash generated abroad for dividends. Still, assuming that Apple generates around 35% of its profit in the U.S. (roughly in line with the distribution of its sales), its domestic cash flow would be sufficient to pay a quarterly dividend of up to $0.75-$0.80. Furthermore, President Trump and congressional Republicans are both eager to implement a tax reform package that would slash U.S. corporate taxes and enable companies like Apple to repatriate foreign cash at a very low tax rate. In a worst case scenario -- i.e. assuming tax reform didn't happen -- Apple could issue some debt or pay taxes to repatriate cash if its dividend were slightly higher than its domestic cash flow. Waiting for tax reform One reason for Apple's decision to stick with a modest dividend increase is that management still thinks Apple stock is undervalued. As a result, the company continues to focus most of its capital return program on share repurchases. That said, Apple stock isn't as much of a bargain as it has been for the past few years, so the argument for buybacks over dividends is losing strength. Furthermore, Apple could have announced a bigger increase to the capital return program to support a higher dividend without compromising its share repurchase plans. The bigger issue is that Apple has decided to keep its capital returns in line with free cash flow for now, notwithstanding its enormous cash pile. CFO Luca Maestri made it clear on Apple's recent earnings call that until U.S. tax law actually changes, Apple isn't going to make any major changes to its capital allocation strategy. If legislators do agree on a tax reform package that eliminates the distinction between domestic and foreign income, Apple would no longer have an artificial constraint limiting its dividend. It could raise its payout ratio over time to 40%-50% -- and possibly even higher -- while dipping into its $250 billion-plus cash reserves to fund share buybacks. But until the ink is dry on a corporate tax reform bill, it looks like Apple investors will have to settle for 10%-11% annual growth in Apple's dividend payout.

The research firm IDC says that first quarter 2017 shipments were at 36.2 million, down 8.5 percent from the same time last year. First quarter shipments peaked back in 2014, when 50.4 million tablets were sent out globally. IDC includes both traditional tablets and more powerful devices, like the Surface Pro, in its count of tablet sales — any tablet with a first-party detachable keyboard counts, but convertible laptops with permanently attached keyboards don’t. “We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones.” Apple remains the market leader, with just under a quarter of all shipments by IDC’s calculations. But its control over the market shrank slightly, which suggests the iPad Pro hasn’t done much to improve sales. In fact, the only major tablet manufacturer to grow this quarter was Huawei, which was up to 2.7 million shipments, from just 2 million the same time last year. The coming months could be interesting to watch. Apple’s tablet lineup got a lot more aggressive at the tail end of March with the release of a $329 iPad — one of the lowest prices Apple has put on a tablet to date. But it shipped too late to have an impact on this quarter’s results. IDC also says to look out for whatever Apple and Microsoft have planned for later in the year, saying the market “will move with major product launches” from the two of them. That said, Microsoft’s Surface line doesn’t seem to be having a huge impact. Microsoft doesn’t rank in IDC’s list of the top five tablet makers, which may be because it’s focused on high-end, expensive devices. Amazon ranks third in market share, and it focuses entirely on low-cost tablets. IDC analyst Ryan Reith sees a couple reasons why people aren’t buying as many tablets these days. “We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression,” Reith says. For now, IDC says the tablet market’s growth is in “detachables” — that is, tablets like the iPad Pro with first-party, detachable keyboards. Shipments of these devices continue to grow, and IDC thinks they’ll continue to beat out convertible laptops in the long run. Though, this quarter, that didn’t quite happen.

The study on mobile device security, mandated by a 2015 law, offered a series of recommendations for the U.S. government to safeguard smartphones and tablet computers against threats from nation-states, criminal hackers, and others, DHS said on Thursday. The study was produced by DHS' Science and Technology Directorate in coordination with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a government body that produces optional standards on information technology and cybersecurity. "The [study] has found that threats to the mobile device ecosystem are growing, but also that the security of mobile computing is improving," Dr. Robert Griffin, acting undersecretary for Science and Technology, said. ADVERTISEMENT "It outlines several important recommendations to strengthen security that will help the Federal government keep pace with current and emerging threats." The study was mandated by the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, legislation aimed at enhancing information sharing about cybersecurity threats. DHS said that the study drew on significant input from the mobile industry and academic researchers. It outlined a range of threats to mobile devices used by the federal government, including those posed by nation states, organized crime, and hackers, DHS said. It also touched on threat patterns that target consumers, including ransomware, banking fraud, and identity theft. The study warned that federal government device users could be at increased risk because of their employment. These devices could also be used to attack back-end computer systems that hold sensitive data on Americans and government operations, the study said.   Recommendations offered by the report include adopting a mobile device security framework and starting an information-sharing program to address mobile malware and vulnerabilities.

APPLE ANNOUNCES $1B JOBS INVESTMENT: Apple will put up $1 billion to start a fund geared toward boosting advanced manufacturing in the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook said Wednesday. "I'm proud to tell you that we're creating an advanced manufacturing fund," Cook said on CNBC's "Mad Money." "We're initially putting $1 billion in the fund." "By doing that, we can be the ripple in the pond," he added. "Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around -- those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them, because you have a service industry that builds up around them." Cook said Apple would announce the first investment from the fund later in May. The announcement appears to fit in line with President Trump's calls to bring manufacturing jobs to the U.S. Cook also applauded the Trump administration's proposal to lower the corporate tax rate from the current 35 percent.

RURAL BROADBAND COMPANIES SHOW SUPPORT FOR FCC CHIEF: A group of small, rural broadband companies on Thursday praised the Federal Communications Commission's moves to repeal its net neutrality rules. The internet providers, all members of the trade group USTelecom, wrote a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai applauding him for his "vision and leadership" in moving to repeal the net neutrality regulations. The letter expressed support for principles of net neutrality, like treating all web traffic equally, but criticized the FCC's move to reclassify the broadband providers as telecommunications services, which opened them up to tougher, public utility-style regulation. "Rural America urgently needs a smarter and more practical approach than rules based on laws written when our grandparents were stringing the countryside with copper and even cattle wire to connect neighbors on old party line telephones," the letter reads.

ALPHABET CHIEF ON HIGH-TECH VISAS: Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet, doesn't think very highly of U.S. limits on visas for high-skilled immigrants. "The single stupidest policy in the entire American political system was the limit on H-1B visas," Schmidt said at an event at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab on Wednesday, according to CNN. H-1B visas for high-skilled workers are currently capped at 85,000 annually. Those visas filled were within five days this year, something that has repeatedly happened in recent years. Critics argue this means the program should be expanded. But President Trump signed an executive order last month calling for tougher oversight of the program to cut down on potential fraud.

The chipmaker will make the request to the International Trade Commission, a source told Bloomberg. The quasi-judicial agency has the power to bar certain goods from coming into the United States. Apple iPhones are manufactured in Asia. Qualcomm and Apple have been locked in a long legal battle sparked over patents the chipmaker holds that allow it to charge royalties on many smartphones, even if the device doesn't use its chips. Apple argues that this isn't fair and has accused Qualcomm of unfair trade practices. Read more here. FCC CHIEF TO DELIVER SPEECH ON FIRST 100 DAYS: Ajit Pai, the Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, will deliver a speech on Friday marking 100 days of him leading the regulatory agency. Pai will give the speech at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The FCC chair made waves last week with his announcement that he would begin proceedings this month to roll back the agency's net neutrality rules, which were passed in 2015 and require internet service providers to treat all web traffic equally.

SPACEX WANTS TO LAUNCH BROADBAND-DEPLOYING SATELLITES: SpaceX, the Elon Musk-founded aerospace company, told Congress that it is planning to launch a network of satellites to deliver broadband internet access from space. During a Senate Commerce hearing on Wednesday, Patricia Cooper, SpaceX's vice president of satellite government affairs, outlined the company's plans to deploy a constellation of 4,425 satellites to deliver broadband internet around the world. According to The Verge, there are currently only an estimated 1,459 satellites in orbit around Earth. In her written testimony, Cooper told the committee that this approach to providing internet access will reduce the amount of infrastructure needed on the ground, making it easier to bring broadband to underserved areas, like rural communities.

The barricades in front of the upcoming Apple Store in Orchard Road's Knightsbridge mall came down on Wednesday night. In their place, on the building's facade, are three icons - Apple, Heart and Red Dot - as well as the name of the store, Apple Orchard Road, below. There are 12 smaller groups of the icons close to the still-closed glass doors. Each group has a different red dot to represent the 12 local "Creative Pros" - photographers, artists, musicians and film-makers selected by Apple to conduct free hands-on lessons on topics such as photography and illustration at the store. They include photographers Aik Beng Chia, Ernest Goh and illustrator Kristal Melson. Mr Chia, who is known for street photos taken with his iPhone camera, said: "I'm pretty stoked to be able to share what I see and impart my knowledge using my iPhone camera to fellow Singaporeans." The sessions, called Today at Apple, will be launched progressively in all Apple retail stores across the world this month. Apple senior vice-president of retail Angela Ahrendts has said previously that Apple does not merely view its retail spaces as stores but as modern-day town squares where everyone is welcome. The Straits Times understands that Apple Orchard Road will be opening soon, but no specific date has been given. News of the store here first broke in October 2015, after a former tenant of the mall, the Pure Fitness gym chain, sent a letter to its members informing them of its closure to make room for the Apple store. In addition, four other tenants at the mall - clothing shops Tommy Hilfiger, Topshop/Topman and Brooks Brothers, as well as watch retailer Dickson Watch & Jewellery - were reported to be moving as well. Apple Orchard Road will be run on 100 per cent clean energy using rooftop solar installations provided by Singapore-based solar energy provider Sunseap Group. "I believe Apple Singapore's local Creative Pros strategy is an excellent example of a company's continued attempt to creatively reinforce its strong brand identity in a globally consistent but locally adaptive way," said Associate Professor Leonard Lee from the National University of Singapore Business School.

Last year, Google jumped into the mix and immediately rose to the top ranks, with the Pixel claiming a spot next to the iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best phones money could buy in 2016. And with that, Apple's place on the top shelf started to look more crowded than it had in recent years. But 2017 is a new year, and Apple isn't done feeling the heat—the newly-released Galaxy S8 is pound-for-pound the best Android phone we've ever tested, and maybe even the best phone we've ever used, period. And it's not just Samsung that's upping the competition, either. Google is on pace to release a follow-up to its crowd-pleading Pixel sometime later this year, and you better believe the tech giant learned a thing or two about building and marketing a winning smartphone after its inaugural run in 2016. If Apple hopes to secure its footing at the top of the smartphone food chain, here's a list of what it needs to do to keep the iPhone from slipping out of the hearts and minds of shoppers looking to upgrade to the next big thing. Keep the fingerprint sensor on the front, but put it beneath the screen itself The iPhone 7 was the first iPhone to replace its iconic home button with a pressure-sensitive, capacitive facsimile that mimicked the look and feel of the original button. According to industry sources, however, the next iPhone is rumored to feature a display that takes up the entire front side of the phone—just like the extra-tall display on the Samsung Galaxy S8. After Samsung displaced the Galaxy S8's home button with a ginormous screen, its engineers decided that the fingerprint scanner would now live on the back of the device—right next to the S8's primary camera. The problem is that the fingerprint scanner on the S8 is roughly the height and width as the phone's camera. What's worse is that the camera is right smack-dab in the middle of the S8's back casing, which is the spot your finger is naturally inclined to go when it wants to unlock the phone. The next iPhone is rumored to feature a display that takes up the entire front side of the phone. In order to avoid the same smudgy-camera fate, Apple will need to position the next iPhone's fingerprint scanner more strategically. Fortunately, according to the iPhone rumor mill, Apple allegedly figured out a way to keep the scanner on the front of the iPhone despite its edge-to-edge, bezel-less display: by putting it underneath the display itself. If this rumored high-tech trickery proves true, the next iPhone will see all of the benefits of a massive screen without forcing its users to re-train their fingers to unlock their phone. It's an easy way to score some points on Samsung, The size and placement of the Galaxy S8's fingerprint scanner doomed it from the start.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) Make the camera faster If there's one area where the Google Pixel has an edge over its contemporaries, it's camera speed. The reason for the Pixel's zippy shutter speed has to do with some ingenious software. Essentially, whenever the Pixel's camera app is open, it's always snapping rapid-fire photos. The only ones that are saved, however, are the photos taken when a user decides to take a picture. This is the sort of software development that Apple should be looking to steal (or, ahem, adopt) moving forward. Sure—when it comes to speed, the iPhone 7's camera ain't exactly slow, but if there's an opportunity to close the gap between you and your opponent, you've got to take it—even if it means poaching your opponent's winning formula. Google's camera takes advantage of some nifty software trickery to make it the fastest smartphone camera on the market today.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) Introduce wireless charging Wireless charging has been a key feature of Samsung's Galaxy series for several years—so long a time, in fact, that it's downright silly that Apple has yet to incorporate similar technology in its iPhone lineup. It's downright silly that Apple has yet to incorporate wireless charging. If you've never known the splendor of wireless charging, just imagine an office desk or a night stand free of cables. Better yet, imagine a bedtime routine that doesn't involve getting down on your hands and knees while you fumble around for a spare outlet. When a new Galaxy phone is released, its wireless charging functionality tends to be overshadowed by camera performance, raw hardware specs, and overall battery life. But it's high time Apple catches up with its chief rival and introduces similar functionality for the iPhone (just don't expect an official Apple charging pad to come cheap). The iPhone 7 is the first iPhone to feature water resistance—and hopefully not the last.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) Keep the water resistance Although Samsung wasn't the first to make a water-resistant smartphone, its Galaxy flagships were the first smartphones to make water resistance an expectation rather than a bonus feature. Needless to say, it took Apple a while to catch up. (Sensing a pattern yet?) Both of the latest iPhones can withstand rain, spills, and accidental drops in the toilet. With the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple finally gave its base what it spent years clamoring for: Both of the latest iPhones can withstand rain, spills, and accidental drops in the toilet. But why stop there? Why bother reverting back to the dark days of sticking your waterlogged iPhone in a bag of rice, wondering if that ill-fated puddle will ultimately claim the life of your precious phone? Besides, if the first Pixel is any indication, Google might not outfit its next smartphone with water resistance. If Apple really wants to sweep Google's leg, this might be a good place to gain the upper-hand. For Apple, staying in front of Samsung and Google is just as much about incorporating new ideas as it is about maintaining the ideas that have proven to work. Water resistance is no longer a nifty add-on feature—it's something people expect. More crucially, it's something people will be disappointed not to have anymore. Real advice from real experts.

The concept isn’t much different from the iPhone; simultaneously pressing the only two buttons on the Watch — the Digital Crown and the side button — has been the usual way of capturing a screenshot on the Apple Watch, however watchOS 3 threw an extra wrinkle into the mix. In watchOS 3, Apple chose to also assign the simultaneous press of both side buttons to the Workout app, allowing you to quickly pause and resume an in-progress workout. On the assumption that most users are more likely to want to pause/resume workouts than take screenshots, by default watchOS 3 disables the screenshot feature. Fortunately, however, you can turn the option back on with a quick visit into the iPhone’s Apple Watch app; the Enable Screenshots setting can be found in the General section. Note that enabling screenshots on the Apple Watch doesn’t change the behaviour of the Workouts app, so you’ll still be able to pause your workouts in the same way, but the downside is that you’ll get a screenshot every time you do that as well.

As the new web page points out, Apple is “one of the biggest job creators in the United States,” both directly and indirectly supporting more than two million jobs across all 50 U.S. states, and having spent over $50 billion into the U.S. economy through deals with American suppliers, developers, and partners. Apple’s new web page breaks down the numbers more specifically, citing 80,000 employees in the U.S. directly employed by Apple, 450,000 jobs through U.S.-based suppliers, and then adds over 1.5 million jobs attributed to the App Store ecosystem. Interestingly, the page also specifically breaks down the number of jobs in each U.S. state, along with a few key apps that originated in those states (not surprisingly, California represents the largest numbers), and a map showing where App Store ecosystem jobs have been created across the U.S. Comments « Apple seeds fifth beta of tvOS 10.2.1 to registered developers Qualcomm petitioning ITC to ban import of iPhones into the U.S. » Related Stories Report: Inventec involved in producing Apple’s Siri-enabled home hub speaker Notes from Apple’s Q2 2017 earnings call Apple Q2 2017: $52.9B revenue, 50.8M iPhones + 8.9M iPads sold Report: Apple’s Siri-enabled home control hub may debut at WWDC (Update: KGI agrees) Apple now withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm as dispute escalates Apple releases fifth beta of iOS 10.3.2 Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Apple seeds fifth beta of tvOS 10.2.1 to registered developers Apple posts new web page emphasizing U.S. job creation Qualcomm petitioning ITC to ban import of iPhones into the U.S. Report: Inventec involved in producing Apple’s Siri-enabled home hub speaker Hulu with Live TV app lands on App Store Notes from Apple’s Q2 2017 earnings call Apple Q2 2017: $52.9B revenue, 50.8M iPhones + 8.9M iPads sold Logitech reveals Slim Folio Bluetooth keyboard case for fifth-generation iPad Several major apps ditching Apple Watch support?

Worldwide tablet shipments have declined 8.5% over the past year, Q1 is the tenth straight quarter in decline Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 1:20pm PDTMay 4, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 15 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 News Remember when everyone thought tablets would replace PCs, at least for average consumers? Yeah, that didn't happen. In fact, the opposite is happening. In a report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide tablet shipments in Q1 2017 have dropped 8.5% compared to Q1 2016, with just 36.2 million devices shipped. In addition, Q1 2017 is the tenth straight quarter where the tablet market saw a decline, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. It's worth nothing that the IDC only counts 'slates' (tablets lacking a keyboard) and 'detachables' (tablets with first-party keyboards) as tablets. There are a few reasons for this continuing decline, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Convertible laptops, commonly referred to as 2-in-1s, have been cannibalizing the tablet market for a while now. The rise of larger smartphones didn't help tablets either. Apple remained top tog over the past quarter, with 8.9 million unit shipments. Samsung followed in second place, with Huawei, Amazon, and Lenovo rounding out the top five manufacturers. Apple's results likely had a small bump from the recent 9.7" iPad refresh. Samsung also released the Galaxy Tab S3 during this time, but it launched near the end of Q1, so the impact is likely negligible. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. There has been very little incentive for people with tablets to buy new ones, and Android tablets haven't seen much attention from OEMs or Google since the Honeycomb days. Press Release FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with total shipments of 36.2 million, a year-over-year decline of 8.5%, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker. The first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions as noted by IDC in the past. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, which IDC refers to as detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products that IDC refers to as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. The other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 and is now in a steep decline that IDC believes will continue throughout the forecast period. "As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression." At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, the personal computer market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. "A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate," said Linn Huang, research director, Devices & Displays at IDC. "To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit. In IDC's 2017 U.S. Consumer PCD Survey, fielded over the previous two months, detachable owners held slightly more favorable attitudes towards their detachables than convertible owners did for their convertibles. However, owners of both were far more likely to recommend a convertible over a detachable." IDC's outlook is that detachables will continue to far outpace convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favor of convertibles if ever so slightly. Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos. Tablet Company Highlights Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines. 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version. This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices. Samsung remained the number 2 tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1% year over year in 1Q17. Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity. Huawei was the only company among the top 5 to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7% from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices. It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company. Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy. Lenovo rounded out the top 5 with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. Of all the companies in the top 5, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business and IDC expects to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category. Lenovo captured 5.7% market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5% market share it had at this time last year. Notes: Total tablet market includes slate tablets plus detachable tablets. References to "tablets" in this release include both slate tablets and detachable devices. The reference to 'convertibles' for convertible notebooks, which are notebook PCs that have keyboards that can either flip, spin, or twist, but unlike detachable tablets, convertible notebook keyboards are hardwired to the display.

My Nexus 7 has been in a drawer since I got my Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. Geoff Johnson Plus ultrabooks have been getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper, so it's not as much of a pain to carry around a laptop like it was 5 years ago. Suicide_Note Agreed. Buying the N6 made my second gen N7 pretty much irrelevant/redundant, so i sold it and never bought another tablet after that. Timmy Turner Same, although I still whip it out for road trips for movies. Dan Nah, I bought a used N9 on swappa to go with my N6, I read books and e-mail and such on the N6, but the larger screen is much better for web surfing, shopping etc. Callanish My Nexus 7 LTE continues to get decent use as it splits the battery load with my 6P so I don't need to charge the phone throughout the day. It is getting long in the tooth though as far as performance though. Keeping a close eye on Lenovo's new tablets coming out in May, especially the 8 inch tab 4 plus LTE model which should make for a decent replacement to the Nexus 7 2013. Thade780 When I got my Nexus 6 I thought the same, but then I started craving a bigger screen for when I was at home and just wanted to browse Reddit and watch Youtube. In the end I got a 10" Samsung S2 and I'm in fucking love with it. It's still plenty fast and does everything I need, so I'm going to skip the S3. I may end up with a possible Tab S4 next year. sbeaulieu My Nexus 9 is working so great it make me want to buy another one. /s & /s Peter Silie I'm fine with my N9 :) (/nosarcasm) freddyba I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5", and it works great. However I won't buy another Galaxy Tab S(X) until they get a 16:9 screen again. I will just stick with what I have, replace the battery in a few years if need be. However I will gladly take suggestions on 16:9 tablets if any one has them! Marty They say the iPad is also in decline. I find that difficult to believe because I own a number of iPads and find them to be the finest web browsing tool ever created. I use mine for media playing, web browsing and a few other task-related things. I came from a PC, which is all I cared to use for web browsing and everything else. But since owning an iPad, the PC now seems clunky at best. I hate to even boot my PCs up. I relegate them strictly to command line tasks. They just don't provide the ease and simplicity of usage I experience with my iPads. I also own Android tablets. There has never been an Android tablet in my experience that has been worth a damn for reliable web browsing or other usage. In my opinion they are the absolute worst devices yet. So, given the value I deem of the iPad trying to understand why it's not selling like gangbusters, I just wonder if people aren't buying Android tablets, getting the same horrifically crappy experience I have with them and then condemning all tablets as worthless...the iPad included? I just wonder if people are being terminally pessimistic about *all* tablets because of any experience with Android tablets? I can understand that if that's happening. I've tended to be that way with things at times myself. catalysto I can't speak to the decline of the iPad, but I absolutely hate any tablet browsing experience. Mobile web browsing is painfully limited in many cases, and for that reason alone, I cannot get into the idea of replacing my laptop with a tablet. I'd get a Chromebook before getting a tablet (though in an ideal situation, I'd have a nice, convertible ultrabook). Marty I've done pretty much ever configuration of PC. I started out buying an eMachines tower a very long time ago. Then I bought a Velocity Micro tower rig. Then I started building my own custom tower rigs. Built several and even sold one on eBay trying to go into the custom PC business. Didn't work out due to family-related issues. Then I got into laptops and have owned a handful. Now I'm into tablet PCs. I own two: a Sony 11.6" Vaio Tap 11 and a Surface 3. None of them have been as convenient to use as my iPads. I doubt I will ever buy another PC...unless MS can somehow radically improve Windows to where it's as convenient and easy to use as an iPad. Not likely, though. Nexus Hexus I find using my Acer X34 Monitor, Core i7 7700k @5Ghz, GTX 1070, 32GB Ram, 960 EVO SSD to be worlds better then any iPad. You're one of those people that say your new phone or tablet is better to use then his 10 year old budget computer. Marty To each, his own. Brandon V. Fletcher iPad sales have been going down for a while. https://www.recode.net/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling JLV90 Well most people use tablets for media consumption you don't need much performance to run netflix and youtube. RiftSilver I'm wondering if I'm just not looking, or uniformed. But what happened to good budget friendly tablets like the Nexus 7 (2013)? I love mine, still going strong. I know myself and others I know are in the market for a new good tablet, but for what most good tablets are going for now, ~$600, I'd rather buy a laptop. Jonathan Litwinka They stopped being "good". You can get an okay tablet for between $150-$200 at Costco or Amazon, but the tech is still comparable to the Nexus 7 (2013). Callanish Keep your eye on the Lenovo Tab 4 range being released in May. Good pricing, decent specs and running Nougat 7.1.1. Like you, my Nexus 7 13 has been a workhorse, but performance has become my biggest gripe, even after cleaning out the cache now and then. Defenestratus My Pixel C is basically a laptop. It works beautifully for what I use it for - web browsing, kindle-reading and minor productivity work. fgd135 I replaced my tablet with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and couldn't be happier. destinyhud planning on doing this but waiting more devices burkett375 Waiting on the Pro...the processor on the + has me worried. dizel123 There are basically 2 classes of tablets. The decent ones that are waaaayyyy overpriced and the cheap ones that are absolute garbage. And most of them have very little to no software support. If companies sold decent tablets for decent prices and guaranteed updates, maybe people would buy them. destinyhud this is why i think a chromebook pixel c2 would be the best of both world. pixel c was just $500 Mix Bought an 8 " $200 Samsung tab A for my 2 year old for Paw Patrol and what not and it's great, the Galaxy tab S3 is $799...like what the balls Samsung!?

Normally I generate eighty bucks each hr and even work for three to 4 hours majority of the days.And wonderful thing about this is exactly that one could manage time when you work and for how long as you like and you achieve a paycheck per week. ---->>>LEARN MORE Regarding It here-> http://s.id/272 mfofofipf Kumnaa The most recent Nexus 7 is almost 4 years old now though :( Kristian Ivanov And the Shield K1 (the actual successor to the Nexus 7 2013) JSo Well if a company would make something worth buying it might change. Marty You mean if a company would make an *Android tablet* worth buying it might change. There are none. Brian Klippel We buy used nexus 9's in this house. With nexus gone, all of the new tablets on the market are way to expensive for what they offer. Pretty much only the pixel will get more than a year of updates and it's just too expensive to watch youtube and play candy crush on. I had one samsung tablet that I smashed with a hammer because it was such a POS. Biff Wonsley Last fall I bought an Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Z380M.) Not especially impressive specs, but it's fine for the usual apps & reading books & only cost $130. And about a month ago it was updated with Nougat, which I didn't in my wildest dreams expect. I have a Nexus 6, but I can't imagine reading a book with it. So long as 8" or so tablets are available, I'll have one. What passes for a phablet these days isn't big enough. Jay There hasn't exactly been many new and/or good tablets to help with these statistics either. Marc Edwards "Apple remained top tog" I think you mean top dog there my friend. fijisiv are you sure he didn't mean "dop tog"? Mix Maybe he was asking us a question? "Apple remained, got pot?" illregal There have been no new tablet releases.. Cakefish No need to replace my iPad Air 2 yet, it's still a beast. And I'm sure it'll handle iOS 11 just fine. destinyhud i dont think my ipad air will handle ios 11. i might not update and later get a Chromebook detachable Taios I understand this. But I so so so want someone to release a replacement for my nexus 7 2013. destinyhud come on chromebook pixel c2 Dan The "problem" if you want to look at it as one, is that people that want one have one and don't need an upgrade. If it ain't broke why buy a new one? Same thing in the PC market, it's not a decline in number used or in the house, just in sold because there is nothing wrong with the current one. Leonardo Baez to be fair there is also less tablet offers to the market. me me I have Nexus 7 2013, Google Pixel C, and a Toshiba Chromebook 2. The Chromebook I have repaired it twice due the flexible plastic screen, the Pixel C has a tough outer shell construction and survives drops, the N7 2013 is still going strong but I use wireless charging to extend its socket life and custom kernel with 90% max charge to extend battery life. I'd happily buy newer if they were better. Innovation in mobiles is far greater, there's more of a reason to upgrade more often than with tablets. [A]dri[A]n I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2015) It's a pretty damn good tablet for $249 or whatever they're priced at now. The battery life is amazingly great and the performance is more than good enough. Lasts about 3 to 4 days with around 15 hours of SOT. Like someone stated before, I'm pretty sure sales are down because the need/want to buy a new tablet isn't as important or relevant as buying a new phone. Mix Snagged the 8" Tab A for $199 CAD and it's a wicked little tablet and you can get 4 of them for the price of a single Galaxy S3 tablet.....Like, why would someone even consider an $800 tablet? whispy_snippet And people wonder why Google won't take tablets seriously. AQ I bought my first tablet last month, isn't as fast or high resolution as my phone but it lasts long & keeps me from charging my phone as much. it was cheap, gsm unlocked, has 2GB ram & 16GB rom+microsd & still has stereo front facing speakers. I doubt I could find another tablet twice it's price having at least those things. ethd ZTE Trek 2 HD, by chance? I replaced my old Nexus 10 with one of those and I couldn't be happier. It's shocking how good cheap tablets have gotten. StopBeingOffendedDERP psshhh. Who needs a tablet when you have a Surface Book. Best of both worlds. Kamal Qara’in People are increasingly looking for lightwaight, portable devices that mirror the functionality of a traditional PC. And that's unfortunately where Android tablets fail; there's little to no 'Value add'; powerful, tablet-optimised apps are almost non-existent on the platform xyz Great. I never liked tablets. Only PCs and smartphones for me. I guess people who bought tablets are satisfied with 6-7" phablets. me me No. I own 10" and 7" tablets, and I like 10" tablets when I'm spending days moving, and like 7" tablet when flying. The issues is there's nothing new worthwhile in newer tablets to bother with the effort to upgrade. A mobile however is always having a compromise of features vs performance so mobiles are being refreshed. Tablets are not being refreshed. This is about technology innovation being slower in tablets than mobiles so tablets are being refreshed less often. Larger tablets are just expensive, and Chromebooks overlap. russjr08 I have a Nexus 7 2013 and an iPad Air 2 and I absolutely love my N7 but it's definitely starting to show it's age. And I'm just not that into iOS to really use my iPad a lot. I also have a Surface Pro 3, but it's waaaaaay too big to be the "tablet" that I casually use to read on. Great for doing something like Netflix or Hulu, but otherwise... I'm just kind of relying on my phone (currently N5X) for most of my stuff. Nathan J Remember the Apple Newton? Apple's failed tablet under CEO John Sculley before Steve Jobs' triumphant return? It utterly failed. And now the iPad is pretty much the only successful tablet. It's weird because the PADD on Star Trek: The Next Generation was so cool. It was basically a Nexus 7 or iPad Mini in size, but thinner, I believe. And let's face it, LCARS (the OS) is pretty, but it's also pretty lame. Too many buttons, it's not a real OS, it's just for show. Even forgiving that, the huge borders on the fixed content areas are ugly. What it could do, we can do with tablets now. Access any information — Google and Wikipedia. Access all art and media — streaming services, and Google. Control certain ship functions — Google/Apple Home. We have that tech now and it's just not as cool as they make it out to be. Also, does anyone remember where they kept PADDs? They don't have pockets. They don't have holsters for them. (They do have phaser and tricorder holsters, though.) I've never seen a stack of PADDs waiting to be picked up. I've seen people set them down and pick them back up, but I've never seen a bunch of them. They just kind of come and go. I think if you have an Android phone, there's no real need for a tablet. Either you have a large phone or a huge phone, and it's partway to tablet land anyway. I can see having a small or normal sized iPhone and an iPad or iPad Mini to go with it. But I have the normal sized iPhone, and I don't want an iPad. Here's where I want Android. On a larger device. That's where I want to spend time customizing. My wife has a 2013 Nexus 7, and it's a good device. I want one in 8" with modern specs and either a microSD card slot, or 64GB of storage. Or 128GB. Or let me hook my portable SSD up to it. But I'm really not a tablet guy. Just a gadget hound... Sootie I own a nexus 7 an ipad air 2 (or whatever the latest ones are called) an old ipad and some other big tablet plus laptops desktops but 90% of the time everything but my phone (pixel xl) is flat plus my phone works perfectly fine for everything I do with it (which admittedly is basically just reddit and youtube) and is always charged Peter Silie And I can tell you why it's like this: because there are so few tablets you can actually buy unless you want to spend a premium amount of money. There used to be way more choices, especially in the Android tablet market. Funem Android tablet specs have dropped while phone specs have increased. If I go online or to the shops its difficult to find a branded Android device that even has 32gb of memory, sometimes its even hard to find one with 16gb whilst phones have more and more crammed into them tablets just seem to have stagnated. The last tablet I purchased was the Tab Pro 12" which was a great tablet, but them Samsung didn't even upgrade the OS much and kind of just left it and this wasn't a cheap device. I'm still looking for a decent replacement with a 10" plus screen, 32gb of ram, SD card support and a decent screen resolution as I want to read my magazines on it and watch films and play some of the games that require a bigger screen real estate to work properly. The only one that came close recently was the Shield K1 Tablet, but the screen is to small.

And he’s right. According to Deutsche Bank’s annual “Mapping the World’s Prices”, iPhone prices can vary wildly from one country to another but one thing has remained true: the United States is still the cheapest place to buy an iPhone. Here’s what an iPhone 7 costs in Apple Stores in the following 33 countries: Turkey—$1,200 Brazil—$1,115 Russia—$1,086 Greece—$1,028 Poland—$1,005 Italy—$995 Czech Republic—$994 Norway—$993 Denmark—$986 Sweden—$982 Portugal—$973 Finland—$973 Ireland—$973 New Zealand—$972 France—$962 Spain—$962 Netherlands—$962 Belgium—$962 Austria—$951 Germany—$951 Mexico—$941 Australia—$926 India—$902 China—$899 United Kingdom—$898 Switzerland—$886 The Philippines—$885 Singapore—$874 Canada—$855 Malaysia—$846 Hong Kong—$821 Japan—$815 United States—$815 To be sure, the aforementioned prices are for the 128-gigabyte 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model. Deutsche Bank has obtained the prices from official Apple websites and online retailers. “In the absence of official prices via the websites, we have used prices from online retailers and news websites,” cautions Deutsche Bank. It’s important to note that US prices exclude the sales tax because it differs from one state to another. Online prices in the United Kingdom and other countries include the sales tax so that’s something to keep in mind when comparing local iPhone prices to those in the US. I’m based in Europe, one of the worst places to buy an iPhone. Apple likes to say that the cost of doing business in Europe is higher than in the US, which is true, but that doesn’t fully explain why people in Turkey are paying nearly one and a half times as much as users in the United States. Other factors are clearly at play here, including import taxes and other regulations specific to every country. It’s interesting that Turkey has now replaced Brazil as the most expensive expensive place in the countries surveyed to buy an iPhone 7. As Business Insider explains, that’s due to the combination of political instability in the country and the big ramp in US dollar appreciation against global currencies after Donald Trump’s win smashed Turkey’s Lira currency  late last year. As a result, Turkey has replaced Brazil as the most expensive place in the countries surveyed to buy an iPhone. By the way, Brazil now ranks second on the list with a 37 percent higher iPhone 7 price vs US. With iPhone 7 said to cost north of $1,000, I’m afraid to think what Tagged: Apple iPhone News MORE FROM iDB 32GB iPhone 6 now available in Spain, Italy, Turkey, Germany, Austria, Denmark & elsewhere Another claimed iPhone 8 drawing shows vertically stacked cameras and nearly full-screen face iPhone 8 concept roundup: Part I Joshua The-Legend Wiebe …or in most cases, eBay Luka Petranović You say it is for 128GB model of regular 7?

If that were to come true, Apple wouldn't buy chips from Imagination after that time, and this perspective has tanked that company's shares recently. Its stock price went down by more than half within a single day of Apple's revelation, and has only lowered since. To be able to fight back, Imagination is selling off two businesses, one which is focused on embedded processors, and another having to do with licensing patents related to mobile and the Internet of Things. At the same time, the company is starting a formal dispute resolution procedure with Apple, hoping that the Tim Cook-led corporation will agree to license some of its graphics patents. Imagination says Apple can not develop its own mobile graphics chips without infringing on at least some of its patents, but Apple thinks otherwise - hence the dispute resolution procedure, which should hopefully clear things out. This process is set up under the two companies' existing licensing agreement. According to Imagination, it's been unable to make "satisfactory progress" on a new licensing agreement with Apple. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imaginations technology, without violating Imaginations patents, intellectual property, and confidential information", it claims. This is a very important matter for Imagination Technologies, because iPhones currently bring it huge royalty payments - 60% of its revenue originates at the PowerVR division that Apple licensed GPU technology from. Were those payments to stop, its very existence will be threatened.

The company says it will invest $1 billion to help create more U.S. manufacturing jobs. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Michael Liedtke and Christopher S. Rugaber SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the United States economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1-billion (all figures US) fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund in an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." The Wednesday report on jobs is its fourth update on its U.S. employment, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment centre is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven).

Eoin Giles (21) of Thornville Ave, Kilbarrack, Dublin pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to one count of stealing a quantity of Apple macbook laptops, Apple watches and iPads from the Blanchardstown shopping centre store on April 15, 2016. Judge Karen O'Connor noted the offence represented a great breach of trust, given that Giles was a trusted employee of PC World. She adjourned sentencing until next month to allow Giles gather €2,000 to offer as redress and engage with The Probation Service. Garda Niamh Dunphy told Dean Kelly BL, prosecuting, that gardaí were called to the store in April 2016 after a stock-take showed that a large quantity of stock was missing. Staff reviewed CCTV footage which showed Giles, who had worked at the store for nearly three years, moving the stock out of the stockroom in a suspicious manner. PC World management staff told gardaí that Giles stole 21 laptops, six Apple watches and seven iPad pros from the shop. When arrested, Giles made some immediate admissions, but maintained he stole 13 laptops, three watches and seven iPads. Ultimately, the exact quantity of stolen goods could not be determined, Mr Kelly said. However, the value of the goods Giles said he stole came to €27,000. The court heard Giles sold all of the products, bar one Macbook, to a man who worked in an electronic store in the city. Giles was given €2000 for the initial handover and was promised a further €10,000 once the stolen goods were sold. He kept one of the Macbooks for himself. Giles was unable to name the man he sold the items to, but from information he gave gardaí, that man was later identified as Muhammed Amjad (31) of Merchants Square, East Wall, Dublin. Amjad was given a suspended 18 month sentence for his role in handling stolen goods last February. When asked why he stole the goods, Giles said he was “stupidly trying to make money”. He said he did not have a gambling or drug problem. He has no previous convictions. Defence barrister, Karl Monahan BL, said Giles previously worked for two charity organisations. He was sacked from PC World in the wake of the offence and now works in car sales. He said Giles, who is in a long term relationship, deeply regretted his actions.   Return to top sports desk Mourinho offers injury update on Rashford and issues rallying cry Mourinho wanted more after his side won their Europa League semi-final first leg tie in Spain We've got the top sports stories from the best team in the world Courts ● Courts Killer teens jailed for murdering mum and daughter challenge terms ● Courts 11-year-old sues ice-skating company after “skater ran over her hand” ● Courts Man who stole almost €8k from his own bank account avoids jail ● Courts Addict threatened to set credit union staff on fire during raid ● Courts PC World employee robbed €27K-worth of Apple products from store ● Courts Murder trial jury fails to reach verdict ● Courts Teen used to transport loot gets chance to avoid criminal record ● Courts Lawyers for murderer claim “fair trial rights were breached” ● Courts No sentence for young thugs who attacked garda ● Courts Youth accused of crime spree in Oberstown Top Content Showbiz World Woman ● Showbiz George RR Martin working on Game of Thrones spin-off ● Showbiz Nikki Reed announces she's pregnant ● Showbiz Dwayne Johnson gets two bottles of tequila for his birthday ● Showbiz Kim Kardashian West's marriage was 'really touch and go' after Paris robbery ● Showbiz Dolly Parton almost took her own life after cheating scandal - report ● Showbiz Mary J.

Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 04 May, 2017 21:35 - - - - print email Comments The Samsung Galaxy S8 has taken the tech industry by storm as the best Android smartphone you can buy. The display is gorgeous, the design is unmatched and the performance is top notch. The Galaxy S8 finally delivered everything I needed to cut the Apple cord and jump ship to an Android smartphone. I do miss iMessage, but there's enough about the Galaxy S8 to soothe the loss of Apple's simple and seamless messaging app. Here are five reasons why I made the switch from iOS to Android and I'm not looking back. Subtle notifications Coming from iOS, notifications included floating pop-ups and angry red badges that judgmentally showcased my growing pile of unread emails. These notifications overwhelmed and annoyed. I'd turn the badges off, or shuffle the app to another page so I wouldn't have to stare at it anymore. My lock screen became a jumbled mix of stacked notifications -- something to ignore as I unlocked the display. It's safe to say my iPhone never became a cornerstone of productivity. But the Galaxy S8 finally makes my smartphone a productive device -- one that I can customize to my preference. And I've finally stopped ignoring notifications. The traditional notifications are clean and minimal, but the Edge notifications are the real treat. With Edge notifications, you'll see a thin, unobtrusive bubble at the top of the display while a blue light that gracefully dances around the edges of the display. It's enough to notice you have a new alert, but not so much that I'm forced to turn on "Do Not Disturb" just to get through a YouTube video. Meanwhile, I can avoid clutter on my lock screen and "always on display" by relying on simple icons that expand with a tap to show all notifications for that one app. On the home screen, I can include widgets and sticky notes that make it impossible for me to avoid my to-do list or reminders. I spent years carrying around two-inch Sticky Notes that I'd tack on to my iPhone display if I needed to remember something important. At least on my S8, the sticky notes won't fall off. In the past, Apple offered enough in hardware and software to let me overlook the absurdity of applying physical sticky notes to a digital device, but not anymore. [ Related story: How to switch from an iPhone to a Samsung Galaxy S8 ] Touchwiz TouchWiz, the notorious Samsung Android skin, died in late 2016, and emerged from the ashes as Samsung Experience. That might sound dramatic, but it's fitting for the dramatic change to Samsung's UI. In the past, TouchWiz was consistently one of the worst features on any Samsung Galaxy device -- each passing year saw incremental gains to the UI, but most users turned to launchers. The Galaxy S8 is the first Samsung device that won't have you running to the Google Play store to download Nova Launcher right out of the box. Gone are the complex menus, cartoon-like app icons, obnoxious notifications and a confusing mess of duplicate Samsung apps you couldn't delete. You can uninstall most of Samsung's apps, and for certain apps -- like reminders and weather -- you won't even find an icon in your app drawer unless you enable it within the app. And don't be surprised if you find yourself turning to Samsung's native apps, which now have simple, minimalist designs. They're all aesthetically pleasing and I prefer the Samsung email and calendar apps over the Google counterparts. In fact, I like a lot about Samsung Experience over stock Android -- something I never thought I'd say. [ Related story: Enterprise showdown: 5 ways the iPhone beats the Galaxy S8 ] Wireless and fast charging The battery on the S8 isn't anything spectacular. It's about the same as the Galaxy S7, but software improvements and a more efficient processor make it slightly more resilient. I've used the S8 as my main device for a few weeks and I've made peace with the battery. I can get through most of the day on a full charge, but need to top it off if I plan to go out at night. I use typical battery draining apps like Facebook Messenger and Snapchat and I keep my Bluetooth on for most of the day so I can easily connect to a Bluetooth speaker to stream Spotify. The battery manager on my device averages about 10 hours of use every day, and that feels about right. What's most surprising about the battery is how fast it charges. You can get a full charge on a nearly drained battery in under two hours. I try to remember to always charge my phone about 30 minutes before I need to leave the house. With the Galaxy S8, that's more than enough to get a solid charge. Not only is the fast charge incredibly convenient, but with wireless charging, it's easier than ever to find a spot to juice up out in the wild -- whether at a Starbucks or an Airport. The battery doesn't need to do more than it does, because it's easier to gas up on the go. The iPhone still doesn't have either of these features, which made my decision to switch even easier. [ Related story: A deeper look at Samsung's Galaxy S8 ] Headphone jack Jason Cross/IDG I'll never understand how Apple got away with removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, but it was the final nail in the coffin for me. I use headphones when I travel and I like to keep my phone charged while I kill time in airports, train stations and bus stops. Bluetooth and audio streaming are notorious battery drainers, and when you're on the road, every percent counts when you're not sure when you'll get your next charge. I'm not a fan of adapters because I always forget them, which is probably easy to imagine for someone who needs physical sticky notes on a mobile device. Also, quality Bluetooth headphones are expensive, and Apple's Air Pods are comically easy to lose -- they look like a case of dental floss. I'd give myself two weeks before accidentally tossing them into the trash. Even in a world where I am organized enough to hang on to $150 ear buds, I'd still be faced with Bluetooth. I don't think Bluetooth is where it needs to be to completely replace wired headphones. I'm sure as Bluetooth 5.0 becomes the standard it will become a non-issue and compatible ear buds will be more affordable and replaceable. But for now, I prefer to plug in via the 3.5mm stereo jack. Refreshing design I like iOS, but it's getting boring, Every year it's the same icons, layout and general functionality. Add that to tired, repetitive designs and Android looks better and better. I looked at the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S8 side by side, and knew I wouldn't be able to stand not having something close to the S8's OLED Infinity Display for two years. Some people might not care about this, which I understand. Not everyone cares about technology the same way not everyone cares about sports or fashion. You might watch the playoffs or buy a few trendy pieces for your closet, but that's where the fascination ends. There's nothing wrong with buying a reliable, well-known and highly regarded device like the iPhone, especially if you want to turn it on and never worry about it again. But that's not me. I remember every cellphone I've had since my first Nokia in 2003. I've always been fascinated by cellphone and smartphone design. Every new release brought improvements in hardware, software and new features like color displays and physical keyboards. And then I got my iPhone 4. Since then, each year has brought incremental changes in hardware and software, always dependable and reliable updates, but never anything as exciting as the Galaxy S8. My smartphone feels fun again. Samsung set a new standard and I'm excited to see how other manufacturers -- especially Apple -- respond. Technology is always at its best when there's healthy competition pushing both sides, and Samsung has finally upped the ante.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Hot New iPhone 8 Concept Focuses on the Function Area By Uzair Ghani 14 hours ago 9Shares Share Tweet Submit It’s rumored that the iPhone 8 will come with a Function Area, and it would work much like how the Touch Bar does on the new MacBook Pro. A new iPhone 8 concept focuses on this, and gives us a glimpse of how Apple might be able to take things forward. Accept Calls, Access Quick Actions & More Using Function Area – New iPhone 8 Concept Has it All Different reports suggest that the iPhone 8 will feature an edge to edge display while giving up the Home button at the same time. Some reports all suggest that the Touch ID fingerprint sensor will be moved to the back of the device for authentication. While that does make sense given the front of the device will be all-screen, but, there’s a possibility that Apple might actually embed the fingerprint sensor inside the display itself. That’s not all though – it’s also believed that there will be a portion of the phone’s display dedicated to certain functions. Different reports are calling this dedicated portion the ‘Function Area.’ If the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro is anything to go by, then we can take hints into what the Function Area will do on a smartphone level. This includes accepting or rejecting calls, skipping through music, have quick toggles right at your fingertips and more. Related Imagination Technologies Will Sell Two High Growth Business Units After Apple Hangs It Out To Dry Following Custom GPU Plans A new iPhone 8 concept on the other hand, imagines quite a bit of possibilities what Apple might be able to achieve with its upcoming smartphone. So without further ado, let’s jump right into the concept itself, and see what the future might hold for Apple fans. Advertisement The concept is, without a doubt, really nicely done in a lot of ways. Though we don’t get a glimpse of the smartphone from the back properly, except for the vertical camera arrangement, it’s obvious what Apple might be able to achieve with such a large display on a smartphone. Just imagine having your favorite or crucial toggles front and center whenever you need them, without ever having to take up space on the center. Or, you can set iOS to display a certain bit of information every time in that space. Related Analyst Makes Bold Claim of Apple Previewing iPhone 8 During WWDC The possibilities really are endless.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Mobile Imagination Technologies Will Sell Two High Growth Business Units After Apple Hangs It Out To Dry Following Custom GPU Plans By Ramish Zafar 13 hours ago 16Shares Share Tweet Submit Even though your iPhone might be all fancy, Apple’s a hard player in the corporate world. Cupertino’s known to drive a tough bargain and not care about other companies in the process. Tim Cook’s intricate supply chain in the East will bear testament to this. Apple’s known to strong-arm small suppliers to provide components at a bargain and within strict schedules. These companies, who depend on Apple for survival, often find themselves in a no-win situation. Now, UK-based Imagination Technologies is one of the new additions to this list. Take a look below to find out more. Apple’s Dispute With Imagination Technologies Forces UK Corporation To Sell Two Out Of Three Business Units Apple and Imagination technologies have been partners since 2008. The latter’s PowerVR GPU lineup has been a part of Cupertino’s A series processors since the A4, which powered the iPhone 4 and the 4th gen iPod Touch. Now, in lieu of a long time company tradition, Apple will launch its own GPUs by 2019, to take more control of its products. The company already uses custom variants of Imgtec’s PowerVR lineup in the iPhone and iPad. Related Hot New iPhone 8 Concept Focuses on the Function Area Just as Apple announced its decision, Imagination’s market capitalization fell by a massive 60%. The group will now sell off its business divisions to ensure that it can survive after its breakup with the Silicon Valley tech giant. Imgtec is already bearing the brunt of Apple’s failure to keep up to market trends with the iPhone. The company cut down 350 jobs last years after its revenues, half of which are based on royalties from Apple declined in lieu with disappointing iPhone sales. And TIm Cook can blame the rumor mill all he wants for the smartphone’s current, less than stellar run. It won’t change the fact that the lineup isn’t what it was a couple of years back. Advertisement Related Analyst Makes Bold Claim of Apple Previewing iPhone 8 During WWDC The Hertfordshire company will dispose off of its Enigma and MIPS business units. The pair accounted for £21m or 29% of its total revenues in October last year. Both of them represent growth areas for the company, with MIPS involved in manufacturing solutions around autonomous vehicles. Enigma on the other hand deals with intellectual property licensing related to the Internet of Things. The business has doubled its revenues in the six months leading to Imgtec’s latest financial statements. Speaking of intellectual property, Apple’s also headed for a good patent war if it does develop custom GPU designs. The space is already saturated with huge players which include the likes of Nvidia, AMD, ARM and Qualcomm. There’s very little chance for Apple to avoid stepping on any toes on the path to a fully custom, in-house GPU. As far as Imgtec goes, dark times lie ahead for the company. Wouldn’t it be better if Apple simply buys it? After all, Cupertino was in advanced rounds for a buyout last year. It’s prime meat especially after a huge chuck off of its market capitalization.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechCompanies Apple's dilemma: what to do with $256bn cash pile 2017-05-04 21:57 - Rob Lever, AFP Post a comment 0 share: RELATED ARTICLES Apple delivers higher profits, but iPhone sales slip Huawei closing gap on Samsung, Apple in smartphone market Apple touts greater use of recycled metal in gadgets Washington - It is a sign of Apple's success but also a thorny problem: its cash stockpile has hit a staggering $256.8bn, sparking debate on what do with such massive reserves. Apple's quarterly report this week showed its cash holdings - the vast majority held overseas - jumped to a sum that tops the entire economic output of Chile. The tech giant has resisted the idea of bringing the cash home, because of disincentives in the US tax code - it allows multinational firms to defer profits while they are held overseas but taxes income at up to 35% when repatriated. Proposals by President Donald Trump and lawmakers could lower the tax rate for repatriated earnings, an incentive for Apple and others to put the money to work in the United States. While any company would gladly be in Apple's shoes with its cash hoard, "there's something not quite healthy about it", said Roger Kay, analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates. "Normally, you would expect cash to fund investment opportunities, but obviously Apple doesn't have any use for that much cash." Apple has become the most valuable and profitable company of the current era. But the unique challenges it faces because its earnings come mostly from the iPhone, which faces increasingly tough competition in a saturated smartphone market. Long-term strategy Apple faces periodic pressure to return more cash to shareholders with higher dividends and more share buybacks, and has already spent some $200bn doing this. Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy argued that returning all the cash to shareholders "doesn't help further anyone's strategic interests" and that Apple needs to find ways to diversify its business. One way to do this would be "going vertical", or acquiring a chipmaker such as AMD to supply all Apple devices, Moorhead said. Netflix, he said, could complement Apple's business by offering content for Apple's ecosystem of devices. Moorhead said that if Apple - which has a permit to test its self-driving car system - is serious about autonomous vehicles "it would need to buy a car company" such as Tesla to ensure "the Apple experience". Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research said Apple has a staggering amount of cash and "could make enormous entries and completely rewrite industries" with it. "The challenge is culturally and organisationally, how do you integrate something that big," O'Donnell said. He said Apple has always sought to minutely manage details of its operations, "so making an enormous purchase goes against their culture." The tax conundrum Apple's situation has highlighted the growing stockpiles of cash held overseas by US multinationals, now estimated to be between $2.5trn and $3trn. Lisa De Simone, a Stanford University professor who specialises in international taxation, said the current code creates "incentives for companies to shift as much of their profits as they can offshore". But De Simone said a temporary tax "holiday" as Washington tried in 2004 would only increase the incentives. "Companies like Apple have only increased their income shifting in expectation they could get another holiday later on," she said, arguing for a permanent tax change. Georgetown University finance professor Lee Pinkowitz said companies with cash overseas are essentially holding the funds hostage to US policymakers. "The government already revealed in 2004 they were willing to negotiate with the hostage takers," he said. "What you would expect is that more hostages will be taken." The Trump administration is seeking to encourage firms to bring those earnings home for investment and job creation in the United States. But Pinkowitz said a major stimulus from repatriated assets is unlikely. With Apple, much of the funds are held nominally by its Irish subsidiary but are invested in US assets. "Apple has almost $50bn in US Treasury and agency securities, so technically that $50bn is already here. It just hasn't been taxed." Made in USA? Could Apple use some of the cash to bring large-scale manufacturing back to the United States? Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research said this is unlikely because of Apple's manufacturing and supply process. "We simply don't have the work force to support this scale of manufacturing," he said. "No tax break is going to offset that entirely." But Kay said he sees potential for Apple to bring factories home if the conditions are right. "I could see a happy solution where contract manufacturers and Apple partner and train American workers to be as efficient as the Chinese," he said. "It would take quite a bit to make it come true but it could bring down the myth that Chinese workers are more efficient."Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: apple  |  technology  |  smartphones share: More In This Category Facebook profits surge as user base nears 2 billion New smartphone player quietly enters SA with cheap devices MTN revenue rises despite subscriber drop Apple delivers higher profits, but iPhone sales slip Most Popular Read New smartphone player quietly enters SA with cheap devices WhatsApp restored after two-hour blackout New TV service launched to rival Netflix, Showmax Apple's dilemma: what to do with $256bn cash pile Tracking innovation helps community combat crime Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

Features ● Verbal commands for Siri ● AirPlay ● Seven tweeters, one woofer ● Custom ARM processor ● Probably     ● Maybe     ● Probably not Apple is working on its own competitor to the Amazon Echo, according to a number of rumors, with the creation of an audio device that will allow users to make Siri queries without directly interacting with any other Apple devices.  The proposed device would in theory compete directly against the aforementioned Echo, as well as Google Home, hardware Apple is likely to emulate with its own offering. In theory, this would provide more opportunities for Apple customers to interact with the assistant, rather than use competing systems, keeping users within the Apple ecosystem.  Some reports have gone against the rumors, suggesting Apple won't produce an Echo-like speaker, with Apple supposedly looking to make Siri an "omnipresent AI assistant across devices" instead of a central hub.  Current speculation has Apple introducing the device at WWDC on June 5, alongside potential updates to Siri that will arrive on iPhones and other hardware in the future. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes there to be a more than 50 percent chance of a WWDC announcement for the device.  Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker Physical Design Based on the Google and Amazon competition, it is likely the proposed device would take the form of a network-connected speaker with a microphone array. The nearest product to the proposed device currently offered by Apple is the Beats Pill range of speakers. While not an Apple-branded product, it is plausible for Apple to borrow aspects of Beats' designs for its own intelligent speaker.  While it is unclear if it will be a portable device, like some items from Beats' speaker range, it is likely to be built as a staticly-located speaker. Due to its presumably audio-heavy interface, managing network connectivity while on the move could be considered a challenge for a portable version.  A leak from Sonny Dickson in late April claims Apple is "currently finalizing" designs for the speaker, which is "expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device." The hardware could use some form of Beats technology, Dickson claims, and will run a variant of iOS.  As for the appearance, Dickson suggests it will have a concave top that will house physical controls, a similar button positioning to the Echo range.Boasting "Mac Pro style," it is claimed it will also have a speaker mesh portion covering the body of the device, similar to the UE Boom Bluetooth speaker sold in Apple retail stores.  Dickson has been accurate in the past for some predictions such as the revamped lockscreen interface in iOS 10.  On May 1, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo issued a note to investors speculating that the device will use one woofer and seven tweeters for a rich sound. Inside will be a custom ARM processor similar in power to the A8 CPU, used in the iPhone 6.  Apple's custom W1 chip, which handles the Bluetooth connectivity in the company's AirPods, will allow other wireless accessories to connect to the Siri device automatically, so long as they are logged into the same iCloud account. Continuing on media playback, Kuo also believes that support for AirPlay in the device for music streaming will help Apple quickly gain a footing in the market, capitalizing on the extensive music services available to its users.  Siri A core component to the device will be Siri. Much like Alexa on Amazon's Echo device range, the device should allow for users to invoke Siri by verbal commands alone, and to receive a spoken response.  It is believed that Apple will be introducing a number of new features to Siri at WWDC, claimed DigiTimes in January, though the report stopped short of stating what features to expect.  Due to the high reliance on verbal communication, any changes to Siri will make a major impact on the device's chances of being a success at launch.  Siri has been criticised in the past for providing relatively limited functionality compared to its main competition, especially when considering contextual queries. For example, Google Assistant, the latest iteration of Google's own tool, is capable of understanding follow-up questions, like "Who is the U.S. President?" followed by "How old is he?" Samsung has also made an effort to join the digital assistant market, with its own Bixby assistant included in the Galaxy S8. Bixby is thought to be based on technology by Viv Labs, a firm created by former Apple employees and Siri co-founders Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Chris Bringham, and acquired by Samsung in October 2016.  Viv's biggest technological advantage over Siri was its third-party integration, which effectively allowed the user to easily perform transactions or use third-party services with verbal commands.  Apple has not rested on its laurels with Siri, investing in its own machine learning work as well as acquiring firms in the AI and language processing fields, such as Perceptio, VocalIQ, and Turi. Any work from these investments are likely to make a big impact to the way Siri operates, improving the assistant across the Apple ecosystem of hardware.  The higher level of competition in the digital assistant field is likely to drive Apple to make Siri the best assistant the company can. While this will generally focus on improving the experience for iOS users, especially for the "iPhone 8" this fall, it is highly likely any progress made there will also benefit Siri on the speaker.    Name So far, none of the rumors or leaks have suggested a name for the supposed device, though it is apparently known internally by the codename "B238." Despite being the main way of interacting with the speaker, it is unlikely that Apple will employ "Siri" in the name. Since Siri is its own multi-platform service, Apple will probably try to keep the branding of the new hardware different, if only to separate the two brands.    Amazon's lineup of Alexa-enabled devices Pricing and Availability KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in April the specifications of the proposed device will push the price higher than the Amazon equivalent. It will apparently be positioned for the high-end market, with a better entertainment experience and superior sound quality qualifying the potentially increased cost compared to its rivals.  For reference, Amazon sells the Echo for $180 and the Echo Dot for $50. The Google Home costs $129.  Kuo also believes Apple could ship as many as 12 million units of the device over the first year of availability. If it proves to be popular, Kuo suggests Apple could sell extended models of the device, echoing the Echo lineup from Amazon.    Production by Inventec A report from the Economic Daily News on May 3 claims Inventec has been selected by Apple to produce the rumored speaker. Supply chain reports from the Chinese publication claim Inventec is involved, but it is unclear if the Taiwanese firm is being used for component production or device assembly.  Inventec has a history with Apple, working for the Cupertino iPhone producer since the iPod. The firm is also currently producing another Apple audio product, with its facilities used to manufacture AirPods.  If the report is true, this means that Apple's primary assembler, Foxconn, hasn't been selected to build the device. Foxconn is already the producer of one of the supposed device's competitors, the Amazon Echo.    Essential Reading Inventec allegedly tapped for Apple's rumored standalone Siri speaker product Apple's Siri-based Echo competitor to carry premium price, feature high-end audio with 1 woofer & 7 tweeters Apple's Siri-based Echo competitor rumored to borrow design cues from Mac Pro, could arrive at WWDC Apple 'finalizing' design of Amazon Echo rival based on Siri Better incarnation of Siri may appear alongside Apple's 2017 iPhones - report Apple unlikely to develop an Echo-like standalone Siri speaker - report     Siri Home Speaker Stories (276) Inventec allegedly tapped for Apple's rumored standalone Siri speaker product ~2 days ago Apple's Siri-based Echo competitor to carry premium price, feature hig... ~4 days ago Apple's Siri-based Echo competitor rumored to borrow design cues from ... ~7 days ago Apple 'finalizing' design of Amazon Echo rival based on Siri ~8 days ago Amazon Echo Look and iOS app judges your wardrobe choices with machine learning ~9 days ago Apple AI guru Tom Gruber speaks of artificial intelligence's 'inevitab... ~9 days ago Actress says credit for Siri's personality belongs to Apple programmer... ~21 days ago Amazon allowing Alexa software, far-field microphone technology use by... ~21 days ago Koogeek Smart Plug converts regular light socket into Apple HomeKit light ~30 days ago Rumor: Siri to get iMessage integration, adapt to user habits in 'iOS 11' ~1 month ago 4-year-old saves mother's life by asking Apple's Siri to call emergenc... ~1 month ago Marriott likely to decide on Apple Siri or Amazon Alexa for hotels lat... ~1 month ago Siri competitor Alexa comes to iPhone via Amazon's official app ~2 months ago Apple exposes how it teaches new languages to Siri, staying ahead of c... ~2 months ago RBC iOS app update adds pay-by-voice commands to Apple's Siri ~2 months ago Server firmware security incident in 2016 forced Apple to sever ties w... ~2 months ago Apple confirms existence of Cambridge Siri R&D lab with new office sign ~2 months ago Apple unlikely to develop an Echo-like standalone Siri speaker - report ~2 months ago Apple's Siri gets 'LEGO Batman Movie' tie-in with custom Bat-phrases ~3 months ago Quickly adjust AirPods volume by percentage and check listening levels... ~3 months ago Must-know Siri commands for Apple's wireless AirPods ~3 months ago Apple updates Siri on iOS, Mac & Apple TV with Super Bowl-related commands ~3 months ago Apple's 'differential privacy' policy invoked for opt-in iCloud data a... ~3 months ago Apple officially named as founding member of Partnership for AI, Siri ... ~3 months ago Apple reportedly close to joining Partnership on AI industry group to ... ~3 months ago Better incarnation of Siri may appear alongside Apple's 2017 iPhones - report ~3 months ago The best third-party apps for iOS 10 that support Apple's Siri ~4 months ago How to turn on Siri for third-party apps in iOS 10 ~4 months ago Adobe concept demonstrates editing images on iPad using just your voice ~4 months ago Is Apple getting Siri-ous in the face of Amazon's Alexa Echo? ~4 months ago Test link Top of page Copyright © 2017, Quiller Media, Inc., Contact Us Privacy Policy Advertise on AppleInsider Design: gesamtbild

Most recently, and in an exclusive interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer of "Mad Money," Cook discusses his new focus as CEO: to have Apple create jobs for U.S. workers. Here are two main takeaways for leaders from Cook's interview: 1. Use your position to benefit others in need Cook makes it clear in his recent interview that he's using his position to help American workers. "You know, a lot of people ask me, 'Do you think it's a company's job to create jobs?' and my response is a company should have values because a company is a collection of people," he says. "And people should have values, so by extension, a company should." Cook continues to discuss his philanthropic bent as a leader. "One of the things you do is give back. So how do you give back?" he asks, rhetorically. "We give back through our work in the environment, in running the company on renewable energy. We give back in job creation." "People should have values, so by extension, a company should." -Tim Cook, CEO, Apple "And so if you look at job creation in particular, we've now created two million jobs in America," he adds. "Two million." But for Cook, that's not enough. In fact, he wants to use his post as CEO to make even more jobs available to U.S. workers. "We ask ourselves, 'How can we increase it further? How can we create even more?'" he says. "We're not satisfied with just two million. And so you can bet we're going to be hiring thousands of employees in the future." Overall, Apple says it's using $1 billion for a fund to create more advanced manufacturing jobs in the U.S. 2. Be humble During his conversation with Cramer, Cook also talked about how lucky he feels to be in the top spot at Apple, a post he took in 2011 from Steve Jobs. "I love it," he says. "You know, there's no bigger privilege in the world than to work at this company at this moment in time. And to be able to work with all the great people I get to work with every day." Being humble is a key trait for successful leaders, according to Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky. "Take a step back and have some humility," he tells CNBC. "It was beyond my wildest imagination," says Cook about being named CEO, "and there's not a day that goes by that I don't thank God for it." show chapters Jim Cramer talks with Tim Cook: The full interview    Wednesday, 3 May 2017 | 7:36 PM ET | 24:04 Benjamin SnyderLeadership Editor, CNBC Make It Primetime Shows Watch full episodes | TV schedule To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

By Luke Johnson / Published 4th May 2017 The iPhone 8 release date is edging closer, and now Apple CEO Tim Cook has teased tantalising details on the next-generation smartphone. Despite the device not being set to hit retailers’ shelves until September, Cook has hinted that the phone will offer enough new feature to get existing iPhone owners clamouring for a upgrade. While it’s unsurprising that the company’s CEO would big-up the firm’s next phone, according to Cook, the iPhone 8’s key feature will be a big surprise to most. Speaking during the company’s quarterly product call, Cook teased that the upcoming phone will bring “something that you didn’t expect”. GETTY IPHONE UPDATE: Apple CEO Tim Cook has teased Apple's next-generation smartphone Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photographs, concept images and renders Friday, 6th January 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button 1 / 10 VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button Questioned on whether it has made its existing devices too good for people to upgrade, Cook stated: “No, because it’s always something that you didn’t expect.” Referencing the improvements made by last year’s iPhone 7 Plus, he added: “You know, who though you could take a photo like a portrait?” Despite teasing big changes for its future phone, the Cupertino company has yet to explain exactly what new feature we can expect. Cook, however, did again take the opportunity to big up his belief that AI and AR is the future, suggesting major Siri improvements could be in line for an iPhone-based appearance. “I think AI is huge,” he said. “We use AI in so much of what we do today, but we’re going to be able to use it even more in the future. “The processing and GPUs are getting so incredible - their capabilities so incredible we’re going to be able to do a lot more.” He added: “I don’t want to get into detail, but there’s a lot more there. “AR, you know, I’ve said in the past, this is something we’re really excited about.” The iPhone 8 is one of the most eagerly awaited devices of the year and will bring the fight to the recently released Samsung Galaxy S8. A phone expected to pack a mass of new features, the phone has been tipped to run the upcoming iOS 11 software direct from the box. Elsewhere, Apple’s next-gen device has been mooted to pack a more powerful A11 processor and 3GB of RAM. This will reportedly be paired with a new, vertically aligned dual lens camera and a higher resolution, edge-to-edge display that will see the phone’s physical home button given the boot.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 2 Top Dividend Stocks in Smartphones When it comes to investing in dividend stocks in the smartphone market, it’s Apple and Samsung and then everybody else. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) May 4, 2017 at 2:24PM In terms of great dividend stocks in the smartphone market, investors need look no further than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). As the perennial leaders in terms of devices shipped, these two fierce competitors stand head-and-shoulders above the competition -- so much so that Apple and Samsung typically capture more than 90% of all smartphone market profits in any given quarter. So let's dive into the income-investing thesis for each of these two smartphone giants. Apple At first glance, the Mac maker might seem like an underwhelming income investment. After all, its 1.5% dividend yield sits a cool 40 basis points lower than the S&P 500's 1.9% yield. However, this perspective dramatically understates Apple's potency as a long-term dividend growth stock. The main source of the company's strength as an income investment comes from Apple's massive balance sheet. The company sported an otherworldly $158 billion in net cash -- cash and investments minus debt -- as of its January earnings release. And given the company's cash-generation capabilities, it only seems that Apple will have added to that figure during its most recent quarter, for which it will report earnings on May 2. The company is also widely expected to increase its dividend and further expand its capital-return program beyond its current $250 billion allocation as part of the report; be sure to check back at the Fool for analysis of Apple's report. The source of Apple's capital return war chest is, of course, its various high-end consumer-electronics franchises, led by the iPhone. Here's a quick overview of how the iPhone has grown in prominence within Apple's financial empire in recent years.   2016 2015 2014 iPhone Revenue   $136.7 billion  $155.0 billion  $101.9 billion Apple Total Revenue   $215.6 billion $233.7 billion $182.7 billion iPhone Revenue as % of Total Revenue   63.4% 66.3% 55.8% Data source: Apple Form 10-K annual report.  If anything, this trend appears likely to continue during Apple's 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, as the effect of its highly anticipated iPhone 8 should draw more consumers into Apple's device ecosystem. According to Bank of Montreal research, 31% of the iPhone's installed base will be two years or older by the time Apple releases the iPhone 8 this fall, suggesting consumers should be primed to purchase Apple's newly redesigned handset en masse. For this reason and many more, the iPhone appears poised to become even more important to Apple's financial performance and dividend payments in the years to come. Image source: Apple. Samsung The only dividend-paying company positioned to challenge Apple in the smartphone arena, South Korean smartphone power Samsung also enjoys an interesting dividend growth story today. After weathering a difficult past year -- largely because of its Galaxy Note 7 recall and its place in South Korea's ongoing political scandals -- Samsung has demonstrated that the worst is behind it in a number of ways. Its chip business, mobile unit, and television units all contributed strong performance during the company's most recent quarterly report, which saw the company remain on track to report record earnings for its entire fiscal 2017. Samsung also made progress in placating longtime activist shareholder Elliott Management, which originally advanced a plan calling to split Samsung into two publicly traded companies. Samsung has rejected this idea outright, but it did report that it planned to cancel $35 billion in outstanding treasury stock, a financial engineering move that should boost earnings per share by reducing its number of shares outstanding. Elliott also factors into Samsung's dividend outlook. Regardless of your opinion on activist investors, Elliott's campaign to boost shareholder returns forced the electronics giant to pledge to increase the amount of free cash flow it will distribute as dividends from around 30% to 50% this year. Especially considering the company's improving operation performance, it seems Samsung's current 1.6% yield  could increase meaningfully in the year ahead. Like Apple, Samsung's dominant franchises across a wide spectrum of the electronics industry give it a strong base of profits from which it can continue to reward shareholders for years to come. At the end of the day, the race to find the best two dividend stocks in the smartphone market is a two-horse race between Apple and Samsung. Andrew Tonner owns shares of Apple.

Canadian operations News provided by Uponor 04 May, 2017, 14:30 ET Share this article APPLE VALLEY, Minn., May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --  Uponor North America (Uponor) is expanding its manufacturing facility in Apple Valley, Minn., beginning late spring 2017, with completion expected by January 2018. The $17.4 million investment will be used toward the expansion of an additional 58,000 square feet to increase manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand. This is the tenth expansion since Uponor began operations in Apple Valley in 1990. The most recent expansion took place in 2016 when the company invested $18 million and added 88,000 square feet to its manufacturing facility. Uponor has also leased an 8,500-square-foot office and lab space in a building next to its manufacturing annex, which the company's technology group will occupy beginning mid-May 2017. The new facility will add an additional 58,000 square feet of production and packaging space to support Uponor’s PEX piping business. The company's North American investments and growth are not limited to the United States. Uponor announced last year it was consolidating the Canadian head office with its eastern distribution center, which moved to Mississauga, Ont., last June; the Canadian headquarters moved into the same building last month. To further unify the Canadian team and take advantage of centralized efficiencies, they are expanding its estimation and commercial piping design services, also located in Mississauga, which will add significant value to its Canadian customers. This alignment resulted in closing its Regina, Sask., office. New features in Mississauga include a training facility that will hold up to 50 attendees as well as a hands-on application lab. To complement the new venue and its traditional plumbing and radiant heating/cooling training classes, the new Canadian facility will begin offering engineering continuing education units (CEUs) beginning June 2. "These are exciting times at Uponor and the building industry as we continue to experience significant growth in both commercial and residential construction; and it's an exciting time for our partners," says Bill Gray, Uponor North America president. "Central to our culture and values is our commitment to our customers; we are continually striving to exceed their expectations. Investments in capacity and our focus on enhancing the customer experience support our strategic direction and set us up for more opportunities." Uponor's North American headquarters are located in Apple Valley, Minn., and the company has a distribution center and resin-receiving facility located in nearby Lakeville, Minn. By year-end, the total Twin Cities metro area footprint will amount to 738,000 square feet, which is nearly 17 acres of facilities under roof. The building expansion is required to meet forecasted growth for its crosslinked polyethylene (PEX) tubing in plumbing, fire sprinkler, radiant heating and cooling and hydronic piping systems used in residential and commercial buildings. According to Gray, Uponor North America's investments represent more than just a larger manufacturing footprint. The company created more than 100 new jobs last year in the Twin Cities and anticipates adding a significant number of jobs as a result of the manufacturing expansion — all of which contributes toward economic development in the metro area. "Apple Valley's latest expansion with its automated packaging technology will become operational as Uponor celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2018," says Jyri Luomakoski, president and CEO, Uponor. "In an established organization like Uponor, we always remind ourselves that we constantly need to introduce new solutions, new ways of working and new ways to view the world to better serve our loyal customers. Our North American region has consistently performed well in this area — and the outlook remains solid — thanks to our dedicated staff in North America, our customers and business partners." Uponor's decision to expand again in Apple Valley was partly due to the successful cooperation of both the State of Minnesota and the City of Apple Valley and their willingness to provide an attractive business climate for Uponor's continued growth.   "When making this investment decision, we spent a significant amount of time evaluating our options," says Gray. "Throughout the process, the City of Apple Valley has demonstrated its support and the State of Minnesota has also shown its appreciation for Uponor. We truly appreciate their support and, as always, do our best to honor and exceed our commitments."

The update, added to the Speedpass+ app this morning, will let any Apple Watch owner authorize a payment using whatever stored option they choose, be that a manually inputted credit card or via Apple Pay. ExxonMobil first added Apple Pay support to Speedpass+ in March of last year, and the new updates should work at more than 10,000 Exxon and Mobil gas stations in the US, the company says. Meanwhile, other app makers are fleeing the Apple Watch While this should be useful for the eager mobile payments fan, the Apple Watch is still in a peculiar position. Apple’s watchOS quietly lost app support in the last few weeks from big-name software makers like Google and Amazon, as well as companies like TripAdvisor, Target, and eBay. None of those companies seemed willing to say it was because wearable tech is not worth the resource investment — representatives for Google and Amazon said the companies would be returning to the platform sometime in the future. But it’s still not a good sign that you can no longer use Google Maps on a device designed to keep you from using your smartphone too often. Nonetheless, Apple seems bullish on the future of the smartwatch, and so does ExonnMobil, apparently. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, CEO Tim Cook said Apple Watch sales have nearly doubled since last year. We still don’t know exactly how many units the company has shipped, but some analysts estimate that around 3 or 4 million devices were sold in the last quarter and lifetime sales are inevitably in the tens of millions of units.

Apple creates awesome hardware and software but when you throw internet services and the cloud into the mix, the company’s rigid approach to product development actually works against it. In some ways, the things that make Apple such a great hardware and software company make it bad at the cloud. You’re probably using iCloud in different ways (sometimes not even knowing that you’re using iCloud). If you’ve ever felt that those options are not as feature rich or reliable, here are some of the available alternatives. 1. iWork for iCloud Apple’s iWork suite is pretty good How iWork Works: The Basics of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote How iWork Works: The Basics of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote Have you always dismissed Apple's productivity apps as unsuitable for your office needs? It's time to reconsider! Read More , especially now that it’s available for free for everyone. iWork’s design and feature set make it a great alternative for creating presentations and documents. But it just doesn’t hold up when you try and collaborate, or you try to use it in the browser. If you’re going to collaborate on a document, Google’s options (Docs, Sheets, and Slides) are much better. For document collaboration, Quip and Dropbox Paper are also worth looking into. 2. iCloud Drive If you’ve ever given an iOS app access to your iCloud account Protect Your iCloud Account With These 4 Easy Steps Protect Your iCloud Account With These 4 Easy Steps Have you taken steps to make sure that no one gets access to your iCloud information?

It’s Apple’s version of Dropbox, but quite basic. On the Mac, you can get to iCloud Drive by clicking on the shortcut in the sidebar in Finder. On iOS 10, you can open the iCloud Drive app to see the files and folders saved here. Here are the two biggest reasons to say goodbye to iCloud Drive. Lack of transparency — iCloud Drive on Mac won’t show you when its sync is active and there’s no way to manually pause or stop the sync. Poor sharing features — iCloud Drive just doesn’t have a simple way when it comes to sharing files with absolutely anyone over the web. Reliability — Just like iCloud, iCloud Drive just isn’t reliable enough. The best alternative Dropbox vs. Google Drive vs. OneDrive: Which Cloud Storage Is Best for You?

Sometimes there are database issues, sometimes I forget the Keychain password so I can’t sync it to other devices. I haven’t yet found a transparent and reliable way to back up and restore iCloud Keychain when I’m formatting or reinstalling macOS either. I think when it comes to something as serious as passwords and personal information, transparency and control should be on the top of the list — which is why you should use 1Password (or LastPass). 1Password is a completely local solution for password management (although for even more security, you can sync the encrypted file with Dropbox). 1Password has apps for Mac and iOS, as well as Android.

Here are your options! If you're looking to upgrade to a new Apple Watch Series, switch between aluminum, stainless steel, or edition, or simply aren't using your Watch anymore and want to find it a new home, sell it can help you earn back some cash. While there aren't as many places to sell your old Apple Watch as there is your old iPhone, there are still a few worth checking out. Sell your Apple Watch on Swappa Sell your Apple Watch on eBay Sell your Apple Watch on Craigslist When should you sell? Normally I advise people to sell just before a new version gets released. That way the market isn't flooded and prices haven't gone down. Apple Watch is only on its second series, though, which makes it hard to predict when the third will arrive. The original Apple Watch debuted in the spring. The second in the fall. That's a big window, but it's also big enough to slip in between. If you time your sale for just before September or March, you might hit the sweet spot regardless. Also, since Watches aren't the necessity phones are, if you misjudge and sell a little early, the worst that can happpend is you have to wait a few weeks for a new one. What should you do before you sell? You might be tempted to simply toss your Apple Watch at someone, count your cash, and walk away. But if you take a few minutes to prep, not only will your Apple Watch be safer to part with, you might just end up with even more cash to count. Unpair your Apple Watch from your iPhone When you unpair your Apple Watch from your iPhone, it not only makes sure you have an up-to-the-minute backup of all your data on your iPhone (and iCloud), it makes sure all your personal information is wiped from the Apple Watch. That way you're not giving away your photos, schedule, contacts, and everything else about your life along with your watch. It also lets you remove the watch from your Apple account and Activation Lock. If that step doesn't happen, the new owner won't be able to set up the watch, and you'll have one unhappy customer demanding their money back. (If you don't have your iPhone handy, you can reset and wipe your Apple Watch, but you'll have to remove it from your Apple ID and Activation Lock later, when you get back to your iPhone or go to iCloud.com on any browser.) Launch the Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom, if you're not already there. Tap on the Watch you want to unpair at the top. Tap on the Info button to the right of the Watch details (looks like an i in a circle.) Tap on Unpair Apple Watch. Tap on Unpair [Watch name] to confirm. Once that's done, you're good to go. Clean up the casing Simply cleaning out the data on your old Apple Watch isn't enough. You have to actually clean the casing as well. Whether the steel is as stainless as the day it shipped, or the aluminum shows some well-worn chips, you want to make the best of whatever situation your Apple Watch is in. So, take a few minutes to carefully, considerately wipe that watch down with a damp cloth and make sure all dirt, oil, lint, and other stains, debris, and even fingerprints are gone from every nook and cranny. This is especially true if you intend to sell your Apple Watch yourself and need to take photos. In that case, don't just polish it up, but put it in great lighting and make sure every angles shine. Don't be dramatic and don't try to hide anything. That way refunds lurk. Simply make it look as good as possible and take photos as best as you can. An honest sale is a good sale. Collect up the cables and bands If you're selling your Apple Watch yourself, including the magnetic charger, AC Adapter, and even the original box, if you can. It'll give you an edge over other sellers. Also include the original band or a substitute if the original is no longer in usable condition. Include both sizes, if it came with multiple sizes and you still have them. Also, if there are any other bands you've grown tired of or simply won't be using any more, throw them in. They won't just sweeten the deal but declutter your own house as well. How should you sell your Apple Watch? Apple Watch is a new product so the market for selling them isn't as mature as it is for phones. That means there are fewer options and most of them require more work on your part. Of course, that also means the potential for more money. Swappa Swappa is a way to get more money for your old Apple Watch than traditional services provide, but in a way that's simpler and easier than selling directly. You do have to have reasonable expectations and some patience. Sell to Swappa eBay eBay can net you more money for your old Apple Watch but requires you to do a lot of the work and take some of the risk. If you're comfortable handling your own sales, and have the time to invest, you can get a better return than trade-in services. Just make sure to: Only ship to the buyer's confirmed Paypal address if using Paypal. Price competitively, especially if you're using Buy It Now as an option. Take great photos but show any defects so everyone knows what they're getting. Take at least one photo showing your Apple Watch when ON, so everyone can see it works. Use a fast shipping service and make sure you include that in your item description. Use keywords in your title and in your item description to attract more potential buyers. You may also want to consider insuring your item in case anything goes wrong during shipping. Watch out for low-feedback buyers and also keep in mind that Paypal charges processing fees as well. Sell on eBay Craigslist Craigslist is the old classified ads in new digital form, and all the wonder and dread that entails. The advantage of Craigslist is that you can sell locally, face-to-face. That greatly speeds up transactions and reduces overhead like shipping. Just make sure to: Never put your personal or home address in an ad. NEVER. Price your Apple Watch competitively. Find existing ads on Craigslist in your area for Apple Watch that are the same model and condition as yours and price accordingly. If you're comfortable, include a number to call or text. It can increase the likelihood of a quick sale. (If you have a virtual number, use it.) Meet in a public place, preferably in the daytime. A coffee shop like Starbucks is ideal. Bring a friend with you, just in case. Watch out for email scams. If someone offers a lot more money to encourage you to ship them your Apple Watch, they're just trying to rip you off. Sell on Craigslist What about selling to a family member or friend? Selling to family and friends isn't quite the same as selling to strangers... but it should be. If you don't just want to give it to them free and clear, you probably want to offer them the best deal possible. Happy relationships are good relationships. Also, make sure the Apple Watch is in the best condition possible, and everyone is being treated fairly. If anything goes wrong, everyone is going to hear about it. For a long time.

Cook spoke on the program about Apple's values, and the importance of companies giving back, touching on topics like Apple's environmental efforts and job creation. Cramer also asked Cook about Apple's latest quarter and the company's future prospects. On job creation in particular, Cook says that, through the company itself as well as suppliers across the country, that Apple is responsible for creating two million jobs in the U.S. You can check out that segment below, from CNBC on YouTube: Cook also talked about the company's most recent quarter, including increased performance for products like Apple Watch and the company's services business. He also touched on the fact that the iPhone 7 Plus, with its dual camera and portrait mode, was more popular than the company had expected. Again from CNBC: Apple reported its Q2 2017 results earlier this week. Between January 1 and March 31 2017, the company sold 50.76 million iPhones, 8.9 million iPads, and 4.2 million Macs, with a revenue of $52.9 billion.

The $17.4 million investment will be used toward the expansion of an additional 58,000 square feet to increase manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand. This is the tenth expansion since Uponor began operations in Apple Valley in 1990. The most recent expansion took place in 2016 when the company invested $18 million and added 88,000 square feet to its manufacturing facility. Uponor has also leased an 8,500-square-foot office and lab space in a building next to its manufacturing annex, which the company's technology group will occupy beginning mid-May 2017. The company's North American investments and growth are not limited to the United States. Uponor announced last year it was consolidating the Canadian head office with its eastern distribution center, which moved to Mississauga, Ont., last June; the Canadian headquarters moved into the same building last month. To further unify the Canadian team and take advantage of centralized efficiencies, they are expanding its estimation and commercial piping design services, also located in Mississauga, which will add significant value to its Canadian customers. This alignment resulted in closing its Regina, Sask., office. New features in Mississauga include a training facility that will hold up to 50 attendees as well as a hands-on application lab. To complement the new venue and its traditional plumbing and radiant heating/cooling training classes, the new Canadian facility will begin offering engineering continuing education units (CEUs) beginning June 2. "These are exciting times at Uponor and the building industry as we continue to experience significant growth in both commercial and residential construction; and it's an exciting time for our partners," says Bill Gray, Uponor North America president. "Central to our culture and values is our commitment to our customers; we are continually striving to exceed their expectations. Investments in capacity and our focus on enhancing the customer experience support our strategic direction and set us up for more opportunities." Uponor's North American headquarters are located in Apple Valley, Minn., and the company has a distribution center and resin-receiving facility located in nearby Lakeville, Minn. By year-end, the total Twin Cities metro area footprint will amount to 738,000 square feet, which is nearly 17 acres of facilities under roof. The building expansion is required to meet forecasted growth for its crosslinked polyethylene (PEX) tubing in plumbing, fire sprinkler, radiant heating and cooling and hydronic piping systems used in residential and commercial buildings. According to Gray, Uponor North America's investments represent more than just a larger manufacturing footprint. The company created more than 100 new jobs last year in the Twin Cities and anticipates adding a significant number of jobs as a result of the manufacturing expansion — all of which contributes toward economic development in the metro area. "Apple Valley's latest expansion with its automated packaging technology will become operational as Uponor celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2018," says Jyri Luomakoski, president and CEO, Uponor. "In an established organization like Uponor, we always remind ourselves that we constantly need to introduce new solutions, new ways of working and new ways to view the world to better serve our loyal customers. Our North American region has consistently performed well in this area — and the outlook remains solid — thanks to our dedicated staff in North America, our customers and business partners." Uponor's decision to expand again in Apple Valley was partly due to the successful cooperation of both the State of Minnesota and the City of Apple Valley and their willingness to provide an attractive business climate for Uponor's continued growth.   "When making this investment decision, we spent a significant amount of time evaluating our options," says Gray. "Throughout the process, the City of Apple Valley has demonstrated its support and the State of Minnesota has also shown its appreciation for Uponor. We truly appreciate their support and, as always, do our best to honor and exceed our commitments."

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Apple Apple Just Handed Trump a Billion-Dollar P.R. Win Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Apple Apple Just Handed Trump a Billion-Dollar P.R. Win Tim Cook wants to make manufacturing jobs great again. by Maya KosoffMay 4, 2017 9:24 am Email Facebook Twitter By Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images. In the weeks and months after his election, Donald Trump went on a tear on Twitter, browbeating outsourcers and threatening companies that didn’t move manufacturing jobs back to the United States. And multinationals, eager to appease, were more than happy to serve up the P.R. victories Trump was looking for. Carrier loudly pledged to keep hundreds of jobs in Indiana, even as it quietly moved hundreds more to Mexico and talked of investing a tax credit from then-Governor Mike Pence in automating its factories. Softbank declared that it would pour $50 billion into U.S. investments, even though the money was part of a previously announced fund. Companies like GM and Spring recycled old jobs plans, serving up easy wins for the Trump administration and earning themselves some good press in the process. Now, Silicon Valley is getting into the game as tech leaders maneuver to stay on the president’s good side. Earlier this week, Indian outsourcing company Infosys vowed to create 10,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next two years, just as the Trump administration has begun evaluating whether to clamp down on H-1B visas for workers who might undercut American labor—a restriction that could disproportionately affect call-center businesses. The latest multinational to get into the game is Apple, which currently stands to save billions if Trump’s vision for a territorial tax system makes it into the final draft of the White House’s tax reform plan. Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook appeared on CNBC Wednesday to announce the creation of a $1 billion fund, which will promote advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States. “By doing that, we can be the ripple in the pond,” Cook said. “Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them.” At a time when re-shoring has become a hot-button political issue, the announcement is a smart play for Apple, which has famously off-shored much of its supply chain. Apple sources its product components from factories across East Asia, including memory chips made in Korea and displays made in Japan, with assembly in China. Companies like Apple have resisted re-shoring in the past, given the comparative lack of necessary manufacturing hubs and logistics in the U.S., Cook’s pledge suggests that political pressure may finally be tipping the scales in Trump’s favor. There are other reasons it may make sense for Apple to build up its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. Building components stateside would give Apple more control over its supply chain, and insulate it from potential political instability, including the ever-present possibility of a trade war between the U.S. and China. It’s less clear, however, how Apple’s move will affect its current supply chain and labor costs. And the ultimate effect on the domestic labor market may be limited: advances in artificial intelligence and automation are already replacing millions of jobs across the world, particularly in the manufacturing sector. After Cook’s announcement, Apple launched a Job Creation page on its Web site, highlighting the fact that it now employs 80,000 people in the U.S., up from 5,000 in 1998. Cook said on CNBC Wednesday that Apple has already created 2 million jobs in the U.S. “A lot of people ask me, ‘Do you think it's a company's job to create jobs?’ and my response is [that] a company should have values because a company is a collection of people,” he told Mad Money host Jim Cramer. “And people should have values, so by extension, a company should. And one of the things you do is give back.” Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

By Amey Stone May 4, 2017 1:57 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple (AAPL) was quick to keep its promise to issue more bonds to fund its newly expanded shareholder buyback and dividend programs.  On Thursday it came to market with a plan to sell sets of bonds maturing in three, five, seven and 10 years. This is pretty much customary for Apple -- with one difference. Usually, Apple also sells a 30-year tranche. Peter Tchir of Brean Capital took note of this, writing to clients: This is the 7th time Apple has come to market with a big slate of bonds. They started in 2013 with no debt and should be at about $100 billion by the end of today. In each of those prior deals they issued 30 year bonds - but not this time. Prior long bond deals trade as low as 91 (issued in 2013 to almost 109 issued in 2016). Is it uncertainty over taxes? Talk about an ultra-bond on treasury side? Repatriation? Maybe it means nothing, but I think it is at least mildly curious that they aren't doing a new long bond here. If Apple is able to repatriate its $250 billion in cash at a low rate as part of corporate tax reform, Apple won't need to borrrow to fund its shareholder reward programs. That may explain why it sees less need to lock in 30-year debt. Research firm CreditSights also took note of the lack of a 30-year tranche. It reiterated its "underperform" rating on Apple bonds, but said the rating is mostly because it sees the 30-year bonds as very expensive. Yields are the second closest to Treasury yields of all the investment-grade "super techs," the firm notes. Analysts Jordan Chalfin and Jay Mayers write that they think the seven-year tranche is the best value based on the initial pricing talk. But they expect that the spread over Treasuries (talk is that the 10-year could yield 90 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury) to be reduced when the bonds are actually put up for sale, a later stage in the process.

RUGABER AP Business Writers May 4, 2017 Updated 16 hrs ago (…) Marcio Jose Sanchez FILE- In this Oct. 27, 2016, file photo, Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products in Cupertino, Calif. Apple will invest $1 billion to help create more U.S. manufacturing jobs and counter recurring criticism about its reliance on overseas factories to assemble most of its iPhones and other devices. Cook announced the fund during a Wednesday, May 3, 2017, interview on CNBC’s “Mad Money.” (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. Story continues below video × Advertisement CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. THREATS TO APPLE Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." APPLE IN THE STATES Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report came after years of complaints about labor practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company's major contractors in China, drew more attention to Apple's reliance on overseas factories. Apple to also issues a separate "supplier responsibility" report reviewing the labor conditions in those facilities. The Wednesday report on U.S jobs is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Apple's decision to provide detailed information about the locations of its U.S. employees could help the company win support from lawmakers eager to protect jobs in their states, Enderle said. "It gives senators something to push back with, recognizing that Apple is a real risky company to target anyway because its products are so popular with people." Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. APP ECONOMY The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple's iPhone "ecosystem." That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps. Such "spillover" effects are widely recognized, although economists sometimes spar over their magnitude. But for a company to claim credit for all or most of the jobs in a particular industry is a stretch, Swonk said. The vast majority of app developers, for example, also produce apps for Android phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. The Public Policy Institute only found 1.7 million jobs in the entire "app economy" — and 1.35 million of those were associated with Android apps. Most of those overlap with the jobs linked to Apple. ___ Rugaber reported from Washington. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Cook will be lauded for this, and yes, jobs are good. But don’t think for a moment this isn’t about saving Apple a buck in the long run. “I’m proud to tell you that we’re creating an advanced manufacturing fund,” Cook told Cramer from Apple’s Cupertino, California headquarters. “We’re initially putting $1 billion in the fund.” This ostensible decision of the heart very clearly became something more strategic, as Cramer noted that while a billion is a big number, it’s relatively tiny given Apple’s liquid war chest, which now tops $250 billion in cash. Cook’s reply:”It’s $1 billion of our U.S. money, which we have to borrow to get, that’s another whole topic.” Why would a company with $250 billion in cash need to borrow 1/250th of that in order to launch its vaunted U.S. jobs program? According to Cook, it’s because the company is a victim of its own success: If you earn money globally, you can’t bring it back into the United States unless you pay 35 percent plus your state tax. And you look at this and you go, ‘This is kind of bizarre.’ You want people to use this money in the United States to invest more. We are in a good position, but an unusual one. Our good position is we can borrow. And so to invest in the United States, we have to borrow. This doesn’t make sense on a broad basis, and so I think the administration, you saw that they’re really getting this and want to bring this back and I hope that that comes to pass.” And there it is. “We have to borrow” is of course, untrue. The company could repatriate its vast offshore holdings — which it’s accumulated deliberately, through years of byzantine tax-dodging schemes — but would then have to pay taxes to the IRS, which might bump Apple down from The richest corporation in the history of capitalism to merely One of the richest corporations in the history of capitalism. It’s why Cook has contorted himself in recent months, showing a willingness to collaborate directly with Trump insofar as the president could cut Apple a sweet tax repatriation deal (splashy headlines about domestic job creation will help, too). Asked if Cook’s relationship with the White House is one of “give and take,” despite the fact that Trump’s administration has a clear disdain for a large swath of Apple’s employees, the privacy of people who use his phones, and even Cook’s identity as a gay man, his reply is pretty straightforward: “You know, again, I think with each administration in every country in the world, there are things you disagree and things you agree, and you look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don’t.” In other words: Cook’s Apple will hold its nose and play nice as long as it takes in order to bring home its billions.

Updated May 4, 2017 9:46AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple App Store Apple iOS Mobile Apps Analytics Customer Data Sales and Marketing Developers Technology News Mobile app developers hoping to gain a little more insight into how users discover their apps are in for some good news. Apple announced yesterday that it has updated its App Analytics tool to provide developers with exactly that. The latest version of the tool will offer information such as what users were searching for when they discovered the apps, where they were on the iTunes app store, and where they previously had been on the Web. The service will also include new information, such as metrics on source types, so that developers can analyze which referring apps and Web sites are the most effective at driving users to their products. That should help developers aiming to optimize their marketing campaigns. More Love for Developers The App Analytics tool made its debut two years ago as part of the Apple Developer Program to help developers measure user engagement, optimize marketing campaigns, and monetize their iOS apps. Developers have also been using App Analytics to gain insight into how frequently their apps crash on different versions of the iOS operating system, filter groups of users based on the demographics captured in their Apple ID profiles, and measure the number of sessions, active devices, and retention of users. This week’s upgrade features four new data sources: App Store Browse, App Store Search, App Referrer and Web Referrer. The new information will help developers determine if new customers found their apps on Featured, Categories, or Top Charts listings in the App Store or by searching on specific keywords. The new tools are likely to be particularly helpful for smaller developers trying to squeeze the most out of modest marketing budgets. Apple has been showing its smaller iOS developers much more love recently, with a revamped version of its developer Web site that offers more videos, reference documents, and features such as the ability to respond directly to customer comments. App Store Driving Revenue The new features arrive at a crucial time for Apple and its app store. On Tuesday, the company reported that revenues for the store were up 40 percent year-over-year, setting a new quarterly record. Apple’s “services” category, which includes the App Store, helped generate around $7 billion over the last quarter, up from about $6 billion over the same period last year. Part of that is being driven by the company’s ability to monetize customers of the App Store. Premium and in-app purchases reached $40 per device in 2016, up from $35 per device the previous year. The strong performance of services in general and the App Store in particular is surely welcome news for Apple, which has been grappling with the challenge of delivering continued sales growth as sales of two of its key products, the iPhone and iPad, have begun to flag.

MORE IN MOBILE TECH The Birth of Payment Service Venmo BlackBerry To Launch KEYone in May Cisco Intros Automated EMM Service Samsung: Bigger Profit in 2017 AT&T Takes Heat over Its 5G Network Next Article > BlackBerry To Launch KEYone Android Phone at End of May By Shirley Siluk / Top Tech News. Updated April 27, 2017. The latest Android smartphone from BlackBerry, the KEYone, is set to hit the market in the U.S. and Canada on May 31, according to device manufacturer TCL. Like the classic BlackBerry devices, the KEYone will feature a physical keyboard below the 4.5-inch front display. However, rather than running on BlackBerry's own operating system, the KEYone is built on Android 7.1 Nougat. Pre-ordering will be available in Canada first, while buyers in the U.S. can pre-register now to receive updates and offers ahead of the KEYone's release. An unlocked version of the phone will be priced starting at $549 in the U.S. In 2015, BlackBerry released the Priv, its first Android smartphone, as part of its shift away from its proprietary operating system. 'Smart' Keyboard with Shortcuts "Anyone who is an Android loyalist and values the mobile security and productivity that BlackBerry software brings will love this smartphone," BlackBerry's general manager of mobility solutions Alex Thurber said in a statement released today. The BlackBerry KEYone will feature an aluminum frame and a touch display made of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The company said the "smart" physical keyboard will offer contextual auto-correction and next-word prediction capabilities, as well as up to 52 customizable shortcuts that can provide users with one-key access to apps and contacts. The phone also comes with a personalized learning engine that "gets to know the way you type with on screen flick typing," BlackBerry said. First Product of New Licensing Strategy Unveiled in February at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the KEYone is the first smartphone to come out under a new brand- and device-licensing strategy announced by BlackBerry in September. That strategy marks BlackBerry's "first significant step toward leading as a software company" rather than as a hardware development company, chief operating officer Ralph Pini wrote in a blog post last year. "This is what the future looks like for our business, and it is the right move as we progress towards profitability," Pini noted. "This will enable our resources to focus all efforts on providing state-of-the-art security software for devices and the enterprise of things, as well as work on other critical areas of the company." Based in China, TCL Communication Technology Holdings announced its plans to develop mobile devices for BlackBerry and other companies in January at the CES 2017 in Las Vegas. TCL said its first smartphone for BlackBerry would focus on three key features: security, productivity and reliability. Other features of the KEYone include a 3505 mAh battery, which Thurber said is "the largest ever in a BlackBerry device," a combination of Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 and Adreno 506 GPU processors, and BlackBerry's DTEK security app for "constant security monitoring." It also comes with a 12MP rear camera and an 8MP front camera.

Recommended for You Apple-Picking Robot Prepares to Compete for Farm Jobs Nvidia Lets You Peer Inside the Black Box of Its Self-Driving AI Real or Fake? AI Is Making It Very Hard to Know An Ostrich-Like Robot Pushes the Limits of Legged Locomotion The 3-D Printer That Could Finally Change Manufacturing The may seem like music to Donald Trump’s ears. The president has long argued that America’s most successful gadget firm should manufacture more of its products on domestic soil. A push to invigorate the U.S. industry sounds like good news from that standpoint. Trump’s main goal in calling out Apple, of course, is to create new jobs. The manufacturing industry is indeed likely to welcome the infusion, even if it is small beer to Apple these days. As Reuters notes, the company already spends $50 billion per year with U.S. suppliers, and has $257 billion in cash overseas. But it rivals the investment into advanced manufacturing made by President Obama in 2013—money that went toward building new national institutes focused on developing new manufacturing techniques. Apple hasn’t released much in the way of details about its plans for the investment, saying only that the first beneficiary will be announced later this month. And to add to the difficulty in predicting its direction, “advanced manufacturing” is a large umbrella term that includes everything from 3-D printing aerospace components to installing robots on assembly lines. Apple certainly has enough cash with which to experiment outside its own domain. But you can expect at least some if to be channeled toward the automation of hardware manufacturing. The firm has shown off an iPhone recycling robot in the past. There’s no reason that couldn’t be turned into something that puts devices together instead of taking them apart. Still, regardless of the recipient, the investment is unlikely to yield the new jobs that Trump so desperately wants. As we’ve explained in the past, advanced manufacturing—with all of its automation and super-efficiencies—can certainly bring productivity gains. But it won’t bring back manufacturing jobs. Just last month we finally got some hard numbers on the impact of automation on the labor force in our factories and warehouses: more robots bring with them decreased employment and lower wages. So if Apple’s focus is indeed going to be on using robotics, it’s not going to be good for the workforce.  It’s perhaps no wonder, then, that Tim Cook appeared to play up the wider effects of boosting the industry when he announced the news, explaining that “manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them.” Indeed, the Manufacturing Institute claims that every $1 in sales of manufactured products supports $1.33 in output from other sectors—the biggest multiplier in any industry. As far as Apple’s investment goes, that may have to be enough for Trump.

But that's not as great a title as previously. The iPad was the most popular tablet in the first quarter with 8.9 million shipped worldwide, research firm IDC said on Thursday. While that gave Apple a leading 24.6% market share, the company's shipments actually declined 13% year over year. It was the biggest drop among any of the five most popular tablet makers. "Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in [the first quarter of 2017]," IDC said in a statement. "Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product lines." Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter The iPad was once an important part of Apple's product mix and contributed significantly to the company's bottom line. However, over the last few years, consumers have increasingly turned their attention to cheaper tablets and two-in-one hybrids, devices that can be used both as a notebook and tablet. Apple's (aapl) iPad revenue has subsequently suffered. Earlier this week, Apple said that its iPad sales during its fiscal second quarter was 8.9 million units, a 13% drop year over year. IPad revenue was $3.9 billion, a 12% decline. But as IDC's data shows, Apple isn't the only company facing trouble with tablets. Worldwide, tablet makers shipped 36.2 million tablets during the first quarter, an 8.5% decline compared to the first quarter of 2016. According to IDC, it was the tenth consecutive quarterly decline for the overall market. Still, other tablet makers didn't experience quite the drop Apple did during the period. Samsung (ssnlf), for instance, shipped 6 million units during the quarter, a 1.1% year-over-year decline. Amazon's (amzn) shipments fell just 1.8% to 2.2 million, and Lenovo shipped 2.1 million units, a 3.8% decline. The winner in the first quarter, however, was China-based telecommunications company Huawei, which shipped 2.7 million tablets, notching a 31.7% gain over the same period a year earlier. According to IDC, Huawei's growth was built partly on detachables, or tablets that can be plugged into a keyboard and mimic laptop-like functionality. Here's a look at the top five companies' tablet market share: Apple: 24.6% Samsung: 16.5% Huawei: 7.4% Amazon: 6.0% Lenovo: 5.7% All other tablet makers: 39.8% Looking ahead, IDC didn't share a forecast about where the tablet market is headed. It did, however, say that it believes detachables and hybrid notebooks will continue to sell well in the coming months.

ExxonMobil Speedpass+ App Breaks New Ground With Connected Car and Apple Watch First app to connect a car with mobile fuel payment in the United States First app to use Apple Watch to pay for gasoline at a majority of its U.S. network First app to allow consumers to apply for a credit card and use to save on fuel Loading media player... Download Windows Media Video Quicktime MPEG-4 Video May 04, 2017 03:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time SPRING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ExxonMobil announced today that it is rolling out several updates to its Speedpass+ mobile payment app, including use of the app with both Ford vehicles equipped with Ford SYNC®3 and the Apple Watch to purchase Synergy™ fuel and car washes at approximately 10,000 participating Exxon and Mobil stations across the United States. “With these updates to the Speedpass+ app, consumers now have even more options to pay for fuel while sitting in the comfort of their car – either using Ford SYNC 3 or the Apple Watch,” said Matt Bergeron, vice president of marketing for ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company. “This is more than a cashless payment app; it is a platform that earns and redeems Plenti loyalty points and manages receipts. With ExxonMobil’s heritage and commitment to innovation, the Speedpass+ app continues to bring new benefits to its users.” Introduced in early 2017, Ford’s AppLink technology in SYNC 3 allows Speedpass+ app users to use the in-vehicle touch screen and voice commands to easily authorize payment, making it the first fuel payment connected car application in the United States. Ford owners can also use the app to check how much fuel is left in the tank when they are away from their car, allowing them to better plan their day. In addition, Apple owners can now use the Speedpass+ app on their Apple Watch. With just a few clicks on the watch, consumers can select their pump and authorize payment. “We are always looking for ways to give Exxon and Mobil consumers a safe, clean, convenient, and quick way to fill up, and mobile payments are helping us to redefine the consumer shopping experience at the pump,” said Bergeron. ExxonMobil is introducing several other new updates to the Speedpass+ app, including the option to use the new Apply and Buy feature in the app to apply for an ExxonMobil Smart Card™, a private label credit card issued by Citibank, N.A. Once an application is approved, the card will be automatically added as a payment option within the app for the consumer to begin using. For a limited time, new accounts will receive a savings of 20 cents per gallon for the first two months, then six cents on every gallon after that. These Smart Card saving benefits can also be combined with points earned through the Plenti Loyalty Program. To earn Plenti points with each Speedpass+ transaction, consumers can simply link their Plenti account with their Speedpass+ account. And for consumers who don’t yet have a Plenti account, they can sign up from within the Speedpass+ app to begin earning points immediately. “We are focused on providing consumers with the best possible experience at our Exxon and Mobil stations. This includes making the process to earn and use Plenti points completely seamless,” said Kim Kemper, U.S. loyalty manager for ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company. “The Speedpass+ app makes earning and redeeming Plenti points as easy as possible.” All Speedpass+ app transactions are secure and use an encrypted token to protect the consumer’s data. Consumers can select their payment method from a number of options including major credit cards, debit cards, ExxonMobil Smart Cards, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. About ExxonMobil ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, uses technology and innovation to help meet the world’s growing energy needs.

It can be downloaded by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C cable and installing the beta software from a registered developer account using iTunes. Because of the installation requirements, tvOS betas are limited to developers. tvOS 10.2.1 will not be available to the public until the final version of the software launches. Apple does not typically provide detailed beta release notes, so we don't yet know what's included in tvOS 10.2.1. It's likely to focus primarily on bug fixes, security enhancements, and performance improvements, but we may not know what's new until the software sees an official release. No notable changes were found in the first four tvOS 10.2.1 betas, but should anything new popup in the fifth beta, we'll update this post.

President Donald Trump plans to change that by lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Profits from unincorporated businesses would also be taxed at 15 percent, in place of the taxpayer's regular income tax bracket. The last time the U.S. overhauled its tax system, President Ronald Reagan's Treasury Department kicked off two years of debate by releasing a three-volume treatise. This time, Trump started the process by releasing a one-page schematic. How Trump's border tax could boost your property insurance rate While details are sparse, the proposed changes to the corporate tax are encouraging. The U.S. corporate tax is woefully out of date, having failed to adapt to shifts in the economy away from manufacturing and toward services and technology. The proposed changes for unincorporated businesses, not subject to the corporate tax, are more problematic. Setting the tax rate on unincorporated businesses much lower than the top federal income tax rate (proposed at 35 percent) creates huge opportunities to game the tax system by reclassifying labor income as profits. While our tax system is a drag on the economy, it has fueled one sector: tax avoidance. As evidence, consider the spate of corporate inversions in recent years, as well as the arcane maneuvers used to avoid or delay paying corporate taxes. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott: Why I called for a Constitutional Convention of States One such innovation is the Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich. No, this is not Starbucks' latest offering. Rather, this is a tax strategy that some of the world's richest firms have used to pay little or no taxes on much of their corporate profits. Apple Inc. uses such techniques to lower its corporate tax burden from over 43 percent, the statutory corporate tax rate for corporations in California, to under 3 percent. Apple is not alone. Google Corp, Microsoft and many other tech companies also enjoy the Double Irish. More traditional firms, relying less on intellectual property, are less able to shift profits. Schemes like the Double Irish exploit idiosyncrasies in some countries' tax systems in order to escape paying corporate taxes. These profits may be taxed in the future, if they are repatriated. U.S. firms hold well over $2 trillion in profits overseas. Many firms are leaving profits outside the U.S. seemingly in perpetuity, or until the U.S. makes repatriation less onerous. Cutting corporate tax rates won't eliminate tax avoidance schemes. Other reforms are needed to curb the practice. However, lower rates alone will go a long way toward reducing the practice. Firms employ high-priced accountants and lawyers to devise and carry out their tax strategies — not to mention lobbying efforts to keep such maneuvers legal. A nearly 60 percent cut in the corporate tax rate will lead firms to shift from costly avoidance strategies and toward investment in socially-productive activities. Extending the 15 percent rate to unincorporated businesses is intended to spur economic growth and jobs. It is more likely to spur accounting chicanery, with firms reclassifying labor income as profits. Consider a surgeon with $800,000 in taxable wages. For simplicity, assume this entire amount is taxed at 35 percent. The doctor would owe $280,000 in taxes. Instead, suppose she reported $400,000 of this income as wages and the other $400,000 as business income. She would now owe $140,000 in taxes on wages and $60,000 in taxes on business income. This would save $80,000 in taxes, lowering her tax rate on the shifted income by 30 percent. Any unincorporated business could exploit this practice. And, efforts by the IRS to curtail this behavior would be costly and invasive. The U.S has much to gain from lowering its corporate tax rate, but extending this rate to unincorporated businesses is more problematic. My hope is that the president's bullet points serve as a clarion call for the desperate need for fundamental tax reform. Seth H.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Qualcomm apparently wants the US to block Apple from importing any more iPhones Qualcomm apparently wants the US to block Apple from importing any more iPhones Matthew Wilson 14 hours ago Apple, Featured Tech News Earlier this year, Apple and the FTC both united in taking Qualcomm to task for its licensing agreements. As you would expect, Qualcomm isn’t too happy about the situation and is trying to fire back at Apple in whatever way it can- including injunctions on iPhone sales. This week, it is being reported that Qualcomm is going to try and persuade US agencies to block new iPhone stock from entering the country. According to a source speaking with Bloomberg, Qualcomm is going to ask the US International Trade Commission to restrict iPhone imports to block them from being sold. This move is likely partially due to the fact that Apple is withholding its royalty payments to Qualcomm while its lawsuit gets underway. The legal battles kicked off earlier this year, when Apple claimed that its current licensing agreement with Qualcomm was anti-competitive. Qualcomm is counter-suing but it is starting off on poor ground to begin with, as the company was already found guilty of anti-competitive behaviour in South Korea. The US Federal Trade Commission is also putting together its own case against Qualcomm, though the chip maker has already asked that it be thrown out. KitGuru Says: I really doubt that Qualcomm would be able to successfully block Apple from importing iPhones into the US. Still, it is an interesting development in the war brewing between these two companies.

Industry giants are thwarting bills designed to let you repair your products, citing safety and legal concerns. The right to repair movement focuses on reversing the trend of embedding proprietary software into everyday equipment. Proponents of the idea have called attention to the increasing inability to repair devices ranging from smartphones to farm vehicles. Preventing repair Previously, most products could be fixed using a standard set of tools and generic repair knowledge obtained from books and local mechanics. This wide access to repair documentation and parts has traditionally enabled consumers to extend the life of their devices beyond their original point of failure. In the modern world, this ease of repair is being progressively eroded. The use of software in products like household appliances and cars makes it harder for a typical owner to fix something if it goes wrong. Without knowledge of the product's programming, even basic problems can't be remedied. Discarded old cell phones. Courtesy Geitan Lee, flickr.com Manufacturers often refuse to publish the service manuals for their devices. When mechanical details are provided, the software diagnostic codes used to identify key faults are usually kept reserved for internal use. Firms like Apple intend you to bring your device to an official repairer if it needs fixing, actively preventing you from mending it yourself. If you try to, you'll face a myriad of complex disassembly procedures, using tools and screw types developed specifically for the phone. Apple's not alone in going out of its way to stop you opening its devices – according to repair guide specialists iFixit, Samsung's Galaxy S8 is also all but impossible to fix. "Front and back glass make for double the crackability, and strong adhesive on both makes it tough to access the internals for any repair," iFixit noted in the negative section of its report. "Because of the curved screen, replacing the front glass without destroying the display is extremely difficult." Hacking tractors Earlier this year, the right to repair movement broke the headlines again, gaining worldwide attention. Reports exposed how U.S. farmers are hacking their tractors to install cracked firmware versions from Ukraine and other regions in Eastern Europe. This change allows the repair-blocking tools used by tractor manufacturers like John Deere and Case IH to be bypassed. The tractor display at the first Silver Willow Classic car and truck show, Mansfield, Ontario. Elizabeth Parker If a fault develops on a machine, farmers can get the part replaced at a local mechanic's workshop. The vehicle won't start up afterwards though, due to software mechanisms that require all installed parts to be approved by the manufacturer before use. The owner has to pay a representative of John Deere or Case IH to drive out to the farm, connect a laptop to the tractor and then drive off again. As the software is proprietary and undocumented, there's nothing the farmer can do to avoid it. This has led to a black market of sorts for "unlocked" tractor firmware. Blocking mechanics Other cases have focused on how tech companies like Apple are driving small repair shops out of business. Apple refuses to provide official diagnostic and disassembly tools to third-party mechanics unless they join its Authorized Repairer scheme. An employee at an U.S. Apple Store Genius Bar helps a customer. Wesley Fryer / Creative Commons The terms and conditions of this program explicitly prevent firms from mentioning repairs for other kinds of phone on their websites. It also prohibits the repair of components not approved by Apple, forcing devices with cracked displays or motherboard problems to be shipped off to an Apple service centre for the work to be completed. "Users are disempowered, trained to go hat in hand to the Apple store just to change a battery (rather than doing it themselves)," explains the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "Independent repair shops are driven out of business. And the electronic waste piles up, as users discard their devices rather than fixing them or donating them for re-use." Involving the law The discontent around the locked-down nature of modern devices has inspired several right-to-repair bill proposals in U.S. states. They've met with fierce opposition and the right to repair isn't yet in law in the U.S. This year, a trial bill in Nebraska was shelved after lawmakers conceded to pressure from the corporations who've pledged to aggressively fight it. Apple united with the tractor brands to argue that giving people access to repair tools would lead to intellectual property exposure and create a risk of personal injury. Representatives of the electronics industry told Minnesota lawmakers last year that customers could cut their hands on glass while trying to repair broken smartphone screens. Nebraska State Capitol, Lincoln. Sarah Korf/Flickr Creative Commons John Deere has also vocally opposed right-to-repair bills, claiming its approach actually helps its customers. The company suggested that it intends to "protect consumers' significant investment in equipment" by forcing them to use first-party parts. In other statements, John Deere implied farmers don't actually own their machines, instead receiving a license "to operate the vehicle." This compares hundred-thousand dollar machines to the kind of business model used by Microsoft to sell Windows. Other right to repair bills are facing similar issues. Proposals are now being considered in New York, Massachusetts, Kansas, Wyoming, Illinois and Tennessee, as well as Nebraska and Minnesota. Representatives of the industry giants fighting the movement are attending each hearing, lobbying lawmakers against the idea. In Europe, basic and little-known legislation already exists. It stops far short of the complete bills being devised for the U.S. Support through attention The farmers and repair organisations trying to push the bills forward lack the strength of backing that the opposition has in plentiful supply. While momentum is rising, supporting groups recognise there's a long path ahead before consumer rights to repair are universally recognised. The response to the movement so far – both from the industry and consumers – has affirmed the importance of the cause, demonstrating it's worthy of lawmakers' attention. Although there's yet to be any major wins, each case increases the visibility of the movement and helps to build support for the idea. Senators backing the movement have noted that making the right to repair a part of law would positively benefit every consumer, something the industry's response has seemingly confirmed. Many airlines last year barred all Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones over fire risk concerns, following reports of exploding lithium-ion batteries. Ed Jones, AFP "This legislation will positively impact all consumers, of all ages and income levels, by adding competition to the electronic repair market, and by paving the way for more innovation," Nebraska Senator Lydia Brasch, sponsor of the right-to-repair bill in the state, said to Ars Technica in March. "I did not realize how important this legislation is nationally until Apple sent lobbyists to my office to oppose it." In the months and years ahead, it's possible Apple, John Deere and hundreds of other companies will be forced into publishing repair documents for their products, creating a more sustainable electronics market where traditional attitudes towards product ownership and lifecycles are restored. As the modern world has progressed, consumers have inadvertently conceded control of their devices' operation to their mega-corporation creators. In turn, this has led to the destruction of decades-old repair businesses and the loss of the once prolific "make do and mend" mindset. With firms like Apple reliant on the rampant consumerism expressed in the two-year iPhone upgrade cycle, giving buyers a way to resist the planned obsolescence of most tech products would impact their bottom line. It's clear the tech giants won't be admitting defeat lightly, making the right-to-repair motion's future uncertain.

Google released a comment on the story stating their intention to reinstate Watch support in the future. .@Google comment on @Apple Watch: "We removed Apple Watch support from our latest iOS release but expect to support it again in the future" — Shara Tibken (@sharatibken) May 2, 2017 While apps like Amazon and eBay may not be well-suited for the Apple Watch to begin with, the bigger story here is how long it took for anyone to notice that the Watch apps were removed. Hughes writes: The fact that these high-profile removals have gone largely unnoticed could be a sign that the apps simply were not widely used. In contrast, removing iPad support from an iOS app, for example, would likely be noticed immediately and generate headlines. The Apple Watch has proven to be a challenging platform for developers to find success on. Initially that could be attributed to slow hardware and limited developer tools, but Apple has made significant improvements with watchOS 3 and its 2nd-generation hardware. Perhaps part of the challenge is that not every app belongs on the Apple Watch, and for the ones that do, the implementation has to be just right.

Originally announced at WWDC in 2014, App Analytics gave developers a better understanding of how and when their apps were used, how many views their app’s page on the App Store received, and more. However, the original version of App Analytics did not report how customers got to the App Store. Yesterday Apple announced an expansion to App Analytics that adds source and referral data. According to Apple’s developer news website: App Analytics in iTunes Connect now provides insight on where customers discover your app, including App Store browsing and search, within other apps, or on the web. With key metrics based on source types, you can see your top referring apps and websites, making it easier to optimize your marketing campaigns. Apple’s App Analytics page elaborates: With App Analytics, you can see how many users discover your app while searching or browsing the App Store — including tapping on Search Ads for your app — to gain insight into how your marketing and metadata impact downloads. App Analytics counts users who visit your app’s product page from a link within another app. Blogs, websites, and other online sources that link to your app’s product page, are critical in driving user acquisition through word-of-mouth marketing and PR. With App Analytics, you can see which organic marketing channels drive the highest traffic, downloads, usage, and revenue for your app. There is a lot of interesting new data for developers to digest in App Analytics that should help them market their apps more effectively. I particularly appreciate the ability to drill down into any source of App Store traffic to see how it has performed over time and from which countries those customers are coming.

But Morgan Stanley's Craig Hettenbach said this waiting game was becoming a bit of a tiresome exercise. By Tiernan Ray Updated May 4, 2017 1:49 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of wireless chip makerQorvo (QRVO) are up 68 cents, or 1%, at $68.73, fully recouping last night’s after-hours losses, after the company met fiscal Q4 expectations but missed with its Q1 outlook, citing the increasingly familiar lament that demand from China has not lived up to expectations. Morgan Stanley’s Craig Hettenbach, who has an Equal Weight rating on the shares, and a $66 price target, thinks investors are being asked to endure a lot of bad reports from Qorvo just to sit and wait for a supposed payoff from Apple’s (AAPL) next iPhone (which presumably will have more dollar content from Qorvo): As QRVO shareholders await the iPhone 8 catalyst, they have had to withstand 3 straight guide downs. This is a big ask, especially when there are cleaner ways to play that product cycle (AVGO). And while the stock had been impervious to negative China data points, China weakness is leaving a mark. More charitable today is Northland Capital’s Tom Sepenzis, who has an Outperform rating on the shares, and a $75 price target, but even he warns that the company’s growth target for revenue of 10% in the current fiscal year is an “increasingly high hurdle." While inventory issues with Apple in the quarter weighed on results, “the greater issue involves the loss of share in the Samsung Galaxy S8,” writes Sepenzis, referring to Samsung Electronics’s (005930KS) recently introduced top-of-the-line smartphone. That loss “could signal a troubling shift for QRVO out of the high end and into the low-to-mid tier." "Management believes this will be resolved with the next wave of flagship devices as it is introducing more integrated and competitive RF front end devices, and has guided towards increased content at its largest customer and Huawei in devices slated for introduction later this year." Despite all those issues, Sepenzis likes the product portfolio and the improvement the company is showing with gross profit: Despite the lower near-term guidance and the issues at its Chinese customers, QRVO does continue to make progress on its integration and its product portfolio. It has made significant progress on the quality and interest in its BAW filter products, particularly in % GHz WiFi, and this should help it return to higher growth in FY19. It also announced that it is working on a new FEM with 12 integrated BAW filters for a product introduction in late CY18. The one area where QRVO does continue to execute is on the gross margin recovery, and management is pushing to exit the current fiscal year with 50%+ margins once again.

Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the fund during an interview yesterday on CNBC’s “Mad Money.” He said the fund will make its first investment by the end of this month. Apple’s contribution amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Facebook tops 1Q forecasts Facebook Inc. reported first-quarter profit of $3.06 billion yesterday. Facebook shares have climbed 32 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has climbed almost 7 percent.

However, industry analysts forecast that Apple will remain on top, thanks to its lower-priced recently refreshed iPad and the 10.5-inch model rumored to be forthcoming. In the first quarter of 2017, Apple took 27.9-percent of the tablet market share (in terms of global shipments) followed by Samsung with 19.1-percent, Huawei with 6.6-percent, Lenovo with 6.4-percent and Amazon with 6.3-percent. Apple's 27.9 percent represents 8.92 million iPads shipped in Q1 of 2017 – down from 10.3 million shipped in Q1 2016. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Neither the shrinking demand for tablets nor Apple's leading role in this area is a surprise, considering that iPads were the first competitive entry into the tablet market, and that "iPad" is nearly an eponymous moniker for tablets of any make or model. However, iPads – especially the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch Pro models – have come under fire recently for their lack of pro features. Without expandable storage, expansion ports, or a full desktop operating system, they lack some key features of their main competitors. But analysts believe Apple will continue to enjoy a place at the head of the table, in part due to momentum, but also thanks to the lowered price (US$329) of its latest model. We believe that Apple took a step in the right direction lowering the buying threshold, but as far as the rumored 10.5-inch edition, we'll hold our speculation until more details emerge. Last year, reputable KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo hinted at fetching features like a nearly bezel-less screen, boosted internals and a redesigned chassis, but it's been some time since those details were elucidated.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ExxonMobil Speedpass+ App Breaks New Ground With Connected Car and Apple Watch SPRING, Texas–(BUSINESS WIRE)–ExxonMobil announced today that it is rolling out several updates to its Speedpass+ mobile payment app, including use of the app with both Ford vehicles equipped with Ford SYNC®3 and the Apple Watch to purchase Synergy™ fuel and car washes at approximately 10,000 participating Exxon and Mobil stations across the United States. “With these updates to the Speedpass+ app, consumers now have even more options to pay for fuel while sitting in the comfort of their car – either using Ford SYNC 3 or the Apple Watch,” said Matt Bergeron, vice president of marketing for ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company. “This is more than a cashless payment app; it is a platform that earns and redeems Plenti loyalty points and manages receipts. With ExxonMobil’s heritage and commitment to innovation, the Speedpass+ app continues to bring new benefits to its users.” Introduced in early 2017, Ford’s AppLink technology in SYNC 3 allows Speedpass+ app users to use the in-vehicle touch screen and voice commands to easily authorize payment, making it the first fuel payment connected car application in the United States. Ford owners can also use the app to check how much fuel is left in the tank when they are away from their car, allowing them to better plan their day. In addition, Apple owners can now use the Speedpass+ app on their Apple Watch. With just a few clicks on the watch, consumers can select their pump and authorize payment. “We are always looking for ways to give Exxon and Mobil consumers a safe, clean, convenient, and quick way to fill up, and mobile payments are helping us to redefine the consumer shopping experience at the pump,” said Bergeron. ExxonMobil is introducing several other new updates to the Speedpass+ app, including the option to use the new Apply and Buy feature in the app to apply for an ExxonMobil Smart Card™, a private label credit card issued by Citibank, N.A. Once an application is approved, the card will be automatically added as a payment option within the app for the consumer to begin using. For a limited time, new accounts will receive a savings of 20 cents per gallon for the first two months, then six cents on every gallon after that. These Smart Card saving benefits can also be combined with points earned through the Plenti Loyalty Program. To earn Plenti points with each Speedpass+ transaction, consumers can simply link their Plenti account with their Speedpass+ account. And for consumers who don’t yet have a Plenti account, they can sign up from within the Speedpass+ app to begin earning points immediately. “We are focused on providing consumers with the best possible experience at our Exxon and Mobil stations. This includes making the process to earn and use Plenti points completely seamless,” said Kim Kemper, U.S. loyalty manager for ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company. “The Speedpass+ app makes earning and redeeming Plenti points as easy as possible.” All Speedpass+ app transactions are secure and use an encrypted token to protect the consumer’s data. Consumers can select their payment method from a number of options including major credit cards, debit cards, ExxonMobil Smart Cards, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. About ExxonMobil ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, uses technology and innovation to help meet the world’s growing energy needs. We hold an industry-leading inventory of resources and are one of the largest integrated refiners, marketers of petroleum products and chemical manufacturers.

But it also reported a dip in sales of the iPhone, caused in part by another limp performance in China, where revenue fell by 14%. Consumers may be delaying updating their device in anticipation of a new model in September. Apple’s cash reserves ballooned to $257bn in the quarter. Following a spate of incidents where users posted videos of murders and suicides, Facebook said it would recruit another 3,000 people to screen for harmful images in addition to the 4,500 it already employs to do that job. Reporting its quarterly earnings, the social network said it had almost reached 2bn monthly users. Revenue soared in the first quarter, to $8bn.

Miami vice In a closely watched case, America’s Supreme Court ruled that the city of Miami does have the right to sue Bank of America and Wells Fargo for allegedly discriminating against blacks and Hispanics by selling them risky mortgages. Miami argues that the mortgages led to a rise in foreclosures, subsequently hitting its proceeds from property taxes. The court decided that under the law in question, Miami has the legal standing of an “aggrieved” person. But it also sent the case back to the appeals court with an order to apply a much tougher standard when assessing damages.  Buoyed by higher oil prices, the world’s big oil companies reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter. Exxon Mobil made a headline profit of $4bn, up by 120% from the same three months last year. And BP nearly tripled its earnings, to $1.5bn. It expects to fork out another $5bn this year in payments related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010, and another $2bn next year. Serendipity Infosys, an Indian IT services company that does most of its business in the United States, announced that it would hire 10,000 American workers over the next two years as it opens four new technology and innovation hubs. Last month Infosys was one of the companies mentioned by the White House when it laid out plans to reform the H1-B employment-visa programme, which it claims is abused by foreign firms bringing in cheap workers. Perhaps by chance, one of the new tech hubs will be built in Indiana, the home state of Mike Pence, the vice-president. The euro zone’s GDP grew at an annualised rate of around 2% in the first quarter. American GDP rose by 0.7% in the same period, the weakest pace since early 2014. America’s weak economic growth at the start of the year played a part in the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates on hold. But with wages growing at a fast clip and the unemployment rate at a ten-year low, the central bank is still on course to raise rates twice more this year. Britain’s economy meanwhile slowed significantly in the first three months of the year, expanding by 1.2% at an annualised rate. But manufacturing grew in April at the fastest pace in more than three years, according to a respected purchasing managers’ index. Airbnb reached a settlement with San Francisco over a law that fined it for every person renting out their home through the website who had not registered with the city. Airbnb and other home-share sites will now check data on hosts and remove listings that fail to comply with the rules. The case was one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of Airbnb’s ambition to launch a stockmarket IPO. For the second time in a decade, Alitalia filed for bankruptcy protection after workers rejected the cuts needed to underpin a capitalisation plan. The airline has been a perennial problem for Italy’s government, which has ruled out a rescue. Alitalia will work out a restructuring plan while it is under special administration, from which it may emerge as a much smaller carrier. The fast and the furious Scene: A room in Los Angeles. It is 1am. The contract between 12,000 television and film script writers and Hollywood studios expired an hour ago. Clearly agitated, the writers have voted for strike action if no deal is forthcoming. White vans stand ready to take volunteers to picket lines. Suddenly, studio executives agree to most demands, including contributing more to the writers’ health plan [fade to jubilant union leaders].

In this article we will look at six key areas of mobile design you should pay special attention to, in order to create a positive user experience.   1. Ensure Content is Accessible When User Has No Internet Connection According to recent research by Google, 34% of users prefer an app over a mobile website when they have a poor internet connection. When they open an app, they expect to see lots of content there, regardless of whether they are connected to the internet or not. It’s vital to make key content accessible even when there is little or no data connection. If the content isn’t there, users will get frustrated and switch to a different app which does a better job of caching the information they want to see. Below is an example of how Apple Maps (left) and Google Maps (right) use their cache. Google Maps remembers the last location and holds an impressive amount of map detail in the cache, while Apple Maps shows you absolutely nothing. Not much good to be said about Apple Map’s offline experience.   2. Design For Each Native Mobile Platform A huge factor in making your app’s mobile UX shine is its UI. Today, most developers want to distribute their apps on multiple platforms. As you plan your app for multiple platforms, keep in mind that each platform has it’s own visual language—a distinct set of conventions and styles which should be followed. For example, there are global elements, such as a status bar and header, which appear on all the pages of your design. The difference between the two platforms seems quite insignificant—slightly different size, different title text alignment (on Android, the text is left aligned, whereas for iOS it’s centred) and fonts (Roboto on Android, San Francisco on iOS), but you shouldn’t change any of these settings if you want the app to feel native. The same goes for buttons and other controls—radio buttons, check boxes, fields, switches—all functional components should give a native feel. If you replicate elements from one platform to another, you risk compromising the user experience and conversion. The differences are small enough for you to progress with one design, but these subtle differences are essential for a native look. If you want to customise user interface elements in your app, you should customise carefully according to your branding—and not according to the conventions of a different platform.   3. Nothing in Your App Should Be a Dead-end Designing a UX is designing for flow and flow is, in most cases, about moving forward to accomplish a goal. You should avoid creating dead-end pages in your apps because dead-ends create confusion, block users on their way to the goal and lead to additional and unnecessary actions. Take an error-state screen from Spotify as an example. It simply doesn’t help users understand the context and doesn’t help them find the answer to the question: “What can I do about it?”   4. Don’t Replicate the Web Experience to Apps Users expect certain interaction patterns and interface elements in mobile apps. What we design on the web often feels awkward in a mobile app—not necessary because something is wrong, but because it’s simply different from what our users expect to see. One common example is using text with underlined links, which are strongly associated with web pages. Below is an example of sign-in form from TD Bank app for iOS. It definitely feels like they design for mobile web, not a mobile app: links are underlined, and there’s even a copyright notice in the UI. Apps use buttons, not links.   5. Don’t Interrupt Users with Requests For Rate the App No one really wants to be interrupted, much less for something useless while they’re in the middle of something important. Despite that, quite often apps interrupt users by prompting them to leave a review. The worst of all is when this dialogue interrupts users in the middle of the task or right after the app launched. You should avoid interrupting users to ask them to rate your app if they’ve only recently downloaded it, or only used it a few times. There’s nothing wrong in asking for a review, but remember that you want to give your users a great experience first. Wait until they prove to be repeat users and find a moment in your app that’s the least intrusive. Clear, a to-do app for iOS is a good example: it shows “Rate the app” dialogue after the user has cleared the remaining tasks from a list. This is a great moment in the app: users are feeling good for having just cleared their todo list and will be more likely to rate the app favourably.   6. Don’t Take Users to the Browser Keep users in-app at all times. If your app lacks a specific feature or content, try to use an in-app browser; but do not invoke the smartphone browser, or you will cause users to lose their track and not return to the app. This will increase abandonment and reduce conversion. When a user clicks on “Forgot Password?” link in the Facebook app the app prompts the user to launch the browser in order to perform this action.     By Nick Babich Fireart Studio is a design studio passionate about creating beautiful design for startups & leading brands.

ExxonMobil Speedpass+ App Breaks New Ground With Connected Car and Apple Watch First app to connect a car with mobile fuel payment in the United States First app to use Apple Watch to pay for gasoline at a majority of its U.S. network First app to allow consumers to apply for a credit card and use to save on fuel Loading media player... Download Windows Media Video Quicktime MPEG-4 Video May 04, 2017 03:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time SPRING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ExxonMobil announced today that it is rolling out several updates to its Speedpass+ mobile payment app, including use of the app with both Ford vehicles equipped with Ford SYNC®3 and the Apple Watch to purchase Synergy™ fuel and car washes at approximately 10,000 participating Exxon and Mobil stations across the United States. “With these updates to the Speedpass+ app, consumers now have even more options to pay for fuel while sitting in the comfort of their car – either using Ford SYNC 3 or the Apple Watch,” said Matt Bergeron, vice president of marketing for ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company. “This is more than a cashless payment app; it is a platform that earns and redeems Plenti loyalty points and manages receipts. With ExxonMobil’s heritage and commitment to innovation, the Speedpass+ app continues to bring new benefits to its users.” Introduced in early 2017, Ford’s AppLink technology in SYNC 3 allows Speedpass+ app users to use the in-vehicle touch screen and voice commands to easily authorize payment, making it the first fuel payment connected car application in the United States. Ford owners can also use the app to check how much fuel is left in the tank when they are away from their car, allowing them to better plan their day. In addition, Apple owners can now use the Speedpass+ app on their Apple Watch. With just a few clicks on the watch, consumers can select their pump and authorize payment. “We are always looking for ways to give Exxon and Mobil consumers a safe, clean, convenient, and quick way to fill up, and mobile payments are helping us to redefine the consumer shopping experience at the pump,” said Bergeron. ExxonMobil is introducing several other new updates to the Speedpass+ app, including the option to use the new Apply and Buy feature in the app to apply for an ExxonMobil Smart Card™, a private label credit card issued by Citibank, N.A. Once an application is approved, the card will be automatically added as a payment option within the app for the consumer to begin using. For a limited time, new accounts will receive a savings of 20 cents per gallon for the first two months, then six cents on every gallon after that. These Smart Card saving benefits can also be combined with points earned through the Plenti Loyalty Program. To earn Plenti points with each Speedpass+ transaction, consumers can simply link their Plenti account with their Speedpass+ account. And for consumers who don’t yet have a Plenti account, they can sign up from within the Speedpass+ app to begin earning points immediately. “We are focused on providing consumers with the best possible experience at our Exxon and Mobil stations. This includes making the process to earn and use Plenti points completely seamless,” said Kim Kemper, U.S. loyalty manager for ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company. “The Speedpass+ app makes earning and redeeming Plenti points as easy as possible.” All Speedpass+ app transactions are secure and use an encrypted token to protect the consumer’s data. Consumers can select their payment method from a number of options including major credit cards, debit cards, ExxonMobil Smart Cards, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. About ExxonMobil ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, uses technology and innovation to help meet the world’s growing energy needs.

Yes, even the richest company in the country, which rarely backs down from a fight with Washington, sometimes succumbs to government pressure. But unlike Carrier, an air conditioning manufacturer that recently scrapped plans to move its factory to Mexico, Apple’s response to Trump’s agenda may actually help create the kind of jobs that are growing, not disappearing. In an interview with CNBC, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the tech giant is launching a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing companies in the United States, announcing its first investment later this month. “By doing that we can be the ripple in the pond,” Cook said. “Those manufacturing jobs create jobs around them.” That’s true. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, for every $1 invested in manufacturing, $1.81 is injected back into the economy. “When you talk about why this matters, not only is it the billion investment, but the multiplier effect around it,” says Brian Raymond, director of innovation policy at NAM. The Future of Work Issie Lapowsky Trump’s Pressure on Tech Outsourcers Might Be Paying Off Issie Lapowsky Dear Donald Trump: Do Not Fear the Future of Work Still, that kind of fund isn’t precisely what President Trump had in mind when, on the campaign trail, he called for Apple to move its manufacturing operations to the US. “We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” he said at the time. But such a drastic upheaval of the global supply chain, experts argued, would only serve to bring low-skill, low-wage, easily automated jobs back to the US, even as it would cripple Apple’s growth. And that, of course, would have a damaging effect on the roughly 2 million jobs Apple already supports in the US, when you account for American suppliers, app developers, retail employees, and the 80,000 people who work on its Cupertino campus. Which is why this $1 billion fund transcends mere marketing. It’s good policy. Advanced manufacturing, which generally describes processes that employ next-generation technologies (think 3-D printing and such) either in the final product or in the production process, has created one million jobs since 2010, even as overall manufacturing employment has been in a two-decade free fall. “People who deny you can do anything with manufacturing jobs aren’t really looking at the evidence,” says Rob Atkinson, an economist and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, pointing to the opportunities that advanced manufacturing presents. That’s particularly true as everything from refrigerators to automobiles are now becoming internet-connected. “This is a long-term, future play,” Raymond says. “If it’s an investment around advanced manufacturing, integrating technology into products and shop floors, it should be beneficial across the board.” There’s one hitch. Even as Apple commits $1 billion to invest in the companies that are creating these jobs, manufacturers may have a tough time finding the high-skilled workers they need to fill them. A recent survey conducted by NAM found that while manufacturers see tremendous opportunity in advanced manufacturing, 40 percent say the skills gap is the chief barrier to taking advantage of that opportunity. “Manufacturing is now digital,” Raymond says. “It is a different set of skills.” That means that even as President Trump pressures Apple and others, Apple’s investment might just pressure President Trump into supporting workforce development programs that help build these skills. Apple could potentially use its investment as leverage in other ways as well. During the same CNBC interview, Cook went on to talk about the need for tax reform in the US. This comes at a time when the White House is considering giving companies like Apple a major tax holiday if they repatriate their overseas cash hoards. In that context, it’s clear that a $1 billion investment doesn’t come for free—even when, like Apple, you have $245 billion more. Go Back to Top.

The site, which premiered on Wednesday, says the company has created 80,000 U.S. jobs directly. In addition, the company says it has created 450,000 jobs at third-party suppliers and another 1.53 million jobs in the "App Store ecosystem." Overall, Apple says it has created more than 2 million jobs. Apple says the point of the site is to show how the company positively impacts the economy. But it might also help the company counter complaints that it doesn't pay enough taxes and thus, doesn't do enough to support the U.S. economy. Apple's math for supplier employees includes people who work at more than 9,000 suppliers in 38 states. Most of those people work in manufacturing, but the number also includes retail employees, construction workers, and financial services professionals. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Still, it can be difficult to directly attribute Apple's activities to a particular job at a third-party company. Absent Apple, it's technically possible those people would still have a job. To calculate its data, Apple cited a study by research firm Analysis Group, which analyzed the amount the company spent on goods and services in the U.S. last year. It then applied that information to employment data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The practice, while not an exact science, is a generally accepted method for determining a company's impact. Information on a company's spending is applied to multipliers for calculating both direct and indirect effects on jobs. For its developer "ecosystem" data, Apple cited Dr. Michael Mandel at the Progressive Policy Institute, whose research, the "US App Economy," provides insight into how both Apple's iOS and Google's (googl) Android operating systems impact the economy. The study looks at developer jobs created at third-party companies, online job postings for software developers, and the money people spend on mobile devices.

Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 US employees work on Wednesday, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a US$1 billion fund aimed at creating more US manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by US President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund in an interview on CNBC, but didn’t say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple’s initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its US$257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire “thousands of employees, thousands more in the future” in the US, although he didn’t specify how quickly that will happen. Apple’s US payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 US workers. Cook also said Apple is studying ways to help more people learn the programing skills to make apps. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple’s costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. “They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the US,” said technology analyst Rob Enderle.

Photo by igrec Apple creating $1 billion fund to promote U.S. manufacturing Apple may not be planning to build the iPhone or its other products in the U.S. any time soon, but Cook said that the company is planning to create a fund to support advanced manufacturing in the U.S. “We’re initially putting $1 billion in the fund,” the CEO said, adding that the company will announce the first investment from the fund in May. Cramer asked Cook about creating jobs: “You’re a huge company. What are you doing to create jobs?” Cook responded by saying that many people ask him if he thinks it is Apple’s job to create jobs, to which he replies by saying that a company should have values because it is a collection of people. “We give back through our work in the environment, in running the company on renewable energy. We give back in job creation,” Cook said. Cook said they have created 2 million jobs in the U.S. He mentioned this on Apple’s recent earnings call as well; however, during the interview, he was more forthcoming about where those jobs went, notes Macworld. He told Cramer that over 25,000 employees are in research and development, while 6,000 are working at Apple’s facility in Austin, Texas. Many employees are also working at Apple’s retail stores. If you are wondering about where the others are, Cook is also counting U.S. suppliers that make components like 3M adhesives and Corning glass, which are used in iPads and iPhones. Cook said that the company spent over $50 billion in the U.S. last year. Further, he told Cramer that they are not satisfied with just 2 million and will be hiring thousands more employees in the future. What’s in it for the developer community? Cook also talked about the developer community, saying that it is nearly 1.5 million people currently and includes people from really small businesses to large companies. “And they’re writing apps that change the world. And we’re giving them the platform,” Cook said, adding that developers have created an incredible store which lets them sell their product in 155 countries in the world. When asked if Apple would even put its own money forward to empower the next generation of developers or to train more people to code, Cook said, “We would and we will and you’ll be hearing more about that across the summer.” Further, the Apple CEO said they already invest in the developer community in several ways like by offering WWDC scholarships, opening a new developer center in India, etc. Cook also commented on Apple’s plans to double its services category by 2020 and pursue opportunities related to television and original programming.

Securities mentioned in this video BRK.A Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B Berkshire Hathaway Inc Related Links 2017 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting How We Craft Questions for Buffett Ahead of Meeting, Berkshire Looks Fairly Valued Jeremy Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. We're getting ready for the 2017 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. I'm here today with Gregg Warren, he is a senior stock analyst who covers Berkshire for Morningstar. He'll also be on a panel of analysts asking questions of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger at the meeting. We're going to talk about what some hot topics are going to be this year. Gregg, thanks for joining me. Gregg Warren: Thanks for having me. Glaser: So, it seems like going into every meeting there's one or two kind of big things that are on everybody's mind. Into 2017 what do you expect to be dominating the conversation? Warren: I think as we look forward to this year's meeting, there seems to be the more obvious things that have popped up. It's been a topic in past years and it really sort of revolves around Berkshire's relationship with 3G Capital. Back in 2013, it really kind of popped up when they bankrolled the purchase of Heinz with 3G Capital. 2015 it rose again when they were bankrolling the Tim Hortons combination with Burger King as well as the acquisition, or I should say the merger of Kraft with Heinz. So, I think, this year, we're going to see 3G sort of pop its head up again. The failed attempt on Kraft Heinz's as a part to buy Unilever earlier this year is really I think going to be a big topic of conversation. It's going to not only raise questions about that relationship and what Berkshire gets from it and what Berkshire shareholders should expect from it longer term, but I think it also sort of begs questions about Kraft Heinz. Have they sort of reached a pinnacle on how much margin improvement they can bring out of the business and do they need additional acquisitions to keep that story going. Glaser: It's not going to be the only topic. Wells Fargo has had a, let's call it an eventful year. You suspect that also will be something people are going to want to talk about. Warren: Yeah. I think Wells Fargo is sort of Buffett's favorite holding, and he has been petitioning the Fed for almost a year now to allow Berkshire to maintain more than a 10% stake. It gets more difficult once they get past that 10% threshold. They sort of have to act in a very passive manner. We get the sense that there may have been additional restrictions that are going to be put on Berkshire if they maintain that stake above that level. As you know, earlier this month Berkshire walked away from that pursuit of that sort of dispensation from the Fed. They've agreed to sell down the stake below 10%. The question longer term is, does this mean that Wells Fargo is going to be a perpetually declining stake within Berkshire's portfolio, because as Wells Fargo buys back stock every year, they are going to have to adjust down their portfolio or look to see whether or not they have to adjust down their holdings to get below that threshold. Glaser: If Wells Fargo maybe will take a diminished stake, Apple has been taking a larger stake. What do you think says about Berkshire? Warren: Yeah. I think, Apple--and even if you go back a few years to sort of IBM--I think they've raised some serious questions about the size of Berkshire's portfolio and whether or not they're somewhat handicapped now where they can only buy the largest of the large caps. Because if you think about it, for a company like Apple, they bought a $7 billion stake. That seems enormous. But Apple's market cap is $700 billion-plus. So, it really only amounted to about 1% of the company's outstanding shares. So, it's not as likely to, say, move the shares overall than if they were to try to take a $7 billion in a much smaller firm. So, I think that this raises some questions about the challenges that the investment portfolio has and more so what Todd and Ted are going to have longer term as they look to sort of populate the portfolio with meaningful enough positions to be impactful but at the same time also tapping into companies that may be able to grow at a faster rate than say your mega-caps. Glaser: Outside of those names though they've been buying stakes in airlines. What kind of questions do you think are going to come up around these kinds of the investments? Warren: Yeah, the airlines kind of caught us off guard a little bit. Buffett's never been a big fan and suddenly they were piling into four different airlines within the past six months. And it just seems counterintuitive. I know that there's talk about the consolidation of the industry. They are a little bit more rational now. But it begs sort of the question is, are there comparisons here--and I know a lot of investors are worried sort of voice these--but when they bought BNSF nearly a decade ago, they went out and bought a handful of railroads beforehand before they finally bought up all of BNSF. So, there is some hope here that they buy one of the airlines on some investors' parts. But my big concern with the airlines is, they are really sort of pegged to commodity prices, to oil prices, fuel prices overall. With your standard railroad, not only do they have sort of the track right away sort of empowering a wide economic moat, there's few of the railroad domestically and even within North America when you count the Canadian railroads. But from a pricing perspective, they have contracts in place that will move up and down the charges relative to where fuel prices go. Airlines, fuel prices go up, you can only raise ticket prices if everybody else raises ticket prices and vice versa. When oil prices fall significantly, if you wait too long, your competitors are going to undercut you by dropping prices on tickets overall. It's very, very sort of competitive in that realm. So, we're kind of curious to see if questions get asked along those lines. Glaser: Gregg, it sounds like it's going to be a pretty eventful meeting then? Warren: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We think it's going to be pretty eventful this year. There's already a line of different topics that have come up within the past few months that are likely to make the meeting more interesting. And we also think that in the next couple of weeks you could see some more things breaking. Glaser: Gregg, thanks for joining me. Warren: Thanks for having me. Glaser: For Morningstar, I'm Jeremy Glaser. Thanks for watching.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Offers New Tools for iOS Application Developers By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MAY 04 2017 Mobile app developers hoping to gain a little more insight into how users discover their apps are in for some good news. Apple announced yesterday that it has updated its App Analytics tool to provide developers with exactly that. The latest version of the tool will offer information such as what users were searching for when they discovered the apps, where they were on the iTunes app store, and where they previously had been on the Web. The service will also include new information, such as metrics on source types, so that developers can analyze which referring apps and Web sites are the most effective at driving users to their products. That should help developers aiming to optimize their marketing campaigns. More Love for Developers The App Analytics tool made its debut two years ago as part of the Apple Developer Program to help developers measure user engagement, optimize marketing campaigns, and monetize their iOS apps. Developers have also been using App Analytics to gain insight into how frequently their apps crash on different versions of the iOS operating system, filter groups of users based on the demographics captured in their Apple ID profiles, and measure the number of sessions, active devices, and retention of users. This week’s upgrade features four new data sources: App Store Browse, App Store Search, App Referrer and Web Referrer. The new information will help developers determine if new customers found their apps on Featured, Categories, or Top Charts listings in the App Store or by searching on specific keywords. The new tools are likely to be particularly helpful for smaller developers trying to squeeze the most out of modest marketing budgets. Apple has been showing its smaller iOS developers much more love recently, with a revamped version of its developer Web site that offers more videos, reference documents, and features such as the ability to respond directly to customer comments. App Store Driving Revenue The new features arrive at a crucial time for Apple and its app store. On Tuesday, the company reported that revenues for the store were up 40 percent year-over-year, setting a new quarterly record. Apple’s “services” category, which includes the App Store, helped generate around $7 billion over the last quarter, up from about $6 billion over the same period last year. Part of that is being driven by the company’s ability to monetize customers of the App Store. Premium and in-app purchases reached $40 per device in 2016, up from $35 per device the previous year. The strong performance of services in general and the App Store in particular is surely welcome news for Apple, which has been grappling with the challenge of delivering continued sales growth as sales of two of its key products, the iPhone and iPad, have begun to flag.

The Birth of Payment Service Venmo Next Article > BlackBerry To Launch KEYone Android Phone at End of May By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: APRIL 27 2017 The latest Android smartphone from BlackBerry, the KEYone, is set to hit the market in the U.S. and Canada on May 31, according to device manufacturer TCL. Like the classic BlackBerry devices, the KEYone will feature a physical keyboard below the 4.5-inch front display. However, rather than running on BlackBerry's own operating system, the KEYone is built on Android 7.1 Nougat. Pre-ordering will be available in Canada first, while buyers in the U.S. can pre-register now to receive updates and offers ahead of the KEYone's release. An unlocked version of the phone will be priced starting at $549 in the U.S. In 2015, BlackBerry released the Priv, its first Android smartphone, as part of its shift away from its proprietary operating system. 'Smart' Keyboard with Shortcuts "Anyone who is an Android loyalist and values the mobile security and productivity that BlackBerry software brings will love this smartphone," BlackBerry's general manager of mobility solutions Alex Thurber said in a statement released today. The BlackBerry KEYone will feature an aluminum frame and a touch display made of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The company said the "smart" physical keyboard will offer contextual auto-correction and next-word prediction capabilities, as well as up to 52 customizable shortcuts that can provide users with one-key access to apps and contacts. The phone also comes with a personalized learning engine that "gets to know the way you type with on screen flick typing," BlackBerry said. First Product of New Licensing Strategy Unveiled in February at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the KEYone is the first smartphone to come out under a new brand- and device-licensing strategy announced by BlackBerry in September. That strategy marks BlackBerry's "first significant step toward leading as a software company" rather than as a hardware development company, chief operating officer Ralph Pini wrote in a blog post last year. "This is what the future looks like for our business, and it is the right move as we progress towards profitability," Pini noted. "This will enable our resources to focus all efforts on providing state-of-the-art security software for devices and the enterprise of things, as well as work on other critical areas of the company." Based in China, TCL Communication Technology Holdings announced its plans to develop mobile devices for BlackBerry and other companies in January at the CES 2017 in Las Vegas. TCL said its first smartphone for BlackBerry would focus on three key features: security, productivity and reliability. Other features of the KEYone include a 3505 mAh battery, which Thurber said is "the largest ever in a BlackBerry device," a combination of Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 and Adreno 506 GPU processors, and BlackBerry's DTEK security app for "constant security monitoring." It also comes with a 12MP rear camera and an 8MP front camera. Image credit: BlackBerry.

Imagination Technologies said Thursday it launched a “dispute resolution procedure" with Apple after the companies were unable to resolve a licensing disagreement. In April, Apple ended its contract with Imagination Technologies, which supplied graphics-related components. The British firm supplied Apple with its PowerVR graphics processing units (GPUs), which were integrated in every iPhone. Imagination receives royalties from every sale of an Apple gadget that sports its designs, including the iPhone and iPad. Read: Qualcomm Wants To Stop Apple From Importing iPhones Into US, Report Says Imagination said Thursday it failed to make satisfactory progress with Apple on an alternative commercial arrangement for the current license and royalty agreement. "Imagination has, therefore, commenced the dispute resolution procedure under the license agreement with a view to reaching an agreement through a more structured process," the firm said. Imagination Technologies said Apple would no longer use Imagination’s processing designs in 15 months to two years time, according to Reuters. Apple is Imagination Technologies’ biggest customer, making up about half of its revenue. Apple notified the British company it was developing its own graphics processors for iOS devices last month, causing the firm’s shares to drop. However, Imagination Technologies said last month it doubted Apple could go on without violating its patents. “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information,” Imagination Technologies said in a statement last month. “This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it.” Read: Apple Vs. Qualcomm: Apple Ceases Royalty Payments Amid Lawsuits, Qualcomm Stock Price Plummets The company added it believes it “would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights. Accordingly, Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions.” Imagination Technologies also said Thursday it will be selling its MIPS embedded processor technology and mobile connectivity Ensigma units. Apple Cutting Its Need Of Suppliers For Products Apple recently has been looking to get rid of its dependence on suppliers. The company reportedly is developing its own power management chips, cutting the need to use chips from Dialog Semiconductor. Karsten Iltgen, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe, said Apple could have its own power chips ready by 2019’s iPhone generations, adding the iPhone seller is working on facilities in the U.S. and Germany. Engineers from Dialog have been switching over to Apple, the report added. Dialog Semiconductor saw its stock plunge by 20 percent in Frankfurt after the news. Apple is also designing its own smartphone processors, which will cut its dependence on Qualcomm or other chip suppliers. Apple is currently in a legal battle with Qualcomm after hitting the company with lawsuits. Qualcomm countersued last month, saying the iPhone’s success would not have been possible without the chip supplier’s technologies.

We’re hearing it is also available in Chile, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and presumably other countries.] Back in March, an iPhone 6 with 32GB of storage in gold became available with select Asian carriers while a space gray 32GB iPhone 6 showed up on Amazon’s Indian website. Today we’re seeing Spanish retailer Media Markt also start to offer the space gray 32GB iPhone 6 as a budget option. Apple originally only offered the iPhone 6, which is now discontinued in the United States, at 16, 64, and 128GB tiers. However, AT&T is selling a limited amount of the 32GB iPhone 6, marketing it as a new device for $345 to be used with its pre-paid GoPhone service. AirPods Taiwan Mobile is still selling the special 32GB variant of the iPhone 6 as of this writing as is Amazon via its Indian site. As we reported earlier, Apple’s official iPhone 6 model never offered a 32GB option. The latest 32GB iPhone 6 is being sold by Spanish retailer Media Markt for €469 or about $502. In comparison Apple sells the iPhone 6s in Spain for €659 or $721. In the US you can find the iPhone 6 reconditioned starting from about $299. Media Markt doesn’t share the official iPhone model number that it is selling, but includes an internal retail article number. It’s hard to tell if these units are refurbished or if Apple is actually producing a new model to be sold via third-parties in Spain. There doesn’t seem to be any mention of refurbished condition by Media Markt. For what it’s worth, the retailer states the iPhone 6 includes a 2-year warranty and a 14-day return policy. The LTE bands that Media Markt shares in the specifications for the 32GB iPhone 6 match those that Apple included on the iPhone 6 model A1549.

The world’s most valuable company, which makes most of its products in China, will help “advanced manufacturing jobs” in the United States, the Apple CEO told Jim Cramer on CNBC’s “Mad Money” Wednesday. Apple has been criticized by President Trump for manufacturing its products outside the United States. During his campaign, Trump called on the Silicon Valley tech giant to make its “damn computers” in this country. After Trump became president, he said he talked to Cook about Apple opening U.S. manufacturing plants, and that he promised him tax incentives to do so. What Cook is offering instead is that Apple will announce its first manufacturing-related investment in a yet-to-be-named company later this month. “By doing that, we can be the ripple in the pond,” Cook told CNBC. “Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them.” Cook has said that Apple makes its products in China because that country has “skill” that comes from its focus on manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing is defined by different people in different ways, but in general it means the use of new technology to improve the manufacturing process. Apple’s move comes amid a rush by companies to respond to Trump’s constant call to bring manufacturing jobs to this country — some companies have announced new, or sometimes almost new, jobs alongside the president in recent months. Apple also launched a new website that highlights how many jobs it has contributed to the United States, putting in one place its regular talking points about its economic benefit to this country. It says it is “responsible” for 2 million jobs in all 50 states.     Photo: Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at a product launch event on March 21, 2016, at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.

(Quartz/Mike Murphy) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession "America First" May 04, 2017 Out where the buffalo roam, on the plains of the Badlands, near the border with Canada, four Apple employees spend their days working for the wealthiest company in the US. It’s probably not exactly all home, home on the range. But it may be close. And while Apple’s tiny cadre of workers in North Dakota is the fewest it employs in any US state, it does mean that the company has employees in every single state. Apple unveiled a new website Wednesday (May 3) listing where all of its more than 77,000 US employees are based, as well as describing the 2 million jobs it believes it’s created for the US economy, through developers creating programs for its app stores, and companies supplying parts for its products. CEO Tim Cook also said on CNBC that Apple plans to invest an additional $1 billion into bringing manufacturing jobs to the US—something that will likely be welcome news to president Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the maker of the most popular gadget of all time for not manufacturing it on home soil. It’s possible that Apple is making a push into employing more Americans in an effort to convince Trump, and the majority-Republican congress, to pass tax reform that would allow Apple to repatriate the hundreds of billions it holds abroad. As Quartz’s Tim Fernholz recently reported, Apple hoards much of the foreign income it earns overseas, because if it were to bring that money back to the US, it would face billions in taxes. Speaking on CNBC, Cook said that the $1 billion Apple will invest in the US is borrowed money, insinuating that to keep up investing like this, it would really need to bring its foreign income back to the US. “We are in a good position, but an unusual one. Our good position is we can borrow,” Cook said. “And so to invest in the United States, we have to borrow. This doesn’t make sense on a broad basis, and so I think the administration you saw that they’re really getting this, and want to bring this back. And I hope that that comes to pass.” But for the current four employees in North Dakota, the nature of their employment is not quite as politically charged. The four are what Apple calls “at-home advisors” for its AppleCare extended warranty and tech support service. They are employees who work at home and field calls from Apple customers with their questions on their products, whether that’s setting up a new iPhone or figuring out a software bug on an iMac. And these employees are probably closer to any Apple customers in North Dakota than any Apple store: The closest one to North Dakota’s largest city, Fargo (which happens to sit on its eastern border), is over 230 miles away in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota. Here’s a breakdown of where all of Apple’s employees are based.

Jaelynn Castillo/Unsplash Reached the end of your mobile contract? Ready to upgrade? You've got more choice than ever when it comes to picking a new smartphone. But that also means that sifting through the specs and makes and models can be overwhelming. We're here to simplify it for you. To make this advice as universal as possible, we've stopped short of recommending particular phones, but you should be able to use the guidelines below to make an informed choice about whatever handsets are currently on the market. iOS versus Android For some, the software platform that their new phone runs on is the be-all and end-all of their phone choice; for others, it barely matters. So what are the main differences between iOS and Android? These platforms are actually more similar than ever, as they've been borrowing features from each other for years. Most of your favorite apps, from Facebook to Spotify, will run just fine on both. And they offer the same fundamental features to let you do everything you would want on a modern-day smartphone. That said, Android remains the more customizable mobile operating system. If you want to, you can (for example) change the default SMS app or the default browser; you can also revamp all the icons and widgets to create a truly personalized interface. Apps can also hook into deeper parts of the phone, which means they can perform extra tasks. So some Android apps let you record calls you make—iPhones just don't let apps dig that deep into the system. Apple iOS iOS is more polished but more restrictive than Android. Apple For better or worse, Apple's iOS is more limiting in what it lets apps and users do on iPhones. Its fans would say that makes for a smoother experience, while its detractors would say it's too restrictive. For instance, you can install Outlook and Gmail on an iPhone, but when you tap to email one of your contacts, the app that actually opens will always be Apple Mail. iPhones are also designed to work primarily with other Apple gear, like MacBooks and the Apple Watch. However, you can still easily sync your phone with iTunes on Windows or use it without a computer at all. To choose between Android and iPhone, you also must think about the other apps and platforms you use. Despite some of the debates you might read online, Android and iOS are pretty much neck-and-neck in terms of performance and features. Each has its own feel and way of working though. So if you're already on one platform or the other, try grabbing a friend's phone for ten minutes to see what the other side looks like. Stay or go? Unless you're only just old enough to be getting your first phone, picking between Android and iOS is less about comparing the two and more about considering whether it's worth the effort to switch. It's no wonder Apple and Google want to lock users into their apps and services as tightly as possible. If you're heavily invested in the Google ecosystem—Gmail, Google Drive, Google Photos, and so on—then switching between Android and iOS is pretty straightforward, whichever direction you're going in, because all of Google's apps are available on both platforms. You just install the Google apps on your new phone and away you go. However, if you've already spent a long time on the Apple side of the fence, then moving over to Android can be a real headache—you need to extract yourself from iMessage, for instance, and none of the movies or shows you've bought on iTunes will work on Android (to watch them, you'll need to use iTunes on a computer, an iPad, or an Apple TV). Google Pixel The Pixel is a flagship Android phone developed and marketed by Google. Google To be clear, it's not impossible to switch from iPhone to Android, but it can be difficult if you aren't already using a lot of Google services on your Apple device. It largely depends how tightly tied you are into Apple's various services, such as iCloud and Apple Mail, as you don't get these apps on Android. The one major Apple app you do get on Google's platform is Apple Music. For a lot of people upgrading from an existing phone, the easiest decision is to just stick to what you know. The process will be quicker, and both iOS and Android let you set up a new phone from an old one, which means you can transfer a lot of your stuff over to your new handset very simply. That said, we'd also recommend checking out what the other side can offer, in case some new feature or function catches your eye, or you just prefer the interface. It might be worth your while to switch to an iPhone if you've just bought a MacBook and an Apple TV, or to switch to Android if you notice that you're mostly using Google apps on your iPhone. What smartphone specs mean Smartphone specifications are broadly similar to computer specs: The processor controls how fast the phone can "think," the RAM (Random Access Memory) determines how much the phone can think about at once, and the storage space is how much room it provides for all your apps, music, games, and other files. On top of that, you of course have the screen size and resolution. These affect the sharpness of images and text on screen, as well as how easy the phone is to hold in one hand. Options for the small-handed are dwindling in number, as the trend seems to be for bigger and bigger screens pushing phones closer to tablet territory. However, unless you're going to the very low-budget end of the market, or the ultra-premium high-end, smartphone specs don't matter too much—much less than they do on your laptop. Any modern-day phone can run Facebook and Instagram, and you don't need to splash out on the very latest hardware unless you want the top-end games and intensive apps like video editors to run at top speed. Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung's Galaxy phones sit at the premium end of the Android market. Samsung Other details to look out for are waterproofing and dust protection, and whether the phone accepts a memory card for expanding the on-board storage (some Android handsets do but this isn't available on iPhones). Another perk to keep an eye out for is wireless charging: A lot of phones now offer this feature for extra convenience. One of the most important specs for any smartphone buyer is the quality of the camera, which is usually listed in terms of megapixels (the size of the pictures) and aperture size or f-number (how much light the sensor lets in). More megapixels and a lower f-number usually means better pictures, but many factors combine to determine the quality of a smartphone camera. When weighing your camera decision, you should also check out professional reviews, user reviews, and sample shots online. Finally, battery life is another important consideration. Phone battery size is measured in mAh or milliampere hours, with a higher number meaning more juice. But of course many other factors, like the screen size and resolution, will affect how quickly this runs down. Again, check out the reviews you can find online and take the manufacturer's quoted battery life with a pinch of salt. Picking the right price The final consideration, and perhaps the most important for many of us, is price. One quick way of narrowing down your choices for a new phone is to just set your budget and see what's available in your price range. Android phones have a lot more price points than iPhones do. In addition to their expensive flagship phones, most of the major Android manufacturers also offer decent, mid-range versions for those on a tighter budget or with less demanding needs. That said, Apple does provide a few options beside the latest iPhone: They usually put the previous year's iPhone on sale, and has recently been offering the iPhone SE as a smaller, cheaper option for buyers. For the most part, phones that cost just a few hundred dollars will serve you just as well as those that push closer to a thousand dollars, but you might have to sacrifice some screen resolution, camera quality, or app loading speed along the way. For the phones on your shortlist, check out a few professional online reviews to gauge whether or not you're getting the right value for your money. OnePlus 3T Chinese firm OnePlus has made a name for itself in lower-priced Android handsets. OnePlus Don't forget the refurbed or second-hand option either. Sure, you're getting a handset that might be a little bit worn, but these devices will usually work just as well as the brand-new ones, and the savings can be substantial. Make sure you buy from a reputable source and look for extras like warranties for your refurbed gear. Older phones are an option here too—when new handsets arrive, the previous generation drops in price, even though they're still very capable handsets. Shop around for flagship phones from the last year or 18 months, and you might be surprised to see what you can pick up on a budget. Timing Last but not least, you should also consider the time when you plan to buy. Otherwise, your shiny new handset could be replaced within a few weeks. Apple usually launches new iPhones in September, and Google's Pixels follow soon after. Most other manufacturers refresh their phones around March, though this can vary. So when you've got your eye on a particular phone, check when it launched. If it's coming up for its one-year anniversary, you might be better off waiting for the next version. Of course, once you've decided on your dream phone, it'll need a great case to go with it.

Taking rumors at face value, talented 3D artists and CAD addicts conceptualize what Apple’s next handset might look like. More often than not their work is off the mark, but some of the concepts we’ve seen thus far are plausible and give us nice food for thought. We asked our resident video editor Andrew O’Hara to create a short video summarizing some of the conceptual iPhone 8 renderings we’ve featured thus far here on iDownloadBlog. Without further ado, watch our video roundup of iPhone 8 concepts and mockups.

On a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts and investors, Apple CEO Tim Cook has attributed what he believes to be “a pause” in iPhone purchases to the rumor-mill and leaks that have been proliferating earlier than usual this year. “We’re seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones,” he said. How do you like the conceptual artworks and 3D models highlighted in Andrew’s video? Which is your favorite one, and why? Which one will we see, if any, come this fall?

Tech News | 04 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (0) Tim Cook Touts Apple’s American Jobs, Promises More by Josh Centers When Michael Cohen and I were listening to Apple’s Q2 conference call, my ears perked up when I heard Apple CEO Tim Cook talk about how Apple had created 2 million jobs across all 50 U.S. states (see “Apple’s Q2 2017 Financial Results Show Slight Growth,” 2 May 2017). That statement turned out to be the kick-off of a much larger campaign. Cook repeated that 2 million figure again during an interview with Jim “Mad Money” Cramer, and he went on at length about Apple’s U.S.-based stores and suppliers. Cook said that Apple was putting its money where its figurative mouth is: in a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing in the United States. Apple will announce the first investment later this month. Why is Apple doing this? President Trump campaigned on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States, and often chose Apple as a target of his ire for offshoring much of its manufacturing to China. At the same time, Trump has spoken favorably of helping companies repatriate overseas money back to the United States, a cause Cook has championed (for background on Apple’s tax situation, see “Apple Grilled Over Tax Practices,” 24 May 2013). Cramer immediately drew the connection: You know, when you do that, do you ever look at the government as perhaps saying, “Okay, look, Cook is putting $1 billion of his company to it. Let’s get in,” you know, President Trump’s saying, “We’ve gotta give him a repatriation. Who knows what he’ll do with all that money over there. We’ve gotta give ‘em the tax break.” Would you work closely with the president to get some of these things done so that you can do more job creation? Cook did not deny that this advanced manufacturing fund might be a negotiation tactic with the Trump administration, saying: “I think that repatriation — actually, I think comprehensive tax reform is the, is so important to this economy.” In fact, Cook even said that the $1 billion comes from Apple’s money in the United States, and that it will have to borrow to get it. Cook later said: You know, again, I think with each administration in every country in the world, there are things you disagree and things you agree, and you look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don’t. If you don’t show up, I think that’s the worst scenario because then you’re quiet and this doesn’t do your cause any good or your point of view any good. In addition to the advanced manufacturing fund, Apple has published a new Web site with an elaborate breakdown of jobs Apple creates in the United States, including a state-by-state listing of jobs and apps based in each state. Does this mean that Apple will start making more of its products in the United States? Doubtful. The main thing Apple manufactures in the United States is the Mac Pro, which is a high-cost, low-volume product, which has plenty of its own issues (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). Chinese manufacturing offers numerous advantages: cheaper wages, more skilled workers, and suppliers that are often literally down the street from the factory. But perhaps most important are China’s lax regulations, as documented in this New York Times article from 2012: Apple executives say that going overseas, at this point, is their only option. One former executive described how the company relied upon a Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves. Apple had redesigned the iPhone’s screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the plant near midnight. A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company’s dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day. “The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,” the executive said. “There’s no American plant that can match that.” Apple could never get away with that in the United States. Regulators and labor unions wouldn’t stand for it. And even with China’s massive manufacturing capacity, Apple often struggles to keep up with demand for its products (ask anyone trying to buy a pair of AirPods.) However, there could be a strategic advantage to Apple moving at least some of its manufacturing to the United States. Due to a payment dispute, Apple supplier Qualcomm is attempting to block Apple’s import of iPhones into the United States. Needless to say, if Qualcomm were to succeed, it would be devastating to Apple’s business. But if at least some iPhones were manufactured in the United States, Qualcomm’s threat wouldn’t be nearly as dire. Furthermore, an American-made iPhone would be produced by a labor force that is, by law, guaranteed worker rights, fair pay, and safety precautions, not to mention high environmental standards. But those requirements don’t come cheap, so an American-made iPhone would likely cost more than today’s $650 starting price. An article in Marketplace places the total cost at $2000, but that’s with the unrealistic assumption that every part would be made in the United States. Would you be willing to pay more for an iPhone that was made in America, or at least in a country with stronger labor and environmental protections? And if so, how much more would you be willing to pay? Let us know in the comments or in our weekend Twitter poll.   Create a Squarespace website to launch your next idea.

Qualcomm plans to ask the U.S. International Trade Commission to ban imports of iPhones, which are built in Asia, according to a Bloomberg Technology report. The news report cited an unnamed person familiar with Qualcomm's strategy.  A Qualcomm spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the news report. The USITC has the power to ban imports into the U.S. for patent infringement, and the agency is frequently used by patent holders as an alternative or addition to slow-moving patent infringement lawsuits in U.S. courts. Qualcomm's request for an import ban could come before Apple plans to release its iPhone 8 later this year. Last month, Qualcomm claimed Apple is using its market power to avoid paying full licensing fees. Qualcomm's claims were in response to an Apple lawsuit filed against the chipmaker in January that claims Qualcomm has charged "exorbitant" licensing fees for its cellular technology. Apple cut off some licensing payments to Qualcomm last month, and the chipmaker revised its revenue projections based on lower payments from Apple.

Imagination shares collapsed when Apple first revealed it would phase out its use of the firm's technology, sending stock prices down more than 60 per cent in the first week of April. Its London-listed shares were up 2.8 per cent today after releasing its trading update.  Apple has used Imagination's technology in its products from the time of the iPod Apple has used Imagination's technology in its products from the time of the iPod, and it receives royalties from every sale of an Apple device containing its designs, including the iPhone and iPad.  The potential loss of Apple, which accounts for about half of the British firm's revenue, sent its shares down 70 percent on the day, and the stock has barely recovered. It has also sent concerns through other Apple suppliers.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Accounting watchdog to investigate KPMG over checks of...

Share this article Share Imagination said in April that it doubted Apple could go it alone without violating its patents, and analysts said legal battles could lie ahead. But Apple believes that it can't rely on a third-party company for such a crucial part of its iOS devices. The company is concerned that Apple's plans to restore Imagination's intellectual property with its own technology within the next two year risks violating the British company's patents. The move would also mean Imagination would not be eligible for Apple's royalty payments and licence fees, which brought in £60.7 million in revenues in the year to April 30. That accounted for half of the £120 million made in group revenue from continuing operations for the last financial year.   Imagination said in a trading update that while it had proposed 'alternative' commercial arrangements with Apple, the two companies failed to reach a deal. It said: 'Imagination has been unable to make satisfactory progress with Apple to date regarding alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement. 'Imagination has therefore commenced the dispute resolution procedure under the licence agreement with a view to reaching an agreement through a more structured process.' The loss of its biggest customer came as a bitter blow last month and follows on from a tumultuous 2016. Imagination posted a £61.5 million loss last year - the biggest in its history - and also embarked on a cost-cutting drive which saw 200 jobs axed.  Imagination said it will instead be concentrating its resources on its PowerVR business and 'strengthening Imagination's balance sheet'. Oliver Knott, an equity analyst at N+1 Singer, said Imagination was not in a strong selling position. He said: 'The sale of MIPS and Ensigma is a logical step to free up available resources for the group to concentrate on its primary asset, PowerVR. 'Both assets up for sale are loss-making assets and Imagination is not selling from a position of strength.' He added that an acceptable resolution with Apple is 'far from certain', which puts Imagination Technologies in a 'very difficult position'. He said: 'It is unclear how the dispute resolution process will move the conversation on, but it is a necessary step before the group can take any further action. 'There is no guarantee the group will commence full legal action, which would be very costly.'   Read more: Imagination Technologies Group PLC Share Price | This is Money Share or comment on this article e-mail MARKETS CLOSE: Solid corporate earnings and an assured...

Elizabeth Gurdus | @elizabethgurdus 15 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Exclusive: Apple just promised to give US manufacturing a $1 billion boost    Wednesday, 3 May 2017 | 6:59 PM ET | 12:09 On Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced plans for a $1 billion fund to expand advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, but the company is no stranger to job creation. Apple has already created 2 million jobs in the U.S., from engineers to app developers to suppliers, Cook told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer. (Read the full interview here.) Directly and indirectly, Apple has employed workers in all 50 states, boasting 80,000 company workers in areas like research and development, customer support, financial services and Apple's 271 U.S. stores. U.S.-based suppliers such as Corning, which provides glass for the iPhone and iPad, and 3M, which Apple calls on for adhesive materials, credit the company for 450,000 jobs. Additionally, 1,530,000 jobs can be attributed to what Apple calls "the App Store ecosystem," a network of designers and developers for the ever-growing roster of iPhone apps. "These are folks from really small businesses, a party of one, to larger companies, and they're writing apps that change the world," Cook said Wednesday. On its website, Apple cites a number of statistics, including a 1,500 percent increase in U.S. workers since 1998. The company also lists key investment projects in California, Texas, Arizona, North Carolina and Oregon to build new facilities and hire more employees. "We actually spent over $50 billion last year in this country. I mean, this is incredible," Cook told Cramer. "We're not satisfied with just 2 million. And so you can bet we're going to be hiring thousands of employees in the future."

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Tim Cook will spend 0.39% of Apple’s cash to keep Donald Trump happy Chris Mills BGR News May 3, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share In a CNBC interview this evening, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple will start a $1 billion fund to “promote advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States.” President Trump has repeatedly called out American companies that do a majority of their manufacturing overseas, including Apple. Previously, Apple has hinted that it might explore the possibility of building iPhones in the US. Trump has explored the possibility of a border adjustment tax, which would heavily penalize companies that manufacture overseas, but no concrete plans have been put forward. Don't Miss: This sophisticated phishing scam has the entire internet terrified In the interview with CNBC, Cook didn’t explicitly talk about Trump’s policies or indicate that they were the impetus for Apple’s announcement. Cook seemed to promote Apple’s new fund as part of the company’s broader corporate social responsibility, saying “A lot of people ask me, ‘Do you think it’s a company’s job to create jobs?’ and my response is [that] a company should have values because a company is a collection of people. And people should have values, so by extension, a company should. And one of the things you do is give back.” Details of the fund have not been specified, but Cook did say that Apple has already “talked to a company that we’re going to invest in.” That first investment is expected to be made in May. A $1 billion investment is a relative drop in the pond for Apple, which yesterday revealed that its cash holdings, mostly offshore, now total more than $250 billion. Cook did not specify if the investment fund will come from Apple’s cash stock, or debt financing, which it commonly uses for dividends and share buyback programs.

Aside from a very public falling out with Qualcomm which has been escalated to trade authorities, the Imagination complications has been bubbling along in the background, with the saga set to escalate to a full-on quarrel in the courts in the near future. Apple doesn’t seem to be scared about fighting multiple legal battles simultaneously. “Imagination has been unable to make satisfactory progress with Apple to date regarding alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement,” the company said in a statement. “Imagination has therefore commenced the dispute resolution procedure under the licence agreement with a view to reaching an agreement through a more structured process.” Apple took the bold step in April of declaring the end of the relationship between the two firms, believing it was capable of developing its own graphic chips in-house. Imagination contests where the iLeader has the ability to do this without infringing its patents, and has seemingly spent the last couple of weeks attempting to negotiate an alternative commercial arrangement based on licensing fees. Considering Imagination are now escalating the issue, the talks clearly didn’t go to plan. Imagination has been working with Apple for a considerable time now, designing graphics chipsets for the iPhone and iPad. Losing customers is just a part of life, but considering Apple represents roughly half of Imagination revenues, this is one you would want to keep hold of. In fairness, Imagination does have a point. Developing technologies of this nature takes years. Even if Apple thinks it is a bad idea to be so heavily reliant on a third-party for such a critical part of the product, surely it would take longer than the 15 months to develop the expertise and technology? While this could be a disturbing turn for the business, Imagination is not sitting on its hands. In the same statement, it declared its PowerVR business was going from strength to strength, targeting on of the most lucrative sectors in the connected economy. Growth in the VR world is an encouraging sign, however you do feel there needs to be some positive news to come out of the Apple conflict. It’s a company which accounts for a substantial amount of annual revenues, and following the initial departure announcement, shares in Imagination slumped 60%, showing little sign of recovery since. It could quickly develop into a life of death situation.

This comes as an additional hit from Qualcomm, after the San Diego-based enterprise launched a lawsuit against Apple, claiming that it made its chips look inferior to Intel's. Up until the iPhone 7, Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modems for all Apple phones. The latest devices though started using a mixture of Intel and Qualcomm hardware. The Free Trade Commission also jumped in with a lawsuit, claiming that Qualcomm extorts smartphone manufacturers to pay royalties even if they are using other companies components. The International Trade Commission has the power to stop any import of non-US goods, but it's unlikely that it will go this far in this case. And in all cases the proceedings will be long enough not to put the next iPhone launch in jeopardy .

Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Which lightweight notebook is best? by Joe Roberts 15 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: The MacBook Air has been the go-to lightweight laptop of choice for many, but Microsoft has a new challenger in the form of the Surface Book. Here's how the two compare. Microsoft recently launched the new Windows 10 S alongside a shiny new device on which to show off the software: The Surface Laptop. At around the £1000 mark, this isn't a cheap laptop by any means, but there's no denying the sleek design and effort that's seemingly gone into making this a premium product. Of course, the price point and attention to aesthetics puts it in direct competition with Apple's dated MacBook Air. So, we thought we'd see how the two machines compare. Here's all you need to know: Related: Surface Laptop vs Surface Book Surface Laptop MacBook Air Processors Dual-core 7th-gen Core i5 or i7 Dual-core 5th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 Graphics Intel HD 620 or 640 Intel HD Graphics 6000 Memory 4-16GB 8GB Storage 128-512GB SSD 128GB-512GB SSD Weight 1.25kg 1.35kg Thickness 14.5mm 17mm Screen 13.5-inch 2256x1504-pixel touch screen 13.3-inch 1440x900-pixel display Ports USB 3.0, 3.5mm audio, mini DisplayPort MagSafe 2, 2x USB 3, 3.5mm audio, Thunderbolt 2, SDXC card Price £979-2149 £949-1099 Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air – Design Microsoft might just be able to give Apple a run for its money with this latest device. There's no screws, joins, or hinges visible on the new laptop, and the company has also managed to pack the speakers below the keyboard, in order to hide the speaker grilles and project audio directly at you from behind the keys. Of course, you also won't be seeing much in the way of screws, hinges, or speaker grilles on Apple's famously sleek laptop, unless you closely inspect the base of the thing. The important thing to note is that both these laptops look great and convey the attention to detail both companies have put into their respective designs. One area where Microsoft has Apple beat, however, is portability. The Surface Laptop measures 9.9mm at the front and 14.47mm at the back, thanks to its tapered design. Meanwhile, the MacBook Air comes in at 17mm, though at its edges it reduces to about 3mm. It's also slightly heavier than the Surface Laptop. Microsoft's machine weighs 1.25kg, while the Air weighs 1.35kg. These are small differences, but there's no doubt Microsoft's machine is the more slight and portable offering. Related: Surface Laptop vs Chromebook Pixel Microsoft has provided several colour options for its laptop: Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gold. Apple's machine comes in either Space Grey or Silver. Both feature backlit keys but Microsoft has taken the liberty of outfitting the Surface Laptop with Alcantara fabric on the area surrounding the keys. There's no fuzzy keyboard tray on the MacBook Air, but whether that's an issue will come down to your personal preferences. We're yet to test out the keyboard mechanism on the Surface Laptop, but we found the keys on the Air to have a crisp, clean and light action, despite being slightly shallow. On the sides of the Surface Laptop you'll find a USB port, Surface power connector, and a mini DisplayPort – no USB Type-C connection this time, unfortunately. Things are slightly more comprehensive on the Air. Apple's provided a MagSafe 2 power port, 2x USB 3 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, Thunderbolt 2 port, and SDXC card slot. Related: Windows 10 S laptops Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air – Hardware and Performance With the Surface Laptop, Microsoft has provided a 7th-generation Intel Core processor (i5 and i7 options available), along with either 4GB or 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, which can be expanded if you pay more. It's a decent set of specs, though not quite top-end stuff. It should provide speedy performance, especially if you opt for the 8GB RAM version with any of the processor upgrades. All the various configurations can be slightly confusing, so here's a table of all the different setups available and how much they cost: Microsoft Surface Laptop: Option 1 Option 2 Option 3 Option 4 Processor Intel Core i5 Intel Core i5 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i7 Storage 128GB SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD 512GB SSD RAM 4GB 8GB 8GB 16GB Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Colour Platinum Burgundy, Platinum, Cobalt Blue, Graphite Gold Platinum Platinum Price £979 / $999 £1,249 / $1,299 £1,549 / $1,599 £2,149 / $2,199 So, how does the MacBook Air stack up? Well, you'll also find a dual-core Intel Core i5 or i7 depending on whether you want to upgrade. However the processors used in this laptop are 5th generation Intel chips, as opposed to the much newer 7th generation processors used in the Surface Laptop. This means they're both less powerful and less efficient, and this becomes very obvious when you push the MacBook Air hard: the fans fire up to a cacophony and it gets very hot. The Air comes equipped with 8GB of RAM as standard (topping the standard 4GB on the Surface Laptop) and flash storage of either 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB depending on how much you want to pay. What with 8GB of RAM and flash storage, you should be getting a nice, fluid user experience on the MacBook Air, especially since the hardware was designed with MacOS in mind. Related: 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016) review Aside from newer processors, The Surface Laptop also has an edge on the MacBook with its stylus support. You'll be able to use Microsoft's Surface Pen to doodle on your display and make notes if you feel inclined. And that display isn't too bad either. Microsoft has provided a 13.5-inch, 3.4 million-pixel LCD touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio and 2256 x 1504 resolution. That resolution on a 13-inch display should make for a sharp image, and we're expecting it to be vibrant, too. Apple, for its part, has kitted out the MacBook Air with a 13.3-inch LED-backlit screen featuring a 1440 x 900 resolution. That's a significantly lower resolution than the Surface Laptop, and in this day and age is well below par, both in terms of resolution and colour coverage. It's the weakest part of the MacBook Air and puts it well behind not just the Surface Laptop, but also most other premium Windows 10 machines. Related: Best laptops On the software side, you'll find Microsoft's new Windows 10 S running the show on the Surface Laptop. What is it? You can read our full guide to the new operating system here, but essentially, it's Microsoft's attempt to provide a stripped-down version of the WIndows 10 OS. With a simplified, redesigned home screen, the new version of Windows only allows users to install applications from the Windows Store. It's a more locked down version of the full OS that's designed to give teachers and administrators more control over the system. Naturally, the MacBook Air runs Apple's own macOS Sierra. The latest version of the operating system, macOS Sierra, is a great iteration of the software, with a load of new features such as iCloud Desktop synchronisation, Siri integration, Apple Pay support built into Safari, and a load of other neat touches that make the OS a pleasure to use. Related: WWDC 2017 Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air – Price and release date You can pre-order the Surface Laptop right now, with the device set to ship and hit stores on June 15. The basic configuration is priced at £979 in the UK and $999 in the US, while more expensive models will run you up to £2149 in the UK and $2199 in the states. Pre-order: Surface Laptop from £979 Apple's machine is ever so slightly more affordable. The MacBook Air starts at £949 in the UK and $999 in the US, but could run you as much as £1409 ($1549) if you want the top-spec version. Apple seems to have abandoned the Air entirely, so don't expect a new version to arrive any time soon. Surface Laptop or MacBook Pro, which is best?

Apple CEO Tim Cook promised that the company will hire “thousands of employees, thousands more in the future” in the U.S., although he didn’t specify how quickly that will happen.  (Marcio Jose Sanchez / The Associated Press)   By Michael Liedtke And Christopher S. RugaberThe Associated Press Thu., May 4, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO—Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion (U.S.) fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. Read more: Anticipation over 10th anniversary iPhone holds back Apple profits Article Continued Below Apple planning to release new-look iPhone this fall for 10th anniversary Apple ‘one of the only companies’ that can pull off augmented reality CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund in an interview on CNBC, but didn’t say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple’s initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire “thousands of employees, thousands more in the future” in the U.S., although he didn’t specify how quickly that will happen. Apple’s U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. Threats to Apple Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple’s costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. “They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.,” said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. “So if want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won’t be a good example.” Cook isn’t the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company’s hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. “There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States,” Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives “do not want to show up in a tweet.” Apple in the States Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report came after years of complaints about labour practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company’s major contractors in China, drew more attention to Apple’s reliance on overseas factories. Apple to also issues a separate “supplier responsibility” report reviewing the labour conditions in those facilities. The Wednesday report on U.S jobs is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple’s second biggest employment centre is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Apple’s decision to provide detailed information about the locations of its U.S. employees could help the company win support from lawmakers eager to protect jobs in their states, Enderle said. “It gives senators something to push back with, recognizing that Apple is a real risky company to target anyway because its products are so popular with people.” Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. App economy The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple’s iPhone “ecosystem.” That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps. Such “spillover” effects are widely recognized, although economists sometimes spar over their magnitude. But for a company to claim credit for all or most of the jobs in a particular industry is a stretch, Swonk said. The vast majority of app developers, for example, also produce apps for Android phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. The Public Policy Institute only found 1.7 million jobs in the entire “app economy” — and 1.35 million of those were associated with Android apps. Most of those overlap with the jobs linked to Apple.

New data from TrendForce shows that Apple is still number one among the top five tablet brands, however, as global tablet sales dropped 9.3% year-over-year. The report also believes Apple could have a positive quarter now with the newly released $329 9.7-inch iPad and a rumored high-end replacement coming soon. Sony A6500 Going into the second quarter, Wang expects the 9.7-inch model to contribute greatly to the iPad shipments. At the same time, Apple will be releasing a new 10.5-inch iPad device. These two products together will push iPad shipments into the positive territory. TrendForce estimates that iPad shipments in the second quarter will go up by more than 15% compared with the first quarter’s figure. Apple’s 13% year-over-year drop in iPad sales only briefly included a new product release. Year ago sales included a newly launched 12.9-inch iPad Pro and launch sales for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro compared to this year where flagship iPads have not been updated and the new entry is a cheaper model with fewer features. As for the rumored 10.5-inch iPad that’s expected to replace the 9.7-inch iPad Pro as the flagship model, rumors initially expected that model to be introduced as soon as this quarter, although expectations seem to have cooled with a release later this fall possible. Apple will be competing with 9.9 million iPads sold in the current year ago quarter if it expects to see year-over-year growth in shipments. Can the $329 iPad get Apple there without introducing a new flagship tablet is the question… Separately, IDC has released new data that claims global tablet shipments are declining because of a slow migration from slate tablets to detachable tablets. TrendForce’s data excludes 2-in-1 PCs.) IDC cites the original iPad in 2010 as creating the slate tablet market: “As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this,” said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. But points to consumers not upgrading or buying tablets as a current trend: “The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we’ve seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression.” Still, IDC believes the iPad Pro line can keep Apple competitive in the tablet space: This product line quickly elevated Apple to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment, and IDC believes Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a ‘mobile OS’ while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices.

Yes No Life Sciences VC & Funding Startups Mobile & Broadband Employment Analysis Insider Benefits Posted May. 4, 2017 at 11:23 a.m. Apple: We're responsible for nearly 35,000 jobs in NC Published: 2017-05-04 11:23:05 Updated: 2017-05-04 11:23:05 Post a comment Print this blog postE-mail blog post Apple On The Web Apple jobs report By WRAL TechWire Editor Tags: Employment, New jobs, Apple Research Triangle Park, N.C. — Apple declares in a new report that it is responsible for creating nearly 35,000 jobs across North Carolina. The tech giant maintains multiple operations in the state, including retail stores and a mammoth data facility west of Charlotte. The tech giant also said it is launching a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more jobs in the U.S. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products, according to The Associated Press. In releasing state-by-state jobs totals, Apple is running counter to many corporations, such as IBM, which won't even say how many employees they have in the U.S. IBM stopped disclosing numbers by country and states years ago, citing competitive reasons, although the company had come under much criticism for laying off American workers and offshoring jobs. Breaking down NC jobs In North Carolina, only 1,148 jobs come directly from Apple. The remaining 33,500 come from business derived through Apple, such as its app stores where entrepreneurs and companies sell a variety of goods and services. Even at nearly 35,000, however, North Carolina-linked Apple jobs still number fewer than the 36,786 direct Apple employees based in California. Apple also says it works with 173 suppliers of goods and services, including materials produced at seven manufacturing facilities. Among those is Greensboro-based wireless and semiconductor technology firm Qorvo, which helps Apple devices linked to WiFi networks. The report also sites several apps developed in North Carolina. Two of its retail stores are based in the Triangle - one in Raleigh at Crabtree Valley Mall, the other in Durham at Streets of Southpoint. Overall, Apple says it is responsible for 2 million jobs across the country, including 80,000 company employees. Another 450,000 jobs are linked to Apple suppliers. The remainder are "attributable to the App Store ecosystem," Apple noted. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, CEO Tim Cook told CNBC. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers.

News and Press Release Distribution, Since 1995 Deliver Your News to the World Sign In Create a Free Account Home News How We Work Compare Services FAQ All WebPost WebPost PPC WebRelease Targeted Media Wire Service Huawei Overtakes OPPO to Become the Number One Smartphone Company in China in 2017Q1, says IDC SINGAPORE – WEBWIRE – Thursday, May 4, 2017 According to International Data Corporation (IDC), 104.1 million smartphones were shipped to China in 2017Q1. This was a mere 1% year-on-year (YoY) growth, in part the result of high inventory from the previous quarter. 2017Q1 was also relatively quiet aside from a few product launches like Huaweis new P10, P10 Plus, and Honor V9. This, along with strong momentum for the Honor brand, helped Huawei reclaim the top position from OPPO. Despite a soft first quarter in China, the second quarter should pick up sequentially given not only JD.coms June promotions, but also activity around a number of new products like vivo with its Y53, Xiaomi with its Mi 6, Meizu with its E2, and Gionee with its M6S Plus, says Tay Xiaohan, Senior Market Analyst with IDC Asia/Pacifics Client Devices team. Apple has been seeing double-digit YoY declines for the fifth quarter in a row, but we believe that Chinese consumers are holding out for the launch of Apples 10-year anniversary iPhone at the end of the year, and this will help Apple to see a rebound in the China smartphone market, according to Tay. These are some key highlights in the China smartphone market in 2017Q1 and some points on what we can expect to see for the coming year:     The top five smartphone companies now dominate 70% of the market. We expect their share to continue to rise and to see more consolidation from the smaller companies in the coming year. We also do not expect to see any new smartphone companies entering the market that will be able to make a significant difference to the smartphone scene in China. Android ASPs continued to increase QoQ and YoY. This was largely due to the top Chinese smartphone companies Huawei, OPPO and vivo seeing an increase in their ASPs, as consumers seek to purchase their key flagship models. Consumers are also seeking to upgrade their smartphones to seek a better user experience, and these companies offer models that can meet their needs. Additionally, with key flagships by these Chinese companies having more upgraded specifications such as dual cameras and OLED screens, the price of smartphones has continued to increase. Huaweis Honor 8, OPPOs R9s and vivos X9 were the popular models from these companies in the quarter. Apart from the continued reliance in celebrity endorsers for these models, one other common factor these models share is the strength of the phones cameras which was clearly highlighted across all their advertisements. These models also had batteries with the capacity of around 3000 mAh, highlighting the importance of phones having a powerful camera and strong battery life. Smartphone companies will be focusing more on their offline retail expansion. Huawei has committed to opening more experience stores in key cities while OPPO will be opening more stores in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Xiaomi, who used to focus on its online channel, has targeted to open 1,000 Mi Home stores in the next 3 years across China. Having one star flagship model that is marketed successfully is sufficient to significantly propel a companys shipments in the right direction. This can be aptly exemplified in OPPOs key flagship R9s which comprised close to half of its overall shipments. In light of the foregoing, whilst the Chinese companies can continue to innovate and try to outshine one another in the coming year, they can also consider focusing their resources on one or two key models with clear key messages than to stretch themselves thin and try to diversify their portfolio, ends Tay.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson    Apple To Invest $1 Billion In American Manufacturing Ted Goodman 11:36 AM 05/04/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Apple is investing $1 billion into advanced manufacturing in the United States with plans to create thousands of new American jobs, its CEO said Wednesday. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook made the announcement to Jim Cramer on CNBC’s “Mad Money” Wednesday. “You’re the first person I’m telling,” Cook told Cramer, who was visibly surprised by the news. “Well, not the first person because we’ve talked to a company that we’re going to invest in already.” The decision to make a $1 billion investment in advanced manufacturing in the United States may be a part of an effort by Apple to “head off” any potential conflicts between the company and President Donald Trump, according to The Verge. “We’ve now created two million jobs in America. Two million,” Cook asserted to Cramer in an exclusive interview. He highlighted examples of where Apple invests in American companies, like the iPhone’s glass screen is purchased from Corning and its adhesives are purchased from 3M. “We’re not satisfied with just two million,” said Cook. “And so you can bet we’re going to be hiring thousands of employees in the future,” he continued. The president has made American job creation a priority in his first 100 days, focusing particularly on manufacturing. The president has publicly shamed Fortune 500 companies in the past, including Apple.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 29, 2013 When Cramer pointed out Wednesday that $1 billion is a sliver of the companies $256 billion, Cook said that the $1 billion can be a “ripple in the pond.” Cook asserted that if the company can create more manufacturing jobs with the initial investment, it could lead to an increase in jobs in surrounding industries, including the service sector. The first investment into the advanced manufacturing fund is set to take place sometime in May, according to Cook. Follow Ted on Twitter Send Tips to [email protected] .

Begin typing your search above and press return to search. Press Esc to cancel. Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Apps Best Browser For Adobe Flash Player For iOS And Android Devices By Donklephant. Published on May 4, 2017. 0 People use different Internet browsers on their mobile phones. So, when it comes to content that requires Adobe Flash Player, users may have varied experiences. This should be possible, particularly on iOS and Android devices. Here are the best browsers that you can use to play Adobe Flash Player content. Best Browsers for iOS Devices Photon – Although Apple has not supported Flash content to play video, games, and some other content on the Web, you can use Photon as an alternative. You can do this by connecting your iOS device to a remote computer that is running Flash. You can then stream the desktop of that computer through the Safari browser that is built into the Apple device. CloudBrowse – CloudBrowse is an app that would be able to stream a remote desktop session towards your iPhone. Although it would require the users to subscribe in order to get unlimited sessions, there are 10-minute sessions offered for free that anyone can use. However, despite the fast browsing experience, it has a spotty output. Puffin – It might not be a good experience for Apple device users to choose this option, but Puffin is not only intended for playing streaming content. In fact, Puffin provides fast browsing experience, that if you happen to be tired of using Safari. iSwifter Games Browser – If you love games or interactive applications directly from your browser, then iSwifter Games Browser should be a great addition to your device. It basically allows you to view Flash websites, videos, and other interactive Flash apps, such as MMORPGs, social media games, and casual Flash games. Best Browsers for Android Devices Boat Browser – In terms of speed, Boat Browser is the kind of Internet browser you need. This is because you can fully customize this browser, as the locations of the buttons are readily accessible. Likewise, you can install some add-ons to convert your browser into a more powerful one. Puffin Web Browser – Aside from giving you Adobe Flash content support, Puffin Web Browser also gives you fast browsing experience. This browser also includes a smart virtual mouse technology bridging the gap between your desktop and mobile experience. The trackpad can also be activated via the virtual mouse, making it similar to the trackpad being used on your laptop computers. xScope Browser – xScope Browser developers claim that it is designed for Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean, and even on more powerful devices. In fact, it has been reported that it offers the best performance, particularly on Galaxy S III, Galaxy Nexus, One X, and Nexus 7. Moreover, the SwipeNav technology of this browser should enable users to navigate back and forth, with the easy swiping from right to left of the edges of the screen. Photon Browser – If you are still looking for a fast browser that doesn’t compromise your Flash Player plugin support and video streaming experience, then you can use Photon Flash Player. The good thing is that users can use this browser for Adobe Flash Player because it requires no downloads or installations of any Flash plugin.

According to a “person familiar with the company’s strategy,” Qualcomm is planning to petition the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to block all shipments of the iPhone, which is built in China, from entering the country. The ITC is a U.S. Federal Agency in Washington that has the authority to block imports of goods into the U.S. and can act more quickly than the federal district courts in which the two companies are currently battling it out. The legal dispute between the two companies began earlier this year when Apple accused Qualcomm of withholding $1 billion in royalty payments and accused the company of abusing its position in the chip industry and not delivering on its promises to inexpensively license “standard essential patents.” Qualcomm fired back in April with a lawsuit in which it accused Apple of breaching its contract, which led to Apple deciding last week that it would withhold further royalty payments until the matter is settled. Perhaps ironically, during Apple’s quarterly earnings call earlier this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook was also asked to comment on Apple’s latest position in the Qualcomm dispute, and specifically whether Apple was concerned about the risk of Qualcomm taking action such as “getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world.” Cook responded with a cautious optimism about Apple’s position on the matter, saying, “I don’t believe that anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there’s plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.” Cook went on to explain why Apple is pursing this and why it feels the need to take this stand with Qualcomm, nothing that “The reason that we’re pursuing this is that Qualcomm is trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value, [but] it’s one small part of what an iPhone is,” and, “we don’t think that’s right, and we’re taking a principled stand on it, and we strongly believe we’re in the right. I’m sure they strongly believe that they are, and that’s what courts are for, and we’ll let it go at that.” Comments « Apple posts new web page emphasizing U.S. job creation Daily Deal: The Steam Powered Star Wars Gamer Bundle » Related Stories Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Apple seeds fifth beta of tvOS 10.2.1 to registered developers Apple posts new web page emphasizing U.S. job creation Qualcomm petitioning ITC to ban import of iPhones into the U.S. Report: Inventec involved in producing Apple’s Siri-enabled home hub speaker Hulu with Live TV app lands on App Store Notes from Apple’s Q2 2017 earnings call Apple Q2 2017: $52.9B revenue, 50.8M iPhones + 8.9M iPads sold Logitech reveals Slim Folio Bluetooth keyboard case for fifth-generation iPad Several major apps ditching Apple Watch support?

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat The tablet market has now been in decline for 10 quarters in a row. Q1 2017 saw an 8.5 percent year-over-year decline: 36.2 million units shipped worldwide, compared to 39.6 million units in the same quarter last year. The very thin silver lining is that the decline was slightly less than in the previous five quarters, which all saw double-digit drops. The estimates come from IDC, which counts both slate (declining since 2014) and detachable (slightly up) form factors, meaning tablets with keyboards are included. The top two tablet makers maintained their positions: Apple was first and Samsung second. The top five vendors accounted for 60.2 percent of the market, up from 57.3 percent last year, and nobody managed to ship more than 10 million units: Apple saw its shipment numbers fall once again and lost 1.3 percentage points in market share as a result. After 13 consecutive quarters of year-over-year shipment declines, the company is back to the numbers it saw in its first year of iPad sales. Samsung shipped the same number of tablets as a year ago, which meant it ended up gaining 1.3 percentage points. In this quarter, the South Korean gained on its American competitor, which was the case for most of 2016. Huawei shipped 700,000 more units this quarter, catapulting it into third place, thanks to a 2.3 percentage point jump, ahead of Amazon and Lenovo. It was the only company among the top five to experience growth this past quarter. Amazon and Lenovo were both flat in shipments, which meant they increased their market share slightly. Nevertheless, all three of these companies are still a far cry from the market leaders. “As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this,” IDC program president Ryan Reith said in a statement. “The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we’ve seen before. However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression.”

(NASDAQ: AAPL)’s second-quarter results. Shares initially dropped 5 percent after Apple reported earnings. According to Argus analyst Jim Kelleher, Apple dip buyers made the right move. Step Aside, 7 Kelleher sees huge demand for the iPhone 8 and says the iPhone 7’s shelf-life is already winding down. He said the iPhone 7 does not have as much staying power as previous models for two reasons. First, the iPhone 7 did not represent a new form factor compared to the previous model. Second, by choosing to skip the typical “S” model iteration this year and jump straight to the iPhone 8, the iPhone 7 will seem obsolete much faster than previous models. All things considered, Kelleher believes the iPhone 8 will be a major hit for Apple. High Expectations For 8 “We expect iPhone 8 to be a big global success,” Kelleher explained. “Regardless of the reception for the new phone, iPhone unit sales are growing large and also steadier and with less seasonality thanks to the giant installed base.” While investors wait for the iPhone 8, their attention should be focused on Apple’s valuation. Kelleher points out that Apple has historically traded at a 14-percent discount to the overall market’s earnings multiple but is currently trading at a 15-percent discount, making it a compelling valuation play. In addition, Apple’s massive cash hoard and aggressive capital return program limits the stock’s potential downside. Argus maintains an Outperform rating on Apple and a $160 price target on the stock.

Apple is such a powerful company that, for third-party suppliers, it's hard not to become reliant on the cash that it pays you. Engadget adds: But when Apple says that it's done, choosing to move whatever technology you provide in house, the results can be really painful. Imagination Technologies is one such supplier, famously designing the iPhone's PowerVR graphics as well as pushing MIPS, a rival to ARM. But back in March, Imagination publicly announced that Apple was ditching it in favor of its own graphics silicon. Now, Imagination has revealed that it's going to take Apple to dispute resolution, maintaining that the iPhone maker used Imagination's IP without permission. It's the second chipmaker in recent months who believes Apple isn't playing fair, with Qualcomm counter-suing Apple in its own licensing dispute. Secondly, Imagination is going to have to sell off MIPS and Ensigma, two parts of its business that aren't as profitable as PowerVR. Gamers with long memories will remember that MIPS designed the CPUs that lurked inside the PlayStation, PS2 and Nintendo 64. apple business money ← You may like to read: → Over 200 Android Apps Are Currently Using Ultrasonic Beacons To Track Users Apple Cites 'Courage' As Reason To Remove 3.5mm Headphone Jack China Threatens To Cut Sales of iPhones and US Cars if 'Naive' Trump Pursues Trade War Ask Slashdot: What Is the 'Special Appeal' of Apple Products?

Though for the record, they were more interested in the know-how and engineer which where working on the Rampage GPU ("3DFx Spectre" cards) due to programmable pixel shaders being all the rage, and retained them to work on GeForce FX (speculation backthen that probably the pun in the name was intended... ) So in theory, they could have moved into the field much faster than ATI / AMD. (But back at the Rampage / GeForce FX era, there where some area were TBR was problamatic : e.g. some transparency (i.e.: simple alpha-blend, back then) couldn't be handled in a single pass easily. So probably they decided not to bother. Given that modern games work with tons of subsequent passes (transparent materials cause diffraction/distortion in a separate pass of a pixel-shader), I would suspect that it's not that much a problem anymore).

Not to mention they will get a bug up their ass about enforcing one part of the contract one week, then the next week they couldn't care less about that, but this other minor inconsequential provision is now crucial, and they'll club you over the head with the threat of ripping up the contract if you don't comply. They'll claim they have "statistics" or some such that shows you aren't in line with other similar companies, but you'll never actually get to SEE the evidence, because it's confidential or some other nonsense. You'll be assigned an Apple minder, who will typically be completely unavailable if you try calling/emailing them, but will miraculously find time in their busy schedule if it's to call/email you about something you're not doing right. Some of their mid to upper level managers will even be verbally abusive if you have face to face meetings, and they'll even ambush you. They'll invite you to Cupertino, saying it's a friendly little junket to tour the Apple facilities, except you'll be ushered into a conference room where a number of execs will accuse you of a bunch of things. Essentially, Apple's M.O. is to just threaten to rip up your contract if you don't drop trou, bend over, and take a good ass pounding whenever they feel like giving you one.

See related  Apple to make all its products from recycled materials Beoplay P2: B&O's portable pebble speaker Best smartphones of 2017: All the latest handsets However, the rise of premium hardware and software packages from Apple and Google meant the company had to respond to stay competitive, which it did with its range of high-end Surface tablets and notebooks, featuring top-quality materials and high-performing processors.  The latest addition to the line-up, the Surface Laptop, enters into a straight fight between Apple's high-end MacBook Pro and Google's web-driven Chromebook range.  Microsoft's latest baby adopts several features from others in the range, says The Guardian, including a "13.5in touchscreen" and a fabric-covered palm rest.   It weighs 2.76lbs (1.25kg), around 0.26lbs (0.12kg) lighter than Apple's 13ins MacBook Pro, and boasts a thickness of just 0.57ins, adds the newspaper, although it's only available with Microsoft's own charging socket and not a more universal USB-C port.  Users can expect a 14.5-hour battery life, reports Trusted Reviews, as well as a 1TB solid-state storage drive on top-spec models. Entry-level Surface Laptops get a seventh-generation Intel i5 processor and 128GB of solid-state storage.  It also comes with a copy of Window 10 S, a streamlined version of Microsoft's operating system, which TechRadar says "only accepts app installs downloaded from the Windows Store".  Buyers can upgrade to a Windows 10 Pro for free during 2017, but users will have to pay a £49 fee if they wait until next year onwards. Microsoft begins shipping the Surface Laptop in June, with prices starting from £979, £470 cheaper than Apple's entry-level 13ins MacBook Pro. Chromebooks, however, start from as little as £300.

The company announced a policy change last month, saying commission rates for apps and in-app content would drop from seven to just 2.5 percent. The firm now clarifies that the change applies only to affiliate links used inside apps, not the ones on websites like iDB. “Please note that only in-app commissions have changed,” reads the message from iTunes Affiliate Support. Here are the correct new app commission levels, according to Apple itself: iOS apps commissions: 7 percent In-app iOS commissions: 2.5 percent Mac apps commissions: 7 percent In-app macOS commissions: 2.5 percent Several website owners and bloggers linking to App Store and Mac App Store apps have reported that the seven percent commission for apps has in fact remained unchanged. MacGamerHQ provides the following screenshots of Apple’s email to iTunes Affiliate members. Apple originally said about two weeks ago that beginning May 1, 2017 commissions for all apps and in-app content would get slashed from seven percent to just 2.5 percent globally. The poor wording of the message has been blamed for the misunderstanding. “We will also continue to pay affiliate commissions on Apple Music memberships so there are many ways to earn commissions with the program,” Apple said two weeks ago. Aside from slashing commissions for in-app content, items like music, movies, books and TV subscriptions remain subjected to the seven percent commission rate across all markets. iTunes Affiliate Program lets website owners and developers claim a small percentage of the proceeds from linked apps and content. The company’s Affiliate Resources webpage offers a Getting Started guide on becoming an affiliate partner, an updated Program Overview section providing information on the commission raters, reporting, creating links and other useful resources.

(GuruFocus) Holding shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to prove beneficial for plenty of exchange-traded funds, particularly consumer discretionary ETFs. The consumer discretionary sector, the fourth-largest sector weight in the S&P 500, is one of this year's best-performing sectors and Amazon is a big reason. XLY: From A To Z With Amazon Really. Amazon is a BIG reason why discretionary ETFs are surging. For example, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY) is up 10.6 percent year-to-date and is one of the best-performing members of the sector SPDR suite. Thank Amazon for that. Only Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) are bigger members of the S&P 500 than Amazon. The Amazon effect on cap-weighted consumer discretionary ETFs, such as XLY, is pronounced. XLY allocates 14.6 percent of its weight to Amazon, about double the weight assigned to the ETF's second-largest holding, Dow component Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD). Even with Amazon reaching new highs on almost daily basis, some analysts are skeptical regarding XLY's fortunes. In a recent research piece, AltaVista Research tagged XLY with an underweight rating. AltaVista's underweight rating implies below average appreciation potential and a sector trading at lofty valuations and/or is home to stocks with slack fundamentals. In the case of XLY and the consumer discretionary sector, it is likely valuation prompting AltaVista's uninspiring underweight rating on XLY. The research firm's 2017 price-to-earnings estimates on XLY is about 10 percent above the estimate on the S&P 500. Some data points indicate investors are enthusiastic about XLY and continue using the ETF as a proxy for Amazon's high-priced shares. The ETF's shares outstanding tally is up 15 percent over the past year, but short interest in the fund is just 7 percent, according to AltaVista data. XLY's short interest of 7 percent is one of the lowest among the sector SPDR ETFs. The Political Influence There are other factors to consider with XLY, and some stem from Capitol Hill. “This sector may be especially sensitive to plans for tax reform: individual tax cuts would boost consumers but a border adjustment tax could hit retailers — who make up almost half of the index--particularly hard,” said AltaVista. In any event, shares remain richly valued in our view, both in their own right and compared to the S&P 500, and the sector is trading at the top of its P/E range of the last few year.” Related Links: 5 Donald Trump-Inspired Leveraged ETFs Make Their Debut A Short-Term Way To Play The Turnaround In European Banks Posted-In: Analyst Color Sector ETFs Short Ideas Commodities Politics Top Stories Markets Analyst Ratings Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

The reason behind the sale is to strengthen its balance sheet, according to a statement issued by the company. MIPS designs a number of different embedded processors, which are found in routers, modems, wearables and IoT devices. Ensigma offers IP licensing for connectivity in mobile computing, unmanned systems and IoT. The chip company wanted to make alternative commercial arrangements for its current licence and royalty agreement. However, Imagination also announced that it had commenced a dispute resolution procedure with Apple under its licence agreement in order to reach an agreement through a more structured process. Imagination said that it would focus on its PowerVR graphic technologies business used in smartphones, tablets, TVs and consoles. Apple announced last month that it would drop the Hertfordshire-based company as producer of chips for its iPhones. That business from Apple accounted for up to half of the company's revenues. Imagination tech has been in iPhones, iPads and iPods since 2008. Apple is going to produce its own chips for devices and is expected to cease using Imagination's products in the next two years. When the news was first released last month Imagination's stock dropped by 60-70%. Apple originally considered buying Imagination in 2016, but didn't make an offer at the time and it was later revealed that it had been recruiting talent away from the company including the COO and various engineers. This was thought to be because the company wanted to construct an in-house graphics team, which it has done as Apple will soon begin to produce its own chips.

In March, Apple replaced the iOS 10.3 update with iOS 10.3.1. The iOS 10.3.1 update delivers bug fixes and an important security patch but its also brought some annoying problems to many iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners. iOS 10.3.1 problems emerged on release day and complaints about the update’s performance have grown louder as we’ve moved into May. With those complaints in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about these iOS 10.3.1 problems. This roundup takes a look at the current state of problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It looks at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users are running into a number of frustrating iOS 10.3.1 problems. The list includes the usual suspects. iOS 10.3.1 users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID problems, 3D Touch issues, Hey Siri problems, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. We’re also hearing about UI lag on older devices, random reboots, issues with sound, and various problems with the App Store including broken downloads. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter continue to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please.

(iOS 10.3.1) Known issues? — Jan Hambsch (@TeachHam) April 23, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. Where to Find Feedback As we push further away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into this ongoing iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also put together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update at the one month milestone. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5, and the iPad. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about the current version of iOS 10. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can’t Downgrade We’ve got some bad news for those of you dealing with iOS 10.3.1 problems. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1 which means you can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to improve your device’s performance. This is a permanent change and it means those of you who are experiencing iOS 10.3.1 problems are on your own. Apple’s next iOS update is probably a few weeks away. Those of you who haven’t made the move to iOS 10.3.1 yet should take note. Once you upgrade, there’s no going back to whatever version of iOS you’re on. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. It’ll help you prepare for next time. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. We’re currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 and we suspect an official release is close. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. You might even try the iOS 10.3.2 beta on your device. You can always drop back down to the iOS 10.3.1 update if you decide to install the beta on your phone. iOS 10.3.2 Release & Time: 5 Things to Expect & 3 Not To iOS 10.3.2 Release Date   1 / 8 Apple rarely announces iOS release dates ahead of time so its silence regarding the iOS 10.3.2 release date hasn't been surprising.  It's difficult to predict an exact release date but the beta and Apple's tendencies can help us narrow it down a bit for you.  Apple is currently on iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 which means the company has released updates to beta testers. That's a lot for a small maintenance update like iOS 10.3.2 and it probably means we're getting close to the official roll out. The last maintenance update to go through a beta, iOS 10.2.1, saw four beta releases before it was released to the public.  Apple also tends to release new iOS software on Monday. This isn't guaranteed but the company's been pretty consistent lately.  At this point we'd be shocked if we made it out of May without a release. Look for iOS 10.3.2 to land on one of the four remaining Mondays (May 8th, May 15th, May 22nd, May 29th) in the month.    1 / 8 16 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/16/2017 B Reply Me too 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. 04/09/2017 Brooke Reply Updated to 10.3.1 last night and less than 12 hours later my 6 plus has died. Will not turn on and can get no response from it. 04/12/2017 Dot parnell Reply Since I downloaded 10.3 my Facebook does work – anyone know what I can do. 04/13/2017 W Stephen Wilson Reply The update destroyed my IMAP path functionality so I can no longer do email. 04/13/2017 Rosie Reply Ever since I purchase iPhone 7Plus I had nothing but problems. I uploaded the 10.3.1 on 4/11/2017 with the following problems: It’s stuck on the iCloud setup Delete email in Allmail and it creates a duplicate; therefore I have to delete the mail twice. Apple why don’t you hire some computer technology people that know what they’re doing. This will be costing you money and making you look inadequate to the world. 04/14/2017 David Pearcey Reply I tired to update but it messed up my iCloud authentication somehow. It goes into a password authorization loop and disabled my iMessage, FaceTime and Family services functions. The update actually failed during Verifying Update phase of the install. It didn’t install (probably a good thing), and after it failed I got the above mentioned issues. I called apple support and they couldn’t fix it.They upgraded my issue to the engineering department and I haven’t heard from them since. After waiting a couple of days I decided to try doing a full reset and restore on my iPad Air2 and it fixed the issue. I will not be installing 10.3.1 until I hear back from Apple. Very uncharacteristic instability coming from Apple these days :( 04/16/2017 Gourmetdrummer Reply iOS 10.3.1 slows down the search function in contacts if you have a large contact list. I tested this with less than 5,000 contacts and it worked fine, but when I loaded the full 12,000+ contacts it takes 3-4 minutes to pull up a searched contact. I then restored to my backup with the older software version and it worked fine. Is anyone else seeing this? 04/20/2017 Hee Reply I not sure is it whether is ios 10.3.1 problem or my package data problem. I can’t buff the video in instagram story and facebook video. IS that an issue about that? 04/24/2017 Billy Reply Another problem with 10.3.1 is that photos taken on an ipad cannot be uploaded directly from the ipad into other applications, such as ebay. You have to enlist the help of a desktop computer. 05/04/2017 Jason Reply Sad, my brother’s iPhone 6s home button is causing some issue. When pressed sometime it straight away goes to power off option (he is just tapping). Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Image: thanmano/Shutterstock Imagination Technologies is selling two of its three major businesses to shore up cash after Apple dropped a bombshell. UK chip manufacturer Imagination Technologies has opened a dispute with Apple over the use of its technology in the iPhone. Signs that an IP row was brewing came in recent weeks when claims emerged that Apple’s own chip designs might breach Imagination Technologies’ patents. ‘Imagination has been unable to make satisfactory progress with Apple to date regarding alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement’ – IMAGINATION TECHNOLOGIES The company derives more than half of its revenues from a licensing deal with Apple. News that Apple planned to end a contract with the manufacturer in 2019 to make its own design chips sent Imagination’s shares plunging 70pc. Imagination’s technology features in the iPhone and the iPad. Do not put all your eggs in the one Apple basket The crux of Imagination’s case is that it does not believe it is possible for Apple to design or make chips without using its technology in some shape or form. “Imagination has been unable to make satisfactory progress with Apple to date regarding alternative commercial arrangements for the current licence and royalty agreement,” the company said in a statement. “Imagination has therefore commenced the dispute resolution procedure under the licence agreement with a view to reaching an agreement through a more structured process. “Imagination has reserved all its rights in respect of Apple’s unauthorised use of Imagination’s confidential information and Imagination’s intellectual property rights.” To stay afloat, the chipmaker has announced that it intends to sell off its MIPS and Ensigma businesses. Instead, it will concentrate its resources on its PowerVR business and strengthen its balance sheet. “With continued investment, the group considers PowerVR to be well placed in mobile, automotive, digital TV/set-top boxes and the rapidly emerging AR/VR market, and having the potential to exploit investments for artificial intelligence in the medium term,” the company said. “Imagination will continue to make the appropriate investments in the PowerVR business.” iPhone special edition of Apple Product Red.
