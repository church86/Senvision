This year the companies have two phones that are competing in the market for dominance. The Google has the Pixel (and Pixel XL) while Apple has the iPhone 7 (and the iPhone 7 Plus). The iPhone 7 was launched before the Pixel, and it is an evolution of Apple's iPhone 6S. It is also the stepping stone to Apple's iPhone 8, which is expected to be "revolutionary" and not evolutionary. The Pixel, meanwhile, is Google's "first" phone and one of the biggest aims that Google has with it is to beat the iPhone. Well, Google almost succeeds. The Google Pixel is a good phone. Nay, it's a great phone and in many core areas is better than the iPhone 7. And yet there are three reasons that hold it back from beating the mighty iPhone. Maybe next year the Pixel will raise the bar and get its act together to beat the iPhone. But then the iPhone 8 too will be in a different league. But this year in 2017, it falls somewhat short, all because of three reasons. Also read: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review: The best iPhones Apple has made No waterproof body: This is kind of a big deal in a premium phone nowadays. And although people may think that a waterproof body is not something of a must have feature, take a look at it this way: It's like seatbelts in the cars. You don't know you need them until one day they save your life. The same is true for a waterproof phone. You don't realise you need it until one day accidentally you drop your phone in a bucket full of water. Also, a waterproof phone provides such incredible peace of mind. You can use it with wet hands and be a little careless about it in ways that truly make using the phone relaxing. No stereo speakers: This again is a big missing feature in Google Pixel. In fact, its speakers aren't all that good for a premium phone. The iPhone 7 on the other hand has fairly sweet sounding (for a phone) stereo speakers. Even otherwise the audio performance on the iPhone 7 is better, even if you are using an earphone or headphone. And this is despite the hassle that the iPhone 7 poses because of its lack of the 3.5mm jack. Exemplary Apple support: This is the biggest reason nowadays to buy an iPhone. If you are getting the latest iPhone, in this case that is the iPhone 7 Plus, you end up with a phone that you can, if you are little careful in the way you use the phone, end up using for 3 to 4 years despite any hassles. The phone won't slow down. You will continue getting the latest iOS updates. And if something goes wrong with your phone, you will most probably get an aftersales service that is better than the rest. We have seen it again and again that Apple supports an iPhone for 4 years. The Pixel, meanwhile, will be supported for 2 years and while Google is promising top aftersales support for the Pixel phones, we will need to see the company walk the talk on this aspect before we can see whether it matches the Apple support or not. Now, this is not to say that the Pixel is a phone that you should not buy. Far from it. In fact, we have argued that for a lot of consumers the Pixel and the Pixel XL are the best phones in the market. These two phones have the best camera every seen in a phone  and in many core areas, including the software, they edge out the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 7. But like everything else out there, these two phones are also not perfect.  Also read: Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus vs DSLR cam: You can't tell the difference For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Slow Jio 4G speed: Here's a method to increase Jio speed but why bother WhatsApp now rolls out video calling feature, for now in beta Jio 4G may remain free until March 2017: Report 32 lakh ATM cards hacked: Is your debit card safe and should you change PIN?

The Touch Bar, as you'll all recall, is Apple's new secondary touchscreen located at the top of the keyboard where the function key row is normally situated. The contents of the new OLED display change dynamically to provide app-specific controls, giving users yet another option for input. Is Apple's new Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro any better than reaching another inch and using a menu bar that could have been placed at the bottom of a normal touchscreen? Only time will tell. In the meantime, you don't need to spend between $1,800 and $4,300 to check out Apple's new Touch Bar. In fact, you can try it out right now with any Mac desktop or MacBook computer thanks to a nifty free app. DON'T MISS: 10 hidden iPhone gestures you probably don’t know about "But there are no touchscreen Macs," you said to yourself, "so how can I possibly test Apple's new Touch Bar on my MacBook?" Luckily, Apple has been known to make a device with a touchscreen now and then, and you'll be able to use one of those alongside your Mac computer to test out the Touch Bar. Developers Andreas Verhoeven and Robbert Klarenbeek have created a free app called Touch Bar Demo that let you use Apple's MacBook Pro Touch Bar on any Mac laptop. The software Touch Bar itself gets installed on an iPad that needs to be connected via USB to your MacBook or Mac desktop. It displays all of the Touch Bar's features alongside each app that has been updated with Touch Bar support, and it works just like the actual Touch Bar does on Apple's new 2016 MacBook Pro models. Here's a video of Touch Bar Demo in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZLx03OPpUU Installing the macOS portion of Touch Bar Demo is relatively straightforward as long as you're running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 build 16B2657, but the iPad portion of the solution isn't as simple as installing an app from the App Store. You'll need to use some developer tools to essentially assemble the app yourself and then install it on your iPad. You'll find all of the files and instructions you need on the Touch Bar Demo GitHub page.

November 7th, the first day of APPLE FEST. All we wanted to do was eat some "apple inspired dishes" (Question: do these dishes contain apples, or just take inspiration from them?) in the charmingly unwelcoming atmosphere of 1920 Commons. Even that was too much to ask. Only four hours after announcing APPLE FEST on its Facebook page, marking the first time Commons has been called "the apple of our eye", Penn Dining declared everyone's favorite dining hall closed due to a water main break. The break is likely responsible for the flooding on Spruce Street, but we don't know enough about civil engineering to be sure. Campus continues to fall apart in the days leading up to the election. If something has to go, we suppose Commons isn't such a bad thing to sacrifice. Let's just hope that whoever is elected will allow us to enjoy the rest of APPLE FEST in peace.

Then there is the Rich Kids app, an exclusive club where some of the 25,000 members pay £890 a month to post their self-obsessed pictures, in a bid to weed out fake heirs. It’s just been banned by Apple for violating its terms — to its narcissistic stars’ frustration. So just who are these obnoxious rich kids? Sarah Rainey holds her nose and takes a look.   Property tycoon who's rarely in the office  Emir Bahadir lases on an inflatable animal in a pool Turkish-born Emir Bahadir’s name translates literally to ‘Prince’ — and the 25-year-old certainly lives like one. Whether lounging in a pool in St Tropez (inset) or grinning on board his mahogany-panelled private jet (main picture), his 319,000 followers are regularly treated to glimpses of his gilded existence. Emir, who attended the £60,000-a-year American School in Switzerland, and studied business at New York University before moving to London, is heir to a generations-old Turkish property empire and owns a £2.8 million apartment in Manhattan. He is also co-founder of a property brokerage whose offerings include a £77 million premises on New York’s Fifth Avenue. A visit to his Instagram site, however, shows Emir is rarely in the office. He’s more likely to be found in a helicopter over Cannes, attending a gala in Miami or relaxing on a yacht surrounded by a gaggle of bikini-clad beauties.    Ferrari princess with 100 handbags Billionaire's daughter Julia Stakhiva, 24, drives a £200,000 Ferrari 488 Billionaire's daughter Julia Stakhiva, 24, was given her first Louis Vuitton handbag aged nine. Today, she has 100 designer bags as well as a £300,000 fur collection and clothes worth £1.6 million in her Mayfair home. Her lifestyle is funded by her Ukrainian parents, who made millions from their food empire. ‘Since the age of 16, I’ve been spending at least £17,000 a month on clothes,’ she says. ‘I don’t mix and match with designers: I will wear Balmain from top to toe.’ Her 66,000 Instagram followers can ogle photos of Julia clutching a £1,800 bottle of Armand de Brignac Brut Gold Julia, who has spent £180,000 on facial fillers, lip injections and teeth whitening, has a personal trainer and nutritionist. She flies to Moscow to have her hair cut — ‘I book the whole salon so it can be free when I arrive’ — and has five staff to promote her image. Since graduating from a £15,950-a-year business course at Regent’s University, Julia has become a reality TV star. She drives a £200,000 Ferrari 488 and her 66,000 Instagram followers can ogle photos of Julia clutching a £1,800 bottle of Armand de Brignac Brut Gold.    Splashing £15K a month on clothes Lana Scolaro, 21, loves the limelight and was educated at Mill Hill School in North London Whether draped across the bonnet of a gold Bentley or cavorting on a rooftop in a black bra, Lana Scolaro, 21, clearly loves the limelight. Born to an English mother and Italian father, Lana was educated at Mill Hill School in North London. She was offered a place at a design school in New York, but socialising proved to be more fun. Her upbringing was anything but ordinary: her father, who made millions as a mining entrepreneur, gave Lana and her sisters Stephy, 23, and Lydia, 15, everything they wanted. She travels by private jet, owns a £25,000 Hermes Birkin handbag and admits to spending £15,000 a month on clothes. She travels by private jet, owns a £25,000 Hermes Birkin handbag and admits to spending £15,000 a month on clothes Lana uploads pictures to her Instagram account several times a day, giving her 63,000 followers glimpses of her over-the- top party lifestyle. Recent images show her carrying her pet dog, Fifi, onto a private jet, posing in a racy pink bikini and sitting in the front row at a Dolce & Gabbana fashion show. She’s also uploaded an image of a blonde woman in just her underwear lying in a bath of dollar bills with the caption: ‘Where do you see yourself in a few years?’ When she’s not pouting up a storm, Lana has a fledgling jewellery line — LS Diamonds — which includes a black diamond bracelet decorated with a tiny silver gun, costing £795.

Daria, 23, employed four people for two months to apply the million crystals by hand. The car, a birthday present from her parents, cost £50,000 plus £35,000 to customise it. ‘I have a lot of jewellery — diamonds are a girl’s best friend,’ she said at the time. ‘I have them everywhere. I’d like to encrust everything in crystal.’ She has since turned her obsession into a career, customising fur and leather products for wealthy clients. She made headlines in 2014 after her Swarovski crystal-studded Mercedes C-class with the licence plate ‘BA11 BYY’ was spotted outside Harrods Daria, who lives in Knightsbridge, has hundreds of pairs of shoes. ‘But only Louboutin and Louis Vuitton,’ she says. ‘All my handbags are Louis Vuitton, too.’ Her 45,600 Instagram followers are treated to regular updates from Daria’s indulgent lifestyle: dinner at Claridge’s, bottles of Dom Perignon champagne and shopping trips to Chanel.    A fistfull of dollars and a party at The Ritz With her tumbling brunette locks and voluptuous curves, Alexandra Dmitrieva looks more like a glamorous model than a struggling student With her tumbling brunette locks and voluptuous curves, Alexandra Dmitrieva looks more like a glamorous model than a struggling student, but she’s only recently graduated from a business course at Regent’s University London.

Not only are you hammered with hyperbole from all directions, with each company insisting its product is Elvis, Jesus and Chuck Norris rolled into one, but there are almost as many different software/platform combos as there are phones. Let New Atlas help, as we line up our picks for the 10 best high-end smartphones of 2016 – to compare their features, specs and harder-to-define intangibles. For this late 2016 edition of our Smartphone Comparison Guide, we're looking at 10 handsets: Google Pixel XL Google Pixel Apple iPhone 7 Plus Apple iPhone 7 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Samsung Galaxy S7 HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Motorola Moto Z (aka Moto Z Droid) We left out some quality mid-ranged handsets, like the iPhone SE, Moto G4 and Moto Z Play; if you're looking to save a few bucks, they're all solid options. We also skipped some major flagships like the LG G5 (its modular design fell short, and was eclipsed by its more-recent successor, the V20) and the Moto Z's sibling, the Moto Z Force (thicker, heavier and more expensive than the capable standard model). Size The LG V20 is the biggest phone in this bunch, but the iPhone 7 Plus (which has a smaller screen) isn't far behind. The iPhone 7 is smallest, but the Galaxy S7 is only a slightly bigger phone with a significantly bigger screen. At some point razor-thin phones went out of style, as phone-makers tried to find a better balance of thickness, battery life and screen resolution. The only handset in this bunch pushing that boundary is the super-svelte Moto Z, though you may prefer to use it with one of its modular add-ons, which will make it beefier. Weight The Moto Z is also ludicrously light, tipping the scales lighter than the much smaller iPhone 7. Build Aluminum makes an appearance on all 10 phones, though Samsung only uses its metal frames to bind glass fronts and backs. Colors Each phone gives you some degree of choice in colors. The asterisk next to the jet black iPhone 7 and 7 Plus? That's because Apple snuck in an upsale technique (a trick growing more common under Tim Cook's Apple), only offering that none-more-black option in the more expensive 128 GB and 256 GB models. Display size The iPhone 7 is the only handset in this bunch that drops below the 5-inch display threshold. You could say that makes it a little better for folks who don't want a huge handset, but keep in mind the Galaxy S7 gives you an 18 percent bigger screen in only a slightly bigger phone. The 5.7-inch LG V20 has the largest screen in this rogue's gallery, giving you 7 percent more area than the five 5.5-inch phones. Display resolution The iPhone 7 is also the only phone in this bunch to fall short of 400 pixels-per-inch, but Apple paid enough attention to details that won't show up on spec sheets – color range, brightness, contrast, richness – to keep its screen looking close to top-notch. Display type The AMOLED vs. IPS breakdown comes out 6-4 in favor of AMOLED. Pressure-sensitive display Apple is still the only major smartphone-maker bothering with pressure-sensitive displays, with its 3D Touch tech. It's essentially the mobile right-click, bringing up various shortcuts and previews by pressing harder on the screen. Second Screen LG is one of those delightful Android-phone-makers that's always throwing wacky new stuff against the wall. Following last year's V10, the updated V20 has a small strip of screen sitting above the main display that shows various shortcuts and alerts without trespassing on your main screen's turf. Curved display After the fiery Note 7 was recalled and discontinued, that left the Galaxy S7 edge as Samsung's only current-gen phone with a curved-edge display. It's mostly a cosmetic addition, though it can also do many of the same things as LG's Second Screen, only vertically (with the major difference that, in Samsung's case, that strip steals space from the main display). Camera megapixels Megapixel counts, once past a certain threshold (which all of these are) don't mean much. But we can say anecdotally that our tests showed the Google Pixel and Pixel XL providing the best photography of the year. The LG V20, iPhones and Galaxies all came somewhat close. Camera aperture (rear) The logic goes that wider aperture means better low-lit photography – and if you're looking only at physical sensors, then that's probably going to hold true. But Google's HDR software algorithms give the Pixel phones the best low-lit smartphone shots we've ever seen, despite having a mere ƒ/2.0 aperture. Dual-lens camera (rear) The iPhone 7 Plus and LG V20 both have dual rear cameras, but they each serve different purposes. The iPhone's second lens is a telephoto/zoom one, letting you jump between standard and 2x shots with the push of a button. The two cameras also combine to enable a new Portrait Mode that simulates (with hit-or-miss quality) the bokeh/blurred-background effect of a DSLR or mirrorless camera. LG's second sensor shoots wider landscapes instead, and lacks any kind of faux-bokeh effect. OIS The Pixel phones stand as evidence that great camera software can transcend camera spec sheets. Not only do they have the smallest apertures in this bunch, they also lack Optical Image Stabilization. Yet they have not only the best low-lit photography, but also the most stable and least-blurred shots of moving subjects that we've seen in a phone. Battery (capacity) The Galaxy S7 edge has the biggest (highest-capacity) battery in this bunch, but many other factors play into real-world battery life (keep reading). Battery benchmark (lower is better) In our own battery benchmark, where we stream video over Wi-Fi with screen brightness measured at a consistent luminance, the Samsung phones and OnePlus 3 had the best scores – dropping just 9 percent per hour. While the larger Google Pixel XL fared pretty well, the smaller Pixel lost a disappointing 14 percent per hour. Fast charging Over two years after fast-charging tech started popping up in Android flagships (and has improved incrementally since), Apple has yet to offer its own version of this handy feature. Removable battery The LG V20 harkens back to older Android flagships, with its removable battery. If you pick up a spare, you can skip the bulky battery cases or clunky portable chargers, and simply swap that out during an unusually long day. Wireless charging Only Samsung built wireless charging into its phones, but you can buy a battery mod (read on) for the Moto Z that adds the same functionality. Some models of the LG V20 can add wireless charging, if you buy a replacement backing that supports it. Processor You're getting a fast phone no matter which you pick, but in our experience, we found the iPhones and Pixels to provide the smoothest, most real-time feeling in day-to-day performance. RAM RAM isn't always a perfect predictor of real-life multitasking performance (the iPhone 7, for example, still fares very well there), but for those keeping score, the OnePlus 3 has the most. Storage For internal storage, most phones give you several different pricing tiers to choose from. LG and OnePlus are the most generous in their base tiers, with a spacious 64 GB. Expandable storage Only half the phones, though, let you expand/augment that internal storage by popping in a microSD card. These relatively cheap solutions can add up to 2 TB. The V20 has the best all-around storage setup, with 64 GB internal as standard and microSD support. Water resistance Samsung and Apple both added water resistance to their 2016 flagships, but the Galaxies have the higher rating (their IP68 means they can be immersed continuously, while the iPhones' IP67 allows for 1 m/3.3 ft of water for up to 30 minutes). The asterisked phones have some light water resistance (usually just splash protection), but not enough to warrant a full "yes." Hi-Fi audio If you're an audiophile, or at least have a high-quality pair of headphones (think more Sennheiser, Sony or Bose's latest, less Beats), then the LG V20 and HTC 10 can give you outstanding audio without needing to buy any extra DAC accessories. The V20 gets the edge here, though, with its "Quad DAC" for headphone use (the HTC 10 has a standard built-in DAC too) and AptX HD support for wireless listening (the HTC 10 supports last-gen AptX, not the newer HD variant). With Hi-Fi audio files (or Hi-Fi streaming from Tidal) and the right pair of cans, both phones will produce much better sound than anything else in this group. Apple likes to brand itself as a company that "loves music," but it's less concerned than LG or HTC with making that music sound as good as possible. Headphone jack Apple made headlines when it killed the headphone jack in the 2016 iPhones, but Lenovo beat Tim Cook and Co. to the punch by a couple of months with the Moto Z. VR For nearly two years (if you count the Innovator Edition dev kits), Samsung phones were the only place to get high-quality virtual reality on your phone. That's set to change with the coming arrival of Google Daydream, which, at launch, will only work with one headset (Daydream View) and two handsets (the Pixels). Samsung's and Oculus' Gear VR, though, still has the best selection of mobile VR content by a wide margin. Daydream's library will likely take some time to catch up. Daydream View has one potential advantage in the inclusion of a single motion controller: a far cry from motion controls on higher-end VR setups, but still something the Gear VR doesn't yet have or support. Virtual assistant The Pixel phones mark the debut of Google Assistant, a more evolved version of the old Google Now, which runs on all the other Android phones. The tech giant wants Assistant to serve as a more worthy foe to Apple's Siri, and our testing shows that it more than holds its own. Fingerprint sensor In 2016, the question is no longer whether a flagship phone has a fingerprint sensor, but whether it's on the phone's frontside (in the home button slot below the screen) or backside (just below the camera). Modular build Lenovo swung for the fence with the modular Moto Z, which snaps various "Mods" into place using built-in magnets. Most of them are gimmicky (things like a speaker or projector), but the battery mod is the most elegant solution we've seen to adding battery life to a phone. Well, except, perhaps, for the LG V20's removable battery. Stylus With the Note 7 disappearing in a cloud of smoke (in some cases, literally), we're left without any major flagships with integrated stylus support. Software Every phone here that isn't an iPhone runs some version of Android, but not all are created equal. The Google Pixel's OS is the best of the Android bunch, with a pure version of the new Android Nougat that's intertwined with the hardware to a degree that you don't typically see on Android. OnePlus and Motorola come close to using stock Android, with no egregious UI changes, but their flagships are currently stuck on Google's 2015 OS release, Marshmallow. Samsung, LG and (to a lesser degree) HTC add their own UI customizations and marketing-focused features to the Android base. For more on iOS 10, running on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you can check out our full review. Release The oldest phones in this group are the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, which means they're likely to be replaced by successors the soonest, with HTC not far behind. Starting price (full retail) You may have noticed that the OnePlus 3, while holding its own throughout this comparison, didn't have any standout categories. Well, here it is: You can order the phone for a mere US$399 full retail, nearly half of what you'd pay for its best rivals. The rest of the phones have more traditional (you could say "iPhone-like") premium pricing. The V20 gets an asterisk, though, since its full-retail price varies wildly, from $672 (Verizon) all the way up to $830 (AT&T).

Email | 07 Nov 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 7 November 2016 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, developer Marco Arment argues for the Mac Pro’s continued existence, while Apple’s Phil Schiller and Jony Ive give rare interviews to discuss the new MacBook Pro. Marco Arment Argues for the Mac Pro -- Is the Mac Pro dead? It has been three years since Apple last updated its top-of-the-line Mac, giving the impression that the company has abandoned it. Developer Marco Arment argues that dropping the Mac Pro would be a mistake. He provides a wide variety of reasons why the Mac Pro is still necessary, such as having more than four cores, more graphics processing power, the capability to install far more RAM than Apple’s other Macs, and greater reliability. Either way, Apple should issue a statement about its plans for the Mac Pro so professional users who rely on the Mac Pro’s unique capabilities can react accordingly. Read/post comments Apple’s Phil Schiller Discusses the New MacBook Pros -- Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, spoke with the Independent about the just-released MacBook Pro models. Schiller admitted to being surprised by the backlash engendered by the new laptop, but he said that Apple’s online store has taken more orders for the new models than any previous professional laptop. He also explained why the new laptops have headphone jacks, why they lack SD card slots, and why we can’t activate Siri on the Mac via “Hey Siri” without an Accessibility hack. Read/post comments Apple’s Jony Ive on the Touch Bar and Thinking Different -- Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive sat down with CNET to discuss his design process and the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro. Ive reveals that his team spent years working on the concepts that eventually became the Touch Bar. That process wasn’t easy — they often had to prototype what was essentially a full product before they could even test it properly. That begs the question: what ideas did Apple develop, test, and dismiss before moving ahead with the Touch Bar?

To stress on its exclusivity Apple made the glossy black color available only on the 128 and 256GB models. Today, a new report is suggesting another exclusive color is coming to the iPhones, sooner rather than later. Jet White is rumored to join the existing color options later in the lifespan of this iPhone generation. Jet White surely would look awesome on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and will reboot the interest towards Apple's latest smartphones post the holiday season, when the sales are usually slowing down. On the other hand, Apple is not known of doing such releases mid-cycle. A new color option makes more sense for the next iPhone generation unless something else has been cooking at Apple's lab and will need the whole attention at the next event. Apple would probably unveil a new iPad generation in the spring and maybe we'll see the Jet White option in there. If not, it's probably kept under wraps for the anniversary iPhones next fall.

Apple Seeds Second Beta of iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1 & tvOS 10.1, Adds New TV App GO The new TV app is now available for iOS users Nov 7, 2016 22:10 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, November 7, 2016, Apple seeded the second Beta development milestone of its upcoming iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1, and tvOS 10.1 operating systems to developers enrolled in the Apple Developer program. Tagged as build 14C5069c for iOS 10.2 Beta 2, build 14S5869b for watchOS 3.1.1, and build 14U5574b for tvOS 10.1, the new development milestones are now available on your developer account and you can install them on your registered iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, or Apple TV devices following the instructions provided there. Of course, if you're currently using the first Beta of iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1 or tvOS 10.1 on your registered devices, you can update to today's Beta 2 release via the OTA (Over-the-Air) update system. Please note that macOS 10.12.2 Beta 2 and Xcode 8.2 Beta 2 aren't available at the moment of writing this article. Public Beta 2 of iOS 10.2 coming soon with new TV app As usual, Apple addresses many of the bugs reported by public testers and developers during the Beta 1 testing phase, which means that the new Beta should be more stable and reliable. Talking about public beta testing, Apple has not yet seeded the Public Beta 2 build of iOS 10.2, but it should arrive in the coming hours via OTA updates. Make sure you update to iOS 10.2 Public Beta 2 when it hits the streets, as Apple pushed its new TV app unveiled during the "Hello Again" event that took place last month so you can track your favorite TV shows and movies.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-11-07 Print               Many Apple customers complained online when Apple removed legacy connectors in the devices in favor of USB-C and pricey adapters. Apple is sharply reducing the prices of its USB-C adapters for its new MacBook Pro laptops after hearing loud complaints from many users about the cost and need for the dongles that will let them use their new machines with legacy peripherals and equipment they already own. In an emailed statement sent to eWEEK on Nov. 7, Apple said it announced the USB-C adapter price cuts, which will be good through the end of 2016, to address the concerns of the company's customers. "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today, and they face a transition" because of changes in the new MacBook Pros that removed several legacy ports in favor of USB-C ports and accessory dongles, the statement said. "We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables." Under the new pricing plan, all Apple-branded USB-C to USB adapters will be $9 instead of $19; while Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapters will sell for $29, instead of $49. USB-C to Lightning cables will be $19 instead of $25 for the 1-meter version, while the 2-meter version will be $29 instead of $35. In addition, the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport adapter will be $49 instead of $69. The lower prices on the Apple accessories through the end of the year will not include Apple USB-C power adaptors or the 2-meter USB-C Charge Cable, according to Apple. Related third-party MacBook Pro accessories sold through Apple stores and through Apple.com will also be included in the price mark-downs, Apple stated. The SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C reader will cost $29, instead of $49, while all other third-party USB-C peripherals offered by Apple will be 25 percent off. Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro models on Oct. 27. "We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we've ever made," Apple said in the statement. "It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility." The latest MacBooks arrive in three versions—a 15-inch model (pictured) with a sixth-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core 2.6 GHz processor, 16GB of 2,133MHz memory and up to 2TB of solid-state drive (SSD) storage; a 13-inch model with a choice of sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 dual-core processors, and 8GB of 2,133MHz memory; and a second lower-priced 13-inch model that comes with a standard row of function keys instead of a new Touch Bar that's found in the other two laptops. The all-new Touch Bar replaces the top row of clickable function keys with a touch-screen keyboard strip that enables deep customization options with a variety of applications. A sampling of IT analysts told eWEEK that the innovations they had hoped to see in the latest MacBook Pro devices were not part of the company's splashy presentation. Missing were innovations such as wireless displays that connect using WiGig, which could allow users to walk into a room, set down their MacBooks and have them connect to a compatible monitor instantly without having to plug anything in, while removing legacy ports makes things more complicated for users, they said. The 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,399, and the MacBook Pro 13-inch model starts at $1,799 with the Touch Bar or at $1,499 for the standard model without the Touch Bar. The basic MacBook Pro 13 is available immediately, while the other two models will ship in two to three weeks, according to Apple. An analysis of the new MacBook Pro 13 models with the standard function key bar was recently given a score of 2 out of 10 for ease-of-repair by computer tear-down specialist iFixit. The problem, according to iFixit, is that the new thinner, lighter and denser MacBook Pro 13 model has been designed and assembled in a way that doesn't allow easy disassembly. The two new 13-inch and 15-inch Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro models won't ship for another few weeks, so iFixit has not yet taken them apart for analysis.             LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul NXP Unveils New Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles Google Moves to Mobile-First Indexing for Search                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple clamps down on fake shopping apps, invites users to report problematic apps By Christian Zibreg, Nov 7, 2016 Tweet 2 Comments Fake apps that pretend to be from well-known brands have been an incredibly annoying issue for almost as long as the App Store has existed. Like clockwork, apps that spoof big brands manage to make their way into the App Store ahead of a pre-holiday surge and this year’s no different. As The New York Times reports, rogue app factories in China have been busy churning out counterfeit shopping apps by the hundreds, with one particular developer being responsible for an avalanche of fake apps for brands like Puma, Nike, Canada Goose, Celine and others. Beware these apps as they’re scams designed to fool you into providing your passwords and credit card data. Thankfully, Apple is clamping down on the latest round of fake apps as the Great App Store Purge continues unabated. A good example is the shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc. which has three iPhone apps on the App Store. The legitimate company now has to contend with a Chinese development firm that goes by the name Footlocke Sports Co., Ltd. and is behind more than two dozen shoe and clothing apps that look like the real thing, except they’re not. All these rogue apps want is suck your credit card numbers into the cloud. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. But clamping down on these fakes is easier said than done because their creators aren’t stupid and seem to always find a way to fool Apple’s reviewers. The article explains: Despite Apple’s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple’s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. In spite of Apple’s detailed screening processes, some of the counterfeit apps evidently slip through the App Store’s oversight processes. The company is aware of a barrage of counterfeit apps that have popped up in the App Store in recent weeks and last Thursday removed hundreds of fakes. More were removed after a New York Post article last week drew attention to some of the counterfeits. Apple’s review process focuses heavily on blocking malicious apps. Members of the App Store review teams simply don’t have the time to examine each and every of the thousands of apps submitted every day just to check if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. I ca sympathize with Apple here, but still think it should do more to prevent fakes in the App Store. Counterfeit apps that spoof real brands hurt Apple, loyal consumers, legitimate app makers trying to make a living and ultimately said brands, too On the other hand, Apple does move swiftly once a brand or an actual end-user reports fakes. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr told the paper: We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously. We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk. In September 2016, the iPhone maker began removing App Store apps that don’t work as advertised, are outdated or haven’t received compatibility updates nor feature additions in years. With more than two million iPhone, iPad and iPod touch apps available in the App Store, it’s impossible to pinpoint when Apple might finish clearing out the App Store of abandoned or rarely updated apps and those that don’t follow the current review guidelines, but the sooner the better. According to the paper, Apple has confirmed that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. If you rely on retail apps for your holiday shopping needs, be sure to use official apps from trusted developers and—please—don’t let apps with names resembling known brands/developers deceive you just because they have carefully designed icons, screenshots and interfaces that mimic established brands.

A new report this morning from Recode revealed that the iPhone maker is leaving the creation, selling and management of ads on its Apple News service to the ad sales teams over at NBCUniversal. “Apple is going to hand over ad sales for the app to Comcast’s NBCUniversal in an exclusive deal that starts in January,” reports the outlet. Any ad inventory on Apple News sold by NBCUniversal is going to be subjected to the same 70:30 revenue sharing scheme which Apple originally pitched to publishers back when it’d been selling ads on News itself. In other words, NBCUniversal gets to keep thirty percent of proceeds from any ads they sell on Apple News. An internal memo by NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino confirmed that the company would create a dedicated sales group for Apple News. Publishers can also choose to bypass the middlemen and sell their ads directly on Apple News, in which case they’re entitled to keep 100 percent of ad revenue to themselves. At the iPhone 7 unveiling last month, Tim Cook said Apple News had passed 70 million unique users, but the milestone isn’t that much surprising given the app has a major advantage of being shipped preinstalled on iPhones and iPads. Apple News is currently available in the United States, but you can make the app appear on your device by changing your regional settings.

Here's a Better Stock to Buy This company is set to benefit from Apple's new wave of tech. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Nov 7, 2016 at 4:32PM Image source: Flickr. A Motley Fool Investigative Report - November 07, 2016 If you own Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, know someone who does, or have even thought about buying it... there's something you need to know. You see, there's a king's ransom up for grabs as Apple's next game-changer makes its way outside of the company's secretive design labs in Silicon Valley. But, one stock that's poised to benefit the most from Apple's next game-changer IS NOT Apple. While millions of tech-hungry consumers line up to get their hands on Apple's global sensations, a group of in-the-know investors will be licking their chops to capitalize on a backdoor way to potentially profit as Apple's products fly off the shelves. Here's how. Apple is set to sell millions of new Apple Watches, PLUS millions of iPhones, PLUS millions of iPads. But you already knew that. What most people don't know is there's an invaluable, tiny component inside all of these devices that Apple doesn't manufacture in-house! They don't make it because they don't have the technology OR the patents to do so. That's because another company (1/30th of Apple's size) owns the rights to those patents -- so Apple has to pay that company to include its technology in their gadgets. Translation: This tiny company essentially gets paid every time Apple sells a new device. You don't have to be a numbers-whiz to understand what that kind of growth can do to a company's stock price. the_motley_fool has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Smartphone sales are flatlining - and even the mighty Apple out of Cupertino, CA can't escape this wrath. Analysts expect the company to ship 40 million to 50 million iPhones in the first calendar quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million in the year-ago period. And if Apple doesn't introduce a new iPhone SE in the spring of 2017, total iPhone sales could slow even further to shipments of 35 million to 40 million units next summer. To boost sales, Macotakara has claimed Apple may soon introduce at a "Jet White" option to its iPhone 7 lineup. The new colour might debut before the holiday shopping season, but Macotakara, which has a decent track record when it comes to leaking Apple news, said its own source for this rumour is "unreliable". So don't get your hopes up. If you still like to dream, feast your eyes on these white iPhone 6 concepts. The iPhone 4S was Apple's last iPhone model to offer an all-white finish. The current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models are only available in the following five colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Black, Silver, and Jet Black. We can't also help thinking that a Jet White iPhone 7 would go nicely with the newly announced white ceramic Apple Watch Edition announced in September too.  Sections Apple Phones Source: Macotakara Via: BGR That Lumee light-up case Kim K uses has been updated to Lumee Two Best Black Friday UK phone deals: Apple, Samsung, Android phone deals galore New evidence to suggest iPhone 8 will come with curved bezel-less screen The Huawei P10 could be one incredibly powerful smartphone if leaked specs are...

Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Could Be in the Works GO The information comes from Apple's supply chain Nov 7, 2016 21:12 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  The Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus is clearly the hardest to come by Apple smartphone these days, as shipping estimates can go to more than a month. But a few weeks ago you couldn't even get a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus without having to wait around 6 weeks for your device. In the meantime, Apple managed to ramp up production of the phone and customers can now expect to get their Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus as early as 3 weeks after they ordered it. On the other hand, the smaller Jet Black iPhone 7 now ships in 3-5 business days, so it looks like people are more akin to bigger screens. Even though Apple can't yet handle demand for the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus, it looks like the company is readying another version of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It will be called Jet White and, obviously, it will be white. Other than that, it will probably use the same materials as the Jet Black model, so expect it to be very easy to scratch. According to Japanese website Mac Otakara, the information comes directly from Apple's supply chain. Even so, the website warns readers that, for whatever reason, the information might not be as reliable as the source claims. Scratches might be more visible on the Jet White iPhone 7 However, if Apple decides to go ahead with the launch of a Jet White iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, customers will definitely look for some protective cases. Thanks to its darker color, the Jet Black version might hide some of the scratches, but that won't be the case with the Jet White version where even the thinnest scratch could be visible. The idea seems fine and dandy, but let's see the execution. A Jet White iPhone 7 Plus will probably sell like hot cakes, but will Apple be able to cope with the high-demand for another of its new smartphones? #iPhone 7#Jet Black iPhone#iPhone 7 Plus#Apple iPhone#Jet White iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus Ships in November, but Only If You Order Now It’s a Feature, Not a Bug: Jet Black iPhone 7 Label Peeling Off iPhone 7 Undergoes Camera Scratch Resistance Test As Apple Says It Used Sapphire iPhone 7 Pre-Orders Four Times Bigger than Those of iPhone 6, T-Mobile CEO Says OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Ubuntu Online Summit for Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) Starts Today, November 15 darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE    Jet White iPhone 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Donald Trump’s 45% Tariff on China Exports Could Backfire Against the iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The model is different from the Galaxy Note 7 that has been recalled worldwide,” The Associated Press reports. “Lamya Bouyirdane told The Associated Press on Monday that she noticed the phone was very hot after she asked her four-year-old son to pass it over during a family gathering at her home. She said she threw the phone away when she realized it had ‘swollen up’ and smoke was coming out,” AP reports. “‘I panicked when I saw the smoke and I had the reflex to throw it away,’ said Bouyirdane, a mother of three in the southwestern French city of Pau.” “The phone then caught fire and the back blew off,” AP reports. “Her partner quickly extinguished it.” Read more in the full article here.

Toggle navigation Financials Consumer Discretionary Technology Energy Gaming Healthcare Industrials Sports Video Toggle navigation Home About us Contact Us Authors US Edition November 14, 2016 Financials Consumer Discretionary Technology Energy Gaming Healthcare Industrials Sports Video Facebook Finds Apple and Roku TV to Expand Upon its Audience Network ToolA Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon FB AAPL Facebook is bringing personalized ads to apps on Apple and Roku TVs as part of its Audience Network Tool’s expansion plan Speculations confirm that social media giant, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) has plans to bring targeted ads to apps on Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple TV and Roku TV, a part of its determined efforts to branch out its Facebook Audience Network. A Facebook official revealed that the move is part of the company’s efforts to “best deliver” these video ads to a larger market including owners of the TV set-top boxes. Therefore, these video ads will circulate on apps available on the TV set-top boxes, aiming to grasp the attention of users around the world. Since a large proportion of web and app publishers use the popular social network to sell their ads based on users’ interests, we believe that the step will prove to be a great marketing plan for the company’s ad network. Facebook’s strategy of analyzing users’ browsing activities and interests helps it determine the sort of content they would like to see on their screens. An email sent by a Facebook official claimed: “Our goal is to bring relevant ad experiences to people both on Facebook and off." For now, the company is focusing its attention on apps for partners, A&E and Tubi TV that can be run on Apple and Roku TVs. Considering that the social media giant’s initiative aims to bring video ads to those not specifically accessing its own site, the move will help it attract more publishers who are willing to advertise to a specific target market of TV audiences. Through this, Facebook has a higher chance of operating as the next major player in the advertising sector. Both Roku and Apple devices operate as streaming devices, and Facebook may have more streaming device options to choose from in the subsequent future.

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 After new Pro launch, Apple immediately sells out of refurbished 15” last-gen MacBook Pros… Jordan Kahn - 1 week ago @JordanKahn MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has sold out of refurbished last-generation 15-inch MacBook Pros from its online store as the company introduces new models expected to ship to customers in the coming weeks. As noted by customers on Reddit, Apple previously had several models of refurbished last-generation MacBook Pro models available at discounted prices, but that supply is now dwindling as customers pick up remaining stock. There are still places to pick up the refurbished last-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro, however. Best Buy, for example, has two models available including the 2.2GHz quad-core configuration that Apple continues to sell. From Best Buy you’ll pay $1509, which will save you $490 off Apple’s $1999 price tag. It also has the 2.5GHz quad-core model with 512GB flash storage for $2094, $405 off the old $2499 retail price. If you don’t want the refurbished model, eBay currently has the 2.2GHz quad-core configuration brand-new for $1599, $400 off Apple’s current $1999. While Apple introduced all-new MacBook Pro models at its October 27 event last month, the company continues to sell one configuration of the last-generation 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models from its online store, presumably while supplies last. Apple started accepting orders for the new Macbook Pro with Touch Bar with a 2-3 week estimated shipping date following its event. The first of those models will arrive around November 17 to customers, while an entry-level 13-inch model with traditional function keys is already available. Shipping estimates have since increased with all models of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar currently listed with a shipping estimate of 4-5 weeks from Apple. Apple appears to be preparing to ship the first of the new MacBook Pros as it today began charging credit cards of pre-order customers.  Guides MacBook Pro View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

A Week In The Newsroom Publications Newsroom Sign Up For Updates iPhone 7 creates a fanboy Home » Blogs » iPhone 7 creates a fanboy Posted By Brandin Walker on September 19, 2016 Apple unveiled their newest addition to the iPhone family last week, the iPhone 7, and the innovations are ground-breaking. With Apple releasing a new generation of its flagship device every year, consumers have grown accustomed to CEO Tim Cook claiming each new model is better than the last. Others in the industry have noticed small to no advancements within the line. After doing my research I am now a believer in the hype surrounding Apple’s latest release. The biggest controversy and game changer in the phone industry was the complete removal of the analog headphone jack in this remodel. However, consumers who still cling to their ear-pods can be rest assured that they’ve been made compatible with the charger port, or what the company calls the lightning port. Eliminating the headphone jack could be a marketing strategy to increase sales of their latest technological innovation called “AirPods,” wireless headphones that can be setup with the phone. At $159, this pricey feature is on trend with similar counterparts such as Sennheiser and JayBird but becomes unparalleled with its features such as Siri connectivity and its estimated 24 hour battery life. The phone’s most recent operating system update, iOS 10, is the largest and fastest to be engineered, ever. They’ve added a new processor, its A10 Fusion Chip, that makes the phone faster and smarter. Apple proclaims this new chip will make the iPhone 7 120 times faster than the original iPhone from 2007. The camera has been refined to give users professional quality pictures that can be taken with the snap of your phone. Advancements with the camera include a larger six-element lens for clearer photos, optical image stabilization that eliminates blurred images when photographing in-motion, quad-LED flash that allows 50 percent more light to be processed, and a high speed mega-pixel sensor that allows photos to be captured more rapidly. Apple always does a great job of paying attention to small details that make a big difference when putting them to practical everyday use. They’ve created a way to awaken the phone when it’s lifted from a surface, Siri can now access and perform functions in apps upon voice recognition and its navigation app has become compatible with other apps such as Uber and Yelp. The new addition called HomeKit, which connects your phone to various home devices and integrates home automation for users to setup and manage through the phone, was spoken highly by Cook. Lastly, with every new phone at Apple comes with it a new design. Iphone 7 is now the thinnest and lightest IPhone on the market. It will also be water and dust resistant competing with other smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy and Sony Xperia. New designs include a jet black color with a glossy finish, a stainless-steel Apple logo and enhanced stereo-quality with the addition of speakers placed on the top and bottom of the smart phone to produce two-times more volume than its predecessor. While the official release for Apples latest generation iPhone is well before this story publishes, release is on Sept. 16, the iPhone 7 appears to be an extremely intriguing new product on the market. After doing all my research, falling in love with the product, and having a timely upgrade available with my service provider, Apple can be certain that I will be one of the many consumers waiting outside before release to get my hands on this hot new design.

The bigger phone is definitely harder to hold, but if you have big hands your all set :). Great post! Post a Reply Submit a Comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

According to the Plugable, the new USB Type-C ports on the Apple’s newly launched MacBook Pro aren’t compatible for some of the early adopters of the technology on Thunderbolt 3 DisplayPorts and HDMI one. It claims that new MacBook running MacOS Sierra won’t work with peripherals with 1st generation Texas Instruments chips, and mandatory requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 TI chips for to be compatible instead. There is a chance that Apple might roll out an update to add support for older Thunderbolt 3 accessories, but as of now the only official statement from the company to AppleInsider notes that it doesn’t want to comment on Plugable’s findings and all the products using the newest Thunderbolt chipsets with up-to-date drivers are compatible with all MacBook Pro 2016 models. Here’s Apple statement: “While we have no comment on Plugable’s specific complaint, products using the newest Thunderbolt chipsets, with up-to-date drivers, will have no difficulty connecting to any 2016 MacBook Pro.” Source | Via Author: Hitesh Arora From making Gadget and Auto videos for TV and online media, this guy landed up in Tech Writing.

 NBCUniversal in deal to sell ads for Apple News Reuters Nov. 7, 2016, 3:37 PM 179 facebook linkedin twitter email print An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City Thomson Reuters By Tim Baysinger (Reuters) - Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal will begin selling ads for Apple Inc’s News app next year in an exclusive deal, the companies announced on Monday. Apple will outsource the selling to NBCUniversal, which already has relationships with many major U.S. advertisers. The deal is reminiscent of one that Snapchat struck with Viacom earlier this year, under which Viacom sells advertising on Snapchat's behalf. Unlike Apple, however, Snapchat has been filling its sales roster as it prepares for next year’s initial public offering. Apple does not have its own sales team after it shut down its iAd app ad network in June, which was used to fill unsold inventory for Apple News. Apple launched its News app last year and currently has over 70 million active monthly users. Publishers on the app, which include The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, will still be able to sell their own ads and keep all of the revenue, but now NBCUniversal, rather than Apple, will sell the extra inventory. For NBCUniversal, this provides another platform to offer advertisers. Like most legacy U.S. media companies, NBCUniversal parent company Comcast has invested heavily in digital-native companies like BuzzFeed and Vox, partly in an effort to better service existing advertisers. For example, NBCUniversal and Vox partnered on an ad product, Concert, that packages inventory from NBCUniversal and Vox’s digital properties and offers it to advertisers. NBCUniversal would not say how the revenue would be split for the ads it sells against other publishers' content; in the past, publishers would get 70 percent of the revenue with the other 30 percent going to Apple. Publishers also have the ability to opt out of having NBCUniversal sell ads against their content. NBCUniversal said it will also work with Apple on new ad products for the app. NBCUniversal will form a new sales unit dedicated to the News app, which will be lead by senior vice president James Kreckler.

She said she threw the phone away when she realized it had ‘swollen up’ and smoke was coming out,” AP reports. “‘I panicked when I saw the smoke and I had the reflex to throw it away,’ said Bouyirdane, a mother of three in the southwestern French city of Pau.” “The phone then caught fire and the back blew off,” AP reports. “Her partner quickly extinguished it.” Read more in the full article here.

Home Industry Tech Android’s Dominant Alliance shows signs of Balkanization: Gadfly Android’s Dominant Alliance shows signs of Balkanization: Gadfly The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. By: Bloomberg | Published: November 8, 2016 2:16 AM The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. (Reuters) The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software backed by Google parent company Alphabet Inc. powers more than 85 percent of the roughly 1.5 billion new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart. That’s because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit — principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. — are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers. Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That’s no longer a given with Android. Market Share of Android Smartphones 87.6 per cent Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google’s web search on smartphones. Android was Google’s effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world’s digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones — even on Android phones — the more data is being generating out of Google’s reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google’s efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it’s possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn’t willing anymore. It isn’t unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven’t always been on the same page about the Windows operating system — a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion’s share of the profits, too. In short, it’s hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out. The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn’t even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It’s not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can’t stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one — the laser disc player of computing.

Apple will be sending you free money Chris Mills BGR NewsNovember 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share On Friday, Apple announced a limited-time sale on some of the rather expensive dongles for its new MacBook Pro. The news was well-received by people who didn't really want to spend $19 for the privilege of having a USB port, but it looks like Apple is extending the deal to everyone who has already bought any USB-C adapters. 9to5Mac reports that readers who bought USB-C adapters for their new MacBooks in the last week have seen automatic credits applied to their accounts for the difference between the sale price and what people paid for the non-discounted adapters. DON'T MISS: OnePlus is officially releasing an even faster smartphone A reader says that an email from Apple confirmed the automatic credit: “Thank you for your recent Apple Online Store purchase. Apple recently lowered the price of the USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) you ordered. We are pleased to inform you that we will provide you with a credit for the difference between the price you paid and the new, lower price. Apple” It's a classy, if predictable, move from Apple. Given the Apple Store's return policy, customers could have gone into the store to return the dongles and then re-buy them on sale anyway, so Apple's really just making that process automatic. Still, given the laziness of people, it will amount to Apple giving away some of its hard-earned dongle profit. The dongle sale, and now this credit, are the latest conciliatory moves by Apple over the MacBook Pro's port situation. When the company announced a new laptop with four USB-C ports and nothing else, it probably wasn't expecting the level of backlash that it saw. Taking people's headphone jacks is one thing, but it seems like the MagSafe connector and SD card reader are truly sacred ground. It's unclear exactly how far back the credits for the adapter sale will go, but if you've bought a USB-C adapter for any MacBook from the Apple Store in the last 30 days, I'd strongly suggest contacting Apple support and trying to get a refund for the difference.

Apple has now started automatically crediting customers who purchased the reduced products just prior to the announcement. Customers who purchased the accessories that now have reduced limited time pricing before the price drops are receiving automatic credits for the difference, as evidenced by the screenshot below from a 9to5Mac reader who was credited for a USB-C to Lightning cable purchase. “Thank you for your recent Apple Online Store purchase. Apple recently lowered the price of the USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) you ordered. We are pleased to inform you that we will provide you with a credit for the difference between the price you paid and the new, lower price. Apple” Apple appears to be sending out credits to those who purchased the USB-C accessories on or after the day of its MacBook Pro event on October 27th before the price drop kicked in on Friday, November 4th last week. The limited time pricing on Apple’s USB-C accessories and those it sells from third-parties will last through the end of the year, and Apple notes that the deals are effective “October 27 – December 31, 2016”. It’s also offering discounted pricing on the new LG 4K and 5K displays that it announced alongside the new MacBook Pro models, the latter of which isn’t even available until sometime next month. Earlier today Apple started charging credit cards for MacBook Pro with Touch Bar preorders, signalling that it will soon start shipping the device to customers. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Since Apple’s event, there has been lots of talk about the new MacBook Pros, especially among the Apple commentariat. It’s fair to say that the backlash against these new devices is stronger than for any MacBook announcement I can remember, and it’s mostly coming from two particular sets of people: Those who use heavy-duty creative applications such as Photoshop, and those who develop for Apple platforms. This is easily Apple’s most vocal audience, so such a response must be at least a little disheartening. But it’s also worth remembering that Apple — and even the Mac in isolation — has long since gone mainstream, and is bigger than these groups. Apple’s challenge now isn’t serving this hardcore base but pleasing the much larger mainstream Mac user base without alienating the power users. Apple’s increasingly diverse base I wrote a post a while back about the counterintuitive liability Apple has in its growing customer base. On the one hand, this customer base is a huge asset, especially given the upgrade cycles for devices like the iPhone and the ability to sell services to a captive group of users. But on the other hand, the increasing diversity of this base can also be a liability, because Apple now has to please many groups in a much less homogeneous base than in the past. The problem is the public image of Apple among many in the media and beyond continues to be of a company that serves mostly creative professionals. This perception has led to a lot of misguided commentary over the past week, both about the damage Microsoft’s Surface Studio could do to Apple’s Mac base, and about the perceived shortcomings of the new MacBook Pro line. Apple’s Mac base today The reality is that Apple’s installed base of Macs today is likely around 90 million. That’s up enormously over the last 15 years or so — it was around 25 million in the early 2000s. As that base has grown, it has diversified considerably. Just visit any college campus to see row on row of MacBooks in lecture rooms and study halls. These aren’t creative professionals, and they’re not even using their MacBooks for particularly resource-intensive tasks. But, of course, there are still creative professionals and Apple developers who use Macs for work. So it’s worth thinking about what percentage of the overall base these users might represent. Here are some data points: In 2013, Adobe estimated it had an installed base of around 12.8 million users of its Creative Suite software, with another 250,000 on Creative Cloud. Around 40 percent of this revenue came from what Adobe described as creative professionals, with another 25 percent coming from other creative people in businesses, 10 percent from creative people using it at home and 25 percent from education. Adobe currently has around eight million Creative Cloud subscribers (this is how Adobe now sells its creative suite, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and so on). At WWDC this year, Tim Cook announced that Apple had 13 million registered developers. If we put these numbers together, we get a picture of eight million to 13 million users of Adobe’s creative products and another 13 million or so Apple developers. Of course, of those Adobe users, a good chunk will be using Windows versions rather than Mac versions. At the absolute outside, though, it gives, at most, around 25 million total users in the two buckets that have been most vocal about the MacBook Pro changes, out of a total base of around 90 million, or around 28 percent. Realistically, that number is probably quite a bit smaller, perhaps around 15 percent to 20 percent of the total. Of these, not all will share the concerns of those who have been so outspoken in the past week. To look at it another way, Apple sold 18.5 million Macs in the past year, which might end up being roughly the same as the combined number of creative professionals and developers in the base. Apple’s installed base of Macs today is likely around 90 million. That’s up enormously over the last 15 years or so — and as that base has grown, it has diversified considerably. In the end, the picture that emerges is of a base of Macs with the kinds of users that have been expressing concerns or frustration with the changes in the minority. The vast majority of the user base is in other categories, principally general-purpose consumer and business users. How does the rest of the base feel about the new MacBooks? Well, of course, that base is much less vocal and less visible — the general-purpose Mac user tends not to blog or host podcasts about Apple. They’re much more likely to quietly keep using the products they have and occasionally upgrade to something new. The best place to look for their feedback is sales numbers for the Mac. Those have been down a little lately, as the existing Macs have been getting a little long in the tooth, and those in the know have been waiting for upgraded machines. However, Phil Schiller said last week that online orders for the new MacBooks were higher than they’ve ever been for a new product before, suggesting that some of this pent-up demand is being released now. Mainstream users — and likely quite a few from among the professional class of MacBook users, too — are buying this new product despite the misgivings some power users have. We won’t know the actual numbers on how these MacBook Pros are selling until at least three months from now — and probably longer. But my guess is that those sales numbers will suggest that the mainstream base cares a lot less about some of the subjects of the criticism from the past week and a lot more about a decent bunch of spec upgrades, thinner and lighter hardware, and some interesting new features. Keeping the pro base happy Of course, Apple can’t simply ignore the professional base — though these users may be a minority among the overall set of Mac customers, they are an important segment and, as we’ve already seen, a vocal one. Pleasing them is important in its own right, but also as a way to influence broader perceptions of the Mac and Apple as a company. Apple likely needs to do more here to mollify this base. For starters, it needs to update the desktop Macs, especially the Mac Pro, quickly. The current version of the Mac Pro suffers from being less upgradeable than its predecessor. With that being the case, it requires hardware refreshes more — not less — frequently. It might also be a reasonable concession to the complaints from this base to make it more upgradeable. I suspect Apple will have to think hard about how to please those who want a portable yet ultrapowerful machine, which is really the even narrower segment that has been criticizing the new MacBooks. The portability/power tradeoff it has made in the new machines seems to be fine for the mainstream, but that’s the one thing that seems to be creating the most problems for the hardcore base, and it’s worth addressing.

Now, unlike a lot of our readers, I’m OK with Apple ditching the headphone jack, but Uncourage might be helpful to many of us. It’s essentially a key ring with a dummy 1/4″ jack. It’s designed for you to attach your Headphone-to-Lightning Apple adapter when you’re not using it so you don’t lose it. That’s clever, and it’s just US$6. The company said it will ship in mid-November.

November 7, 2016 at 12:59 EST PM geoduck November 7, 2016 True, but at $6 and with that name it would be worth it. You know how some people have religious symbols on their keychains? Maybe hanging a symbolic phone jack on your keyring could be the next bit of geek culture. Pull out your keys and those of us that are part of the IT tribe will recognize a kindred spirit. I may order one just for that reason alone.

Back in 2012, the 3rd gen Apple TV with 1080p support was a decent little set-top box. Since then, the TV industry has raced forward. Content providers have developed new delivery modes and strategies, and the broadcast and display technologies have advanced as well. Apple, however, seems to have frittered its time away and failed to advance its vision and its hardware. In fact, Yoni Heisler at BGR makes the case that Apple has no idea what it’s doing. The discussion is on page 3 of Particle Debris. Check It Out: Apple’s Hit and Miss Affair with TV Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit One Comment Add a comment MarcusNewton November 7, 2016 “Compounding the problem is that its backwards industrial design all but makes it impossible, upon picking it up, to immediately discern which part of the remote is the top and which is the bottom simply by picking it up.” (from the BGR article) — I cannot count how many times I have picked up the Apple TV remote to move it and accidentally clicked the touch area and turned on the Apple TV. Even to pick the remote up I have to slide it over to a table’s edge because it is so thin and flat. Also, I am still surprised that Apple hasn’t changed that awful A through Z straight line keyboard. I have a 65″ TV, with all this screen real-estate, and the keyboard is this thin line near the top of the screen. I thought Apple made all of its employees go through that class where they show that old Google TV remote as a lesson in bad design. I think the Apple TV people called in sick that day. While I am on the subject of the Apple TV on-screen keyboard, it drives me nuts that there are two buttons below the A to Z line of characters, one for uppercase and another button for lowercase. If I can only display either uppercase or lowercase sets one-at-a-time, why are there two buttons? It should be one button that changes to whatever the opposite of the case currently on the screen is. Actually, there is more then enough room to display both upper and lowercase characters at the same time. I would love to watch someone on the Apple TV team try to enter in a strong password like }’rbSq}Fx]ZHOfG)Nxnh/cS* with the on-screen keyboard. Yes, I have tried using Siri, and it is completely useless for understanding random generated passwords. November 7, 2016 at 10:38 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

A host of fake retail apps have appeared in Apple’s App Store recently, an indicator of Apple’s inability to closely monitor software in the way it once did. Both the New York Times and the New York Post have reported that hundreds of fake shopping apps have been published in the App Store recently. While many of them simply serve up irritating ads to make a quick buck, others purport to be genuine retail apps, luring users into providing credit card details. Brands ranging from Foot Locker to Christian Dior have been used as the fronts for such rackets in recent weeks. Apple once made much of its approval process for apps, using it as a means of differentiating itself from Android, which used to allow developers to immediately upload software to its Play Store. (Google began vetting apps more closely in 2015.) Apple still claims to “review all apps submitted to the App Store in an effort to determine whether they are reliable, perform as expected, and are free of offensive material.” But clearly some are slipping through the net. A statement provided to the New York Times by Apple hints that its vetting process may not be quite as rigorous as it once was: “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously. We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” Indeed, the newspaper claims that Apple “does not routinely examine” every app before it’s added to the store. In other cases, the software may be updated after approval to include nefarious content. The main problem is volume: there are a mind-boggling two million apps available in the app store, so vetting new arrivals and updates in detail is incredibly difficult. This is perhaps what happens when a company that once sought to make perfect devices for a small audience becomes one of the world’s largest hardware suppliers with a software marketplace to match: quality slips. Apple also appears to be losing its ability to update product lines often enough to keep consumers interested in the latest models. The latest iPhone launch was wildly underwhelming, for instance, and its computer refreshes come too infrequently for the demanding, need-it-now millennial crowd. The company’s most recent product announcement is also an excellent case in point, revealing a company with time to make small tweaks to existing products, but lacking the vision to break with convention. Perhaps more pressing for Apple right now is the need to clean up the illicit apps, which so far it has done based on reports from the two news outlets.

By Bill Roberson — November 7, 2016 11:26 AM Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Suddenly, those scissors look better than ever If you’re a cable TV cord-cutter, it looks like there’s an interesting option on the horizon. According to Variety, AT&T is going to give streamers free Apple TVs and Amazon Fire TV Sticks with its new $35-per-month streaming TV service, which it will call DirecTV Now. Customers who sign up for a three-month run of the service will get an Apple TV streaming kit, and month-to-month users will get an Amazon Fire TV stick. Variety says AT&T is lining up content channels for the service and so far, HBO, ESPN, Disney, AMC, Viacom and some other heavy hitters are on board. But what about Netflix and Amazon? Well, since it’s a streaming service, we’ll just assume your regular accounts will be accessible through either device as usual. And this doesn’t seem like some trial run, either. Bloomberg is saying that streaming – not cable or satellite – will be AT&Ts primary TV platform by 2020. Samsung, please make sure the A.I. does not explode Couple of A.I. stories for you now: Following the disaster that is the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, the South Korean electronics giant is focusing on the upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship phone, and it could get a new dedicated A.I. built in, in order to compete against Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, and so on. Samsung has copyrighted the name “Bixby” and just last month, the electronics giant bought up Viv, the A.I. designed by the same team that created Siri. The new S8 is expected to debut at Mobile World Congress in February, and will likely come in 5.1 and 5.5-inch variations. Other rumors include a dual-camera system but one more oriented towards low-light performance rather than making pretty portrait pictures, and a 4K screen on the big version of the phone. Sounds great, just make sure to get those batteries squared away, Samsung. We’re not so sure this was the smartest idea And hey, if you want to smarten up an A.I., what do you think would be the best approach? A sit down with Stephen Hawking? Watching Cosmos with Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Reading all of Marilyn vos Savant’s columns? Seems reasonable, but Google has other ideas: They’re having their A.I. “DeepMind” play StarCraft II, because nothing apparently works better at creating a touchy-feely A.I. than battling alien hordes with insanely powerful energy weapons. But Google says the gameplay will teach their apparently teenage A.I. that never leaves the  basement how to better deal with the intricacies – or what Google calls the “messiness” – of everyday life by having to make rapid-fire decisions and coordinate simultaneous tasks. So, DeepMind will either emerge victorious from its marathon gaming sessions, or be mad as hell at being taken out by a tween in Saskatchewan. Apparently teaching it to play the Sims was just too obvious.

KingMel Monday, November 7, 2016 - 5:19 pm · Reply This feedback to RonB applies to all types of labels – conservative, liberal, Republican, Democrat, etc. – that are used as a shortcut to define people and even entire platforms of beliefs and attitudes. You should consider just what that label means to you. What are you saying about yourself when you affiliate with that label? You should consider your attitudes and beliefs that you lump under that label. Are you saddling yourself with viewpoints and biases defined by people/organizations who are seeking to promote their agendas for personal gain – power, fame, and money? Are you such a simple, two-dimensional person that a one or two word label can even come close to being accurate? What beliefs/attitudes do you actual share with others who apply the same label to themselves? To what degree do you actually support all of the aspects of the platform of your chosen political party? Labels are being used to divide America. They are being used as a tool to oversimplify a situation so that it can be more easily be attacked – label and disparage. Labels are being used to incite distrust and hatred among the populace. Ask yourself, “Who benefits from this chaos and gridlock within our government?” “Who is driving this division towards the extremes?” The American people are being played, and the various people/organizations involved are all attempting to blame the others while claiming that virtue is on their side. Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Rather than emphasizing the differences between you and others, seek to identify the similarities, the shared interests and goals. Promote compassion over disdain, cooperation over division, understanding over callousness disregard, reason over emotion, knowledge over ignorance, inclusion over exclusion Do not allow yourself to be manipulated by the tools of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Be willing to open yourself up to seriously contemplate different ways of thinking and different beliefs. They may have some merit. Exercise your humanity.

 Apple and Samsung’s combined smartphone market share is the lowest it’s been in five years Jeff Dunn Nov. 7, 2016, 2:13 PM 2,572 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   If you were to stop a random person on the street at any point in the past half-decade and ask them to name two smartphones, there’s a good chance they’d say (1) the iPhone and (2) the Samsung Galaxy. That'd make sense. Apple and Samsung have been the two dominant forces in the mobile market, they’ve spent a ton on marketing, and, especially in recent years, each of their flagship devices have been well-received. As a result, the two have consistently held a big chunk of smartphone market share. They still do today. But, slowly but surely, that grip has slipped. As this chart from Statista shows, while Samsung and Apple lead the pack, that’s only good for about a third of the market. More specifically, according to recent data from analyst firm IDC, the two make up 32.5% of the market. (With Samsung at 20%, and Apple at 12.5%.) If you dig through the archives, that’s the lowest combined number for the pair since Q1 2011, when IDC had them at 29.6% of the smartphone market. To give you some perspective: Back then, Nokia was not only not dead, it was number one. BlackBerry was not only still making phones, it was called Research in Motion, and it had only just been passed by the iPhone. Fast forward to today, and the smartphone boom is over. iPhone growth has stalled (and may not be done dropping), and the Samsung phones that don’t explode have dipped recently, too. Rising behind them is a set of up-and-coming Chinese vendors — Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo — which have blown up in their home country, and are making gains elsewhere due to largely affordable hardware. While it’s unlikely that those companies will gain the US audience they’d need to overtake an Apple — and while market share itself isn’t really an indicator of profitability — the gap has shrunk.

MacDailyNews Take: Apple takes another step toward getting out of the business of directly selling ads (but not from profiting from ad placements).

KingMel Monday, November 7, 2016 - 5:19 pm · Reply This feedback to RonB applies to all types of labels – conservative, liberal, Republican, Democrat, etc. – that are used as a shortcut to define people and even entire platforms of beliefs and attitudes. You should consider just what that label means to you. What are you saying about yourself when you affiliate with that label? You should consider your attitudes and beliefs that you lump under that label. Are you saddling yourself with viewpoints and biases defined by people/organizations who are seeking to promote their agendas for personal gain – power, fame, and money? Are you such a simple, two-dimensional person that a one or two word label can even come close to being accurate? What beliefs/attitudes do you actual share with others who apply the same label to themselves? To what degree do you actually support all of the aspects of the platform of your chosen political party? Labels are being used to divide America. They are being used as a tool to oversimplify a situation so that it can be more easily be attacked – label and disparage. Labels are being used to incite distrust and hatred among the populace. Ask yourself, “Who benefits from this chaos and gridlock within our government?” “Who is driving this division towards the extremes?” The American people are being played, and the various people/organizations involved are all attempting to blame the others while claiming that virtue is on their side. Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Rather than emphasizing the differences between you and others, seek to identify the similarities, the shared interests and goals. Promote compassion over disdain, cooperation over division, understanding over callousness disregard, reason over emotion, knowledge over ignorance, inclusion over exclusion Do not allow yourself to be manipulated by the tools of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Be willing to open yourself up to seriously contemplate different ways of thinking and different beliefs. They may have some merit. Exercise your humanity.

The new beta adds support for the limited Single Sign-On feature. We also expect Apple to unlock the new TV app in this beta as well, but that’s not confirmed as of now. It’s highly not recommended to run this beta as it may cause problems with your Apple TV down the road. However, to proceed: head to Apple’s Developer portal and download the necessary profile to your Mac or PC. Plug the device in via the USB-C port on the back of your Apple TV and fire up iTunes. From there, tap Option (Mac) / Shift (Windows) + Update and select the profile. Once completed, head over to your Apple TV’s settings > system > Software Update. If it does not appear, reboot your Apple TV and it should prompt you to update. If you spot anything interesting, be sure to leave us a comment below!

To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. watchOS 3.1 requires an iPhone running iOS 10 to install. As a minor 3.1.x update, watchOS 3.1.1 appears to focus on under-the-hood bug fixes and performance improvements, with no outward-facing changes discovered in the first watchOS 3.1.1 beta. We'll update this post should any new features be discovered in the second watchOS 3.1.1 beta. watchOS 3 completely overhauls the interface on the Apple Watch, introducing a dedicated app dock, instant launch apps, new watch faces, and new complication options. There are new Activity sharing features, a "Breathe" app guides users through deep breathing sessions to cut down on stress, and an SOS feature can automatically call emergency service. For more details on what's new in watchOS 3, make sure to check out our watchOS 3 roundup.

Designed for the fourth-generation Apple TV, the tvOS 10.1 beta can be obtained by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C to USB-A cable, downloading and installing the software from a registered developer account via iTunes or Apple Configurator. Once a beta profile has been installed on the device through iTunes, new beta updates will be available over the air. Many Apple TV owners are eagerly awaiting a promised Single Sign-On feature that will allow Apple TV users to sign in once with their cable credentials to access all available live cable content, and the feature has been introduced in the tvOS 10.1 beta. Not included is the new "TV" app that was announced at Apple's October 27 event. "TV" is meant to be a TV guide-style app that provides users with recommendations on what to watch and an easy way to discover new television content. tvOS 10, for those unfamiliar with the operating system, brings features like improved search, expanded Siri capabilities, a dark mode, a Continuity option for using the iPhone for text input, automatic app downloads, quicker access to live TV, and more.

Nov 07, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Image via Publicist Drake's Views has now racked up more than three billion streams on Spotify. As Billboard pointed out, Music Ally tallied up the total number of the album's streams and found that the album has been streamed 3,043,000,000 times as of Monday. This is an even more impressive feat considering the rapper originally released his latest studio album as an Apple Music exclusive back in April. The album didn't hit Spotify and other streaming services until May 13. By comparison, Views has been streamed more than a billion times on Apple Music, becoming the first album to do so on Apple's streaming service. Related Drake's 'VIEWS' Album Has Generated Over 1 Billion Streams Drake's 'Views' Is the First Album to Earn Over a Billion Streams on Apple Music Drake's "One Dance" Is Now the Most Streamed Song in Spotify History This isn't the only milestone Drake has reached on Spotify. In October, his No. 1 hit "One Dance" surpassed Major Lazer's "Lean On" to become the most-streamed song in Spotify's history with 924.5 million streams.  Still, the rapper has a significant history with Spotify's competition, Apple. The company premiered his "Hotline Bling" video as an exclusive. It has since gone on to spurn thousands of memes and join an elite group of videos with more than a billion views on YouTube. Drake also appeared on stage at the 2015 launch of Apple Music and signed a deal with the company worth a reported $19 million that included the launch of his own OVO Sound Radio show on its Beats 1 radio station. Drake recently announced his new project, More Life, which is set to drop in December. He debuted three of the songs from the album—"Sneakin," "Fake Love," and "Two Birds, One Stone"—on his Beats 1 show on his 30th birthday. In other news, Drake also fueled speculation about his joint project with Kanye West by posting a cryptic Instagram post on Monday morning. That follows recent rumors that the rapper has also been collaborating with Taylor Swift on some new music. Views Spotify streams in millions: 1. Keep the Family Close: 32.8 2. 9: 44.1 3.

Folks enrolled in Apple’s developer program can install the update via the over-the-air mechanism in the Settings app, or from the dev center. Beta 2 comes one week after the first beta was released, which revealed a number of user-facing changes and improvements like new wallpaper and emoji. Today’s beta adds onto that with Apple’s new TV app. Apple has also pushed out the second betas for watchOS 3.1.1 and tvOS 10.1. They seem to be more of maintenance updates, but we have noticed that Apple has quietly activated its Single Sign-On feature for beta users. Single Sign-On allows you to login with your [compatible] cable credentials once and gain access to all available content in installed apps. And of the course the TV app is the TV guide-like application introduced last month. See a notable change or improvement we’ve missed in the above betas? Let us know in the comments below! Update: here are some of the changes we’ve found so far in beta 2: Thanks Dox!

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search AT&T to lure DirecTV Now subs with free Apple TV or Fire TV Stick Chris Davies - Nov 7, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit AT&T plans to use a free Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV Stick to turn consumers weary of sky-high cable bills into DirecTV Now subscribers, documents inadvertently leaked by the company have confirmed. The service, which AT&T confirmed back in October will be priced at just $35 per month, is expected to offer both live and on-demand streaming. With it, the company hopes to get a bite of the growing cord-cutter market. That group of users – who now blanch at the idea of spending upwards of a hundred dollars per month on potentially thousands of cable TV channels they never get around to watching – are increasingly on the radar for companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. Unlike many of those players, however. AT&T isn’t planning on making its own streaming hardware. Instead, the leak spotted by Variety suggests, it will offer sign-ups a choice of two well-known third-party devices to turn their existing TV into a smart set. DirecTV Now subscribers who commit to three months of service will get a free Apple TV in return. That seems a pretty good deal for users, given the streaming TV amounts to $105. A brand-new Apple TV is currently priced at $149 for the cheapest, 32 GB model. Those unwilling to give AT&T even three months commitment, however, will get one of Amazon’s Fire TV Sticks. That’s priced at $39.99, currently, complete with Amazon’s latest Alexa Voice Remote. It’s unclear at this stage whether AT&T plans to modify either of the devices before shipping them to subscribers, such as preloading the DirecTV Now app or even limiting access to other services each streamer normally has access to. Meanwhile indications of what sort of content users can expect from DirecTV Now are also now available. AT&T previously suggested upward of 100 channels would be offered, though exactly what will be included will depend on local markets. Still, there are some top-level names AT&T presumably hopes to use as a lure. That includes the Food Network, MTV, Nickelodeon, CBS, Bravo, NBC, and Cartoon Network. Further content will be offered in return for more monthly subscriptions. “With DirecTV Now,” the document claims, “you can stream live TV and On Demand programming with several packages to choose from. Premium channels like HBO and Cinemax can be added at any time.” For on-demand content, there’ll apparently be a 14,000 title strong catalog to sift through. On top of that, many of the networks will supposedly offer catch-up streaming. That will allow shows to be watched within the 72 hours following their original broadcast. A 7-day trial will be offered, and a free tier. Dubbed DirecTV Freeview, the latter will be supported by advertising and offer only a partial selection of its subscription-based counterparts. NOW READ: Apple TV 4th-gen Review Exactly when DirecTV Now will launch remains to be confirmed, and AT&T could well change the terms of its streamer promotion and its channel line-up in the intervening period. Still, if you’re in the market for a new set-top box and models from either Apple or Amazon have caught your eye, it might be worth holding off to give DirecTV Now a try.

Registered developers can download the second iOS 10.2 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. iOS 10.2 doesn't have a single main feature like Portrait mode in iOS 10.1, but it does offer several smaller feature tweaks. New emoji have been added in the update, including clown face, drooling face, selfie, face palm, fox face, owl, shark, butterfly, avocado, pancakes, croissant, and more. There are more than a hundred new emoji, including several profession emoji available in both male and female genders, such as firefighter, mechanic, lawyer, doctor, scientist, and more. Apple has also redesigned many existing emoji, adding more detail and making them look much more realistic. Along with new emoji, iOS 10.2 includes new wallpaper, new Music sorting options, a new "Celebrate" Screen Effect," an option for preserving camera settings, a Videos widget, Single-Sign On support for watching live TV via apps, and more. Apple has called iOS 10 its "biggest release ever" for iOS users, with a revamped lock screen, a Siri SDK for developers, an overhauled Messages app, a dedicated "Home" app for HomeKit users, new facial and object recognition capabilities in Photos, and redesigned Maps and Apple Music apps. What's new in iOS 10.2 beta 2: TV app - iOS 10.2 includes the "TV" app that was shown off at Apple's October 27 event. The app is designed to serve as a TV guide to help users discover new content and decide what to watch. SOS - There's a new SOS feature that will call emergency services when the power button on the iPhone is pressed five times. According to Apple's release notes, SOS works in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, UK, and US. Settings for SOS are available in the Settings app under the General section. Music - There are more prominent Shuffle and Repeat buttons available in the Music app when playing a song.

The TV app is meant to work across multiple devices, including iOS devices and the Apple TV, and as of today the TV app is available in the iOS 10.2 beta. Apple's new TV app works hand-in-hand with features like Siri Live Tune-In and Single Sign-On, simplifying the television-watching experience. In addition to a Library section that displays all the iTunes content a user has purchased, the TV app also features a "Watch Now" section that houses a collection of TV shows and movies from iTunes and other television apps a user has installed on an Apple TV or iOS device. An Up Next feature keeps track of TV shows and movies across devices so you can pick up where you were watching, whether in the middle of a movie or the next episode of a TV show, and there are lists of curated and trending TV shows and movies. A dedicated store lets users purchase content from iTunes or from other sources like HBO Go. The Store section also lets users sign in with their TV provider to find content available through an authenticated cable subscription. Apple's release notes state that the TV app isn't yet fully functional, and it does not appear to be available in the tvOS 10.1 beta just yet. Apple has said the TV app will see an official release in December.

Publishers who put content on the app can still sell their own ads and will keep 100 percent of the revenue from any ads they sell. The new deal means that NBCUniversal, instead of Apple, will sell any remaining ad inventory. As before, publishers will keep 70 percent of those sales. In a note to her staff, NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino said her organization would create a dedicated sales group for the app. Apple News underwhelmed publishers and advertisers when it launched in 2015, and it certainly hasn’t gotten the focus that similar efforts, like Facebook’s Instant Articles or Google’s AMP program, have received. But anecdotal reports indicate that the app, which comes pre-installed on Apple’s mobile devices, is getting more use now that Apple features it more prominently in its newest iOS 10 software. Apple won’t comment on detailed usage numbers, but says the app now has 70 million unique users. The sales deal is also a reminder that Apple, unlike most of its tech rivals, really doesn’t love the business of selling ads itself. Apple had previously used its iAd app ad network to backfill unsold inventory for Apple News. But earlier this year Apple shut down iAd, which had never taken off. And in general, after a brief flirtation with the ad business, Apple has basically conceded that it makes sense for other people to do, but not for Apple. CEO Tim Cook has even used Apple’s lack of an ad business as a tool to criticize ad-based competitors like Google. But Apple still isn’t ad-free. This fall it started selling search-based app advertising in its App Store. And if it gets more serious about breaking into the TV business, it will certainly have to grapple with ads there, since they fuel that industry. * NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Vox Media, which owns this site. recode_divider More From Recode All the news from Code Enterprise in San Francisco Skilled service providers are less vulnerable to automation, says Thumbtack's economist Here’s how to watch our live interview with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff tonight Why wait for a new smart car when you can update your existing one?

In keeping with the trend, Apple on Monday released iOS 10.2 beta 2 for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The new beta includes a number of refinements and enhancements, but let's be honest — the only thing people really care about are all the new emoji that will come along with Unicode 9.0 support. Shrug emoji? Check. Face palm emoji? Check. Clown emoji? Check. And there are plenty more where that came from... 72 in all, in fact. There are also a few new wallpapers in there, and a number of other additions like the arrival of Apple's new "TV" app, which was unveiled last month during the company's MacBook Pro event. DON'T MISS: Hey Apple, why are you trolling us? iOS 10.2 beta 2 is available immediately as an over the air (OTA) update, and it can also be downloaded from Apple's developer website and installed using iTunes. For the time being, it's only available to people who are registered for Apple's paid developer program (or users who follow the simple instructions to get around Apple's restrictions and gain access to developer betas), but iOS 10 public beta 2 should follow closely behind.

Here though, we have just two rivals going head-to-head: the 2016 Honda Civic RS and 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo. And, based on their most recent individual reviews – the Civic RS scoring 8/10 from Mike Costello, the Elantra SR Turbo scoring the same from Matt Campbell – this has the potential to be a rather close-fought little battle. The cars Intended to be the sportiest 10th-generation Honda Civic sedan model currently available, the 2016 Honda Civic RS is sharply styled and sharply packaged. In a notable departure for the Japanese brand, it also teams a familiar front-wheel-drive layout with a brand-new turbocharged engine. Fresh for the upcoming model year, the 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo too – as its name suggests – incorporates a turbocharged engine. Also front-wheel drive, the SR Turbo sits atop the all-new sixth-generation Elantra range, with the South Korean car maker claiming the more aggressive-looking variant genuinely sports some ‘hot’ potential. We shall see… The Plan Despite both cars wearing ‘sporty’ badges – RS for the Honda and SR for the Hyundai – neither is a hard-core circuit weapon. Hence, while our 200km-plus road loop comprises plenty of curves and challenging bends (as well as urban and highway stretches), this test will be confined to public roads rather than a race track. We’re also not going it alone. For this particular twin test, we’ve called in Australian racing driver, and friend of CarAdvice, Emily Duggan. Previously competing in the Kumho Tyre Australian V8 Touring Car series, Emily spends most of her time racing her own 1998 Hyundai Excel – named Katie – in the Excel Cup. She’s also helped us out before, taking part in our Abarth 595C v Volkswagen Polo GTI comparison. Price and features As we said at the start, this is one comparison that could go down to the wire. And starting with price and features, it’s easy to see why. Priced from $31,790 (before on-road costs), the 2016 Honda Civic RS is exclusively available with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), paired to steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters. It rolls on 17-inch alloy wheels, and standard equipment includes keyless entry and push-button start, automatic LED headlights and daytime running lights, LED fog lights, rain-sensing wipers, heated front seats with an eight-way power adjustable driver’s seat and black leather-appointed upholstery, dual-zone climate control, a three-mode rear-view camera, a ‘LaneWatch’ blind-spot monitoring camera, and front and rear parking sensors. Additional goodies consist of an electric sunroof, electric parking brake with automatic brake hold, hill-start assist, rear privacy glass, a 10-speaker premium stereo, and a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth connectivity and audio streaming, DAB+ digital radio, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Cruise control with speed limiter is standard, although, radar-controlled adaptive cruise, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, and satellite navigation, as well as automatic emergency braking (AEB), a road-departure mitigation system, forward collision warning, lane-departure warning, and lane-keep assist, are reserved for the $33,590 flagship VTi-LX model. Safety is addressed, however, with six airbags, two ISOFIX child-seat anchor points, and tyre pressure monitoring. Available with a choice of two transmissions, the 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo starts at $28,990 (before on-road costs) for the six-speed manual, and $31,290 (before on-road costs) for the seven-speed dual-clutch (DCT) automatic transmission, with paddle shifters, tested here. It too comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, as well as keyless entry and push-button start, automatic HID bi-xenon headlights and LED daytime running lights, rain-sensing wipers, heated front sports bucket seats with a 10-way power adjustable driver’s seat and black leather-appointed upholstery, dual-zone climate control, a rear-view camera with rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors. Additionally, the Hyundai comes with an electric sunroof, hill-start assist, cruise control, a six-speaker stereo, and a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth connectivity and audio streaming, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. And while the Elantra SR Turbo trades the Civic RS’s electric parking brake for an ‘old fashioned’ manual hand brake, the Hyundai pips the Honda with its standard auto-dimming rear-view mirror, blind-spot monitoring, lane-change assist, height-adjustable front passenger seat, heated power wing mirrors, rear air vents, and ‘Smart Boot’ hands-free boot-opening feature. Although the Elantra doesn’t offer the Civic’s tyre pressure monitoring system, the former matches the latter with six airbags and two ISOFIX child-seat anchor points. Plus, the Hyundai is the only one of the pair to boast a five-star ANCAP safety rating (the Civic RS is yet to be tested). Cabins and practicality Regardless of which car gets your vote – or your cash – your daily commute will see you immersed in a largely dark cabin. Crack open the Civic’s heavier, ‘stickier’ doors and you’re welcomed by a wider array of more premium-feeling materials than in the Elantra, with scattered silver highlights breaking up the predominantly black interior. High quality touch points, such as the leather-wrapped gear lever and multifunction steering wheel, are joined by subtle grey stitching seen throughout the cabin, while the driver’s instruments feature a digital speedometer housed within a digital representation of an analogue tachometer. Up front, the Civic’s softly padded seats are vastly comfortable at first sit, and can be lowered well into the floor. They are short on bolstering, though, as well as lumbar support – the latter particularly a killer for long drives. Although some might view the Civic RS’s interior as more ‘refined’, the Elantra SR Turbo’s feels the sportier of the two, thanks largely to its leather-wrapped, flat-bottom multifunction sports steering wheel, red stitching highlights, alloy sports pedals and kick plates, and black headliner. The Hyundai is home to harder, scratchier, plastics and trims, and its floor-mounted boot and fuel flap releases do it no favours. However, its firmer, ‘Sport’-stamped seats are better bolstered, and more bucketed and supportive. Annoyingly though, the seats can’t be lowered enough – particularly frustrating for taller folk. Drivers are provided clear and simple instruments, comprising an analogue speedometer and tachometer, as well as a central digital speed readout. Storage is a funny one in the Honda, as, while the physical space for ‘stuff’ exists, the layout is more than a little ergonomically ‘clunky’. Oddly-shaped door pockets will accommodate larger drink bottles, but can prove somewhat limiting. A shallow, semi-enclosed centre console bin has a slidable armrest that tops two independent cup holders (one removable) and a USB input. There’s also a flat, rubber-lined shelf, forward of the gear lever, with a cut out designed to allow cables to run down to another storage shelf below, housing one USB and one HDMI input, as well as a 12-volt outlet. Frustratingly, in a bid to keep the Civic’s centre stack relatively uncluttered, key climate controls can only be accessed via a sub-menu on the central touchscreen – itself fiddly and unintuitive – and although the Honda’s indicator and wiper stalks are better damped than the Hyundai’s, the RS’s steering wheel controls are far ‘clickier’ than those in the SR Turbo. Relying on a simpler combination of two rotary dials, 10 buttons, and its own stand-alone digital display, the Hyundai’s climate controls are easier to use and quicker to become familiar with, while its central touchscreen is ahead of the Honda’s in terms of general usability. Storage in the Elantra too is more ‘conventional’. There are two rubber-lined cup holders between driver and front passenger, a lidded cubby at the base of the centre stack – housing one AUX and one USB input, a cigarette lighter, and a 12-volt outlet – a slideable lid atop an amply-sized centre console bin containing a second USB input, and a roof-mounted sunglasses holder. Pleasingly, both cars feature adjustable seat belt heights, rake- and reach-adjustable steering wheels, and 60:40 split-fold rear seats. Sadly, while the Civic scores automatic up/down power windows for all four doors, only the Elantra’s driver’s window can offer the same. Moving to the back seats and, again, things are closely fought. With wider rear door apertures slightly aiding ingress and egress into and out of the Elantra, the Civic wins back ground with its basic but comfortable rear bench providing more physical seat base (outboard) to passengers than the Hyundai’s more firmly padded rear seats. Although both cars offer impressive rear legroom for small sedans, it’s the Honda that wins for outright space behind the front seats. The Japanese car further pips its South Korean rival – even if just by a nose – in the toe-room stakes too. Head-room is fairly evenly matched, with both cars offering reasonable clearance for those six-foot and below. Any taller, though, and you may struggle in the back of either car. That said, only the Elantra, with its flat floor, makes three across the second row easily achievable – the Civic’s notable rear floor hump limiting middle-seat practicality. Rear seat occupants in the Hyundai are bestowed adequate rear door pockets, one netted map pocket, a fold-down centre armrest with two cup holders, and those previously mentioned rear air vents. Those in the back of the Honda also receive compact rear door pockets, one map pocket, and a fold-down centre armrest with two cup holders. However, in the Civic, the armrest flaccidly rests on the middle seat – rather than holding a more useful and comfortable square position such as that in the Elantra. The Civic’s lack of rear air vents could also be a plausible deal breaker for some buyers. Continuing back, and it’s the Honda Civic RS that wins the boot war against the Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo – 517 litres with the rear seats up, versus 458L. Access to the Honda’s vast rear end does require negotiating a slightly taller load lip, but it is more spacious than the Hyundai’s – despite actually measuring fractionally smaller at its narrowest point. Oddly, neither boot is home to any ‘handy for shopping’ luggage hooks, and, although both conceal under-floor, space-saver spare wheels, both also still employ outdated, and less-than-ideal, gooseneck hinges. Dropping the rear seats in either car requires an identical two-step process – pulling boot-mounted releases first, then manually dropping seats forward from inside the cabin. However, a clever addition of carpet in the Honda reduces the introduced seat-base lip. Handy. On the road Sat side-by-side, particularly in these two hues – Cosmic Blue for the Civic, Blazing Yellow for the Elantra (a $495 mica paint option) – it’s obvious which brand is going for the sportier image. With its body kit, silver and red ‘SR’ badging, ‘Turbo’ front grille badge, silver grille and front bumper accents, black front lip and rear diffuser, integrated boot-lip spoiler, and twin chrome-tipped exhaust, the 4570mm long, 1800mm wide Hyundai is doing its best to catch eyes. Measuring in 74mm longer and 1mm narrower than the Elantra SR Turbo, the Civic RS is more understated – despite its sharper and more angular lines, and that plastered on rear wing. Unique to its siblings, though, the Civic RS does feature a piano-black grille, piano-black B- and C-pillar garnishes, dark-chrome door handles, and, of course, a silver and red ‘RS’ tailgate badge. As we said at the start, both these ‘sporting sedans’ – as opposed to genuine sports sedans – are powered by turbocharged engines. Under the bonnet of the Honda lies a turbocharged 1.5-litre direct-injection four-cylinder engine, with 127kW of power at 5500rpm and 220Nm of torque between 1700-5500rpm. Without the aid of any engine stop/start technology, Honda claims the powerplant will drink 6.0 litres of 91-octane unleaded fuel every 100km (on the combined cycle). Bringing more poke to the fight, the Hyundai is spurred on by a turbocharged 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine, with 150kW of power at 6000rpm and 265Nm of torque between 1500-4500rpm. Also sans any engine stop/start technology, Hyundai claims the turbocharged Elantra will use 7.2L of 91-octane unleaded fuel every 100km (on the combined cycle). Underneath, both cars feature MacPherson struts up front, and multi-link independent rear suspension (IRS) out back. The Honda rides on 215mm-wide, 50-aspect Bridgestone Turanza tyres, with 282mm ventilated discs up front, and 260mm solid discs out back. The Hyundai’s standard Hankook Ventus tyres are 225mm wide and 45-aspect, and encircle 305mm ventilated front discs and 262mm solid rears. Based on official tare weight figures, at 1385kg, the Elantra SR Turbo is up 54kg on the 1331kg Civic RS. And, while both models share an identical 1563mm rear track, the Hyundai has a fractionally wider front track. Making our way out of town and onto the highway, again, it quickly becomes evident which car has been set up, from the outset, to be sportier in nature. Around town, the Honda impresses with its quiet cabin, supple and compliant ride, and easy manoeuvrability. The CVT is mostly unobtrusive, and Honda’s ‘Motion Adaptive’ electric power steering, while light in terms of weight as well as feedback, is quick, if a little lacking in engagement. Over the same terrain, the Hyundai can’t quite match the Honda for cabin hush, though, its locally-tuned suspension – albeit firmer – is impeccably well resolved, while being almost as pliant as the Civic’s over potholes, speed humps, and the like. The Elantra’s seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is a vastly improved unit to the one initially launched in the 2015 Series II Hyundai Veloster SR Turbo – the same model the Elantra SR Turbo’s revised engine is sourced from. And, while weightier than the Honda’s, the Hyundai’s motor-driven power steering is just as responsive, yet far more communicative. On completion of our highway run, the Civic averages 5.1L/100km to the Elantra’s 5.2L/100km. Still nothing in it. Off the highway and into the hills, this is the chance for us, and Emily, to drive the cars back-to-back through a variety of corners, and over a range of sealed surfaces. Jumping out after her first back-to-back, Emily says, “I started in the Hyundai, but as soon as I drove the Honda, you can completely tell the difference.” “The Honda just glides through corners, where the Hyundai you more have to ‘manoeuvre’. And, even though I like having to work for it on the race track, for everyday driving, some people don’t want that.” With its combination of light, consistent, and accurate steering, a softer yet generally well composed ride, and overall comfort, the Honda Civic RS feels amply accomplished out on a twisty backroad… provided you keep enthusiasm in check, that is. Teaming weightier steering with a firmer ride and more cabin noise, the Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo might fall fractionally short of the Civic RS when driving sedately, but up the pace, and it quickly becomes apparent that the Honda can’t quite keep up with the more exuberant Hyundai. “Racing my Excel, I already had a love for Hyundais, so I was hoping the Elantra SR Turbo was going to be good,” Emily says. “You have to work for it a bit, you’ve got to push it, you’ve got to drive it a bit more, but even though it feels firmer on the road, it’s stuck there. You’ve got stability and manoeuvrability. “In the Hyundai, when you’re going through a corner, you have to work for the rewards. So, if you go through a corner at say 60km/h, you’re not really working for it. But if you want to go through it at say 100km/h, you’ve got to work for it, but it’ll do it. “The Honda is really nice, but the Hyundai is so much more entertaining.” Although the Civic certainly has reasonable levels of dynamism, its light steering is short on feedback, making for a disconnected, less involving, driving experience. Its softer set up means the car rides really well the majority of the time, however, it also equates to more roll and lean. And along with having a rear end that doesn’t mind coming out when pushing hard through corners, the Civic isn’t the biggest fan of mid-corner ruts and corrugations – the only road imperfections to notably upset the ride. Response from either alloy sports pedal is short of immediate, but while the brake delivers progressive and measured retardation when depressed, the throttle isn’t helped by being attached to an engine that feels far smaller than the 93cc that actually separates the Honda’s turbocharged engine from the Hyundai’s. Working in partnership with a now overly excitable CVT unit, the combination means even moderate speed increases result in revs jumping from just below 1500rpm, to up around 2500-3000rpm. And once the engine is delivering some decent surge from 3000rpm and beyond, the sound is not a pleasant one. By contrast, the more firmly sprung Elantra SR Turbo is more secure, planted, and stable, more capable and agile, far more confidence inspiring when pushing on through corners, and simply, more fun. Its heavier steering also brings with it more involvement, engagement, and communication. Over the same mid-corner ruts and corrugations the Civic didn’t enjoy, the Elantra is unfazed – even if you still very much feel them from inside the cabin – maintaining better compliance and composure through these types of harsher imperfections. The Hyundai also has grippier tyres, and firmer and more responsive pedals than the Honda. With the Elantra’s turbocharged engine offering 45Nm more torque than the Civic’s, and from 200rpm lower in the rev range, the Hyundai’s seven-speed DCT gearbox has less work to do than the Honda’s CVT. The gutsier and 23kW more powerful 1.6-litre engine is happy coasting along at close to 1800rpm, and when you do need to up the speed, there’s enough low-rpm urge between 1800-2500rpm to all but negate the need for any drastic gear changes. Even compared with the regular Veloster SR Turbo, the Elantra SR Turbo’s retuned engine works better, feels stronger and more responsive, and has greater flexibility and elasticity in its power delivery. And, measured against the Civic’s high-revving 1.5-litre, it also sounds better at higher rpm. The Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo may not quite be ‘hot’ in terms of outright performance, but, compared with the Honda Civic RS, it’s definitely on the warmer side than the more ‘tepid’ Honda. With our hills run in the books, the fuel consumption fight wraps up neck-and-neck – the Civic averaging 7.4L/100km, the Elantra 7.6L/100km. Warranty and servicing With both cars recommended for scheduled services every 10,000km or 12 months (whichever comes first), it’s the Honda that works out to be $333.00 dearer than the Hyundai to service over the first three years of ownership – totals coming to $1110.00 and $777.00, respectively. The highly competitive South Korean brand also takes the cake for aftersales, with the Elantra SR Turbo covered by a five-year/unlimited kilometre warranty with one-year roadside assist, versus the Civic RS’s standard three-year/100,000km warranty with no road-side assist attached. (An available ‘Honda Warranty Plus’ upgrade does boost coverage to five-years/140,000km and adds five years road-side assist, however, that option comes at a cost of $998.) Emily’s pick Using the metaphor of the Honda as someone dancing a waltz and the Hyundai as a hip-hop dancer, Emily reveals her final choice. “I’m going to pick the Hyundai for three reasons,” Emily says. “First, the interior. In the Honda, it’s like I’m in my own separate cabin. It’s got a beautiful seating position, but the layout really excludes the front passenger, where the Hyundai feels more open. “Secondly, I’m a driver who likes to work, so I’m going to go for the car that rewards you when you work for it. “And thirdly, I do not like the sound of the Honda’s engine and transmission. It just doesn’t sound good.” Not completely besotted by the Elantra, Emily adds, “However, one downside of the Hyundai, for me, is its slightly thicker A-pillar, which is more noticeable and occasionally annoying than the Honda’s. “Realistically, it’s not something that’s going to affect me, but it is a minus.” Verdict We knew from the start, this was going to be close. And it is indeed that. But, when you have two highly capable and competitively specced and priced cars, it’s important to look at their intended role and purpose. So, it all really depends on what you want out of your car, and what you want your car to be. If you’re after a largely comfortable (bar the shortfall in lumbar support), adequately powerful, easy to drive small sedan with a huge boot, some sporty details, and a more mature overall persona, the 2016 Honda Civic RS is a high-quality proposition worth considering. In this test, however, we’re talking about sporty, warm-to-hot sedans. And, if legitimate performance, stacks of ability, and an entertaining, engaging small sedan is what you’re looking for, the 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo is hard to beat. Apart from being the sort of car that can put a smile on your face by the time you get home from work, the Hyundai is also more affordable to purchase and service than the Honda, and offers key highlights above its rival – namely a five-star ANCAP safety rating, rear air vents, blind-spot monitoring and lane-change assist, and a better warranty. Moreover, if you’re keen on a cheeky ‘sleeper’ that could more than upset a few established sports car names, save even more coin and opt for the manual. You’ll have a blast. Provided, of course, you don’t mind stirring your own cogs… Click on the Photos tab for more 2016 Honda Civic RS and 2017 Hyundai Elantra SR Turbo images by Tom Fraser.

When it comes to selling advertising, however, its skills don’t often get similar applause. In a sign that an outside party might be able to better maximize ad inventory related to Apple’s popular iPhones, the technology giant and NBCUniversal have struck a deal under which the Comcast media conglomerate will be the exclusive U.S. seller of commercial space in the Apple News app, which is pre-installed in all of the company’s operating systems and has more than 70 million active users. NBCU said it will also work to develop new advertising products around the app. The partnership was reported previously by tech-news site recode. Publishers who allow their content to be used in Apple News typically sell their own ad inventory and keep the revenue from those efforts. Apple has sold whatever space may remain, and is turning that function over to NBCU. Publishers typically split revenue from those efforts with Apple, and are expected to continue to work with similar terms with NBCUniversal. The deal shows NBCU digging deeper into digital opportunities. In recent months, thanks to the company’s investments in digital outlets like Buzzfeed and Vox, NBCU has offered to sell packages designed to win higher-quality audiences online. Many of the nation’s big media companies have tried to extend into digital inventory as their audiences move from TV to streaming video and mobile devices. And it could give NBCU entrance to new opportunities. Apple continues to develop a broadband-TV service that could over time feature advertising. NBCU named James Kreckler, a senior vice president, to oversee a new sales group that will focus specifically on developing products related to the sale of ad inventory around Apple News. ” Under James’ leadership the group will work closely with advertisers and publishers to develop unique and engaging campaigns across the News app’s premium content,” the company said in a prepared statement.

The discounts get you 25% off the displays for the new MacBook and MacBook Pro notebooks that support USB-C. As of right now, the LG UltraFine 5K display is listed for $974 on Apple’s website, down from the original $1299 pricing. Unfortunately, the display isn’t available to order yet and isn’t expected to until December. The 4K version is now $524, down from the original $699 with a 5-6 week shipping estimate. This is kind of Apple considering that the new MacBook Pros went up in pricing following the refresh. We saw a similar price increase in 2012 when the notebooks when Retina, but those came down in price a year after. Most believe that the pricing will come down this time around as well with the next iteration of the notebook.

Based on the name, Jet White will presumably be a glossy white finish. Right now, the iPhone 7 series comes in five colors: Black, Jet Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. However, don’t get your hopes up too much. The source lacks any real details and would be out of Apple’s traditional product release cycle. Traditionally, Apple adds a new color option with its next-generation redesigns. For example, they added the Gold color with the iPhone 5s, Rose Gold with the iPhone 6s, and Black and Jet Black with the iPhone 7. The only exception would be the white iPhone 4, which released months after the black model in June of 2010. However, the white model was announced alongside the original iPhone 4 with the intention of shipping at the same time, but was delayed due to manufacturing issues. While Macotakara has a decent track record regarding Apple products, it seems to not be confident in this report with it saying “this information may be unreliable.” Tags: iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Jet White About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

This is in addition to the discounts being made on the LG UltraFine 4K and 5K displays. Starting today, Apple’s USB-C accessories will have lower pricing up until December 31, with a few exceptions. USB-C to USB Adapter ($19 → $9) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49 → $29) USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25 → $19) USB-C Charge Cable (2 m) ($19) USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35 → $29) 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49) 61W USB-C Power Adapter ($69) 87W USB-C Power Adapter ($79) While Apple is offering no discounts on its power adapters, the company is discounting third-party USB-C accessories sold through its retail locations as well, which includes SanDisk’s USB-C SD card reader which went from $49 to $29. Here’s Apple’s official statement: “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility. “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” Tags: MacBook, MacBook Pro, Thunderbolt 3, USB-C About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 Apple News hits 70 million users as NBCUniversal inks exclusive deal to sell in-app ads Zac Hall - 1 week ago @apollozac apple news View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple announced at the start of this year that its iAd network was going away over the summer, which affected advertising in its story aggregating News app in iOS 9 and later. Today Recode is reporting that Apple has inked an exclusive deal with NBCUniversal that lets them run ad sales for Apple News. Publishers who put content on the app can still sell their own ads and will keep 100 percent of the revenue from any ads they sell. The new deal means that NBCUniversal, instead of Apple, will sell any remaining ad inventory. As before, publishers will keep 70 percent of those sales. In a note to her staff, NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino said her organization would create a dedicated sales group for the app. The report notes that Apple will still allow publishers to sell their own ads, but NBCUniversal is picking up the ad sales business that Apple decided it didn’t want a part of earlier this year. The dedicated group within NBCUniversal that will be in charge of this effort suggests it will be a significant shift from Apple’s current advertising efforts within the News app. The change is set to take effect in January according to the report. Recode also reports that Apple says its News app is now up to 70 million unique users; Apple News is pre-installed on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with iOS 9 and later, but the service is only available in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Apple News had around 40 million users this time last year. Nieman Lab has also published a piece that goes deeper into the numbers behind Apple News. The article dives into growth in Apple News readership that CNN and Bloomberg have seen since iOS 10: CNN, for example, says its Apple News content got 36.5 million unique readers in September, a major increase from August’s 5 million. Its pageviews also increased significantly to 274 million, up from 43 million a month before. The increase seems to be in part due to notifications from Apple News that started working after the iOS 10 redesign. CNN’s first alert through Apple News reached 188,000 users when iOS 10 launched in mid-September. That number increased to 3.7 million users by October 30. Bloomberg, too, has benefited from the update. Unique visitors to its Apple News content spiked 500 percent in October, thanks to a combination of regular inclusion in the Apple News “Top Stories” section and interest in its breaking news notifications. Monetization and seeing a similar effect across other publications like Slate, for instance, remains an opportunity as the piece details. The Apple News deal with NBCUniversal will likely tackle the first half of that equation. You can find 9to5Mac, 9to5Toys, 9to5Google, and Electrek on Apple News.

Mac Otakara has accurately leaked information in the past about upcoming Apple products, but the Japanese site warns their source “may not be reliable” this time around -  so don’t get too excited about Apple’s new “Jet White” color option yet. Previously, Mac Otakara has leaked information about Apple’s plans, including the new Jet Black Color and no headphone jack on the iPhone 7. The site was also correct about other iPhone 7 features, like its name and Home button. Apple announced its new iPhone 7 would be available in five different colors: Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Matte Black and Jet Black. It wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if the Cupertino company decided to add a “Jet White” color option. Related Stories LG V20 Vs.

Now, a new rumour suggests Apple is preparing to unveil a 'Jet White' colour option for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, possibly in time for the festive season. As reported by Japanese blog Macotakara, citing 'supply chain sources', the company could be adding a new colour option to the handset's range of hues, though it warns the information 'may be unreliable'. Related: iPhone 7 review You can already pick up Apple's latest handset in the aforementioned Black finishes, plus either Silver, Gold, or Rose Gold. And while the current black option offers a matte finish, the Jet Black finish adds a shiny layer to the iPhone's casing, suggesting that if a 'Jet White' option does exist, it will also come with the shiny finish. The iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black Apple has never added a new colour option to its iPhone range once a particular model has been released, so we're particularly sceptical about this latest rumour. However, the company is hoping for a return to growth following declining sales year-over-year in several quarters this past year, so could take the step of adding a new colour option to revive its profits. Apple's annual revenue declined year on year for the first time since 2001 this year, falling from $233.7 billion in 2015 to $217 billion in 2016. Related: iPhone 8 – Everything we know Either way, the suggestion of a White iPhone seems dubious, not to mention the report itself is very vague, but we'll likely find out whether the rumours are true very soon. In the mean time, speculation surrounding the iPhone 8 is already beginning to mount, with some suggesting the phone will arrive with a full-face display and no home button. Stay tuned for the latest on the iPhone 7 and its upcoming successor in the coming months.

Here's why. The CPU Isn't Market-Leading Apple's MacBook Pro comes standard with an Intel Core i5 processor on the 13-inch models and Intel Core i7 on 15-inch options. Many market analysts noted that Apple's processor choices were a little anemic compared with higher-end i7s found in competing computers. While the latest MacBook Pro is more powerful than its predecessor, in a race against high-end notebooks, it's trailing many competitors—including devices from Lenovo's Yoga line and several boutique vendors. This Won't Compete With Graphics-Heavy Competitors Similarly, Apple's MacBook Pro comes with either Intel Iris graphics or the Radeon Pro 450 or 455 out of the box. Again, those GPUs are somewhat powerful and nice improvements over the chips in the previous MacBook Pro, but they can't compete with higher-end GeForce chips in many Windows-based competitors. Gamers and creatives might find a better solution elsewhere. There's a Lack of 'Pro' Features Critics have been outspoken about the MacBook Pro's rather un-pro-like features. This is a computer that ships with 16GB of RAM, at most. While that's fine for consumers, for professional users or the creatives Apple is trying to target, it's not enough. Add that to the lack of an SD card slot and just minor innovations to core components such as the screen, keyboard and touchpad, and it doesn't feel like a "pro" device. Where's the Touch Screen? Apple executives have said in several interviews of late that the company has no interest in adding a touch screen to its notebooks and is content with the Touch Bar. However, several Windows-based competitors, including the Surface Book, are now bundling touch screens, and sales suggest the feature is a must-have for many customers. Apple's decision to eschew a touch screen might make the MacBook Pro a little less appealing compared with competitors. The Ports Are a Disappointment Apple said at its press event that its decision to include four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the MacBook Pro reflects its desire to keep up with the pace of innovation. However, many consumers are not pleased with Apple's decision, saying the company should have included standard USB ports, an SD card slot and other ports in the MacBook Pro. After all, similarly thin and high-end competitors from Dell and Acer, among other companies, offer those ports. Why can't Apple? The Cost Is High The Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro starts at $1,799 and $1,999 for the two 13-inch models. On the 15-inch side, customers can expect to pay $2,399 and $2,799. Any customization to the MacBook Pro will send its already high price soaring. Not everyone is willing to spend so much money on a notebook—especially when comparably equipped options in the Windows world are available at much lower prices. Customers Will Need Accessories In addition to paying thousands for a MacBook Pro, customers should expect to spend a considerable amount in adapters that will let them connect accessories to the computer. Apple's decision to offer only Thunderbolt 3 ports in the MacBook Pro means anyone running a USB external hard drive or certain displays will need an adapter to use them with Apple's new computer. It might not take much for the MacBook Pro's total cost of ownership to soar after customers realize the accessories they want to use won't work without an adapter. Battery Life Could Be Better Apple says its MacBook Pro can deliver 10 hours of battery life when continually surfing the internet or watching movies. While that's not necessarily bad, it's not industry-leading, either. Several competitors come with much longer battery life. The Microsoft Surface Book, for instance, promises up to 16 hours of battery life on a single charge. Apple needs to catch up on the battery side to appeal to power users who expect something better. It's Impossible to Repair Some notebook owners like the idea of easily repairing simple notebook problems or updating the machine with new components when the time is right. Those folks will be out of luck with the MacBook Pro. Apple's computer is nearly impossible to open and doesn't offer any access to its motherboard or important components for upgrading. In true Apple form, this is a locked-down computer that won't deliver the level of repairability and upgrade ease many have enjoyed on the Windows side. Competitors Are Outstanding Given these shortcomings, some might be wondering what else is out there. And unfortunately for Apple, there's quite a bit out there. The MacBook Pro is competing with outstanding competitors, including Alienware's many high-end machines and some of Lenovo's professional-use notebooks in the ThinkPad line. Even Microsoft's Surface Book is a nice alternative. Apple's MacBook Pro is nice, but it's going to find a highly competitive market when it hits store shelves.

The computer, which Apple introduced at a media briefing in October, offers several improvements over the previous model, including support for Apple's Touch ID to enhance security and a new Touch Bar placed above the keyboard to provide contextual control over what's happening on-screen. Apple has called the MacBook Pro one of its biggest computing innovations, and many of its customers—home users and business users alike—are expressing interest in the machine. But a closer look suggests that the latest MacBook Pro might not be as appealing and competitive as the company might want customers to believe. For one, the computer uses lower-powered components than competing models. Also, its price is high, and it will require early adopters to pay for several optional accessories. The MacBook Pro might look nice on paper, but the computer might prove disappointing after users get a close look at them and put them through their paces.           Don Reisinger is a freelance technology columnist.

Publishers who put content on the app can still sell their own ads and will keep 100 percent of the revenue from any ads they sell. The new deal means that NBCUniversal, instead of Apple, will sell any remaining ad inventory. As before, publishers will keep 70 percent of those sales. In a note to her staff, NBCUniversal sales boss Linda Yaccarino said her organization would create a dedicated sales group for the app. Apple News underwhelmed publishers and advertisers when it launched in 2015, and it certainly hasn’t gotten the focus that similar efforts, like Facebook’s Instant Articles or Google’s AMP program, have received. But anecdotal reports indicate that the app, which comes pre-installed on Apple’s mobile devices, is getting more use now that Apple features it more prominently in its newest iOS 10 software. Apple won’t comment on detailed usage numbers, but says the app now has 70 million unique users. The sales deal is also a reminder that Apple, unlike most of its tech rivals, really doesn’t love the business of selling ads itself. Apple had previously used its iAd app ad network to backfill unsold inventory for Apple News. But earlier this year Apple shut down iAd, which had never taken off. And in general, after a brief flirtation with the ad business, Apple has basically conceded that it makes sense for other people to do, but not for Apple. CEO Tim Cook has even used Apple’s lack of an ad business as a tool to criticize ad-based competitors like Google. But Apple still isn’t ad-free. This fall it started selling search-based app advertising in its App Store. And if it gets more serious about breaking into the TV business, it will certainly have to grapple with ads there, since they fuel that industry. * NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Vox Media, which owns this site. recode_divider More From Recode All the news from Code Enterprise in San Francisco Skilled service providers are less vulnerable to automation, says Thumbtack's economist Here’s how to watch our live interview with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff tonight Why wait for a new smart car when you can update your existing one?

Apple has done away with "legacy" connectors, even though most are still modern standards. The MacBook Pro, launched two weeks ago, relies solely on USB-C for wired connectivity with other devices. There's also a 3.5mm audio jack, contrasting with Apple's removal of analogue audio from the iPhone 7. You won't find a standard USB port, SD card slot or HDMI port anywhere on Apple's latest laptops though. Apple views all these connectors as "legacy" standards that aren't worth supporting, ignoring how many of the professionals the MacBook Pro targets still rely on them. Apple sells a range of dongles that allow you to convert older connectors to USB-C. The typical MacBook buyer will probably need at least the $19 USB to USB-C adapter. The $19 Lightning to USB adapter may also prove useful, since it allows an iPhone to be connected to the Mac. Out of the box, there's no longer a way of connecting Apple's two most important products together. Apple's dongle range now includes a total of 17 different items. Purchasing them all would cost hundreds of dollars. The company has been widely mocked for claiming to create an all-inclusive ecosystem and then releasing a laptop that doesn't connect with its existing products and comes without key functionality built-in. In response to the complaints from customers and the press, Apple slashed its dongle prices at the end of last week. The USB to USB-C adapter and Lightning to USB-C adapter are now $9 each. Similar price cuts are available across the range, although they don't solve the inconvenience of using a dongle in the first place. For a company that prides itself on quality and user experience, Apple appears to have lost its way. The MacBook Pro targets creative and professional users who use their Macs for graphic design, music creation, video editing and gaming every day. Apple's seemingly never-ending quest to make its products slimmer sacrifices the functionality that makes these tasks possible though. The MacBook Pro needs a dongle to transfer photos from a camera, connect to an external monitor or just work with a traditional mouse. Last week, Phil Schiller, Apple's vice president of marketing, defended the removal of the SD card slot from the MacBook Pro. He said the company decided to drop support for memory cards because "it's a bit of a cumbersome slot" that leaves the card overhanging the edge of the keyboard. Whether creatives would rather have an SD card extend a few millimetres or use a separate cable to connect a bulky dongle remains to be seen. With its price cut, Apple is attempting to move away from the criticism and convince people to progress into the future. The company said it wants to "accelerate" the growth of next-generation peripherals which look set to be dominated by USB-C. "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition," Apple commented to the BBC. "We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem." The dongle price cuts will remain live for the rest of the year, cutting down the cost of MacBook Pro adoption and making it a little easier to get "legacy" devices like the iPhone, professional cameras and televisions working with the MacBook Pro. The new laptop starts at $1,499 for the 13-inch model without Apple's new Touch Bar.

With the arrival of the new MacBook Pro there’s been no shortage of commentary about the ports you’ll find on your Apple smartphone versus those you now get on your Apple notebook, and a fair amount of that has not been flattering. The “Made For iPhone/iPod/iPad” MFi program has been blamed by many for that disparity, but it may not be quite the culprit it’s accused of being. You have to go back in time a few years to understand the port palaver Apple currently finds itself in. USB Type-C has arrived far too late for the iPhone 5: in 2012, when Apple announced it would switch from the 30-pin dock connector to Lightning, the generic USB plug was microUSB. That had a number of disadvantages compared to Apple’s homegrown connector. For consumers, the most obvious advantage was its reversibility. Lighting, unlike microUSB, could be plugged in either way up, meaning less fumbling as you’re trying to charge your iPhone without turning on the light on your nightstand. It was also considerably smaller, which allowed Apple to save on space and make the thinner devices consumers were asking for. For Apple, though, one big consideration was Lightning’s support for the MFi program. Without it, the Cupertino firm couldn’t control the aftermarket accessory ecosystem that has proved so lucrative: chargers, docks, speakers, peripherals, and more. Manufacturers of those must cough up a tithe and include Apple’s MFi chip to ensure the iPhone and iPad gives the green-light when they’re connected. Times change, though, and now USB has not only a retort to Lightning, but many improvements over it. USB Type-C has, as a connector, the same reversibility advantage as Lighting did; it supports data, video, and power – the latter at significantly higher wattages – and is bidirectional. It can also be used for both USB 3.1, as on the 12-inch MacBook, and Thunderbolt 3, as on the new late-2016 MacBook Pro range. As we’ve seen with the latest Apple notebooks, the company isn’t just dipping a toe in with Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C, but embracing it wholeheartedly. It’s not hard to understand why, either: it allows for thinner devices, more flexibility in how ports are used, and is – at 40 Gbps, on paper at least – the fastest consumer interconnect around right now. Half-hearted would’ve been including a couple of Thunderbolt 3 ports on the new MacBook Pro but keeping legacy USB Type-A, perhaps, too: instead, Apple dove in all the way. That’s only drawn attention to the fact that the port of choice on Mac is now very different from the port of choice on iPhone. Much has been made of the fact that you need to buy a new cable (or adapter) in order to physically connect your new MacBook Pro to your new iPhone 7. Even with Apple pushing wireless sync, either to iTunes on a computer or to iCloud, that disparity is still fairly embarrassing. Why can’t the iPhone have USB Type-C too? The assumption by many is that it’s an control-freak thing: Apple refuses to give up on its stranglehold on third-party accessory makers. However, the technology for Apple to resurrect the MFi program only using USB Type-C rather than Lightning already exists. In fact, it’s baked into the USB Type-C specification itself. And, before you start accusing the USB 3.0 Promoter Group of being anti-consumer, the whole point of adding the system in was to protect end-users from potentially damaging their phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices. It’s called the Universal Serial Bus Type-C Authentication Specification, and it was introduced in March 2016 as a way of preventing possibly nefarious accessories from damaging or infecting USB-C hardware. Security researchers had already demonstrated how an ill-intentioned device – or even a cable – plugged into the USB-C port of a device could install malware or extract data. Even easier, but more destructive, it could simply blast the victim device with more power than it was rated for: after all, Type-C theoretically supports up to 100W, though only with the right cable. The Authentication Specification helps avoid that, by validating the accessory device either via a USB Power Delivery message or a USB data bus control message. In short, if you plug in something non-compliant, the host device can refuse to work with it. However, it also allows organizations to select what will and won’t work. That might be an enterprise limit on unverified USB storage being mounted by a company-issued laptop. The specification covers signing of products “owned and controlled by a particular organization” but also “of a particular type from a particular manufacturer with particular characteristics.” Product designers can also add to the specification if they so wish. So, at least in theory, Apple could reboot the MFi program using USB Type-C Authentication, and force accessory-makers to cough up for signing if they want to work properly with future iOS devices. However, there’s a big gulf between something being technically possible, and it being practical in the real world. It’s easy to forget the furore around the demise of 30-pin Dock Connector. It had been a fact of iOS life since the original iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, and when Apple decided it wanted to reclaim some of the space it monopolized, many consumers were livid. Several years-worth of accumulated accessories were made incompatible without adapters; spare chargers and car docks were suddenly unfriendly, just because you’d upgraded to the newest iPhone. At the time, Apple pointed to the myriad advantages Lightning offered over its chunkier predecessor, and that – along with the Cupertino firm’s usual bulldozing – proved enough to cement the new connector as the fresh status-quo. Now, indeed, it’s hard to imagine a time when such a vast plug was normal. Unfortunately, the argument for switching from Lightning to USB Type-C is a trickier thing to make stick. You can’t really pitch a size improvement, as the two are about the same, and both plugs are reversible. Certainly, there’d be no huge increase in battery size supported as a result, or a dramatically thinner device, either of which would be an easy pitch. Apple added USB 3.0 support on the larger iPad Pro, and though it’s not ubiquitous across every iOS device, it means there’s no significant speed improvement it can emphasize for changing to Type-C either. That leaves compatibility with the charger for your new MacBook Pro, and certainly it’s convenient to be able to power a number of devices with a single cable. Problem is, the Mac audience is much smaller than the iPhone audience: many of the people in the latter cohort don’t have a Mac at all, never mind a brand new MacBook Pro costing $1.5k or more. It’d be handy for those with the budget to live on the cutting edge, but that’s a drop in the relative ocean of overall iPhone buyers. In short, the arguments for making another change in iPhone and iPad port “only” four or so years from the last huge change just aren’t as compelling as they’d need to be to pacify users. And, while the technology to corral the third-party accessory market is there, it’s unclear just how much traction Apple would get with those manufacturers, and indeed iPhone fans suddenly discovering that – once again – their peripherals aren’t compatible. Against all that, a $19 USB-C to Lightning cable, or even a nine dollar USB-C to USB adapter and the Lightning cable which came with the iPhone, start to sound a lot more practical. Apple may have early-adopted itself into a Lightning hangover, but it’s one that looks unlikely to pass any time soon. The technology might be there, but user temperament certainly isn’t.

The iPhone 7 line may be pressured by weak demand in China, slower sales of the smaller version of the iPhone 7 and the lack of a new 4-inch, less expensive iPhone SE, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, cited by 9to5Mac. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. KGI expects 40 million to 50 million iPhones to ship in the first calendar quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million in the year-ago period (Apple's fiscal second quarter), 9to5Mac reported. Without a new iPhone SE model in the spring, that quarter could see shipments of 35 million to 40 million units, KGI estimates, below the 40.4 million posted in July 2016. The estimates come despite Cook's recent comments that Apple would return to growth after posting the first annual decline in revenue since the dot-com bubble. Cook highlighted LTE data adoption in China as a sign that the situation there would improve in the next two fiscal quarters. "Looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive," Cook told investors in a conference late last month. "It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. So we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us." With 45.5 million units, the company reported more iPhone sales than expected during the most recent quarter. Apple was expected to report it shipped 44.8 million iPhones. Still, iPhone shipments fell 5 percent, down from 48.04 million a year ago, according to analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. Cook highlighted the lower-priced iPhone SE in Apple's July earnings, saying phone is popular in developed and emerging markets, in line with independent research from IDC in the second quarter. But in key markets like India, the iPhone SE has "failed to make any significant impact in the premium segment," IDC estimates. Meanwhile, Chinese competitors like Huawei have gotten traction beyond Asia, growing its year-over-year smart phone shipments by 70 percent in the third calendar quarter in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Canalyst estimated on Monday.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 7, 2016 8:41 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple iOS Mobile & Wireless Apple iOS 9 iPhone 7 Comments With developed economies facing political and economic crisis, Apple’s decision to focus on emerging economies makes absolute sense as the company seeks to maintain growth. It has already seen significant success in China, but its attempts to expand its business in India have so far been thwarted by local economic policy. Apple’s response India demands that 30 percent of the components used in consumer electronics sold in the country be sourced domestically. That kind of makes sense, given that lack of that kind of economic policy in other developed economies has transformed these into low paid service industries, but for Apple the challenge is that the majority of its products are manufactured in China. Apple is now speaking with India’s government in search of suitable incentives that might enable it to move some of its manufacturing to the country. These moves come as Apple continues to make significant investments in R&D and iOS development centers in key markets worldwide, from Japan to China, Italy, India and beyond. In India these investments mean it intends employing 4,000 people in its new Hyderabad Maps development facility. Apple has also made several attempts to convince the nation to lift its manufacturing restriction, has unsuccessfully sought to sell used iPhones and will soon begin opening Apple retail stores. Apple’s manufacturing partner, Foxconn, was previously reported to be building a factory in India’s Maharashtra. Today’s report suggests Apple plans to be a part of this development. The big plan Speaking in July, Apple CEO, Tim Cook, said: “India is now one of our fastest growing markets. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51 per cent year-on-year.” This continued into the just gone quarter, when Cook confirmed sales in the country grew by more than 50 percent, year-on-year, Cook said during his recent fiscal call. "Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity," he said. "The truth is there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there's a lot of headroom there in our mind. So, we're working very hard to realize that opportunity," he explained. Beyond iPhone The challenge for Apple is that the average smartphone expenditure in India is around $150 while the iPhone SE costs c.$600. However, while some analysts think the relatively high price may limit Apple’s impact in the market, Cook seems to believe that delivering great value added packages may change the pattern. (He hasn’t said so overtly but did mention the recently announced free 4G access deal with Reliance Jio.) The tendency to see Apple’s adventures in India as a zero sum game based around iPhone sales is mistaken. Apple has a big presence in many different sectors in this post BYOD enterprise tech age, so it's worth considering its local business potential, given that the $100 billion Indian software services industry employs around 3 million staff and is forecast to grow at 13-15%. in the end, Apple's long-term future is not going to be defined by the next 13-weeks of iPhone sales, whatver more short-sighted analysts may believe. A thousand years The challenges Apple faces in developing its business in India are unlikely to shift overnight, but it is in position to invest time and money in developing its presence there, particularly given the Android industry has begun consuming itself. “We’re not here for a quarter, or two quarters, or the next year, or the next year,” Cook recently told NDTV. “We’re here for a thousand years.” Google+?

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 Apple begins charging credit cards for MacBook Pro with Touch Bar preorders ahead of shipping Jordan Kahn - 1 week ago @JordanKahn MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit An increasing number of customers that ordered Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models report having their credit card charged this morning ahead of Apple’s earliest expected shipping date of November 17. A few of us on the 9to5Mac team have also had our cards charged today. Apple typically begins shipping devices shortly after charging credit cards, but so far it appears to have not yet changed the status of orders to provide an expected delivery day. Apple usually changes orders from “Processing” to “Shipped” after charging cards, at which time customers should have a more accurate estimated delivery date provided compared to Apple’s original estimated week-long window. Apple first unveiled the new MacBook Pros on October 27 and began accepting orders the same day. It’s already started shipping an entry-level 13-inch model that includes traditional function keys, but the new model with Apple’s Retina Touch Bar display embedded in the keyboard started with a shipping estimate of 2-3 weeks before increasing to 4-5 weeks due to demand. Apple said the new models set an online sales record, but it didn’t provide specifics on sales numbers. Apple on occasion ends up shipping pre-ordered devices ahead of original shipping estimates, as was the case for some customers with the recent iPhone 7 launch. But we’ll have to wait until Apple begins changing orders to “Shipped” to find out which end of its original shipping window it will end up on. Last week Apple announced price drops for its USB-C accessories to help ease the transition to the new MacBook Pros that include USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, and it also offered limited time discounts on the new displays it’s releasing in collaboration with LG. The new 5K LG UltraFine display is expected to become available in December, as are many updates to apps that will support the new Touch Bar. Apple expects to update Logic Pro X, its pro audio suite, with support for the Touch Bar by early next year. Apple just charged my card for my new 2016 15" MacBook Pro. Should be shipping soon.

X Challenge to Apple’s Athenry data centre fast-tracked Commercial Court takes one of two legal challenges on list but defers ruling on other Mon, Nov 7, 2016, 16:07 Updated: Mon, Nov 7, 2016, 16:36 Aodhan O'Faolain         A legal challenge to the planned €850 million Apple data centre in Co Galway will be fast-tracked by the Commercial Court. Sinéad Fitzpatrick and Allan Daly initiated the case in the High Court last month over An Bórd Pleanála’s decision last August to grant permission for the data centre, one of eight such proposed developments, near Athenry. Ms Fitzpatrick and Mr Daly, of Lisheenkyle, Athenry, which is close to the proposed centre, claim the permission is invalid on grounds including that the board failed to carry out an proper environmental impact assessment of the proposed development. Ms Fitzpatrick says she and her neighbours are concerned about the development, particularly about the enormous energy demand it would create in the location. On a full build out, the development has a bigger energy demand than the greater Dublin area, she says. There appeared to be little or no analysis of the environmental impacts of this increase in power demand, she claimed. On Monday, lawyers for Apple Distribution International, the entity seeking to develop the data centre, which is a notice party to the action, applied to have the case admitted to the fast-track Commercial Court list. In a sworn statement seeking transfer to the list, Catherine Kearney, a director of Apple Distribution International and vice-president of operations for Europe, India, Africa and the Middle East, said the company wanted the action heard “as expeditiously as possible”. The proposed centres are “critical pieces of infrastructure required to support the worldwide demand for global storage necessary to cater for the rapid expansion in wireless electronic communication, entertainment and work”, she said. Exponential growth “Apple has experienced an exponential growth in the demand for data processing and storage and expects this trend to continue in the future,” she said. The growth in demand for Apple’s cloud computing and storage service means a large number of large data centres need to be built on a phased basis to deal with the demand, it was stated. ADVERTISEMENT The Athenry project is expected to create hundreds of jobs both directly and indirectly. The case, one of two challenges brought over the proposed facility, was admitted to the list by Mr Justice Brian Cregan. Rory Mulcahy SC, for Apple, said it would also be applying to have the other action, brought by Wicklow landowner Brian McDonagh, transferred to the Commercial Court. Apple want both challenges heard together and a hearing date fixed for March 2017, counsel said. Representing himself, Mr McDonagh told Mr Justice Cregan he was objecting to the fast-tracking of the cases, arguing it would prejudice his action. Mr Justice Cregan said he was satisfied to admit the Fitzpatrick/Daly case to the Commercial Court list but nothing would be done in respect of Mr McDonagh’s action until that matter returns before the court next Monday.       Topics: Courts Allan Daly Brian Mcdonagh Catherine Kearney Sinead Fitzpatrick An Bord Pleanála Apple Athenry Read More Over 2,000 march in Athenry in support of Apple data centre Apple seeks to fast-track challenge to €850m Galway data centre Apple remains stuck in mud in fields of Athenry Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Agribusiness & Food Greencore shares rise sharply on news of $746m acquisition in US Work Lucy Kellaway: I don’t want my employers to feel my pain English Soccer Bastian Schweinsteiger begins talks over move to Chicago Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Irish firms more worried about Brexit than British counterparts 00:01 Investors focus on Trump’s infrastructure spending plans 23:07 Cantillon: To spend or not to spend – FF seem to want it both ways 19:49 Court to fast-track legal challenge to Apple data centre in Athenry 19:25 Cantillon: Irish pension savers cautiously watch bond markets 19:18 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

But before Battersea Power Station is transformed, stunning photographs have shown what it looks like today. Peter Dazeley took the fascinating pictures inside the historic 1930s building on the River Thames in London. And this is the final glimpse of the iconic building before it becomes Apple's state-of-the-art UK headquarters. The technology giant will occupy six floors in the central boiler house of the former coal-fired power station. The £9billion development will be home to some 1,400 Apple workers but with room for more than double that. In August, Apple - which will have about half a million sq ft of office space - threatened to cut jobs in Europe. This came after Brussels ordered it to repay £11billion; the biggest tax bill ever imposed outside the US.

Watch Out For Fake Retailer Apps On Your iPhone This Holiday Season Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Watch Out For Fake Retailer Apps On Your iPhone This Holiday Season Image courtesy of William Hook November 7, 2016 10:50 am EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc seems legit counterfeit apps clones ios apple iphone It feels like pretty much every major chain retailer out there now has an accompanying app they want you to download to your phone. These are supposed to enhance your shopping experience, provide you with targeted discounts, and provide the retailer with a wealth of useful data. What they aren’t supposed to do, though, is steal your private information — but there are a whole lot of clones out there that do just that, and in the run-up to the holiday shopping season, they’re popping up like mad. Counterfeit and clone apps have always been endemic to the ecosystem of your phone. While they’re known more for showing up on Google Play and Android devices than on iOS and Apple ones, neither system has ever been completely immune. Meanwhile, we’re barreling into the time of year where basically everyone starts doing a whole lot more shopping, and that means more people are going to see “download our app now and save money” signs at the stores they visit. The combination of the two makes this the prime moment for fakes to start showing up in droves, the New York Times reports. Some of the fakes are comparatively harmless. They don’t do anything for you, but they don’t really do anything to harm you other than displaying a whole bunch of annoying ads. Others, however, are downright dangerous. Putting payment card information into a fake app is basically like having it stolen. Some fake apps are malware that can steal information from your phone, or ransomware, that can hold your device and its contents hostage until you pay up. Apple has, metaphorically, a higher wall around its garden than Google does. It’s easy by design to put new apps on Google Play; reaching the App Store for iOS devices, though, theoretically comes with a stricter review process. That said, the NYT points out, Apple doesn’t have dedicated personnel screening every single app every single day, and plenty that aren’t obviously malicious right on the face of them will get through. The NYT points out that Apple quietly removed hundreds of fakes and clones after the paper asked about them, and that more were removed after another media outlet highlighted them last night. Both stores that do and don’t have real apps have clones aplenty looking for you online. Dollar Tree has no official app, for example, so the one that consumers find on iTunes can grab everyone. Others are more pervasive in a different way. Foot Locker has three official apps, the NYT explains, but there are 16 clothing- and shoe-related apps that are made by “Footlocke,” many of which are designed to look like legitimate apparel retailers. In the long run, though, the onus is still on consumers to read very, very carefully before they install any software. Its users’ responsibility to flag anything suspicious, and to double- and triple-check anything before agreeing to it. “We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure,” a spokesperson for Apple told the NYT. “We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” Beware, iPhone Users: Fake Retail Apps Are Surging Before Holidays [New York Times] November 7, 2016 By Kate Cox@kcoxdc seems legit counterfeit apps clones ios apple iphone Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related virtual wallets Tap Or Scan Here To Pay: Know Your Mobile Payment Apps copycatters Researchers: iOS Bug Allows Malware To Replace Your Phone’s Real Apps No Breach Wishes Here Flaw In Target’s Wish List App Feature Can Expose Phone Numbers, Emails, Other Personal Info once more unto the breach Apple Pulls Malware-Infected Apps After App Store Suffers Its First Major Breach apple babble Apple To Launch Photon Death Ray (Or Maybe Just More iPhones & A Watch) Previous Toys ‘R’ Us Will Once Again Open At 5 PM On Thanksgiving, Stay Open For 30 Hours Straight Next McDonald’s Preparing To Launch Mobile Order-And-Pay Tech Next Year Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Video: Apple’s Craig Federighi on the new MacBook Pro, Touch Bar and a touchscreen Mac By Christian Zibreg, Nov 7, 2016 Tweet 9 Comments The MacBook Pro controversy isn’t dying down yet so Apple dispatched Craig Federighi, its Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, who discussed the new Pro and thinking behind the Touch Bar feature in a short video interview with CNET in which he also defends no-touchscreen Mac stance. He goes on to reveal that Apple had in fact built several touchscreen prototypes that however didn’t impress Apple executives enough to greenlight the project. The video runs five minutes and twenty seconds long. Federighi is clearly excited for the Touch Bar, the new MacBook Pro’s marquee feature. Other Apple executives went on a PR offensive following the unexpected backlash over some of the controversial MacBook Pro features, like the removal of all ports in favor of USB-C, yesteryear’s Intel Skylake chips that don’t support 32GB RAM and more. Phil Schiller, Apple’s marketing boss, recently explained the reasoning behind the removal of an SD card slot while Chief Design Officer Jony Ive defended Apple’s stance on not releasing a touchscreen Mac. I wouldn’t go as far as to call these interviews damage control on Apple’s part. That’s because Apple’s been saying for years that a touchscreen Mac wouldn’t make much sense from a productivity standpoint due to the Gorilla arm syndrome. According to Ive, Apple didn’t feel that the Mac was the right place for a multitouch touchscreen “for a bunch of practical reasons”.

Rolf Bause I have to say: I share Spanish guys view on that matter way more than Craigs 🙂 Jayy Can any spanish speakers tell me the context of that subbed video? I’m curious to know what’s so funny! Lol FFF84 Even so I still think that the touch bar is so gimmicky (and I might be wrong). Because your eyes normally concentrate on the the screen and due to the fact that the touch bar has a dynamic content and you can’t feel it like keys you need to look each time you want to used. I think every one how has a Nintendo 3DS knows what I means. you (or at least I) can never use both screens at the same time or use one while looking at the other. askep3 At the same time, look at the pages/word touch bar usage, it takes the entire tool bar at the top and puts it on the touch bar. Either way you would have looked away from your writing, and moved the mouse to click on something like bold or italics, but now instead you can just tap FFF84 But in my opinion (and personal experience with the 3DS) looking elsewhere on the screen is not as bad as looking on the keyboard. Anyway I might be wrong and testing the bar is the only way to find out. Unfortunately I’m not going to be able to as I decided not to upgrade my mid 2012 mac pro because of the pricing. In Europe base model 13″ with touch bar starts at 1999Euro. 1699 for the one without a bar.

By Owen Hughes November 7, 2016 16:39 GMT Apple has been criticised for dropping legacy ports from the new MacBook ProApple It wouldn't be inaccurate to say that Apple has left a lot of its customers royally miffed in recent months. After dropping the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, the company has managed to irk fans once again by launching a new MacBook Pro that misses out on standard connectors like HDMI and USB-A ports, Lightning 2 and SD card slot. In an attempt to reconcile with fans now looking at Christmas lists filled with dongles, Apple has dropped the price for all of its USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 adapters, as well as a handful of third-party peripherals. The new MacBook Pro, which comes sporting the shiny, new-fangled Touch Bar, only comes with ports for the new-ish USB-C standard. This means anyone who plans on upgrading from an older Apple laptop will find their collection of power, data and AV cables quite useless on the new machine. The price cut will be in effect until the end of the year, and sees some adapters reduced by as much as 50%. This includes USB-C to USB-A, Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 and USB-C to Lightning cables, as well as various multiport adapters. Power adapters appear to be excluded from the discount. Apple has a mind-boggling number of adapters for its devicesApple Apple's penchant for adopting and subsequently dropping new connectivity standards has turned its adapter product line into one of its most expansive, with the company now selling more than 20 different types. In a statement explaining the discounts, Apple said: "We recognise that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. "Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables." Third-party USB-C peripherals have also had their prices dropped, although the biggest discounts appear to be reserved for US buyers. For example, SanDisk's SD Card reader has had its price cut in half to $29 (£23, €26) in the US, although in the UK the same peripheral costs £33 – a saving of just £4 on the usual asking price.

Follow TechnoBuffalo There seems to be some chatter in Apple’s supply chain about a rumored “jet white” iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. MacoTakara first reported on the whispers, suggesting that suppliers are talking about Apple’s intentions to add the new hue to its family of iPhones. I’m not sure I buy it. First, MacoTakara very clearly says “this information may be unreliable,” which doesn’t give me a whole lot of hope. Also, the “Jet black” color makes a little sense since jets, like stealth fighters, are sometimes jet black in hue. You don’t often (ever?) hear the term Jet white. Maybe jetliner white? It just doesn’t sound right. Don’t hold out hope for the white iPhone 7 I wouldn’t hold out too much hope for the new white iPhone, though Apple has actually done this in the past. The white iPhone 4, for example, came several months after other models were released. In that case, though, we were aware the white iPhone 4 was scheduled to launch at some point. We’ll see.

X Challenge to Apple’s Athenry data centre fast-tracked Commercial Court takes one of two legal challenges on list but defers ruling on other Mon, Nov 7, 2016, 16:07 Updated: Mon, Nov 7, 2016, 16:36 Aodhan O'Faolain         A legal challenge to the planned €850 million Apple data centre in Co Galway will be fast-tracked by the Commercial Court. Sinéad Fitzpatrick and Allan Daly initiated the case in the High Court last month over An Bórd Pleanála’s decision last August to grant permission for the data centre, one of eight such proposed developments, near Athenry. Ms Fitzpatrick and Mr Daly, of Lisheenkyle, Athenry, which is close to the proposed centre, claim the permission is invalid on grounds including that the board failed to carry out an proper environmental impact assessment of the proposed development. Ms Fitzpatrick says she and her neighbours are concerned about the development, particularly about the enormous energy demand it would create in the location. On a full build out, the development has a bigger energy demand than the greater Dublin area, she says. There appeared to be little or no analysis of the environmental impacts of this increase in power demand, she claimed. On Monday, lawyers for Apple Distribution International, the entity seeking to develop the data centre, which is a notice party to the action, applied to have the case admitted to the fast-track Commercial Court list. In a sworn statement seeking transfer to the list, Catherine Kearney, a director of Apple Distribution International and vice-president of operations for Europe, India, Africa and the Middle East, said the company wanted the action heard “as expeditiously as possible”. The proposed centres are “critical pieces of infrastructure required to support the worldwide demand for global storage necessary to cater for the rapid expansion in wireless electronic communication, entertainment and work”, she said. Exponential growth “Apple has experienced an exponential growth in the demand for data processing and storage and expects this trend to continue in the future,” she said. The growth in demand for Apple’s cloud computing and storage service means a large number of large data centres need to be built on a phased basis to deal with the demand, it was stated. ADVERTISEMENT The Athenry project is expected to create hundreds of jobs both directly and indirectly. The case, one of two challenges brought over the proposed facility, was admitted to the list by Mr Justice Brian Cregan. Rory Mulcahy SC, for Apple, said it would also be applying to have the other action, brought by Wicklow landowner Brian McDonagh, transferred to the Commercial Court. Apple want both challenges heard together and a hearing date fixed for March 2017, counsel said. Representing himself, Mr McDonagh told Mr Justice Cregan he was objecting to the fast-tracking of the cases, arguing it would prejudice his action. Mr Justice Cregan said he was satisfied to admit the Fitzpatrick/Daly case to the Commercial Court list but nothing would be done in respect of Mr McDonagh’s action until that matter returns before the court next Monday.       Topics: Courts Allan Daly Brian Mcdonagh Catherine Kearney Sinead Fitzpatrick An Bord Pleanála Apple Athenry Read More Over 2,000 march in Athenry in support of Apple data centre Apple seeks to fast-track challenge to €850m Galway data centre Apple remains stuck in mud in fields of Athenry Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Agribusiness & Food Greencore shares rise sharply on news of $746m acquisition in US Work Lucy Kellaway: I don’t want my employers to feel my pain English Soccer Bastian Schweinsteiger begins talks over move to Chicago Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Irish firms more worried about Brexit than British counterparts 00:01 Investors focus on Trump’s infrastructure spending plans 23:07 Cantillon: To spend or not to spend – FF seem to want it both ways 19:49 Court to fast-track legal challenge to Apple data centre in Athenry 19:25 Cantillon: Irish pension savers cautiously watch bond markets 19:18 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Maya Allen/ Brooke Shunatona By Brooke Shunatona and Maya Allen Nov 07, 2016 No season is more Instagrammable than fall. You've probably scrolled through your feed and seen many of these: A "candid" photo of someone throwing leaves into the air. A hand holding an overpriced fall coffee drink in front of some foliage. Babies posted up in pumpkin patches. The season begs to be photographed. Determined to get a solid fall Insta photo this season, we set out to go where many have gone before: apple-picking. Neither one of us had ever been to an apple orchard before, but we had plenty of expectations for how things would go. After all, we'd seen enough photos of people apple-picking to know what we would get, right? Not quite. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below So here's how things turned out when we, two twentysomething New York City girls, went apple-picking for the first time. Expectation: We’ll just hop on the subway and get off at the apple-picking stop, no problem! Reality: The orchard we chose (totally arbitrarily off a list of orchards near New York City) was a freaking two-hour drive away and we had to rent a car because we are car-less humans. Brooke Shunatona/Maya Allen Brooke: Maya and I decided to meet that morning at the first random NYC rental car place that popped up on Google. Turns out, car rental places run out of options if you don’t book them ahead of time, so the morning was a rough start. We treated ourselves to street coffee and bagels until we found a vehicle and finally got on the road two hours later than we had planned. I drove because I’m the responsible adult over 25, officially old/cool enough to rent a car. Whoever says birthdays past 21 aren’t exciting is wrong. Expectation: The middle of October means fall, and fall means cozy fall weather! Reality: It was hot AF. Maya: We would have worn duster coats and scarves, but we left them at home because it was def not sweater weather. I wasn't that mad about it. What better place to soak up some sun rays than at an apple orchard? Expectation: There would be bathrooms. Reality: There were portable toilets. Maya Allen/ Brooke Shunatona Brooke: It had been awhile since I'd used a porta-potty, but I'm no stranger to them. I've just never worn sandals when I've had to use them in the past. So now you’re probably thinking, You wore sandals to go apple-picking?? Girl, you are dumb and I don’t feel sorry for you. Yes, I wore sandals — suede sandal heels, to be exact. I'm not saying it was a smart choice, but it was a choice that I made and had to live with. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Expectation: Other people would be dressed up for photos. Reality: Nobody dresses up to go apple-picking. Maya Allen/ Brooke Shunatona Brooke: Part of the reason people go apple-picking is to get a cute photo — otherwise, everyone would get their apples at Trader Joe’s. Since Maya and I knew we'd be taking pictures, we dressed up! But we looked ridiculous compared to everyone else wearing boots and sweaters. In our defense, we had never been before, so how were we supposed to know what the dress code was? I thought going to the apple orchard would be like a winery or something. Noted for next year. Maya: Did it really happen if I didn’t Instagram it? Nope. And who wants to look dusty as hell on Insta? Not me. So Brooke and I decided to go all out. I already know what you’re thinking, and I'll tell you that we absolutely thought that strutting across apple orchards in minidresses and heels was not the most appropriate thing to do. But then again, who cares? YOLO. Expectation: All you do at an apple-picking farm is pick apples. Reality: Pumpkin patch! Cornfield! Hayride! Petting zoo! Concert! Maya: Posing on top of the pumpkins gave me all the ~nostalgic feels~. Adulting in NYC is hard AF, so it was fun to feel like a big kid again. Parents might have given me dirty looks when I made that pumpkin my prop, but I had no shame. Brooke Shunatona/Maya Allen Maya: I also learned you can’t go apple-picking without taking a hayride. We could have walked the length of the ride in five minutes, but Brooke and I decided to wait in the long line with everyone else because it’s about the experience, you know? Well, that experience was a long one. The sun, crying babies, and stomping around the orchard in my heels had tired me all the way out. Brooke: I think this was an alpaca? They don't do a good job of labeling the animals at the petting zoo for city folk. Whatever he was, he had the best hair I’d ever seen. Brooke Shunatona/Maya Allen Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Maya: Nobody told me concerts happen at apple orchards! It was fun to take a break and jam out to live music in between our apple-picking activities. You can't take us anywhere. Expectation: The apple cider doughnuts would be amazing. Reality: The apple cider doughnuts were amazing. Brooke Shunatona/Maya Allen Maya: The long line to get one of those cinnamon apple doughnuts was so worth it. “People come here just to buy these in bulk,” the employee told us at the counter, and I believe her. Tasting these magical, heavenly things was the highlight of my day. Brooke: I was later informed that all apple-picking farms have the same doughnuts. We were robbed blind, like the rookies we were. They were pretty good though. Expectation: The trees would be full of apples and we would frolic through the orchard with a picnic basket full of apples we picked. Reality: There were no apples on the trees. Brooke Shunatona/Maya Allen Brooke: Next year, I won’t wait until the end of October to go apple-picking. By the time we made the trip up, all of the apples had already been picked, or had already fallen and been eaten by nature. Maya Allen/ Brooke Shunatona Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Maya: Where were the apples?! Not even kidding, the trees were completely bare. We walked deep down into those orchards too. It was so sad. Does it make me a failure that I went all the way out there and left with not one apple in our apple bag? Expectation: We would go back home and make apple pies and cider, and be domestic with all of our apples. Reality: We each found one on the ground and ate it while we were there. Maya Allen/ Brooke Shunatona Brooke: Yes, you are probably supposed to wash them before eating them, but we were hungry, and it had been hours since our doughnuts, and we were not by water, so you know. It happens. Maya: I've never eaten anything off the ground before that was so tasty in my entire life. Expectation: It would be chill and low-key with a few cute couples holding hands and picnicking under the trees or whatever. Reality: People legit brought their entire extended families and everything (everything!) had a long line. Brooke: It was fun how lively the scene was, but it was a lot like Six Flags with the long lines and the number of kids. Maya: No lie, every line made me feel like I felt like I was at an exclusive apple-picking party and not cool enough to be VIP. Expectation: There would be a gold mine of Instagrammable moments awaiting us. Reality: There was a gold mine of Instagrammable moments. Maya: Posting up in the orchard for the ‘gram was such a good call. We went on one of the busiest days and left with not one apple to take home, but it was fun to be basic for just a day. I learned that it’s not very safe to walk around an orchard in a club dress and heels. But that doughnut made it all worth it. Supposed to be apple picking with @brookebighorse, inappropriately dressed for the occasion 🍎#priorities A photo posted by mayaalenaa (@mayaalenaa) on Oct 16, 2016 at 12:57pm PDT Brooke: The lighting that whole day as A++ and everything was really as beautiful and photogenic as I had imagined. For that reason alone, I'd say the trip was pretty worth it and I would definitely go again next year. Next time, we'll go apple-picking earlier in the season so we can actually, you know, leave with some apples. Went apple-picking for the first time and learned that people do not dress up to go apple-picking.

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 All the dongles I bought for my new USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro — how annoying will it really be? Benjamin Mayo - 1 week ago @bzamayo Feature MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The new MacBook Pros have certainly caused an uprising of controversy, with perhaps the lack of any traditional USB ports causing the most public outcry. Following in the footsteps of the one-port Retina MacBook, the new 2016 MacBook Pro lacks traditional USB-A ports, instead featuring up to four USB-C ports. Although the ports are highly more capable, offering Thunderbolt 3 speeds on a reversible small connector, it effectively means that all current Mac accessories and peripherals are incompatible without some kind of adaptor. In preparation for my new MacBook Pro arriving, I’ve ordered what I think I will need in terms of dongles for my uses. After seeing it all laid out on the table, I generally feel like the negative criticism is overblown … To be ready for the new MacBook Pro (I ordered the base 15-inch Touch Bar model), I’ve already bought the dongles I need to do my work. Having not owned either generation of the USB-C Retina MacBooks, I pretty much started from scratch in terms of USB-C accessories. I was initially thinking that this was going to be a significant hassle (albeit a necessary tradeoff as part of being a Touch Bar early adopter) but after buying everything, it really doesn’t seem that bad. Here’s what I bought and why. I use my MacBook Pro during the week as my primary computer. This happens at a desk connected to an external display. Currently, I do this using a mini DisplayPort cable which is not compatible with the 2016 MacBook Pro on its own. My display does not have USB-C inputs so I needed a DisplayPort dongle. I bought this USB-C to full-size DisplayPort dongle for $12. As a developer, I connect iOS devices frequently to the Mac using a wire so I picked up a Lightning to USB-C cable for development. Outside of work, I never connect my devices with a cable so I’m not even sure this would have been a priority purchase for me: I use iCloud and Wi-Fi for syncing data and apps, and I charge with the array of iPhone power adaptors and docks that I already own. It was under $10. (I bought this before Apple’s USB-C adaptor price cut, see below). My Rode Podcaster microphone, which I use to record 9to5Mac’s Happy Hour podcast every week, currently connects via USB-A to my 2012 MacBook Pro. I was initially thinking that I would need a USB-C dongle to attach to the end of this, but it isn’t actually necessary. The mic cable is detachable; it plugs into a USB-B port on the mic itself and terminates as USB-A. This means I simply needed a USB-B -> USB-C cable to replace the existing cable, which I can plug directly into the mic and the new MacBook Pro. I bought this Cable Matters cable for $7. For reasons that go beyond the scope of this post, I use a wireless keyboard and a wired mouse. The Bluetooth keyboard will work with the MacBook Pro just fine, so I only needed to think about mouse connectivity. Unlike the podcast mic, the mouse cable does not detach. With the goal being to avoid as many dongles as possible, I initially looked for a brand-new USB-C wired mouse. I couldn’t really find anything suitable apart from a couple of mini travel mice; I think this speaks to the infancy of USB-C in general. In time, I’m sure there will be more manufacturers making PC peripherals with integrated USB-C. For now, though, I’ve had to buy a USB-A to USB-C adaptor (2-pack for $8). It’s tiny (only a couple of centimetres long) and cost just $4. In total, I spent under $50 on everything. As a quick aside, I bought all of this stuff from Amazon because I didn’t want to spend a lot of money, it was easy to buy everything from one site and I prefer black cables over white ones. I also bought this stuff before Apple slashed prices on the USB-C accessories it sells; I’ll probably pick up an extra official USB-C adaptor whilst they are on sale for just $9. In general, it doesn’t seem too bad. For the display dongle, it’s more awkward than what I had before but it’s not terrible. The dongle will stay attached to the cable at my desk, so I’m still just plugging in one cable when I sit down with my laptop. It’s just the cable that is a bit clunkier now with the dongle attachment. Similarly, with the mouse, the USB-C adaptor just snaps on the end of it. I can just plug it in to the 2016 MacBook Pro and simply pretend it is one single cable. I could also invest in a wireless mouse which would solve this problem and have other conveniences; wireless is obviously what Apple wants to promote. The situation with the USB-C microphone and Lightning cables isn’t that different from what I have today. I’m just swapping out cables that I already have to own with different ones that I already have to own. There are no add-on dongles or adaptors necessary here at all. The USB-C Lightning cable can’t be used with my Apple USB power adapter, I guess, but I have a separate dedicated cable for charging. This cable is solely used to connect to my MacBook. When the new laptop is delivered, I’ll simply remove the Lightning -> USB-A cable and replace it with the Lightning -> USB-C one. The same is true for the mic; I’m not having to bear any additional dongles or inconveniences aside from the outlay to buy the new cable, once. I also recognize that this transition is only going to get easier with time. I’ll slowly own more and more USB-C stuff, reducing the frictions until its just standard to expect USB-C on everything. There’s also the future potential of buying a USB-C ‘hub’, like this one recently announced by OWC, where you can connect many accessories to the Mac (and charge) with a single cable. This setup would actually give me more convenience than what is currently possible (MagSafe can’t double up as a port for data transfer). There’s also the raw bandwidth benefits to consider when future devices take advantage of the 40/Gbps Thunderbolt 3 speeds. In conclusion, I do not think going all USB-C on the new MacBook Pros is a deal breaker or a huge misstep by Apple design as some have characterized it. Needing to buy $50 of cables is annoying, no question, but it’s only something I have to do once; there is negligible ongoing inconvenience. Moreover, there are real tangible benefits to Thunderbolt 3 USB-C so I’m happy that Apple is brave enough to push the industry forward. Just one USB-A port on the new MacBook Pro would have prolonged the transition away from old, slow, big USB 3 ports significantly; including none at all is a big statement. At the end of the day, this transition seems inevitable … so you might as well get started sooner rather than later.

In something of a throwback to iPhone models of yore, Macotakara relays that Apple may soon introduce at a Jet White option to its iPhone 7 lineup. DON'T MISS: Pokemon Go finally expands the Nearby tracking feature, rolls out new game update There's no timeframe as to when Apple might introduce this rumored Jet White iPhone 7, but it stands to reason that Apple would ideally like to get it out on store shelves before the holiday shopping season. Of course, Apple is hardly one to rush out a new color before it's just right, as we saw with the delayed launch of the iPhone 4 many years back. And as we saw in recent mockups, a white iPhone 7 would look insanely hot. What remains unclear is whether or not Apple was planning to release a Jet White iPhone 7 model all along or if it's a relatively new plan designed to give a last-minute boost to iPhone sales. To that point, a number of analysts believe that the iPhone may experience yet another year over year decline this quarter. At the same time, it's also possible that Apple saw how quickly folks took to the Jet Black iPhone 7 model and are simply trying to capitalize on that as quickly as they can. Notably, Macotakara calls its own source for this particular rumor 'unreliable' so you definitely want to take this one with a grain of salt. Still, the site has something of a strong track record with respect to Apple rumors so this is a story worth keeping an eye on in the weeks ahead. As it stands now, the iPhone 7 is available in 5 colors: Gold, Rose Gold, Black, Silver and Jet Black.

According to a Spanish “Apple engineer”: more dongles means more profit. Yes, El Risitas – the parody meme that first came to wide attention when lampooning the new MacBook last year – is back and this time it is explaining the reasoning behind the long-awaited MacBook Pro’s lack of ports. Apple cuts price of dongles after criticism of MacBook Pro ports Read more Apparently the chief executive, Tim Cook, was disappointed with the Apple laptop division, which was producing far less income than the iPhone division. Faster processors, more memory, better graphics and a thinner body can only do so much. What they really needed was another money spinner. One bright spark on the laptop engineering team, so says El Risitas, came up with the goods: “Remove the ports and sell them as dongles. “They’ll have to carry around a bag full of dongles. They’re all at least $25, some are $80!” Genius. Apple engineer spoof video: is Spanish Laughing Guy the new Downfall?

Among many other rumors with regard to tech specs and design features, this one is the real deal, i.e. not a rumor but a hard fact: the S8 will boast a brand new-state of the art Artificial Intelligence based Digital Assistant. If you ask me, that sounds like Apple’s Siri on steroids and to confirm my theory,according to a report from Reuters, Samsung’s Artificial Intelligence based digital assistant will be created by Viv, a company recently acquired by the Korean tech giant. It’s interesting to notice that the guys behind Viv are the same people who created Apple’s digital assistant, Siri. Now, the question is, how different the Korean Siri will be from its western counterpart? Well, that remains to be seen soon folks. According to the aforementioned report, we have another good news about the AI digital assistant: unlike Apple’s Siri, this baby will be open to developers, meaning that it will be able to perfectly integrate new features and work together with third party apps/services and things of that nature. One of Samsung’s executives told Reuters that, let me quote: “developers can attach and upload services to our agent.” Samsung’s AI digital assistant will also be available to other devices, the likes of home appliances and smartwatches. As you already know, the current Samsung smartphones feature the S Voice assistant, but the S Voice is inferior to Google’s Assistant or Apple’s Siri, not to mention Microsoft’s Cortana. The new Samsung assistant (or Siri 2.0) will come with the improbable Bixby moniker. After the Note 7 fiasco, Samsung needs a brand new and fire-proof flagship smartphone to clear up its reputation and also to lure back its lost customers (that’s a fact) from all over the world. Let’s hope that Bixby and the Galaxy S8 will make Samsung Great Again! source: Reuters Tags BixbyGalaxy S8SamsungSamsung Galaxy S8 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: Bluboo Edge tipped to debut with a curved design Next article Next post: Nokia D1C Pictures and Specs Leaked Live Comment Your email address will not be published.

As fastidiously added up by Music Ally, songs on the album have surpassed a staggering 3 billion total streams -- 3,043,000,000 to be semi-exact.  Views debuted on Apple Music on April 28 and there it stayed until May 13, when it hit Spotify and other streamers. The album, which has also been streamed over a billion times on Apple, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart dated May 21 and spent a total of 26 weeks in the top five. (It slipped to No. 7 on this week’s chart.) The biggest track on Views is, of course, "One Dance," which at 924.5 million stands as Spotify’s most streamed track ever. Then comes album closer "Hotline Bling" with 556 million spins, followed by "Too Good" at 426.5 million. The least streamed track on the album? That would be "Summers Over Interlude," with a paltry 23.5 million listens. Views Streams (in millions) 1. Keep the Family Close: 32.8 2. 9: 44.1 3. U With Me?: 38.9 4. Feel No Ways: 51.8 5.

 AT&T will give away free Apple TVs and Fire Sticks with its new $35 streaming TV service Nathan McAlone Nov. 7, 2016, 9:48 AM 69,824 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hear more from AT&T's CEO, Randall Stephenson, at Business Insider's IGNITION: Future Of Digital this December in New York City.  Tickets On Sale Now »   AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California. Thomson Reuters AT&T plans to give away free Apple TVs and Amazon Fire TV Sticks with its coming $35-a-month streaming TV service, DirecTV Now, according to leaked documents viewed by Variety. AT&T made waves in the industry last month when it announced that DirecTV Now would provide more than 100 channels for a mere $35 a month, undercutting many rivals on price. (Wall Street was expecting it to cost about $50 a month, according to analysts at Macquarie.) AT&T says it will be able to make the economics work at that price in part by cutting out legacy equipment like satellite dishes. DirecTV Now will be delivered over the internet, eliminating the need for cable or satellite but, to watch it on a TV, requiring a streaming box (like an Apple TV) or a smart TV. Not everyone, however, has a streaming box ready to go. With this leak, it seems as if AT&T will try to bridge the "streaming gap" for customers by simply giving them a free streaming box. And make no mistake: This is a monster giveaway. Variety says people who sign up for three months of DirecTV Now will get a free Apple TV. DirecTV Now is only $35 a month, which means AT&T is asking for just a $105 commitment. An Apple TV alone costs $150 at retail. And if you don't want to commit to three months of DirecTV Now, you can sign up for one month ($35) and get a free Amazon Fire TV Stick. That would cost you about $40 at retail. The fuzzy details We still don't know exactly which channels will be on DirecTV Now. AT&T has already signed deals with HBO, Discovery, NBCUniversal, Turner, Viacom, Disney, AMC, Scripps, Starz, and more. So it seems as if all the big guns will be signed up for launch. But exactly which channels they are providing is still up in the air. (An ad for the service viewed by Business Insider showed that ESPN would be on it). DirecTV Now will have a "72-hour catch-up window," according to Variety, which will let you watch shows on-demand for three days after they air. But there may be limitations on this feature — ESPN isn't on that catch-up list, for instance. DirecTV Now will also have an on-demand library of "up to 14,000 titles," according to Variety. For those who don't want to start paying before testing it out, DirecTV Now will let you have a seven-day free trial, according to an ad viewed by Business Insider that has since been taken down. The future is streaming AT&T has big plans for DirecTV Now and thinks it will be the company's primary TV platform by 2020, according to Bloomberg. In the immediate time period, a recent report from MoffettNathanson estimated that DirecTV Now could snag 11 million subscribers. Here's the potential breakdown: 2 million cannibalized from DirecTV, 6 million from other pay TV, and 3 million "cord-cutters." The 2 million subscribers transferred from DirecTV's traditional packages would be of concern to AT&T. Eleven million is a huge number, however, especially considering Sling TV is the market leader after only recently reaching 1 million subscribers, according to Bloomberg. AT&T declined to comment.

Based on purported information received from suppliers, the outlet speculates Apple may be planning to add a Jet White model to the iPhone 7 lineup, although plans could change and Apple could abandon the idea. Mac Otakara cautioned that its sources “may be unreliable.” Mac Otakara is pretty reliable when it comes to leaking Apple’s product plans and details of unreleased gadgets. The publication accurately predicted both the Jet Black colorway and the removal of the 3.55mm audio jack from Apple’s new handsets. Would you consider a Jet White iPhone 7 over the regular Jet Black model?

It will be scratch prone as well. Love my 7 plus Jet Black. lekwame I love mine as well anonmuz It’s going to be prone to scratches also, that’s pretty obvious. h4nd0fg0d Correct, but the scratches will be much less discernable on a white device. So ya, pretty obvious that said scratches will be less obvious on the white, obviously. Take that one to your bank. Truth dose anonmuz Indeed, at least until dirt gets in the scratches like on the old 3G/3GS. But then again that was all plastic so you are probably right. TheAvatarNice Christian, I think it’s just called a 3.5mm headphone jack. Not a 3.55mm headphone jack. Bill Guess I’m not the only one who notices he says that haha! TheAvatarNice Hahaha yeah, he always says 3.55mm. I already pointed that out in a previous article but unfortunately he didn’t read my comment. techfreak23 That always bothers me too but I’ve never actually commented on it. He might be confusing it with the 6.35 mm jack… https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8f1407908b52832a981e5fd1f164ff8b2f51f414f5e612f6e82b8bfc6ecd0f93.png Jim Hart I want the Jet Jaguar one. burge More lightly on the next iteration. lou111 This is a masterpiece from Apple. The “Jet” color is nothing like iPhone 5C before 🙂 I am sure 5c wasn’t available in black color because could looks like too premium. And now, there you go, Black and white iPhone 7 but the price is “regular”, you know… premium Micke på taket Glossy plastic look a la Samsung ,, just call IT jet and boom,,,suddenly its premium ,, ridicilous,,, george White phones are fugly, Diego Milano I definitely would, but if the end result would be scratches everywhere, I’d need to order it with a case right as soon as it goes out. 🙁 I would still prefer it on top of the silver one, unless it’s made of plastic like the iPhone 3GS, hahaha, just kidding.

On Sunday, Samsung announced it would include a new AI assistant with its forthcoming Galaxy S8, and that it would combine conversational language and integration with third-party services to perform tasks, dictate messages, and respond to queries on demand. And now, it appears to have a name: Bixby. Samsung filed a trademark in South Korea for “Bixby” in October, for a “computer software for personal information management” — more specifically, “computer application software for smartphones, mobile telephones, portable computers and tablet computers … used to operate voice recognition system[s] … [and enable] hands-free use of a mobile phone through voice recognition.” That description, albeit vague, would appear to fit intelligent assistants of the sort featured in Google’s Android operating system, Apple’s iOS, Microsoft’s Windows Phone, and Amazon’s Echo speakers. Related: Samsung is buying the new AI assistant from the masterminds behind Siri In October, Samsung acquired Viv, an artificial intelligence startup founded by Dag Kittlaus, Chris Brigham, Adam Cheyer, and much of the same engineering team responsible for Apple’s Siri. Viv, the details of which were never revealed publicly, was said to offer a platform which enabled third-party developers to tap into its capabilities. All the more impressive, it reportedly provided a framework for natural language-based interfaces in apps and services — i.e., voice-navigated menus and custom commands. “The deal showcases Samsung’s commitment to virtual personal assistants,” Injong Rhee, CTO of Samsung’s Mobile Communications business, said in a press release following the acquisition. “Viv was built with both consumers and developers in mind. This dual focus is also what attracted us to Viv as an ideal candidate to integrate with Samsung home appliances, wearables, and more, as the paradigm of how we interact with technology shifts to intelligent interfaces and voice control.” Related: Samsung’s Note 7 woes hurt its bottom line, but things are looking up An artificially intelligent assistant isn’t the Galaxy S8’s only reported highlight. Samsung’s upcoming flagship, which is expected to debut at Mobile World Congress in February, improves upon its predecessor’s hardware in significant ways. It’s rumored to ship in two variants, one with a 5.1-inch 2K (2,048 by 1,080 pixels) Super AMOLED display and another with a 5.5-inch 4K (2,096 by 2,160 pixels) screen. Under the hood, both will reportedly pack cutting-edge silicon in the form of either Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 830 processor or Samsung’s Exynos 8895. And both are expected to pack a dual-camera system, potentially called “LightUp Camera” or “Light+ Camera,” that pairs a 16-megapixel camera sensor with a companion 8-megapixel module for the purpose of improving low-light performance. Samsung is counting on the new device being a blockbuster hit. On Wednesday, Samsung reported revenue of $42 billion and profit $4.6 billion year-over-year declines respectively. Its mobile division was the hardest hit: revenue dipped to $87.9 million, down 96 percent year-over-year and the lowest in eight years. Not surprisingly, the firm attributed a majority of those losses to the launch of the Galaxy Note 7, which the company later recalled as a result of well-publicized defects that caused some units to spontaneously explode. During Samsung’s last earnings call, it projected recovery for the mobile division, and specifically a profit of $1.9 billion by the end of this year. Updated on 11-07-2016 by Lulu Chang: Added news that Samsung confirmed launch of new AI digital assistant with Galaxy S8.

The report did not outline when Apple might add the sixth color to the lineup, and it also warned the information obtained from supply chain sources "may be unreliable." Mac Otakara has accurately leaked information about Apple's upcoming plans in the past, including the new Jet Black color and no 3.5mm headphone jack on iPhone 7. It was also correct about several other iPhone 7 details, including its naming, flush Home button, longer earpiece cutout, and lack of Smart Connector. Nevertheless, the blog has been wrong on occasion, such as when it said the iPhone SE may come in a brighter pink shade that's different than Rose Gold. Moreover, given the lack of confidence in its own source, this rumor may not materialize and should be treated with a proverbial grain of salt.

Construction of the facility has been delayed by three local residents, Sinéad Fitzpatrick, Allan Daly, and Brian McDonagh, who have applied to the High Court for a judicial review on environmental grounds. Apple's proposed data center measures 166,000 square meters and was to begin operations in 2017. Apple would recover land previously used for growing and harvesting non-native trees and restore native trees to Derrydonnell Forest. The project would also provide an outdoor education space for local schools, as well as a walking trail for the community. Residents are concerned that the request for a judicial review will result in Apple taking its project elsewhere. “There is great support for it. It’s very important for Athenry and the greater community that Apple get the go-ahead,” says businessman Pat Joyce. Sean Kyne, Minister of State for Gaeltacht Affairs, said there was cross-party support for the project. “We would be a laughing stock if this was lost at this stage – Galway would be and Ireland would be, nationally and internationally,” he said. This morning, news broke that Apple has managed to get the legal proceedings fast tracked. Local politician Ciaran Cannon wrote on the Athenry for Apple Facebook group: "Very good news from the High Court just now. The Fitzpatrick/Daly proceedings have been admitted to the Commercial Court list. This means that the hearing must be concluded within 6 months, rather than the 18 months for a normal Judicial Review case. Their case will now be be heard on the 21st of March. The application to admit the third objector, McDonagh, to the same list will be heard next Monday."

 Apple sends the iPhone 4 to the land of obsolete gadgets Kif Leswing Nov. 7, 2016, 9:18 AM 21,414 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tyler/Flickr Apple has sent two beloved products to the land of obsolete products where old technology goes when it is no longer worth maintaining. The iPhone 4, which was first unveiled in June 2010, and the 2010 MacBook Air, are now obsolete in most of the world, and "vintage" in California and Turkey, Apple announced on its obsolete products webpage on November 2.  The 2010 version of the MacBook Air was a major redesign and the first Apple laptop to sport the wedge design still used on MacBook Airs sold today. The iPhone 4 was the first phone Apple sold to come with a "retina screen," or a super-pixel dense display that quickly became the standard around the smartphone industry. It was also the phone that was famously leaked by Gizmodo before it launched.  The iPhone 4 set Apple on its massive growth trajectory that it's been enjoying for the past five years.  Apple had previously made the CDMA version of the iPhone 4, which was designed to work on Verizon and Sprint's network, obsolete.  When products are obsolete or vintage, Apple says that it will no longer service the hardware, except in limited circumstances, such as when it was purchased in Turkey or California.  Apple writes: Apple has discontinued all hardware service for obsolete products with no exceptions. Service providers cannot order parts for obsolete products. All Apple Retail Stores and the Canadian, European, Latin American, and Asia-Pacific operating regions follow the U.S. product list, but make no distinction between vintage and obsolete. When applied to Apple Retail Stores and these operating regions, products on the U.S. vintage list (all models) are considered obsolete.

By Liam Tung | November 7, 2016 -- 13:53 GMT (05:53 PST) | Topic: Apple The MacBook Pro dropped from five connections down to two. Image: ZDNet Following complaints about the new MacBook Pro's switch to USB-C ports, Apple has dropped the price of several USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 adapters. The new style USB-C ports replace Apple's familiar MagSafe charger, an SD card slot, HDMI and older USB ports in previous MacBook Pro models. The new design left some MacBook fans outraged over the number of adapters they'd need if they wanted existing peripherals to work. The higher end MacBook Pro comes with four USB-C ports, while the lower end features just two. Apple has heard those complaints and on Friday cut the price of its USB-C adapters by as much as half until the end of 2016. see also I'm buying a new MacBook Pro, but the Surface Studio took my breath away The Surface Studio is brilliant. The new MacBook Pro is boring. So what? Read More The company also cut the price of its new LG UltraFine 5K Display from $1,300 to $974, while the LG UltraFine 4K Display will see a drop from $700 to $524. LG and Apple teamed up to build the displays for the new MacBook Pro. Apple USB-to-USB Adapter now costs $9, down from $19. Its Thunderbolt 3-to-Thunderbolt 2 Adapter now costs $29, down from $49. The USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter and the USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter have both dropped from $69 to $49 each. The 1m and 2m USB-C to Lighting Cables have been discounted by $6 each, and now cost $19 and $29, respectively. "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables," Apple said in a statement to The Verge. The temporary discounts may appease some who've baulked at upgrading to the new MacBook Pro, but it doesn't solve the bigger problem in creating a notebook that isn't powerful enough for many pro users. Many see the latest MacBook Pro as evidence that Apple has forgotten who the MacBook Pro is intended for -- namely, creatives and developers who now may be turning their backs on Apple's hardware.

More than 2,000 Apple supporters marched through the streets of Athenry, County Galway, on Sunday 6 November to demonstrate their backing for the project. The march, organised by members of the Athenry for Apple Facebook group, was designed to show that the area is open for business and keen for the build to happen as quickly as possible, members said in a series of posts on the social networking site. “We want to show Apple, and the whole world, that the vast majority of Athenry people support wholeheartedly Apple’s desire to open a datacentre near our town,” said a post, announcing the march. The campaign was mounted because of concern that any further delays to the project may cause Apple to abandon its plan entirely, putting at risk the 300 job opportunities the company claims the construction phase would bring to the area.   “Apple could take this datacentre anywhere in the world, and it chose Athenry,” said one group member. “It will bring hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in construction, and a lot of engineering/technical and management jobs when it opens.” Apple first received conditional planning permission for the 24,500m2, single-storey datacentre in September 2015, but a “valid appeal” was lodged with Irish planning body An Bord Pleanála (ABP) by local residents objecting to the project. It is understood the residents’ objections centred on the environmental impact the scheme could have on local wildlife populations and traffic levels. Read more about Irish datacentre builds A “valid appeal” has reportedly been raised in response to Galway County Council’s decision to grant conditional planning permission for Apple’s Irish datacentre build. Cloud services giant is continuing with its plans to build out its European datacentre region with another facility in Ireland. ABP granted permission for the build to go ahead in August 2016, but then a legal challenge was mounted by three local people, delaying the project further. In response, Apple asked the High Court to fast-track the legal challenge, resulting in an announcement on 7 November that the case will be fast-tracked and heard within the next six months, with a hearing now scheduled for March 2017. Without the High Court's intervention, Apple could have faced up to an 18 month wait to see if its datacentre plans could proceed.  One of the objectors to Apple’s plans is known to be local businessman Brian McDonagh, who, according to local press reports, is embroiled in a lengthy planning dispute with Wicklow County Council about a datacentre build of his own. He has pursued his own bid for a judicial review into the build, which is expected to be heard in the court on Monday 14 November. Meanwhile, all three objectors are being urged by members of the Facebook group to reconsider their position and think about the economic benefits for the local community of Apple investing in the area. “I was proud to stand united with the town today to say our future won’t be compromised by three objectors,” wrote one member. “Athenry for Apple – loud and clear.” Computer Weekly contacted Apple to comment on this story, but had not received a response at the time of publication. .............................................

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 Following the success of Jet Black, report suggests Apple plans to add ‘Jet White’ color option for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Benjamin Mayo - 1 week ago @bzamayo iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit A new report from Japanese tech blog Macotakara is suggesting that Apple will update the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to add a Jet White color option. Based on the name, following the popularity of the glossy Jet Black color, Apple would add a glossy white case chassis option to its existing line of flagship iPhones. Right now, the iPhone 7 series phones are available in five colors: Silver, Black, Gold, Rose Gold and Jet Black. The report should be treated with quite a bit of skepticism as the source lacks details and the move does not follow the traditional cycle of Apple product releases. Ever since the original iPhone, Apple has not added a new color to an existing iPhone hardware design; new colors are introduced as part of next-generation redesigns. For example, Apple added the Gold color with iPhone 5s and Rose Gold with iPhone 6s. Perhaps, the only exception to this is the iPhone 4 where the white version was release nine months after the black model in June 2010. However, the color was announced alongside the original launch as it was intended to launch simultaneously but was delayed due to manufacturing difficulties. Although Macotakara has had a decent track record in recent months regarding Apple products, it does not seem like it is as confident with this report; the entire source story is only two sentences long and the latter simply warns that ‘this information may be unreliable’. The possibility of a Jet White iPhone 8 was thrust into the rumor mill when Apple unveiled the new ceramic Apple Watch Edition, which has a brilliant white case finish. However, the cost and practicality of making an iPhone out of the same material is not clear and by no means a sure thing. It seems even more far-fetched that Apple would add such a radical change to the existing iPhone 7 series hardware. As well as the product development challenges — surely Apple engineering is focused on iPhone 8 development at this point — adding a new color mid-cycle would likely upset devoted Apple customers who upgraded to iPhone 7 at the release and didn’t have the new white color as an option. Apple is also struggling to meet demand for its existing 5-color iPhone 7 lineup, so it’s unlikely to be rushing to add yet another SKU into the supply chain. For now, treat the idea of a Jet White iPhone 7 as a very sketchy rumor that needs a lot more justification than a two sentence blog post to have any real credibility.

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has released a report to investors state that Apple will prolong iPhone SE’s lifecycle beyond the usual one year rotation in a bid to boost gross margins and minimize cannibalization of high-end flagships like the iPhone 7. To the point, Kuo noted that it seems unlikely that Apple will launch a new iPhone SE handset in the second fiscal quarter of 2017, which for Apple ends in March. The 4-inch iPhone variant debuted this year on March 31, leaving some to speculate that a next-generation version with updated internals would see release at roughly the same time in 2017. Kuo does not mention plans beyond the second quarter, meaning a refresh might land later in the year. The decision to hold off on a next-gen iPhone SE is thought to be due to Apple’s lower than expected gross margin guidance for the first quarter of 2017. During Apple’s recent quarterly earnings call, the company said it anticipated gross margins between 38 percent and 38.5 percent for Q1 of 2017, below consensus of more than 39 percent and down from 40.1 percent in 2015. Apple has also placed pressure on component manufacturers to reduce their prices as a means of reducing supply chain costs. Major suppliers of key components, like Samsung and TSMC, have bargaining power and are unlikely to be impacted by the belt-tightening, but smaller producers could see calls for price cuts arrive in November and December. Kuo forecasts iPhone shipment volumes of 40 million to 50 million units for the current quarter, down year-over-year from 51.2 million units, on conservative sell-through for 4.7-inch iPhones and weakening demand in China. Looking ahead, he estimates total iPhone shipment volume to reach 35 million to 40 million units in the second quarter of 2017, down from 40.4 million units at the same time last year. As a result, you might have to wait until 2018 for a next-gen iPhone SE.

The patent, as per Patently Apple website, features a bendable or foldable design.Gadgets Now | Updated: Nov 7, 2016, 06.31 PM IST It seems that Apple is experimenting with foldable display technology and may even use it in future iPhones. According to multiple online reports, Apple has been awarded a patent having serial number 9,485,862 and titled "Electronic devices with carbon nanotube printed circuits". The patent, as per Patently Apple website, features a bendable or foldable design. In the patent filing, Apple has mentioned possible uses of carbon nanotubes for creating a foldable device. The accompanying image illustrates a tablet-like device that can be folded to take the shape of a smartphone. Apple has reportedly also mentioned Ceramic as one of the materials that can be used in the foldable device. The report further adds that Apple can use both single-wall and multi-wall carbon nanotubes, or even a mixture of both for creating the flexible display. "The carbon nanotube structures may be incorporated into signal cables such as flexible printed circuit cables, rigid printed circuit boards, printed circuits that include rigid portions with flexible tails (sometimes referred to as 'rigid flex'), portions of display structures, portions of touch sensors such as capacitive touch sensor arrays for displays or track pads, camera structures, antenna structures, housing structures, internal device structures, electrical components, substrates, brackets, housing walls, other structures, or combinations of these structures," reads a snippet from the patent. This is how much Apple paid for Indian startup Tuplejump During his visit to India, Cook announced plans to set up a design and development startup accelerator in Bengaluru and open retail outlets in the country. It has been mentioned that the patent was filed back in 2014 by Apple. This means that the company may have already started working on the technology. Until now, Apple's competitors such as Samsung and LG were the only ones rumoured to be working on smartphones with foldable displays. Samsung already sells smartphones having curved displays. It's worth pointing out that although Apple has been awarded the patent, it is not sure if the company will launch a product having such a technology soon.

BlackBerry has launched its third Android-based phone in New Delhi—the device whose success will be a do-or-die for the company’s viability—opting to price its top-end device well-below Apple Inc’s iPhone 7. The BlackBerry DTEK50 was launched in July 2016, and began shipping in select regions in August. The BlackBerry DTEK60 was launched last month. Blackberry, which has lost most of the market to Apple and others, last month said that it planned to completely outsource the development of its smartphones to focus on its more profitable business of making software and managing mobile devices. It clearly means that the Android-based DTEK50 and DTEK60 will be the last phones for which BlackBerry buys components itself, which carries a heavier risk if it does not sell well. The DTEK50 and the DTEK60 are priced at Rs 21,990 and Rs 46,990 respectively. The DTEK50 will go on sale starting this weekend, while the DTEK60 will go on sale by early December. Blackberry also announced its partnership with Optiemus, a Delhi-based telecom enterprise, to distribute and promote BlackBerry handsets in the market. “India is a very important market for BlackBerry and we are delighted to announce a new partnership with Optiemus Infracom Ltd that strengthens our network of key partners in India and enables us to deliver our secure BlackBerry Android experience to more customers,” Alex Thurber, senior vice president, global device sales, BlackBerry, told reporters at the event. Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry does not have any deals with telecom companies to distribute the device. Instead, it has been pitching the phone directly to companies and governments, as well as selling it on its own websites in the US, Canada, and several major European countries. Both the smartphones run Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with BlackBerry’s hardware. The customisation alongside BlackBerry Enterprise services, and the DTEK by BlackBerry app, makes the company call them the ‘world’s most secure Android smartphones’. Blackberry is also claiming that the smartphones are ready for enterprise adoption with its Enterprise Mobility Management solutions. The DTEK50 features 5.2-inch full-HD display with a pixel density of 424ppi, 3GB of RAM, powered by a 1.2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 SoC. It also features a 13MP rear camera with a 6-element lens and an f/2.0 aperture along with an 8MP front camera with LED flash. The device has 2TB of expandable memory and houses 2,610mAh battery. The device is said to come packaged with quick charge 2.0 that will charge the device 50% in 51 minutes. The DTEK60 features a 5.5-inch quad-HD display with a pixel density of 534ppi, the device is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC and 4GB RAM. The 4G LTE smartphone features a 21MP rear camera PDAF, dual-tone LED flash, along with a 6-element f/2.0 lens and an 8MP front camera. The device houses 3,000mAh battery and also packs a fingerprint sensor. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

Apple Wants to Sell iPhones in India by Any Means GO The company is now changing its mind and is trying to get incentives to build a manufacturing plant in the country Nov 7, 2016 13:44 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple wants to be one of the companies benefitting from the growing mobile market in India, and the company is looking into several ways to start selling iPhones locally, including setting up a local manufacturing plant that would help them comply with Indian regulations. Due to laws that forbid companies from selling devices in the country unless at least 30 percent of parts are manufactured in local plants, Apple has until now been unable to bring the iPhone to the local market, so it only had to rely on retailers using import taxes that eventually increased the final price as well. Apple asked the government for an exception to the law, but authorities denied the request, explaining that all companies must comply with these rules. Cupertino also attempted to bring used iPhones in India and sell them as refurbished, but several companies opposed to the plan, on the grounds that such a move would violate environmental laws that are currently in effect in the country. Local manufacturing plant And now, Apple is giving another shot at bringing iPhones in the country with a request for incentives that would help the company set up a local manufacturing plant. This should help the firm comply with the 30 percent production regulation, but also reduce costs of the iPhone. "They are doing their due diligence from quite some time. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) will write to both the departments regarding this communication for their views," an Indian official was quoted as saying by India Times. Apple hasn’t issued a statement on this, but since negotiations are under way, an announcement should be provided when the company gets the go-ahead to set up the manufacturing plant. Oddly enough, India is not at all a market where Apple feels like home, as the country has already rejected all alternative plans to start selling the iPhone locally, but at the same time is also trying to buy technology that could help hack devices involved in criminal activities. #Apple#iPhone#India subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news No iPhone SE Refresh in 2017, Analyst Claims India to Buy Technology to Hack Password-Protected iPhones Apple Might Make It Impossible to Steal an iPhone Apple Working on an iPhone That Bends on Purpose OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Ubuntu Online Summit for Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) Starts Today, November 15 darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE    iPhones might soon be manufactured in India new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Donald Trump’s 45% Tariff on China Exports Could Backfire Against the iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

By Ricardo Bilton @rbilton Nov. 7, 2016, 8:38 a.m. Nov. 7, 2016, 8:38 a.m. Apple News may finally be starting to live up to its promise, at least when it comes to traffic. RELATED ARTICLE Video notifications, Apple News subscriptions, and more for publishers from WWDC 2016 June 13, 2016 RELATED ARTICLE For news organizations, this was the most important set of Apple announcements in years June 8, 2015Alongside the launch of iOS 10 in September, Apple announced a handful of updates to Apple News, which it launched last fall. Along with some cosmetic changes like a new logo and typeface, the new version of the app brought some much-needed features for publishers, including breaking news notifications and support for paid subscriptions. But for many publishers, the most welcome change was to the traffic it gives publishers, which has grown in a big way. CNN, for example, says its Apple News content got 36.5 million unique readers in September, a major increase from August’s 5 million. Its pageviews also increased significantly to 274 million, up from 43 million a month before. “It’s really quite a remarkable story,” said Alex Wellen, CNN’s chief product officer. While CNN had seen “steady traffic growth” for most of the year,” said Wellen, Apple’s tweaks to its news app have changed the traffic picture significantly. Wellen added that CNN has seen a significant increase in interest in its notifications as well. On the first day of the Apple News relaunch, CNN’s notifications reached 188,000 users; on October 30, only a few weeks later, that number increased to 3.7 million. Bloomberg, too, has benefited from the update. Unique visitors to its Apple News content spiked 400 percent in October, thanks to a combination of regular inclusion in the Apple News “Top Stories” section and interest in its breaking news notifications. M. Scott Havens, Bloomberg’s global head of digital, said that the organization owes much of that growth to the success of its politics coverage, which “has overindexed there for us. People on Apple News tend to be a bit older and more engaged with the campaign cycle,” he said. A Mark Halperin interview with Donald Trump, for example, was particularly successful on the platform. More regional organizations seem to be seeing gains as well. Boston Globe Media, which pushes its Boston.com content into Apple News, was drawn to the app’s new subscription, notification, and newsletter features, according to Matt Karolian, Boston Globe Media’s director of social media. The traffic part of the equation is paying off as well. Boston.com sees “massive spikes in traffic when a local story goes national,” said Karolian. “When we do see spikes, we are seeing hundreds of thousands of unique readers,” he said. Apple’s editorial choices play a role there: Both Havens and Wellen pointed out that Apple regularly features content from their outlets within its human-curated “Featured Stories” section, which drives a lot of interest from readers. Other publishers are still waiting to see that degree of interest with their own content. Chris Schieffer, senior product director at Slate, said that Slate’s Apple News traffic has been “generally pretty flat since the update,” despite some regular spikes in clicks on its election coverage. “My guess is that’s not related to any of the iOS 10 updates — it’s just the news cycle,” he said. Slate has not invested too many resources into Apple News and is taking a wait-and-see approach as Apple fleshes out more of the app’s backend analytics and advertising features. Publishers’ current rosy view of Apple News is a relatively new trend. At launch, dozens of publishers had signed on, eager for a chance to get in front of Apple’s user base. The early results were disappointing. Publishers, including Time Inc. then-CEO Joe Ripp, said they weren’t happy with the slow traffic growth on the app. Apple added to the anxiety earlier this year when it disclosed that it had been undercounting audience data. Most recently, Apple threw publishers a curveball when it started to divert links from articles in the news section of the Spotlight search screen to Apple News rather than to publishers’ websites. That was a big deal for many sites, which saw mobile website traffic  from Spotlight shrink after the change. CNN’s Wellen said he wasn’t very concerned by the tweak, which he said felt inevitable. “That behavior of Spotlight opening up a webpage in Apple News was not a good experience,” he said. “As long as you can assure the new traffic is properly attributed and you’re monetizing it appropriately, then the change is actually a better experience for the user and the brand. Spotlight was just added value.” The story is slightly different on the revenue front. Monetization is “still a work in progress,” noted Havens. Slate, in a similar position, is “not monetizing [Apple News] very well at the moment,” said Schieffer. Wellen said CNN “has monetized its stories,” though he wouldn’t give specific details. Ads still feel like a rare occurrence for its Apple News content; publishers are still eager for integration with comScore, a major hurdle to getting advertisers interested in the platform. At the same time, it’s clear that Apple has been listening to publishers and taken steps to implement the kind of features needed to make Apple News a viable platform for not just audience development, but monetization as well. In March, Apple made a handful of big additions to the app, including an analytics dashboard and new ad formats, both key issues for publishers looking generate revenue on the platform. Havens, Wellen, and Schieffer all said they were impressed with Apple’s willingness to hear and respond to publishers concerns about the app, despite the slow rollout of certain key features. “We don’t work with everybody,” said Havens. “More and more, with the size of our organization, we have to pick and choose the relationships we have based on several factors, one of which is the openness of communication with the partner. We’ve been happy with Apple in that respect.” POSTED     Nov. 7, 2016, 8:38 a.m. SEE MORE ON Mobile & Apps SHARE THIS STORY      TWITTER   FACEBOOK (0)   EMAIL   TUMBLR   LINKEDIN   SHARE ON FACEBOOK (0)   TWEET Alex Wellen Apple Apple News Boston Globe Media Boston.com Chris Schieffer CNN M.

The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. Photo The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc. has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co., Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store. “We’re seeing a barrage of fake apps,” said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time. Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless — essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple’s process for reviewing every app before it is published. That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google’s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company’s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers. In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and the Pokémon Company, among others. “It’s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,” he said. Apple removed hundreds of fake apps on Thursday night after The New York Times inquired about the specific app vendors that created many of them. Other apps were removed after a New York Post article last week drew attention to some of the counterfeits. “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,” said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. “We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove “apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.” The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. Despite Apple’s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple’s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s a game of Whac-a-Mole,” Mr. Mason of Branding Brand said. On Friday, for example, an entity calling itself Overstock Inc. — an apparent attempt to confuse shoppers looking for the online retailer Overstock.com — was peddling Ugg boots and apparel through a fake app that was nearly identical to one banished by Apple on Thursday. The same Chinese app developer, Cloaker Apps, created both fake Ugg apps on behalf of Chinese clients. Photo A fake Michael Kors app, claiming to be connected to Nordstrom. Some counterfeits are more convincing than others. Jack Lin, who identified himself as the head of Cloaker, said in a phone interview in China that his company provides the back-end technology for thousands of apps but does not investigate its clients. “We hope that our clients are all official sellers,” he said. “If they are using these brands, we need some kind of authorization, then we will provide services.” Mr. Lin said Cloaker charged about 20,000 renminbi — about $3,000 — for an app written in English. But like so many of the apps his company produces, Cloaker is not what it purports to be. Its website is filled with dubious claims, such as the location of its headquarters, which it says is at an address smack in the middle of Facebook’s campus in Menlo Park, Calif. In the interview, Mr. Lin at first said he had offices only in China and Japan. When asked about the California office, he then claimed to have “tens of employees” at the Facebook address. China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts. Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, “Our angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Data from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. “Would give zero stars if possible,” wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. “Constantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.” Mr. Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands. “The retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,” he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard’s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps. But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real. The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store — including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear. Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Company has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume. Some of the fake apps have even used Apple’s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store. Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple’s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google’s Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said. But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pokémon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “The criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,” Mr. Clay said. Emily Feng contributed reporting from Beijing.

Trip Chowdhry's Top 4 Stock Picks What To Do When Then Experts Chime In (Seeking Alpha) This election season, companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been criticized by both candidates for the massive cash hoards the companies have stashed overseas to avoid U.S. taxes. The companies claim U.S. corporate taxes are simply too high for them to justify bringing that cash back into the country. Are U.S. corporate taxes really so high? As it turns out, yes they are. They Aren't Wrong According to Tax Foundation, the U.S. top marginal corporate tax rate of 38.92 percent is the third highest rate in the entire world. The top U.S. corporate tax rate far exceeds the global average of 22.5 percent. European countries average only an 18.55 percent rate. U.S. small businesses earning less than $100,000 per year in income are not subject to the top marginal tax rate. The only two countries with higher peak marginal corporate tax rates than the United States are Puerto Rico (39.0 percent) and the United Arab Emirates (55.0 percent). On the other end of the spectrum, Montenegro (9.0 percent), Turkmenistan (8.0 percent) and Uzbekistan (7.5 percent) are the only three nations with top corporate tax rates in the single digits. U.S. companies are currently holding more than $2.5 trillion overseas to avoid corporate taxes. Microsoft, GE and Apple are the three largest offenders. As Related To Tuesday Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump plans to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15 percent and enact a repatriation rate of only 10 percent for companies with cash overseas. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton plans to maintain the current corporate tax rates.

 Apple's $900 million data center is getting fast-tracked Sam Shead Nov. 7, 2016, 9:07 AM 5,193 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple supporters in Athenry.Ciaran Cannon Apple has succeeded in getting a legal dispute for a proposed $939 million (€850 million) data center fast tracked through Irish courts. Apple's west Ireland data center was facing an 18 month delay after two Irish residents — Allan Daly and Sinead Fitzpatrick — appealed against a local planning body who gave the development the green light in August. Apple asked the High Court at the start of November to fast-track the legal challenge brought about by the three individuals. The High Court held a hearing into the matter on Monday and agreed to put the dispute on the "commercial list," meaning it has to be resolved within six months. The case concerning the two applications, is listed for hearing on March 21 2017, with a decision due in April. Local politician Ciaran Cannon wrote on the Athenry for Apple Facebook group: "Very good news from the High Court just now. The Fitzpatrick/Daly proceedings have been admitted to the Commercial Court list. This means that the hearing must be concluded within 6 months, rather than the 18 months for a normal Judicial Review case. Their case will now be be heard on the 21st of March. The application to admit the third objector, McDonagh, to the same list will be heard next Monday." The court's decision came a day after thousands of people marched through the streets of Athenry to show their support for the data centre. They believe it will provide crucial jobs for the area and boost the local economy. A third person named Brian McDonagh is also seeking a second Judicial Review – this case is due for mention in the High Court in the coming weeks. Apple Those against the data centre — who appear to be very much in the minority — say that the site Apple has chosen hasn't been "zoned" for a large data centre. They have also raised concerns about the impact on local wildlife, drainage, and pollution. Apple wants to build eight data halls on a 500-acre site in Derrydonnell Forest, which is owned by state-sponsored forestry firm Coillte, and situated roughly three miles from Athenry. Apple first announced the data centre in February 2015, saying at the time that it will build a similar facility in Denmark, which is already well underway. Apple wants to use the centers to store European user data and to help power online services, including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release.

This should come as no surprise to those who’ve long perceived the Mac platform as inward-looking, limited in compatibility, and generally worse value for money than comparable Windows alternatives. Pros are smart with their tools and their money, after all. But the change with Apple’s 2016 generation of MacBook Pros is that those downsides have been amped up — more expensive and less compatible than ever before — to an extreme that exposes the fallacy of the continued use of the Pro moniker. These are Apple’s premium laptops, its deluxe devices, but not in any meaningful way computers tailored for the pros. A MacBook Pro is now simply what you buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and have a higher budget and expectations than the MacBook can fulfill. Those complaining about Apple's current Mac lineup are not haters, they're lovers. They've spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs. — Jeff J. (@lapcatsoftware) October 29, 2016 The backlash from among pro Mac users that’s arisen in the wake of this new product launch is unprecedented, drowning out even the widespread grumbling about the loss of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 just a month prior. Just take a look at this studious blog post from Michael Tsai, which gathers together the broad negative consensus from among Apple's most passionate followers. The Mac community finds the specs underwhelming, even on the 15-inch model, which uses power-sipping AMD Radeon graphics instead of the world-conquering Nvidia Pascal chips. Emotions are running so low that people are even speculating about whether Apple should do with the Mac what IBM did when it sold off the ThinkPad line to Lenovo. This is partially because Apple hasn’t had a class-leading professional Mac computer for years — the Mac Pro is 1,054 days old now — and the new laptops have given an outlet and reason for expectant fans to vent. Many people were clinging on to their aging MacBook Pros in the vain hope of seeing a major spec and performance upgrade that simply didn’t materialize, and that's been frustrating. Here's how the 15" #MacBookPro 2016 component specs compare to the 2012 model: CPU: +8.9% to +13% MEM: +33% GPU: +53% to +184% /cc @mjtsai pic.twitter.com/uucjBzXe6C— Felix Schwarz (@felix_schwarz) October 28, 2016 The updated MacBooks from Apple have newer chips, but not that much newer, with Apple using yesteryear’s Intel Skylake CPUs and not this year’s Kaby Lake. They have faster storage, which is an indisputable benefit, but they also max out at 16GB of RAM. For consumer or casual use, that’s perfectly adequate, but "for a developer work machine, 16GB is the uncomfortable minimum requirement," as web developer Baldur Bjarnason points out. Apple seems surprised by the predictable backlash at betraying the trust of its most loyal customers Here’s the thing: if these new MacBooks simply didn’t carry the Pro label, we’d all have a lot less to complain about. It’s perfectly okay for a company to craft expensive, niche devices that will only match the particular needs of a select group of people. But over the course of the past decade or two, the entire tech industry has moved away from labeling things as exclusive or luxurious, opting for more inclusive language. If you can’t afford the premium model, that implies you’re not wealthy enough; but if you can’t afford the pro version, maybe you’re just not that into it. A subtle, but important distinction. And so it is, that we’re now living in a world populated by the PS4 Pro, DJI Mavic Pro, Surface Pro, iPad Pro, Beats Pro, Logitech Pro Gaming Mouse, and many others. Those of us old enough to remember ATI, the Canadian graphics card company that was taken over by AMD, will remember it pioneered many of these tags with such historic GPUs as the Radeon 9500 Pro, 9800 SE, X800 XT, and so on. They’re all meaningless as far as the company is concerned, but it just so happens that the "Pro" appendage is more meaningful to users than slapping on a "Plus" or "XL." With the obvious exception of leisure-time devices like the PlayStation console, a "pro" piece of consumer electronics is generally interpreted as a signal to actual professionals that this machine is for them. I'm out of apologia juice for defending Apple going with 4 USB-C ports on the new MacBook over a useful mix and keeping the MagSafe. — DHH (@dhh) October 28, 2016 Apple’s folly is in not recognizing just how passionate and committed its professional audience is. But the company should already know that all the iOS app developers that generate its unparalleled third-party software ecosystem are doing their work on Macs. It should be aware of their RAM requirements and the improvements they most want to see. "Pro" used to mean something when it came at the end of MacBook model names Beyond developers, there are the photographers and video producers that have made Mac computers the central hub of their home and work studios for many years, thanks to Apple’s early prioritization of high-quality displays and intuitive software. Leaving them without an SD card slot or an included adapter runs entirely counter to Apple’s fundamental principles of having a coherent ecosystem and a more user-friendly approach than the (previously) cold and aloof Windows PC manufacturers. Apple used to be a friend to creative professionals, and now that it’s acting against their wishes and interests, it seems surprised at their impassioned negative response. The backlash to the new MacBook Pro is so bad that Apple has slashed its accessory prices and LG's monitors to appease. Seems unprecedented — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) November 7, 2016 MacBook Pros were once professional computers that could also appeal to an aspiring consumer audience. They were pricey for a general-purpose laptop, but justifiable as a luxury purchase or as a device that pays for itself by making its user more efficient and productive. But today MacBook Pros are very definitely consumer devices that only gesture toward a professional audience without truly endeavoring to appease it. The new Touch Bar is not a pro feature. It’s cool, it works really well, and it has tons of potential for the future, but it clashes with professional workflows, many of which involve external monitors and keyboards. Apple showed how DJs might use it, but those same people would probably prefer to have dongle-free USB ports for the rest of their gear and a MagSafe charging adapter in the event of some inebriated clubber tripping over their cables. None of Apple's additions improve professional workflows yet, and its subtractions will lead to plenty of headaches The ultra-flat keyboard with 0.55mm key travel is also not professionally minded. Its purpose is overall thinness, but I know of no app developers, globetrotting businesspeople, or digital artists that had "more thinness" anywhere near the top of their priority list of MacBook Pro improvements. Professional writers might have asked for more tactile response, not less, and Apple's keyboard alterations seem to primarily serve to optimize and harmonize its design rather than enhance any functionality. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pros carry on the Pro moniker dishonestly. At least we should all hope that's the case — because if Apple actually believes that these new laptops are suitable and sufficient for intensive professional needs, then the company's long and happy relationship with creatives may be heading toward a calamitous breakup.

(AAPL) Mac PCs Saves a Lot of Money IBM says it’s saving up to $543 pre computer by ditching Windows PCs for Macs By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 24, 2016, 2:02 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: The Next Thing Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit View All Posts International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) has some advice for companies looking to cut IT costs: switch from Windows PCs to Mac computers from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The Macs may cost more up front, but there are big savings to be had in support costs. Source: Apple In 2014, IBM and AAPL entered into a historic agreement. They were once rivals — IBM was an early part of the whole “Wintel” thing with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) — but now they are working closely together. IBM went on to develop software and cloud solutions to support Apple iPhones and iPads at the enterprise level, and sold AAPL’s mobile devices through its business channels. Last year, IBM began promoting a similar service for Macs. But it went even further, beginning to replace its own employees’ Windows PCs with Apple Mac computers. The timing of the move wasn’t great advertising for Microsoft, which was promoting the rollout of Windows 10 and moving into business-focused PC hardware production itself with the Surface Pro tablet and Surface Book laptop. 10 Hottest Gadgets for the 2016 Holiday Shopping Season There were many doubters, primarily because Mac PCs are seen as being more expensive than their Windows counterparts. Despite the popularity of Mac laptops in particular, many companies have been resistant to spending the money to buy them for employees. IBM rolled out 30,000 Mac computers that year. The project has been such a success, that the number of Macs being used at IBM has now grown to 90,000. Why Macs Are Popular With IBM, But Hated by Some IT Staff MacRumors reported on the Jamf Nation User Conference, which took place earlier this week. IBM sent a VP to present an update on the company’s Mac initiative. He told attendees that 73% of employees have requested their next computer be a Mac and that IBM was rolling out the AAPL computers at a rate of 1,300 per week. The kicker is the cost. IBM says the Macs are actually saving it big money compared to Windows computers. How is this possible? The big factor is support costs.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple responds to customer feedback, drops prices on assorted USB-C adapters Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, November 7th, 2016, 05:40 Category: Hardware, MacBook Pro, News, retail, USB-C Tweet Responding to customer demand, especially in the wake of USB-C becoming that much more prevalent on the newly-released MacBook Pro notebook, Apple has dropped the prices on all of its USB-C adapters by $6 to $20. The simple USB-C to USB Adapter, formerly priced at $19, is now $9, while the more expensive USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter, formerly $49, is now available for $29. Even Apple’s newly released Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter has seen a price drop from $49 to $29. The full price list goes as follows: – USB-C to USB Adapter – Was $19, now $9 – Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter – Was $49, now $29 – USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter – Was $69, now $49 – USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter – Was $69, now $49 – USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) – Was $25, now $19 – USB-C to Lightning Cable (2m) – Was $35, now $29 The adapters have been discount roughly 25 percent in most cases, with some accessories, such as SanDisk’s USB-C SD card reader, seeing a steeper $20 discount, dropping the price from $49 to $29. Apple offered the following comment regarding the price drop: “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” While Apple didn’t mention a price break or solution for users who’ve already purchased adapters to go along with their new MacBook Pros, users have stated that Apple will refund the price difference for customers who have already purchased adapters for their MacBook Pros. Customers who still have orders pending will also automatically see a price drop. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

If the latest estimates by analyst Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets, about smartphone industry are anything to go by, Apple seems to be the only shining spot in an otherwise ailing industry. As per the estimates by Long, reported by Investors, Apple accounted for 103.6 percent of the total smartphone industry's profit in Q3, compared with 90 percent of the total share a year ago. If you are wondering how the figure is above the 100 percent mark, this is because majority of other smartphone manufacturer's registered a loss while Apple registered a large profit. As a result, the Cupertino-based company ended up making more profit than entire industry's net profit. Apple also offers fewer devices, and no actual budget segment, helping skew the graph further.At second place, and very far behind, falls Samsung with 0.9 percent of the profit share, as per the estimates. The South Korean company's profit from smartphone business was notably hit by the controversies surrounding its, now discontinued, smartphone Galaxy Note 7. The smartphone had to be recalled two times and as a result, the company is estimated to be facing a total loss to the tune of $5.3 billion (roughly Rs. 35,433 crores). Samsung's loss seems to have been Apple's gain as the demand for company's new smartphones iPhone 7 and 7 Plus got further boost after the announcement of Galaxy Note 7's discontinuation. As per a recent survey, about half of Galaxy Note 7 users shifted to iPhone after the recall. Other companies like LG and HTC have continued to lose money in their respective smartphone business and added to the woes of the industry. If the estimates are correct, this will be the first time when Apple has registered a profit share of over 100 percent. In terms of overall smartphone sales, Samsung still leads the pack with 21.7 percent of the total smartphone sales in Q3, while Apple's share stands at 13.2 percent, as per BMO. Huawei comes in at third position in smartphone sales with market share of 9.7 percent.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Samsung just confirmed one of the Galaxy S8’s most exciting new features Yoni Heisler BGR NewsNovember 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Despite Samsung's reliance on Android and Google's suite of service apps, the South Korean tech giant has long tried to wrestle away control of the user experience from the search giant. That said, the forthcoming Galaxy S8 will mark the company's boldest effort yet to establish a unique identity for itself that partially exists outside of the strict confines of the Android universe. According to a new report from Reuters, Samsung's Galaxy S8 will ship with its own intelligent AI service based on technology the company picked up when it acquired Viv just about a month ago. Developed by Siri co-creator Dag Kittlaus and a handful of former Apple engineers, Viv touts itself as a next-generation AI assistant that can blow rival services from the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon out of the water. DON'T MISS: Apple has a secret research team devoted to making Siri’s voice sound more human-like Samsung hasn't yet revealed too many details surrounding its plans for the S8, but the company did indicate that its AI platform will be able to interface with third-party apps, similar to what the Amazon Echo has long provided and what Siri has been capable of since the launch of iOS 10. "Developers can attach and upload services to our agent," Samsung Executive Vice President Rhee Injong said in a statement obtained by Reuters. "Even if Samsung doesn't do anything on its own, the more services that get attached the smarter this agent will get, learn more new services and provide them to end-users with ease." Corporate lingo aside, it will extremely interesting to see how Samsung's first foray into the world of intelligent AI assistants stacks up against more established competitors. Viv may not be a household name, but the company's technology is incredibly intriguing. During demos, Kittlaus showed off how Viv is capable of answering complex queries and layered questions with ease. For example, if a user asks, "Will it be warmer than 70 degrees near the Golden gate bridge after 5 PM the day after tomorrow?" or "Find me a flight to Dallas with a seat that Shaq could fit in”, Viv can successfully parse the question to deliver an answer. As impressive as that is, what makes Viv truly stand out from the pack is its ability to learn how to process queries that it wasn't originally programmed to understand via a technology Viv calls "dynamic program generation." “The more you ask of Viv, the more it will get to know you,” Kittlaus said during a product demonstration a few months ago. “Siri was chapter one, and now it’s almost like a new Internet age is coming. Viv will be a giant brain in the sky.” While Samsung's acquisition of Viv loudly signaled the company's intention to release its own AI powered hardware, it's interesting that Samsung is wasting absolutely no time integrating it into its software and getting it out into the hands of users. For those unfamiliar with Viv, the following demo of Viv from May of this year provides an exciting overview of the type of technology Samsung's Galaxy S8 might ship with. Notably, it was previously reported that both Google and Facebook made offers to acquire Viv before the deal with Samsung ultimately went through. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI07aeZqeco Trending right now: Analysts have no idea if smartwatches are dying or not Pokemon Go finally expands the Nearby tracking feature, rolls out new game update These are the 10 worst airports in the United States See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Confirms AI is coming to the Galaxy S8 in Late February Courtesy of Viv | Main | The Politics over Opening an iPhone Plant in India Takes another Twist as Apple Seeks Government Incentives up Front » November 07, 2016 Chinese Cyber Security Law goes into Effect in June 2017 that may Require Apple to surrender iOS Source Code   Back in April we posted a report about China beginning their promised crackdown on cyber security. China had asked Apple for their iOS source code and Apple refused to comply. China is interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent." In this new era, he added, China "is strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States." The Chinese government was also working on a new antiterrorist that would require foreign companies to turn over encryption keys. Though some of the language in the proposal was changed, critics felt it was only a temporary chess move. This weekend the warning bell was rung again as expected renewing fears of forcing foreign companies like Apple to give up their source code.   Bloomberg reported earlier this morning that "China has green-lit a sweeping and controversial law that may grant Beijing unprecedented access to foreign companies' technology and hamstring their operations in the world's second-largest economy.   The Cyber Security Law was passed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, and will take effect in June, government officials said Monday. Among other things, it requires internet operators to cooperate with investigations involving crime and national security, and imposes mandatory testing and certification of computer equipment. Companies must also give government investigators full access to their data if wrong-doing is suspected.   The measures are part of a sweeping push under President Xi Jinping to control China's internet, including the passage of a security law establishing "cybersovereignty" and making the spread of rumors and defamatory posts a crime.   The requirement on certification could mean technology companies will be asked to provide source code, encryption or other critical intellectual property for review by security authorities. This is something Microsoft already does with its software, under controlled conditions.   While Apple initially refused to hand over its iOS source code to Chinese authorities, it wasn't law at the time. In June 2017, the Chinese government may not ask but rather demand to have Apple's source code by law.   Apple's CEO had told ABC news back in February that if new laws were passed in the U.S. forcing them to comply with warrants to open iPhones that they would comply with the law. Specifically, Cook told the ABC interviewer, "Let me clear. At the end of the day, we have to follow the law. Just like everybody else. So we have to follow the law." There's no reason to believe that Cook's statement won't stand and extend to China.   Will China force Apple's hand on this sensitive issue? Bloomberg notes that "Advocates say the government will issue future regulations to clarify its scope and intent." So it will remain an open question until at least next summer at minimum when clarification of the law will be cemented. But on paper, it appears that the option will remain on the books until they decide to pull the trigger. At that time, Apple is likely to comply.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The result was largely a success, and even Apple CEO Tim Cook said he didn't expect the overwhelming demand for the device. Apple iPhone SE review: Great things can come in small packages KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been accurate on a number of Apple rumours before, says there won't be a follow-up model in 2017. The main reason for no new model is it may affect iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales, which are already struggling because of lack of demand, especially in China. Because the current model has the same specs as the 6S, the only logical step would be for the new model to have the same specs as the iPhone 7. Apple would obviously much rather consumers buy the more expensive models, so will hold off releasing a cheaper SE model to encourage them. Apple is also said to in talks with component suppliers to reduce costs to help it improve profits, although some suppliers such as Samsung are unlikely to budge, but smaller companies may well be forced to. Kuo predicts Apple will sell fewer iPhones in the current quarter, around 40-50 million, down from 51.2 million in the same quarter a year ago.

Here's What Amazon Has Learned So Far With its smart speaker and voice service, Amazon has gained new areas of expertise—and, in some cases, been surprised by its own customers. [Photos: courtesy of Amazon] Harry McCracken 11.07.16 12:00 AM On November 6 2014, Amazon announced Echo, a smart speaker featuring a voice-controlled assistant service called Alexa. The company didn't exactly go out of its way to whip up excitement for these newcomers. In sharp contrast to the rollout of its ill-fated Fire Phone—which kicked off with a press-conference extravaganza starring Jeff Bezos—it simply disclosed that Echo existed and would be sold, at first, on an invitation-only basis to Prime members. But Echo spoke for itself—and not just literally. People quickly saw that the pint-size cylinder was a genuinely new kind of consumer-electronics device. They got excited over the concept, and, soon thereafter, by where Amazon was taking it. The company opened up Echo sales to all comers in July 2015. Today, it has a hit product on its hands. (Amazon is famous for its reluctance to reveal hard numbers about product sales, but a third-party study showed Echo's market share sailing past those of big-time speaker makers such as Bose, Logitech, and Sonos.) Alexa is also available on Amazon's Tap (a cheaper, smaller Echo) and Dot (an adapter for other speakers) as well as its Fire TV box and Fire tablets, and is gradually coming to non-Amazon devices. Beyond that, Amazon has established itself as a peer of Apple, Google, and Microsoft when it comes to building voice-controlled interfaces and infusing them with artificial intelligence. The number of "skills" that Alexa possesses—tasks that it can perform, such as setting a thermostat or summoning an Uber—has grown from 135 in January to 1,000 in June to 4,000 today, thanks to the tools that the company has given developers to integrate their services and devices into Alexa. By the time proprietors of other voice services have caught up with that figure, Alexa may have sprinted even further ahead. Rohit Prasad and Toni Reid To hear about what Amazon has learned during the first two years of this journey, I visited its campus and spoke with two of the people who have shaped Echo and Alexa from the days before they'd been announced. Toni Reid, director of product, Echo devices and Alexa, is an 18-year Amazon veteran who's responsible for the overall consumer experience of Echo and related products such as the Dot and Tap. And Rohit Prasad, VP and head scientist for Alexa machine learning, oversees the artificial-intelligence underpinnings that allow Alexa to understand and fulfill user requests. Looking Forward, Working Backwards Amazon started work on the Alexa and Echo project in 2011, long before it ever told the world about it. And its initial goal couldn't have been much loftier. "The inspiration for Alexa," declares Prasad, "was the Star Trek computer." In other words, Amazon aspired to create a computing interface that wasn't all that different from communicating with a really smart, capable human being. That's not exactly a unique goal: Google has often turned to the same cultural touchstone. But it clearly provided Amazon with enough challenges to keep itself busy for many years and multiple product cycles. At the same time, the company wanted to focus its effort on something discrete and achievable. "You'll hear us talk about our working-backwards process, where we write a press release as if it's going out to customers at the very beginning of a process, and then we start working backwards from that," explains Reid. As part of this working-backwards analysis, Amazon decided that Echo would not only be a voice-controlled speaker but that it wouldn't have a display at all, a design gambit that meant that Alexa would not only emphasize speech (like Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana) but be 100% reliant on it. "Not having a screen meant there was no escape route," says Prasad. "We had to solve that problem." Among the products in Amazon's Alexa-enabled lineup: the Tap, Fire TV, Echo, and Dot In multiple ways, the Alexa and Echo projects required Amazon to ramp up its expertise in machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies beyond all the things it was already using them for, such as recommending products and forecasting prices. "A voice-based computer that you could just talk to was definitely the natural progression of that in terms of complete artificial intelligence working at the scale you'd want," says Prasad. The company turned to machine learning from the start as it figured out how to teach a speaker that might be located across the room to recognize the "wake word" ("Alexa," by default) among all the other other conversation that might be going on in a room—a different, more daunting challenge than that presented by earlier, smartphone-centric voice assistants such as Siri. Here's what an Echo would hear without any noise cancellation, and what it hears after the software Amazon created has scrubbed out almost all sound except for the wake word "Alexa": From a feature standpoint, some of Amazon's decisions about what to build were pretty straightforward. "We started to look at use cases, what customers would be doing in their home," Reid says. "Music floated to the top." At first, that music you got was mostly from Amazon's own catalog—which, in a world in which many people get their music elsewhere, was limiting. "That wasn't something we were oblivious to," Reid. "It was just the timing. But our customers very quickly [said] 'We want Pandora, we want Spotify, we want other providers.' And so we did the work to implement them." Another obvious missing service in the earliest days: Amazon's own audiobook arm, Audible. "You'd think Amazon would have it, but we didn't, and that was a big ask for customers," Reid remembers. "They had this device in their house and they said, 'I want to listen to my audiobooks.'" Amazon had a good handle on the types of content people would want to consume via Alexa. But it also listened carefully to the people who bought Echoes—which was a major reason why it sold the product only in limited quantities through an invitation system at first. "We thought, let's go to a subset of customers who we think will give us feedback and who want to shape the product," Reid explains. "It turned out that it worked. We had a group of great customers who gave us early feedback and high usage." It turned out that those consumers were interested in using Alexa to control other devices in their households. Amazon hadn't ignored such a scenario entirely, but it hadn't been one of its initial priorities, as evidenced by this introductory video, which doesn't even mention home automation: Two years later, Alexa has become a primary interface for other household gizmos, an area where other giants such as Apple are still finding their footing. Amazon has built the APIs that allow sellers of other consumer-electronics devices to hook their creations into Alexa, and sells many such products on the Alexa Smart Home section of its site, including light switches, light bulbs, thermostats, fans, security cameras, and other devices. "The smart home has been a big surprise for us from a usage perspective." "The smart home has been a big surprise for us from a usage perspective," says Reid. "You're moving out of this very early-adopter perspective, with high-tech hackers setting it up. It's becoming more mainstream and I think Alexa is actually allowing that to happen and simplifying it for customers." As third-party companies use Amazon's tools to make their devices and services work with Alexa, they're able to build on top of Amazon's investment in machine learning and other technologies. But they've had to confront the question of how to make their offerings usable through voice alone, an interface-design exercise that they would have to go through sooner or later for other voice assistants as well. "When you talk to developers, you will hear them say, 'It was a needed challenge for me to think about how I could transition my app that used a GUI [graphic user interface] to a voice experience,'" Prasad says, "I don't think we intended to challenge developers. But I think it was welcome, given that it was a big shift." The battery-powered Tap puts Alexa on a speaker you can take anywhere Shopping Without Seeing From a monetization standpoint, Amazon's long-term goal isn't just to sell scads of Echoes, Dots, and Taps. As with other Amazon hardware, Alexa-powered gadgets are designed to make buying stuff from the company so easy that the more you use them, the better the company will do. "We build the devices in a way that will start that flywheel effect, from a business perspective," Reid says, pointing to services such as Amazon Music and Audible that people are more likely to pay for if they use them on an Echo. Then there's another way Amazon can make money from Alexa: by turning it into a store. The easiest type of shopping to do through voice alone is simply to order more of something you've bought before from Amazon, so that's where the Alexa team started. "It’s a seamless experience," says Prasad. You know very quickly when it’s going to show up." It's when someone wants to buy something new that things get tricky—especially since shoppers usually don't begin their quest by naming a specific product, and probably don't want to spend 20 minutes talking to Alexa to narrow down their options. "I ordered a Roomba through voice," Prasad says. "But you can’t order a blue shirt. A lot of it is discovery-based: You look for ‘blue shirt’ rather than ‘Calvin Klein blue shirt.’ You’re either brand conscious or price conscious and we need to balance all of these [factors]." "I’m not that picky. I could say ‘medium blue shirt,’ and I’ll be happy with that." Even for traditional Amazon shopping on a device with a screen, Reid says, "we’re optimizing for the first few search results. You’ve got the concept of 'above the fold' on a laptop. In voice, you really just have one—maybe you can argue two—shots. You don’t want Alexa to read off three or four items." To do that winnowing for commoditized types of products such as AA batteries, Amazon now uses algorithms to boil down many similar offerings into one pick that it calls "Amazon's Choice." But there are many categories where it's tough for the company to make a selection on behalf of a customer, especially for items that involve an aesthetic aspect, such as clothing. "I’m not that picky," says Prasad. "I could say ‘medium blue shirt,’ and I’ll be happy with that. Will everyone in the world be happy with that experience? I don’t think so. We’re going to experiment a lot. I’m not saying we won’t do it. We just have to do it right." Amazon is continuing to chip away at the challenge of making voice shopping make sense. In the long run, it sees it as something different than online shopping in its conventional form, and perhaps more personal. "In India, it used to be that you’d go to the same shop every time and see the same salesman who'd route you to what you needed," Prasad says. "It’s that kind of relationship you need to build with a voice-based shopping assistant. You want that kind of trust. And it's not just a technical problem." Alexa As A Personality In the Star Trek universe, the computer had a human quality in part because it was voiced by a human: actress Majel Barrett, who eventually married Gene Roddenberry, the series' creator. And well before it announced Alexa and Echo, Amazon was at work on making Alexa feel like a personality rather than an automaton. Here, for instance, is a comparison of what Alexa sounded like a year before it debuted—intelligible, but rather lifeless—and the considerably more peppy version that Amazon shipped: If anything, the consumers who use Alexa have treated it even more like a person than Amazon expected, a fact that it can monitor by keeping track of what they ask for in aggregate. For instance, 13,000 more users have asked Alexa who it's voting for than have asked who they should vote for, which the company sees as a sign that the service's personality matters. (For the record, Alexa responds to "Who should I vote for?" with "You should vote for the candidate who best reflects your views and has the best policies" and to "Who are you voting for?" with "There are no voting booths in the cloud—believe me, I've looked...It's all just ones and zeroes up here.") "Big data can get you great information, but then customers are also telling us what’s important to them," Reid says, noting that a U.K. customer was nonplussed that Alexa can't sing "Happy Birthday" there. (In the U.S., it can.) Users might care about playful answers and songs, but the next frontier for services such as Alexa is interacting in ways that feel less like automated responses to commands and more like genuine human interaction. That's a basic research problem rather than something any one company is likely to fully achieve on its own. So in September, Amazon announced the Alexa Prize, an annual competition, with up to $2.5 million in prizes, in which university students will try to create bots that can intelligently chat about topical matters for 20 minutes. The scenarios that Amazon aims to help create with this contest, says Prasad, are "pushing the boundaries, not just in terms of personality but how you interact, in a setting where you can have more long-term discussions, rather than this transactional nature of interactions, where you say 'play music,' but you’re not actually engaging in a full conversation. That’s where we’re going next. " "We have a bunch of features we want to get done for our customers." That sort of ambition will be necessary if Alexa and the devices that run it are to remain trendsetters. Google's Home speaker, powered by its Google Assistant service, is unmistakably an attempt to out-Echo the Echo, and is getting respectable reviews. Rumor also has it that Apple is working on an Echo-esque device, a move that would make Siri and Alexa into direct rivals. Microsoft, Samsung, and other companies with the wherewithal to compete in the voice-assistant game are presumably also hatching plans to take on Alexa and the Echo. The other companies whose products fall into the same ballpark as Alexa and the Echo "are building some interesting things," Reid says. "We want to understand where our gaps are relative to common experiences. What are they doing, and doing better than we are?" Still, like virtually any other big-company executive you might ask about the competitive landscape, Reid and Prasad emphasize that they don't obsess over what others are doing. "We have our own roadmap," says Prasad. "We have a bunch of features we want to get done for our customers. That’s what we worry about mostly, daily." When Alexa and the Echo were still just ambitious ideas rather than shipping projects, he adds, "my own team felt like we had a nine out of 10 chance of making this work. I felt that if we were able to solve the technical problems, we'd have a new category that we'd created." Prasad was right—and the fact that the category Amazon created has become one of the hottest ones in tech is one reason why the next two years for these products promise to be even more eventful than their first two.

Kuo’s sales numbers on the iPhone 7 shows a trend of falling sales, with the primary factor being the weak demand for the phone in China and slow shipments expected in Q1 of 2017. It is suggested that Apple is not giving the iPhone SE a bigger lease at life, but instead plans to use the lack of a new 4-inch variant to boost sales of the flagship 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch devices. Considering that Apple’s flagships are much more expensive than the SE, the company’s profit margins are higher with those phones as well. Apple launched the iPhone SE in March of 2016, breaking its annual iPhone launch cycle that happens in September. Driven by the fact that many customers using the smaller form (4-inch) iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s were reluctant to move on to the larger iPhone 6, 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, 6s Plus – Apple decided to launch a new 4-inch phone with update specs. Even while reports have suggested that the iPhone SE received a greater reception than what Apple expected, the Cupertino giant however (according to Kuo) sees ‘lower than expected gross margin’ with the device. Kuo added that Apple is pressurising its component manufacturers to reduce price of production in order to drive up its own margins. A recent report by MBO Capital Markets analyst, Tim Long said that Apple has more than 100 per cent of smartphone industry profits in Q3 2016. Long suggested that Apple ends with “more smartphone profit than the industry netted overall”, while its vendors lose money. Read- Apple patent hints a foldable, bendable iPhone: Report Apple iPhone SE carried forward the form factor of the iPhone 5s with a 4-inch IPS LCD display. The phone however runs better hardware, which it borrows from the iPhone 6s series. iPhone SE is powered by an Apple A9 chipset coupled with a six-core PowerVR GT7600 GPU. It comes with 2GB RAM and storage options of 16/64GB.

Published on November 07, 2016. Most Popular The machines are rising. They are planning our days, making our reservations, ordering our cars. We talk to Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google like we would a human assistant. But how do these AI systems compare? Here's a look at what they do, how they're marketed and what they'll do next. Siri, made by Apple Credit: Apple Siri Made by Apple Origins: Siri was perhaps the first virtual personal assistant to enter the mainstream, debuting on the iPhone in 2011. Functions: Siri only widely opened to third-party apps this year with the arrival of iOS 10. That's allowed developers outside Apple to give it capabilities such as hailing an Uber if you simply ask for one, which so far is the pinnacle of achievement for most consumer-facing AI. Major malfunction: Siri was criticized early on for poor speech recognition because Apple was behind rivals in "neural network" technology—that's nerd-speak for computers that act more like human brains. Apple improved this technology this year. Upgrades: Siri is getting smarter with Apple TV. A viewer can ask it to pull up a livestream from inside Apple TV apps. It also is embedded into Apple CarPlay for hands-free control of key systems like navigation, music and messaging. And Siri is gaining control of homes through Apple HomeKit. Marketing: In the past year, Apple has played up Siri's talk-to-TV capabilities in TV commercials. It's also relied on stars like Zooey Deschanel and Cookie Monster in work done by Apple agency TBWA/Media Arts Lab. Alexa on Echo, made by Amazon Credit: Amazon Alexa Made by Amazon Origins: Alexa is the name Amazon gave the digital assistant living inside its Echo home device, which started selling widely in June 2015. Functions: Alexa began with limited uses, most often responding from the in-home speaker to requests for things like weather and news. Alexa can also find a radio station from TuneIn. It's an Amazon pitchwoman through and through, so it will take commands like remembering your shopping list. Major malfunction: Alexa isn't in your phone; it's stuck inside the Echo or the newer Dot device. Amazon just made it available in its tablets. Upgrades: This fall, Alexa connected with Amazon's TV device to control streaming video. And it made the leap from simply taking dictation around shopping lists to now placing the orders. Alexa also has a program to control the home environment. Tinkerers have hacked the device to perform functions like starting their Tesla cars remotely. Marketing: The company is running an ambitious series of 100 digital vignettes called "Alexa Moments," 10 seconds each, to show its versatility. Tool of North America is the agency. Cortana Made by Microsoft Origins: Cortana was introduced in 2014, named after the AI character in the hit Xbox game "Halo." Cortana, made by Microsoft Credit: Microsoft Functions: Microsoft calls Cortana a "digital agent." It can handle basics like controlling calendars, getting weather and taking dictation on an email. Major malfunction: Like all AI-powered assistants, Cortana is only as smart as its programming, and Cortana gets much of its information from Microsoft's Bing. It does not use Google, the search leader. That's not a "malfunction," but it is different. Upgrades: Microsoft has put Cortana into its Edge web browser, which means it's there to help complete online tasks such as making reservations or looking for discounts while shopping. Cortana also works with Google Android and Apple iOS devices. Microsoft wants Cortana to be everywhere, including of course its own ecosystem, from the Xbox to Skype to LinkedIn. Marketing: Microsoft's most memorable Cortana commercials are the ones that go directly after Siri, something it has done a few times over the years in spots from M:United. Assistant, made by Google Credit: Google Assistant Made by Google Origins: In 2012, Google answered Apple's Siri by adding Google Now to phones. Google's AI advanced this year with Google Home, an Echo competitor, and a new messaging app called Allo, both bearing a voice-commanded helper known simply as Google Assistant. It's also the engine for Now. Functions: Google Assistant acts like Siri or Cortana, as an assistant that can call up information and perform tasks like turning on Spotify and giving directions. Of course, Google taps into its own knowledge graph to retrieve the relevant information for consumers, which gives it an advantage as it expands capabilities. Major malfunction: Privacy is a concern for all AI-powered devices invading our homes, but Google gets higher scrutiny on this issue because of all the data it has. It's going to be a challenge to balance privacy with always-on. ever-listening digital assistance. Upgrades: Assistant can perform tasks like finding flights. The assistant also syncs with Chromecast, giving people voice control over their digital TV experience. Marketing: Google is promoting its new Pixel phone with TV spots calling it the first phone with Assistant. Droga 5 is the agency.

November 7 AAPL: 110.41 1.57 Report: Apple wants to manufacture iPhones and iPads in India, asks government for investment incentives Benjamin Mayo - 1 week ago @bzamayo Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple executives have targeted both India and China as developing regions to drive revenue growth in the coming years, primarily through iPhone sales. However, India has stringent regulations on foreign device sales and requires that 30% of the components in the devices must be sourced domestically. Apple currently cannot meet this requirement as the vast majority of parts and all assembly happens in China. As such, Apple is looking to setup a new manufacturing plant in India that will make iPhones and iPads, thereby complying with the law and enabling iPhone to join the Indian smartphone market en masse. Via the India Times, Apple is seeking incentives from Indian government to reduce the financial burden of setting up a whole new plant. India offers large organizations financial incentives to invest in local electronics manufacturing; Apple is looking to take advantage of this. The government body managing the application says that “due diligence” is underway. Apple has attempted Indian iPhone sales from multiple angles. It tried to arrange a special exception to the 30% local manufacturing rule earlier this year, claiming iPhones were too technologically advanced for local sourcing to be possible. This request was refused. Apple also attempted to get the government’s permission to resell used iPhones in India, allowing Apple to enter the market at lower price points, but this was also blocked and denied. India saw the attempt as a quick way to ‘dump’ reject devices in their country. At the moment, the company must resort to selling limited quantities of its phones through Indian resellers — severely limiting the market potential. Ever since, rumors of Foxconn and Apple teaming up for an Indian manufacturing plant have been swirling. Local manufacturing will allow Apple to comply with the 30% domestic components rule and may also help margins in a market where prices are likely to be squeezed. The average cost of a smartphone in India is $150 — several hundred dollars cheaper than the newest iPhones. The government response today confirms that these plans are in motion but a projected timeline is not clear. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Twelfth Monkey Menu Skip to content Home About Search Search for: PlayStation 4 Pro: re-balancing the power narrative November 7, 2016 / K. Jihwan Back in the latter days of the PS3 and Xbox 360, many people were convinced that we had arrived at the end of the gaming consoles as we knew them. The buzz was all about browser gaming (in the halcyon days of FarmVille), and then mobile gaming. Among the most vocal critics of the future of traditional gaming were pro-Apple tech pundits like MG Siegler, to whom the vision of a gaming-oriented Apple TV dominating gamers’ living rooms came all too readily. All that Apple had to was click a finger, and the whole industry would be theirs. We all know that’s not how things played out. PS4 and Xbox One have outpaced their respective predecessors in sales, and the former in particular has surpassed all expectations. At almost 50 million in sales 3 years after release, it is as far removed from being ‘in crisis’ or ‘killed by Apple’ as a console is possible to get. While Xbox One has suffered in comparison, together Sony and Microsoft – with almost 70 million sales – have nevertheless proved that console gaming remains in great demand. It would be misleading to say, however, that the PS4 was a product born of defiance. The opposite, in fact: partly in reaction to the perceived threat from mobile and set-top box gaming1, PS4 was designed to be affordable and accessible with the ability to ensure backwards-compatibility going forward. With internal components customized around existing off-the-shelf chips from AMD, and a pressing need to not be loss-leaders, PS4 was much less technologically ambitious compared to previous eras2. So far this has been sufficient to drive sales and to maintain the loyalty and interest of the core gamers. The sheer amount of time since the release of the previous consoles3 meant that the new ones didn’t need to be formidable technical powerhouses in order to present clear graphical improvements. However, with PS4 now firmly a part of the x86 family, the gaming console has opened itself up for a new comparison – and a renewed competition: the gaming PC. There are multiple reasons for this, but to summarize: the extended lifecycle of the PS3; the aforementioned conservative specs for PS4; the mobile app revolution which essentially removed casual gamers from the addressable market for traditional consoles; accelerated advancements made in PC graphics cards over the past decade; and Steam’s emergence which, as well as offering PC gamers perhaps the most convenient, comprehensive and customer-friendly distribution platform of them all, did much to console-ify PC gaming in terms of the integration of service, ease of use and commonality of input method4. Ultimately, the PC did much to catch up to consoles in the areas it was behind in, while widening the already-significant gap in performance to the extent that an i3 processor with a sub-$150 graphics card like GTX 950 can outperform PS4. With no casual gamers to appeal to in order to stimulate sales, core gamers are more or less the only segment that Sony can capture, and the fact that PS4 is made to look so modest next to even a fairly budget gaming PC is not going to help drive further revenue. The runaway success of PS4 showed that there remained a tremendous amount of hunger for high-fidelity console gaming. Sony has also seen first-hand that consumers do care about things like resolution and framerates. With most of the casual customer base that propelled the Wii to a 100m unit sales decamped to iOS and Android, PS4’s growth depends on taking more users away from Xbox One and PCs, as well as convincing existing PS4 owners to upgrade. Arguably Sony has achieved the first part; the second and third segments are more tricky to win over, and near-impossible to achieve with the baseline PS4 specs. So it makes a lot of sense for Sony to release PS4 Pro now, rather than wait for the full console lifecycle to play out, when the PS4 would be even more painfully outdated. Sony’s stable of first-party developers as well as close relationships with indie studios mean that it can continue to rely on a steady stream of exclusives, and while this may be distasteful to PC die-hards, it also tempts others without consoles to think seriously about getting a PS4 Pro. In Sony’s favour is the shrewd way they have managed the PS4 Pro’s release. It has a year’s headstart on Microsoft’s Scorpio hardware, and it costs the same as the launch price of the original PS4. By ensuring an immediacy of availability at a deceptively reasonable price point, Sony is treading the same proven (if still rather elusive) marketing and business path that has been so successful for Apple5. Microsoft will counter that Scorpio will be more powerful6, but in Sony’s favour is the likelihood that Microsoft will find it difficult to price Scorpio at anywhere other than north of $399, and that the combination of the graphical improvement that the PS4 Pro does deliver (2.3x over vanilla PS4) and its earlier release should prove sufficient to encourage upgrades and defections. PS4 Pro is being released in three days’ time, and the fact that there’s not a lot of hype and fanfare around it is going to help Sony. It’s proof that the company has not gone out of its way to create artificial excitement, and the expectations should therefore be easier to manage. Instead of being heralded as the new future of PlayStation, PS4 Pro is being presented as just another, more premium (albeit still affordable) option, something for gamers who want better and faster to consider but not something that will fracture the player base. Customer resentment and confusion are likely to be kept at a minimum. Mid-lifecycle hardware upgrade of this magnitude is new frontier for the console manufacturers, but in the age of annual smartphone and tablet releases, it’s not unfamiliar for tech consumers. PS4 was a product of necessity, and commoditized as a sensible design choice. PS4 Pro further commoditizes the gaming console, and helps Sony to not fall further behind the latest graphics technology. PS4 showed that the age of console gaming was not over; PS4 Pro could go onto show that it may in fact be the beginning of an evolving new era.     …and also in reaction to the excesses of the PS3 launch. ↩ Also, for arguably the first time, this generation saw the home consoles unable to present a graphical advantage over the PCs at the point of their launch. ↩ For reference, PS1 to PS2 was 5 years 3 months; PS2 to PS3 was 6 years 8 months. PS3 to PS4 was 7 years. ↩ Xbox controller becoming the de facto controller for PC games is one of the my favourite developments in PC gaming in recent years. ↩ Best examples are the 2nd generation MacBook Air and iPad 2. ↩ 40% more powerful than PS4 Pro, by Digital Foundry’s reckoning. ↩ Share this: Email Google Twitter Facebook Like this: Like Loading...

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Features, News And Update Rumors For Apple MacBook Air 2017, Will It Support Up To 32GB Of RAM? Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 08, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» It is expected that a new MacBook Air will launch sometime next year in spite of rumors suggesting that Apple has discontinued the entire lineup. Several reports suggest that the device which was dubbed the MacBook Air 2017 will make a debut next year, hopefully in March. Currently, tech experts and fans are looking forward to the release of the new iPad Pro version. There have been a lot of rumors surrounding the iPad Pro along with its probable successors, and the idea of a new MacBook has been discarded. It is yet to be confirmed that Apple has discontinued the Air series of laptops. MacBook Air series received the last major update back in 2015, and even though it received an update this year, it’s not that significant. The new MacBook Pro 2016 was released last month, but news about the MacBook Air 2017 has not been revealed. According to MacWorld UK, the minor upgrade in 2016 could probably signal the release of a major one next year. Considering that, a 2017 release is still possible for the MacBook Air 2017. In the meantime, WCCFTech revealed that MacBook Air 2017 is happening, but the laptop is expected to be the last entry in the series. An impressive update was not received by the current model, and there isn’t a lot that the company can do to the device because of limitations with dimensions. Considering that, MacBook Air’s legacy of being the thinnest ever laptop could soon be over. However, other reports suggest that it will be lighter and thinner compared to its predecessor. The specifications will be improved, and new batteries should be included on board. It will also come with a cooling module and improved chassis. The device could feature a USB Type-C connection as well. Take all this information with a pinch of salt since the specs, and rumored features are all based on guesses and speculations. It is recommended that you wait for official updates from Apple. Meanwhile, Ming-Chi Kuo, the famous KGI Securities Analyst expects that there will be price cuts for both new and old MacBooks in 2017 along with a refresh which adds 32GB of RAM and more. He also believes that the plethora of USB Type-C devices and software which takes advantage of the Touch Bar will become more advanced, thereby exciting more users. Kuo also expects that refreshed MacBook Pros will be launched in the second half of 2017 and will include support for 32GB RAM. Kuo also mentions that this is dependent on whether the Cannonlake processors are launched by Intel. Many customers have reported that the new MacBook which runs on Skylake processors continues to max out with 16 gigabytes of RAM and also costs more than previous-generation models. Phil Schiller, the Apple marketing chief told in an email to David, a MacRumors reader that if Apple makes a notebook with more than 16GB of RAM, it will start consuming a lot of power. Schiller said during an interview that price is something they care about but the company focuses more on designs for experience instead of price. Kuo expects that the 12-inch MacBook and new MacBook Pros will undergo price-cuts, it is unclear whether Apple will introduce support for a maximum of 32GB RAM for the MacBook 12-inch variants, besides the MacBook Pro.

(Reuters/Jason Lee) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging November 07, 2016 Apple is still the king of profitability among smartphone makers. And it’s not even close. Yes, the company experienced three straight quarters of declining iPhone sales before registering an uptick in its most recently completed quarter. And its overall quarterly profit slid for the first time in 15 years. Even so, Apple accounted for a staggering 103.6% of the smartphone industry’s operating profits during the third quarter, according to a BMO Capital Markets analyst, Investor Business Daily reported. How’s that possible? Pretty much all of its competitors logged losses during that time period. Samsung, which is suffering due to its exploding Galaxy Note 7 debacle, grabbed an almost insignificant share (0.9%) of industry profits, BMO found. Money-losers in the smartphone business last quarter included LG and HTC, Long told IBD. LG reported a $381 million loss due to weakening interest in its flagship G5 phone, which saw shipments decline 9% from the year prior. Taiwanese vendor HTC’s revenue was down 44% compared to a year ago, as it failed to keep up with the hyper-competitive market. Meanwhile, from July through September, the iPhone accounted for 60% of Apple’s revenue, and overall the company generated $9 billion in income. Making it even more remarkable is the fact that Apple has actually been losing market share. In the third quarter of 2016, Android captured a record 88% of the global market, according to Strategy Analytics. Meanwhile, Apple’s iOS share slipped to 12.1% in the same period, from 13.6% the year prior. Android has hundreds of partners across the world—Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei and more—which play in the low and mid-range sectors in price-sensitive economies. Apple iOS is only available in the handful of handsets the Cupertino company releases, and its cheapest device is the $400 iPhone SE. Apple has always captured a small portion of the market and yet brought in the vast majority of the profits. During the third quarter of 2015, it generated 90% of the industry’s profits in the industry, BMO said. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

If KGI Securities' analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, then Apple's sales in the first and second quarter of 2017 will continue to decline, falling short of how it performed in the same quarters in 2016. Kuo blamed the second quarter decline on Apple's decision to not refresh the iPhone SE next year. Apple's iPhone marks its tenth anniversary next year, and the Cupertino is keeping things minimal but significant rather than going all out. The iPhone 8 is expected to pack major upgrades; however, Kuo claims that the company will give the next version of iPhone SE a complete miss. "Shipment volume in 2Q16 came in higher than expected thanks to upbeat demand for the iPhone SE. However, in order to keep gross margin at a high level and to avoid cannibalisation of high-end models, we do not expect Apple to launch an upgraded iPhone SE in 2Q17. Without contribution from a new model, we forecast total iPhone shipment volume will reach 35-40mn units and fall YoY in 2Q17, lower than the 40.4mn units in 2Q16," 9to5Mac quotes Kuo as stating in his note to investors.The analyst also notes that this decision is mostly influenced through Apple's effort to keep the gross margin high and minimise cannibalisation of high-end flagships like the iPhone 7. While Kuo seems certain that there will be no iPhone SE refresh next year, he did not provide any clarity on when (and whether) Apple plans to update. The iPhone SE was launched in March this year, and helped Apple garner a lot of sales this year. It remains unsure what update cycle will Apple adopt for the iPhone SE range. In any case, Kuo is not that positive on iPhone 7 sales in 2017 first quarter, claiming that the shipment volume in that time frame will be 40-50 million units, much lower than 51.2 million units that were shipped in first quarter of 2016. Most of this sales decline is attributed to the lack of demand of the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. However, Kuo comes bearing some good news as well, and claims that even though the first two quarters next year are said to see a decline in sales, Apple will more than make up for it after the launch of its iPhone 8 smartphone. The smartphone, based on preliminary rumours, is expected to sport an OLED display panel, come in three variants instead of two, sport an optic fingerprint recognition technology, and have an all-glass casing.

Samsung plans to integrate an AI platform called Viv into Galaxy phones  It is unclear what types of services will be offered through the assistant It is hoping the S8 will revive smartphone momentum after scrapping the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 By Reuters and Shivali Best For Mailonline Published: 05:26 EST, 6 November 2016 | Updated: 07:14 EST, 7 November 2016 e-mail 49 shares 84 View comments Set to take on Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, Samsung has said it will launch its own artificial intelligence digital assistant service for its upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone. The announcement comes shortly after the Galaxy Note 7's collapse, which is expected to hit Samsung's profit by £4.4 billion ($5.4 billion). It is unclear what types of services will be offered through the AI assistant that will be launched on the Galaxy S8, which is expected to go on sale early next year.

It's speculated that Samsung could design a fingerprint-sensing display or place the feature behind the tempered glass. Because levels of concentration will be increased with a 'full screen', pictures and videos should be much clearer and even go so far as to produce a 3D effect. Rumors suggest that pixels of the dual-cameras will support 16 megapixels and 8 megapixels.  Another new addition to the Galaxy S8 could also be an upgraded Application process (AP) that corresponds to handset's brain.  Sources say Samsung is going to start mas-producing 10-nano Snapdragon 830s, which will be used for Galaxy S8, at the end of this year at the earliest.  In October, Samsung announced the acquisition of Viv Labs Inc, a firm run by a co-creator of Apple Inc's Siri voice assistant programme.  Samsung plans to integrate the company's AI platform, called Viv, into the Galaxy smartphones and expand voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices. Samsung is counting on the Galaxy S8 to help revive smartphone momentum after scrapping the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. Investors and analysts say the Galaxy S8 must be a strong device in order for Samsung to win back customers and revive earnings momentum. Samsung did not comment on what types of services would be offered through the AI assistant that will be launched on the Galaxy S8, which is expected to go on sale early next year.  It said the AI assistant would allow customers to use third-party services seamlessly. 'Developers can attach and upload services to our agent,' said Samsung Executive Vice President Rhee Injong during a briefing, referring to its AI assistant.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Apple has killed off everything good about the Macbook Pro Posted on November 7, 2016 by Nick Farrell - News A member of the Tame Apple Press who four years ago claimed that the Mac Pro contained everything that a laptop needed has admitted that his favourite company has dropped the ball with its latest version. Jason Koeble wrote in 2012 a review which claimed that the non-retina MacBook Pro was the “most flexible and ultimately had the potential to be the most powerful laptop”. This was because it used used non-proprietary, upgradable RAM and the CD drive could be easily replaced with many types of solid state hard drives with minimal effort. However, with the release of its new MacBook Pros, Keoble has had to admit that the fruity cargo cult has taken away this good thing that the MacBook Pro had and turned the device into something expensive and disposable. Koeble tried his best to salvage what in Apple fanboy terms is a “scathing review”.  He said that the  new MacBook Pros were a performance upgrade for a product line that had gone four years without a significant redesign, but the move to smaller, thinner, sleeker has sacrificed customisability, reparability, and upgrade-ability. However, that covered his obvious anger that the laptop has a glued down battery, soldered RAM and the specs of the computer you buy will be its specs until the end of its life. Koeble said that the SSD was removable but was proprietary, which means finding replacement ones will require going to the grey market and Apple does not sell replacement parts to the public or to independent repair shops for MacBooks or iPhones. He seems to be implying that Apple realised that its previous policy of allowing people to fix key parts was preventing them from buying new ones. “I used a 2010 MacBook Air without feeling a particular need to upgrade it, and I’m sure there are tons of you out there in the same boat. As a rule, Apple’s computers last for a long time regardless of the specs it has. So to consumers, maybe upgradability doesn’t matter as much as it used to,” he said. He said that Apple has little incentive to help those who upgrade and fix computers people and arguably has little obligation to build computers that can be repaired and resold on the secondary market. What is weird about all this is that Apple is trying to sell itself as environmentally friendly. What this is doing is putting a lot of computers which could be re-used back on the rubbish tip.   Tags: appl, macbook pro Search for: Recent Articles Boffins work out how your fingers can grass you up A team of insecurity experts has worked out that that it is possible to hack a smartphone by listeni[...] BMW wants to sell 100,000 electric cars next year BMW wants to boost sales of electric cars by two thirds next year to 100,000 vehicles.

It turns out that if you say "pen pineapple apple pen" to the Japanese version of Siri, you'll be totally convinced that Apple is aware of Piko-Taro's "smash" "hit" "song." Just in case you were worried otherwise! "Nice! Let me try as well," Siri says, before dropping what amounts to an excruciating ad for newly launched mobile payment services: ("で" means "with" or "by," so the kicker here is "Use Apple Pay with Apple Watch!") This is fine, really. Apple Pay did just launch in Japan, and it is actually kind of a big deal, so I can't blame Apple for making the most of a fortuitous situation.

Rohit KVN   November 7, 2016 14:48 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares Apple iOS jailbreak update: Demo video showing Jailbroken iPhone 7 running iOS 10.2 beta surface online@ijapija00's YouTube demo video [Screen-shot] It's been only a few days since Apple released the iOS 10.2 public (beta) version to registered developers and now, a demo video showing the new OS jailbroken has surfaced online. Apple had intensified its war against jailbreaking in iOS by patching the loophole in the kernel protection system in the iOS v9.2 in late October 2015 and ever since, many jailbreak communities have tried to break it open. A few popular communities such as PanGu Team and TaiG showed limited success, but it has got increasingly difficult with the release of the iOS 10 series. Why advertise with us?

Also read: Microsoft Surface phone images leak; when will Windows 10 mobile flagship be unveiled? In August, Apple had announced a bounty program for software developers and those who find security loopholes will stand a chance to claim handsome cash reward, making it much more difficult for the jailbreaking community. Now, a popular iOS coder, @ijapija00, has released a video (link provided below) showing a jailbroken iPhone 7 running the latest iOS 10.2 public (beta 1) version.

Minyanville AAPL Strong Dividend Stock in the Technology Space By Scutify Nov 06, 2016 11:30 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others.

Buz Investors Bullish AAPL Strong Dividend Stock If you look at Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock performance over the past 12 months, it has basically done nothing for its huge investor base. More recently, Apple stock has been on a slippery slope since it announced its third-quarter earnings, which the market didn't like much. There are two potential drivers of this performance. One is that after the massive capital gains of the past decade, AAPL stock is entering a growth phase where it's basically a value play, with stable dividend payouts and normal returns. AAPL Strong Dividend Stock Transitioning Into A Great Value Investment For the quarter ended September 24, 2016, Apple reported $1.67 profit per share, which was better than Wall Street's expectation of $1.66 per share. Apple sales rose to $46.85 billion in the same period, also better than analysts' estimates of $46.83 billion. For the same quarter, Apple shipped 45.5 million units of the "iPhone;" analysts expected the tech giant to ship 44.8 million. (Source: "Apple Reports Fourth Quarter Results," Apple Inc., October 25, 2016.) To me, it makes more sense to accept Apple stock as a great value play rather than expecting the company to produce earthshaking results and products every other quarter. And I don't think the fact that it won't is bad news for long-term investors who prefer slower growth companies with big piles of cash and dividend payouts over high-growth (and higher risk) investments. Since the company resumed dividends in 2012, Apple stock's quarterly payout has increased by more than 50%. The last dividend increase was in April 2016, when the company raised its payout by 9.6% to $0.57 per share, giving AAPL stock an annual dividend yield of 2.08%. Note that this level of dividend yield won't give you a total picture of Apple's paying back its investors. The company also has a long-term share buyback plan, which will not only stabilize its share performance, but is also another way it can return cash to investors.

Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7: Which smartphone camera is better? Google Pixel XL and iPhone 7 camera shootout: Check out what the two deliver in terms of photography. Written by Shruti Dhapola | Updated: November 8, 2016 2:25 pm Apple iPhone 7 in matte black next to the Google Pixel XL in Silver colour: So which is the better smartphone camera? Best premium smartphone, Android king, and the best camera ever on a smartphone: Google Pixel is getting all sorts of accolades. With the Note 7 now dead, Samsung doesn’t really have a new flagship for the rest of 2016. And the iPhone 7 doesn’t look much of an upgrade, except for maybe the matte black colour option which is gorgeous. When it comes to flagship phones, cameras are a key defining feature. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is considered one of the best in the business thanks to its camera’s low-light performance. With the iPhone 7, Apple claims improved low-light performance thanks to a wider aperture and has made OIS standard. On the other hand, there’s the iPhone 7 Plus which offers a dual lens set-up, an option for DSLR-style Portrait/Bokeh mode. But Google Pixel and Pixel XL are topping all of this with their 12.3 MP lens and no OIS; these phones rely on EIS instead. Personally, I have been an iPhone user since the time of 5c; my iPhone 6s has been my one and only device for photography on vacations, trips, and during coverage of technology events. And it has delivered in most cases. In bright sunlight and clear blue skies (something we are not going to see in Delhi anytime soon), the iPhone doesn’t have a competitor. On most of my sunny vacations, the iPhone 5c and 6s have managed excellent shots. And one of the reasons for upgrading or not upgrading to the next iPhone is always around the camera.

I’ve been using both phones extensively for the past couple of weeks. Honestly, both phones are pretty close to each other in terms of camera performance. I have uploaded some of the comparison pictures below, but do note these have been resized for the web. Also, the iPhone 7 has a different colour profile (wide colour gamut DCI-P3) on the display, which means there is difference in how these pictures look on the actual phone compared to a desktop screen, regular mobile display, etc. I felt the difference when I had to crop/reduce image size for uploading on the web. Personally, I’m not a fan of big phones, which is another reason why the iPhone 7, 6s, etc appeal to someone like me. But this particular vacation, I found myself constantly reaching for the Pixel XL, and ditching the iPhone 7. This is not to say the iPhone 7 doesn’t deliver in photos, it is just the Pixel XL comes very close thanks to the software wizardry that Google is doing with the phone’s camera. While with the iPhone 7, I like that the colour tones are more muted, more natural, but there were moments where the Pixel XL left it far behind. In my daily use, the Pixel XL was much faster than the iPhone 7 when it came to focus and taking a shot; in the former’s case the post processing HDR+ takes a couple of seconds. For instance, the below shot of pictures are taken from a moving boat; the Pixel XL makes the sky a lot more blue, while the iPhone 7 has got the it closer to the natural colour when it comes to the lake water. In low-light, the Google Pixel XL has a tendency to over-process some of the images, and yes they do look brighter, though once you zoom in on the edges, there is noise. The iPhone 7 goes with more muted colours tones, but that doesn’t mean it is missing out on details either. In case of the bell photo, I could zoom in and still see the texture on the iPhone 7. On the Pixel XL, the picture looks much brighter and might appeal to most people, and the details like the scratches on the bell are much more clearly visible. In most low-light cases, I came to depend on the Pixel XL, even though some of the picture look a tad too bright. Also both phones deliver quite well when it comes to taking macro-style shots in proper lighting. Again the difference comes down to the colour tones, though both capture sharp details. So which is the best camera smartphone in the market out there? As iPhone 6s user, I’m yet to find a compelling reason to upgrade to the iPhone 7. I’m waiting to see what happens with the iPhone 8. But both iPhone 7 and Google Pixel XL are two of the best smartphone cameras in the market. The Pixel XL has a software advantage in low-light for those who love brighter, more vivid colour tones. In my mind, there’s no doubt the Pixel is the right competitor for the iPhone 7’s camera. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News US President-elect Donald Trump could return Iraq war boosters to power Punjabis react to Trump’s decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‘May affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel agents’ Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for ‘doublespeak’ Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh Tomar Shruti DhapolaLooking at technology and web culture.... read more Asus Zenfone 3 Laser review: Good phone, but pricey for its specs Fake news and how it is killing democracy through social media timelines Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes gone: Paytm to MobiKwik, digital wallets are rejoicing                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Image: Rihardzz/Shutterstock At the weekend, more than 2,000 local people from Athenry in Galway marched in support of the €850m Apple data centre. The investment by Apple in a state-of-the-art data centre in Athenry represents the single biggest digital infrastructure investment west of the Shannon and is a considerable economic prize for the region. The data centre will manage data for Apple’s Music, App Store, Messages, Maps and Siri customer base. It will be 100pc powered by renewable energy. It could forge the lynchpin for job creation by new, digital enterprises for decades to come. ‘We want to show Apple, and the whole world, that the vast majority of Athenry people support wholeheartedly Apple’s desire to open a data centre near our town’ – ATHENRY LOCALS However, despite planning permission being granted by An Bord Pleanála for the 24,500 sq ft facility back in August, a new legal challenge by three people (just two of them local) threatens to delay the project for 18 months. Apple has applied to have the case fast-tracked, by requesting that the case be moved to the commercial list of the High Court. A decision by the court is expected tomorrow (8 November 2016). Delay could derail the digital dreams of the west Meanwhile, a sister project announced the same day in early 2015 for Viborg in Denmark is already halfway towards completion. Losing the project would make Ireland a “laughing stock” warned Minister Seán Kyne, TD, and could endanger the country’s chances of landing further data centre projects in regional locations. Great turnout in support of the Apple Athenry project this morning, vital for the town and County Galway #Athenryforapple pic.twitter.com/dXdd2pcPVF — Seán Kyne TD (@SeanKyneTD) November 6, 2016 Ireland – the last landfall between Europe and the US with vital fibre-optic cabling coming ashore in Mayo – is strategically positioned to profit hugely in the next industrial revolution driven by data. Athenry, like many towns west of the Shannon, was hit particularly hard by the financial crisis that began with the banking collapse of 2008, which saw businesses close and young people emigrate. The news of Apple’s single-storey data centre coming to the area was seen as a turning point. Delays and objections, ranging from concerns about wildlife and flooding, contributed to the 18-month delay in planning permission. The fear is that the project might slip away if a further 18-month hold-up takes place in the courts. “We want to show Apple, and the whole world, that the vast majority of Athenry people support wholeheartedly Apple’s desire to open a data centre near our town,” a Facebook group supporting the investment and organising the march said.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Taiwan Oct exports jump at fastest pace in two years as holiday shopping nears By Reuters Published: 04:37 EST, 7 November 2016 | Updated: 04:37 EST, 7 November 2016 e-mail By Liang-Sa Loh and J.R. Wu TAIPEI, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports rose at their fastest rate in over two years in October, signalling strong year-end shopping demand for hi-tech goods remains on track, powered by Apple Inc's latest smartphones. Shipments related to microchips and smartphone components rose by double-digit percentages, and a surge in imports bolstered by chip-making equipment pointed to more gains ahead, the Ministry of Finance said when it issued the data on Monday. "It reflects a positive outlook for future export business," the ministry said in a statement. October's exports rose 9.4 percent from a year earlier, better than expectations for a 1.8 percent climb and reversing a 1.8 percent fall in September when Typhoon Megi disrupted shipments. It was the fastest single-month, on-year growth since August 2014. All major markets showed solid demand. Exports to China rose 14.9 percent from a year earlier, more than doubling September's pace, while exports to the United States, Europe and Japan all reversed their September on-year declines. The better outlook was echoed by the central bank, which said the island's economy is stabilising and poised for a "mild" recovery, in a report issued to parliament that was seen by Reuters on Monday. Apple late last month projected record revenue for its current, holiday-dominated quarter even as it said its bigger iPhone 7 Plus model was in short supply. The guts of iPhone 7 models are made up of components churned out by Taiwan's tech supply chain, and the island's export trends are a key gauge of global demand for tech gadgets. Imports surged 19.5 percent, beating an expected rise of 4.09 percent and compared with an increase of just 0.7 percent in September. Woods Chen, an analyst with Yuanta Investment Consulting in Taipei, said that exports in the final two months of this year could grow around 6 percent each month, paving the way for exports to recover in 2017. But Chen said the longer-term outlook for Taiwan's trade will depend on who wins the presidential election Tuesday in the U.S., with a victory by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as his base case scenario.

Texting and driving an urgent problem: UN Distraction simulator: a wake-up call ‘Facebook on your dashboard can be deadly’ motoring industry news Should phones auto-disable when you drive? Industry news / 7 November 2016, 09:49am Emily Kent Smith London - The relatives of four people killed by a truck driver using his cellphone at the wheel have called on Apple to introduce a disabling function. In 2008 Apple filed an application to patent a ‘lock-out’ feature which would disable a phone when being used by a driver, but has never introduced it. Apple has patented technology that would disable a cellphone if it was used by a driver while driving, but has never used it. File photo: Elaine Thompson / AP Patent documents reveal that the device would be able to determine if the car was moving using GPS and see who was using the phone by activating its camera. But despite the patent being granted in 2014, Apple has not added the potentially life-saving feature to its products. Tracy Houghton, 45, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, was killed alongside her sons Josh, 11, and Ethan, 13, and stepdaughter Aimee Goldsmith, 11, when Polish driver Tomasz Kroker, 30, ploughed into a queue of traffic on the A34 in Berkshire while distracted by his phone in August 2016. Now their relatives have asked Apple for a meeting to urge the company to introduce the technology in Britain. Doug Houghton, who lost sons Josh and Ethan, said: “If that technology exists it should be compulsory. There is an epidemic of people using their phone at the wheel. And what do you do with epidemics? You cure them.” Mark Goldsmith, Mrs Houghton’s partner and Aimee’s father, said: “It should be impossible to use your phone in the driving seat of a car. “It would be fantastic if that feature was included.” How it works The technology contains a ‘motion analyser’ which can detect the speed at which the car is moving. A ‘scenery analyser’ checks if the phone was being used in a safe location or in the driving seat. The device would look out for things such as distance from the phone to wheel and whether other people were in the car. Patent documents state: “Texting while driving has become a major concern of parents, law enforcement and the general public.” They add that the function could be used without making any modifications to the car. The development was also backed by Paul Carvin, 59, from Morpeth, Northumberland, whose wife Zoe, 42, died when she was crushed while waiting in a queue of traffic. Father-of-two Mr Carvin said carmakers and cellphone companies had a duty to stop phones being used by drivers. He added: “Some people will respond to education and some people will respond if there is a harsh punishment. Some people won’t respond to any of that. “This is the equivalent of taking a phone away, like saying to children: ‘You don’t use it at mealtimes’ – until eventually they don’t do it any more.” Safety charity Brake said: ‘With so many people flouting current laws, technology that would make this impossible could be life-saving.” Apple would not reveal why it had not pushed ahead with development of the technology. A spokesman said: “We are strongly committed to helping users stay safe.” Daily Mail Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Subscribe to our NewsletterSHOW ALL Related stories Hands-free v hand-held myth: Busted!

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business iPhone users: Beware fake apps print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2854891 false Jim Wilson / The New York Times The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus seen here in September. Several companies warned consumers recently about fake apps appearing in the Apple App Store. Click here to enlarge image Smart Start iPhone users: Beware fake apps By Vindu Goel / New York Times News Service Published Nov 7, 2016 at 12:02AM SAN FRANCISCO — Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple’s App Store in recent weeks — just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. “We’re seeing a barrage of fake apps,” said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time. Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless — essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said. But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple’s process for reviewing every app before it is published. That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google’s less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company’s intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers. In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and Pokemon Co., among others. “It’s important that brands monitor how their name is being used,” he said. Apple removed hundreds of fake apps Thursday night after The New York Times inquired about the specific app vendors that created many of them. Other apps were removed after a New York Post article last week drew attention to some of the counterfeits. “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,” said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. “We’ve set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We’ve removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.” In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all 2 million apps in the App Store and remove “apps that no longer function as intended, don’t follow current review guidelines or are outdated.” The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. Despite Apple’s efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple’s monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. “It’s a game of whack-a-mole,” Mason of Branding Brand said. China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts. Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, “Our angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday." Data from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. “Would give zero stars if possible,” wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. “Constantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.” Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands. “The retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,” he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard’s, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps. But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real. The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store — including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear. Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Co. has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume. Some of the fake apps have even used Apple’s new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store. Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple’s tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google’s Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said. But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pokemon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available. “The criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,” Clay said. 15537524 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

India is a country where many a times a phone is used to denote the status symbol of its user. iPhone wala hai, paise wala hoga ( Has an iPhone, must be rich),Â  this is the common notion in at least the small towns of the country. Yes, the fact that many people despite having no clue about iOS or how is it better or worse than Android, buy it for that half-eaten Apple logo that sits behind the device. Funny as it sounds but Apple is seriously a costly fruit and especially the bitten ones. Also Read: Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: The choice won't be easy for phone buyers But my reason to prefer Android over iOS is not just restricted to its pricing. Note that these reasons are my personal opinion and may vary person to person. So, here I go: Best Ideas With Android comes variety: Yes, it's just like the street shopping! Whether you are looking for something under Rs 5000 or below Rs 50,000, Android users can pick anything from any price bracket. With Apple, the basic iPhone 5S starts at Rs 20,000. So, you see the difference. Availability: Imagine a small shop in some remote village of India, selling iPhone. The image simply doesn't come up, yeah? Forget iPhone, it's hard to find even an ad banner of iPhone in the distant parts of the country whereas you may not get phones like Samsung Galaxy or Xiaomi Mi 5 but you will surely find a basic smartphone selling in those small shops of your town's market. Android is easier: If I plan to gift an iPhone to my grand dad, I am pretty sure he'll either give it back to me or lock it in his safe, thinking that it is something to keep in the safe rather than using it. Yes, the iOS is slick but it's also complicated. I find Android simpler and where any user can understand the basic functionalities in very less time. Customisable: Android users have to choice to customise their phones. There are very few phone companies that come with stock Android, but most of the Android phones give you the liberty to choose the look of your phone like the wallpapers or the icons. With iOS, it becomes boring and redundant as the iOS does not offers way to completely customise your iPhone. Limited data sharing in iOS: While Android users can easily share files with each other, iOS does not allows one to share files non-Apple devices. That causes issues when you are using the phone.

November 7 2016 at 09:49am By Emily Kent Smith . Apple has patented technology that would disable a cellphone if it was used by a driver while driving, but has never used it. File photo: Elaine Thompson / AP London - The relatives of four people killed by a truck driver using his cellphone at the wheel have called on Apple to introduce a disabling function. In 2008 Apple filed an application to patent a ‘lock-out’ feature which would disable a phone when being used by a driver, but has never introduced it. Patent documents reveal that the device would be able to determine if the car was moving using GPS and see who was using the phone by activating its camera. But despite the patent being granted in 2014, Apple has not added the potentially life-saving feature to its products. Tracy Houghton, 45, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, was killed alongside her sons Josh, 11, and Ethan, 13, and stepdaughter Aimee Goldsmith, 11, when Polish driver Tomasz Kroker, 30, ploughed into a queue of traffic on the A34 in Berkshire while distracted by his phone in August 2016. Now their relatives have asked Apple for a meeting to urge the company to introduce the technology in Britain. Doug Houghton, who lost sons Josh and Ethan, said: “If that technology exists it should be compulsory. There is an epidemic of people using their phone at the wheel. And what do you do with epidemics? You cure them.” Mark Goldsmith, Mrs Houghton’s partner and Aimee’s father, said: “It should be impossible to use your phone in the driving seat of a car. “It would be fantastic if that feature was included.” How it works The technology contains a ‘motion analyser’ which can detect the speed at which the car is moving. A ‘scenery analyser’ checks if the phone was being used in a safe location or in the driving seat. The device would look out for things such as distance from the phone to wheel and whether other people were in the car. Patent documents state: “Texting while driving has become a major concern of parents, law enforcement and the general public.” They add that the function could be used without making any modifications to the car. The development was also backed by Paul Carvin, 59, from Morpeth, Northumberland, whose wife Zoe, 42, died when she was crushed while waiting in a queue of traffic. Father-of-two Mr Carvin said carmakers and cellphone companies had a duty to stop phones being used by drivers. He added: “Some people will respond to education and some people will respond if there is a harsh punishment. Some people won’t respond to any of that. “This is the equivalent of taking a phone away, like saying to children: ‘You don’t use it at mealtimes’ – until eventually they don’t do it any more.” Safety charity Brake said: ‘With so many people flouting current laws, technology that would make this impossible could be life-saving.” Apple would not reveal why it had not pushed ahead with development of the technology.
