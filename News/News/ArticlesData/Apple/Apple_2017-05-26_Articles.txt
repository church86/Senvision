She also fancies herself a bit of a rock star in her town and spends too much time reading comic books.  If she's not typing away at her keyboard, you can probably find her at Disneyland or watching Star Wars (or both). Last week was Global Accessibility Awareness Day and Apple made a point to let the world know that it is always working on improving accessibility features. Good for Apple. Apple has long been a trailblazer down the path to accessibility with such features as VoiceOver; it originated on the Mac back in 2007, and is now on every device the company makes. In recent years, Apple has been highlighting the importance of including accessibility features in new technologies and sharing its work with the world. It's incredible, the things Apple has accomplished in working toward an inclusive and supportive range of devices that anyone and everyone can use, no matter what their level of ability is. Apple isn't the only one doing these things. There are lots of tech companies that include accessibility features on there devices and in their software programs, and even more app developers that provide incredible help to those that need it. More companies should be spotlighting what they do to advance accessibility technologies and proudly share their successes with the world. The competition to see who is the best at it could produce some amazing and revolutionary results. How accessibility has helped my family My nephew has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). He is high-functioning, but didn't start out that way. He didn't say his first word until after turning three years old. Before he started speaking, his parents discovered a way to communicate with him using TapToTalk on a tablet or phone (TapToTalk has since gone out of business). When he was hungry, he could tell his parents that he wanted a bowl of cereal. The frustration that comes with not knowing why your child is upset eased up significantly once my nephew was able to talk to them thanks to TapToTalk. It's software like this that has helped a lot of families communicate when they never could before. Fast forward seven years. My brother has been undergoing treatment for throat cancer, which has damaged his voice-box so he can no longer speak. Today, my brother uses an app called Speak4Me Pro, in which he types what he wants to say and the app uses VoiceOver technology to relay the information. It's been incredibly helpful for my brother to have the ability to tell my nephew to stop talking, even though he doesn't have a voice to do it (just kidding, though he sure does talk a lot now). Both apps used by my family to help them have a voice when they weren't able to on their own didn't cost more than a dollar. Imagine how incredible it is to be able to talked to your loved ones, when you couldn't before, for just a dollar. Accessibility issues are a part of my life, and that's just my immediate family. It's likely that you know at least a few people that deal with something relating to accessibility, too, like a grandparent that has vision impairment or a friend with hearing loss. It's not a niche market. It's a huge market. How other companies besides Apple are helping the world If you do a Google search right now for "Accessibility Apple," you'll see dozens of hits at the top of the page of reports of Apple showcasing accessibility features on its products — spreading the word. If you do a Google search right now for "Accessibility Android" or "Accessibility Windows" you'll find some very informative how-to guides for using accessibility features, but very little reports of how these companies are making strides in the industry. Less people are talking about it because tech companies aren't spotlighting it. There doing it, they're just not talking about it. For example, Android has its own version of VoiceOver, which allows users to have words on screen and actions read allowed. It also lets a person connect their phone to switches or keyboards instead of the touch screen for people with dexterity impairments. It has braille display support, screen adjustments, and captions for supported content. Windows has a long list of accessibility features available with its desktop software and Windows Phone includes a number of features similar to Android, like a version of VoiceOver, adjustable screen options, a magnifier and zoom, and captions for supported content. Are they ashamed of their progress? Do they feel uncomfortable talking about it? I doubt it. I just don't think Google or Microsoft are spending much effort spreading the word of their part in making technology more accessible to everyone. How competition encourages growth Just like Google, Microsoft, and Apple are always fighting each other to prove who is the best at education, art, and generally cool features in their software updates, they should be fighting to prove who is better at inventing incredible advancements in accessibility. If every tech giant's keynote had a wow-factor section on accessibility, I'll bet we'd see the technology grow a lot faster. Google and Microsoft, it's time you put on your boxing gloves and took off your humble suit. Tell the world about what you do for accessibility and try to make it the "next big thing" at your yearly keynotes. Let's see some healthy competition in the accessibility field.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Google has Tensor cores. Could Apple soon have AI cores of its own? Apple is already driving mobile silicon in a way few if any other companies have been able to keep up with. Now, a new report claims Apple will be using its considerable chipset chops to accelerate artificial intelligence as well. Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg: Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition. If true, this should surprise no one. Arguably, Apple's biggest advantage in computing right now is that the company custom crafts the complete stack, from atom to bit to pixel. That includes an ever-increasing amount of custom silicon. A few years ago, Apple offloaded motion tracking from its main A-series system-on-a-chip to an M-series sensor fusion hub. A few years later, it added onboard natural language parsing to the M-series to enable "Hey, Siri!" in as power-efficient a way as possible. The latest A-series, A10 Fusion, combines two high-efficiency cores with two high-performance cores to try to eek out as much battery life as possible while pushing pixels and bits as fast as possible. Anything that makes sense to offload to increase efficiency and performance, you can bet Apple is working on offloading. Including and especially AI, since it's such a hot topic these days. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media. Google Home is a single product. Echo is a growing line of similar, home-based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods. Apple has also expanded Siri across dozens of languages, including Chinese, Hebrew, and Arabic, as well as dozens of regions. It's fair to say no other vendor has yet been as aggressive as Apple in deploying virtual assistants across product lines or to customers around the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." This also reads oddly to me. Almost everything Apple does already requires AI. AI is going to be everywhere in computing the same way math is everywhere. There's nothing unique about special projects like augmented reality or cars. Machine learning, computer vision, and related technologies are already powering everything from battery efficiency to photo tagging, sequential inference to computational photography. Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years. What's interesting isn't that the big tech giants are working on it; it's how they will use it to solve real problems in the information and computer space and, in Apple's case, how it will solve those problems while protecting our security and privacy at the same time.

Echo is growing line of similar, home based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods." ... except that Google's Assistant is available across mobile devices (Android, iOS), within Chrome I believe, not just through the Home product. And Alexa is present and capable on the Echo products as well as through the Alexa app, the Amazon app, the Fire stick, presumably the Fire TV, and so on. It's a valid comparison, correct? And - pardon my ignorance - is Siri present in Airpods independent of the phone? 0 7 hours ago Reply bhatech Yeah smh at google home is a single product. Hello !!! google now, assistant, voice recognition is everywhere. 0 5 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire The AirPods have a tap for Siri feature. Viticci mentioned he uses them for Siri in his latest podcast. "While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants." Rene's point is that the media forgets that Siri is in so many places. Apple has been aggressively implementing Siri, but you would never know it by news coverage. He does *not* claim that Google is less aggressive or in fewer places in any way at all. 0 2 hours ago Reply bhatech News coverage is about how Siri sucks, no one complains that's not in many places. They complain because it's bad compared to competition. 0 2 hours ago Reply bhatech "This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media." Nothing against Rene, but it's just pro apple narrative from you, Gruber and few others on everything Apple does. At least Mark is honest even though he loves Apple products. Pretty much everyone is right Siri lacks and is just dumb compared to google. And, yeah Google does it many languages as well if that's your defense for whatever little Siri can do. On the positive side, I'm excited to see what Apple comes up and see how it can compete with Google given it has no other option other than pushing privacy story and how it can do everything on device. They would love to be like google but given the lack of their ability we have to see how well they can do this AI stuff on device and keeping privacy in mind. "Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years." Really? You are so hurt on this? Even on MacBreak weekly you brought this up. This is what Apple does for pretty much everything in their keynote. Every feature they talk as if they invented it even though it's on competitor's device for years. 0 5 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire They all try to make it sound like they invented it. Heck, people have forgotten there were smart phones before 2007. There were, but far fewer people had them. As for the narrative, I am seeing a lot of criticism on the media praising the Echo and viewing the Apple Watch as a flop. Yet I've read on multiple places that the watch sells more in volume and for a profit while the Echo is sold for a loss and fewer are sold. Numbers are not released, so I'm going to dig for the articles (but I believe Above Avalon was one of them). What is interesting is the way the Echo has caught the attention of the media. It's different and it is functional. There is plenty to write about since it is so open (too open for my tastes). The hardware is getting refreshed at a good pace too. As for Siri, yep, it needs work. Actually, it needs a way for me to tell it that, no, it did not understand me. That's really all I want… that and to have more fluid conversations. 0 2 hours ago Reply themacbuddha How Apple approaches the digital assistant is predicated on these factors: Security/Privacy, Ubiquity, and Extensibility. Security/Privacy---Data storage and manipulation is best served on the local device when it can be and only stored and manipulated on the cloud if it can be done so at the deepest level. For a photo to be synced to and manipulated in the iCloud and for Apple to do so having excluded their ability to hold any encryption key protecting it is a very, very, very tall order. There is a reason they hired Jonathan Zdziarski. The call to crop and apply a filter needs to happen on all devices AND the cloud without compromising privacy. Keeping customer data encrypted at these levels on their servers is not in Google's best interest or even their wheelhouse. Google doesn't talk the security game. Therefor they keep themselves open to running fast and loose with your data. That means ample blood in the water for any number of bad players to go after. The trope of Google User Data Anonymization is prime for failure. Not a matter of "if" but "when". The continued treatment of end user devices as dumb terminals and the shoving of ever more data and processing power to the cloud leads to laziness on the OEM's part. We've seen this battle before. One can only assume that Samsung is not simply glomming Viv to things but actually following through on the promise of Android as a true open source solution. Don't Hold Your Breathe. Reports that Apple is creating custom silicon for managing digital dossiers should not surprise anyone. Nor should the fact that they are telling Qualcomm to take a hike now be a surprise. That they added Intel as a supplier for cellular modems is quite telling - they are going to make their own modems too. 0 25 sec ago Reply themacbuddha Ubiquity---Though it might seem obvious to most the scale of this can not be understated. The "Internet of Things" is akin to the "World Wide Web" in my mind. Tremendous promise turns into absolute morass of pain. To put some perspective to something that was mentioned in an earlier post regarding the Amazon Echo line: There is plenty of talk about how wonderful Tesla is doing. Yet the Apple Watch has generated more unit sales then Echo and more revenue then Tesla. Apple Watch is primed to leap forward this fall. This is not to belabor those companies' successes but to illustrate that the reach of Apple products and there for Siri (or whatever the overall solution is deemed to be called) exemplifies how far it can go. Apple Watch can be viewed as an accessory to iPhone. And what of any Siri Speaker (hate that name) product. What of a newer wifi system that integrates and amplifies Siri and HomeKit. What of CarPlay and other integrated auto systems. Project Titan is aptly named but probably a **** lot closer than most think to producing fruit. Extensibility---Echo has both language support and security working against it. Amazon is predominately US company. However one must appreciate that it is Walmart and their ilk that Amazon is truly competing against. Don't undersell that. Google's bread and butter on the other hand is in advertising. And they will ride that pony straight in to the ground. Their forte is on the server. Their greatest success found almost exclusively within a web browser. Again...Advertising and the World Wide Web! When combined, the most hated concept in existence. They will have a difficult time assailing that wall. I foresee a lot of WTF results that is far worse the bane of Siri now. And where might Apple fit in this? Yes, yes, yes! Fluid conversation is nice but natural language is better suited. In fact it is absolutely imperative. And never mind about just simple language support. What about muddled accents and mixed languages - Spanglish anyone? Recognize the extent third party support for Siri introduces a set of complexities far, far, far beyond the chicken scratch/Graffiti approach of Google Assistant and Alexa, and is dependant on Apple growing domains instead of leaving businesses to grab at the lowest hanging fruit. Make no mistake it is not about competing against Android/Amazon/Google/Advertising/BuynLarge. It's about creating a platform for communication and commerce that doesn't bank on the gullibility of the end user. It's all my data; what I buy, who I buy it from, what I do with it? Whose to say that a viable solution positively requires that I give up that control. Just remember....the road less travelled.

Rob Sabo | This empty lot just east of Downtown Reno will get a newhigh-tech look with its purchase by Apple for a distribution center. Prev of images Next Every time she looks out the front window, Belen Morales, manager of BJ's Hair Shop on Evans Avenue, has stared at a barren dirt lot across the street from the salon for the six years she's been employed there. The blighted lot at Fifth Street and Evans Avenue in downtown Reno soon could get a major facelift from a big-name tenant, though. Apple recently announced plans to construct a distribution facility as part of an additional $1 billion investment in its operations in northern Nevada. The site was formerly home to a warehouse that was demolished following heavy winter snows in 2005. It's been a vacant dirt lot ever since. For awhile the lot used for impromptu parking for Reno Aces baseball games, but a chain-link fence went up about a year ago that put a kibosh on the free parking. Morales is all for the Apple project. "I think it is fabulous that we will have something across the street," she says. "We have a lot of traffic this way anyway, so I don't think it will have a huge impact. We probably will have more police patrol, and more lighting. "We have a great little area here," she adds. "This is not a bad spot for them. It will only benefit all of us, and I think it is a great thing." The area surrounding Fifth and Evans site was part of the sweeping Tessera redevelopment project, which called for 1.2 million square feet of mixed-used development. That project ultimately never transpired as the hard-hitting recession scuttled developers' plans for the district. Apple five years ago announced a $1 billion dollar investment in northern Nevada to take place over 10 years, and accomplished that spending goal in five years as it built out its data center at Mustang. The tech giant recently announced it will increase its investment in northern Nevada by an additional $1 billion to expand on its data center and construct a distribution facility in downtown Reno. Apple originally wanted to lease the downtown land but now wants to purchase the property to build its distribution facility. The land is held by Northern Nevada Urban Development Company, the proposed developers of the Tessera District. Buying the land is a key part of Apple's investment strategy in northern Nevada, said Apple representative Mike Foulkes to the Reno City Council. "We spent a long time trying to find a good site in town that would be good for us and the city," Foulkes said. "To make the kind of investment we are willing to make, we need to own the property. It is not the type of investment you make on a leased property." Apple's investment in the downtown facility would be in excess of $4 million, Foulkes says, and the new facility would mirror the look and feel of Apple's retail and employment centers. "We are working to really make it a showpiece for downtown," he says. "We think it will be the most beautiful building in that corridor. For us, beauty is important." It wouldn't take much to be named the most beautiful building in that area, although the area does exude the rustic charm of old Reno with many old brick buildings. Fifth Street and Evans Avenue are home to older 1960s homes and some even older apartment buildings — one dates back to 1908. There also are several older storage warehouses in the adjacent areas. Stantec Consulting Services in March filed a special use permit with the City of Reno that details plans to build a 27,000-square-foot warehouse/distribution center on 1.38 acres at 520 Evans Avenue. The facility would be built to accommodate between five to seven truck deliveries each day from Sixth Street. The facility would employ between eight and 12 people, although office space could accommodate 15 or so employees. This mirrors what Foulkes told the city council. The proposed building would be constructed using a combination of masonry, metal panels and resin panels, the Stantec permit states. It also would include new eight-foot sidewalks with deciduous trees planted every 30 feet along Evans, Fifth and Sixth streets. Forty trees in total and 240 shrubs would ring the property, and signage would be limited to address signage on Sixth Street and Evans Avenue. Josh Rosenstock, Apple spokesman, said in a statement in early May that the Silicon Valley tech giant supports more than 700 jobs in Nevada. "Nevada is home to our largest solar investment, powering our data center with clean energy. We're excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data center and supporting facilities. As part of our growth we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs."

S. Bradford — in Contributors 174 shares The world of technology has given us so much in the way of improving quality of life. From practical application in the world of medicine to creating virtual playgrounds for recreation, we see innovation moving so quickly that it can be hard to keep up sometimes. In looking to our future, we look to our past, which – relative to the age of our planet – is not that long at all. We can learn a lot from those that came before us and are still with us now, sharing their experience and continuing to make the world a better place. I had the great fortune of sitting down with John Sculley, the former CEO of Apple and Pepsi President, to talk about what it was like to work with Steve Jobs, what he has learned during his long and impressive career, and what future innovators need to succeed in the world of tech. The Next Web: Hello John. Thank you for joining me today. As we all know, there was once a time when Apple, as a fledgling company, was going through a tumultuous time. As someone who has been successful in several ventures, what was your experience during this time and what was it like to work with Steve Jobs? John Sculley: I was Steve Jobs’ partner and closest friend for three years.  What made Steve Jobs different is he never tried to adapt to fit into the world. Steve always wanted the world to change and see the possibilities he saw. When he was 27, Steve was brilliant and in deep learning mode. Like many geniuses, he experimented and made mistakes. It was amazing experience to be with him seven days a week. It was during these years that Steve Jobs defined his first principles that still the foundation of Apple today. TNW: What were those principles, John? JS: There are six: 1.) Empower non-technical people with bicycles for the mind that will unleash their creativity. 2.) Change the world by enabling people to visually communicate (in those days before the Web, Steve Jobs created AppleTalk that wired Macs together). 3.) Design is important to everything Apple will do and simplification is the ultimate sophistication. 4.) No compromises. 5.) Every detail of how we do things at Apple must be as perfect as possible. The six colors of the logo. The Mac Factory, and many other examples. As we were getting ready to finish the final rev of the Mac mother board, just before first release, Steve saw a slight imperfection. The engineer working on it said to Steve, “ This board will be inside the Mac box and no one will ever know.”  Steve looked at him will a deep stare and said, “I’ll know.” 6) The Mac team needs to be willing to devote every waking moment of their lives to making Macintosh insanely great. There is no time to waste. TNW: [Laughs] I love how Jobs’ words were so ominous, but I get it. It’s not enough for the products to be great, they have to be the best. The standards are what separate competing forces from one another and gives the edge to the ones that give way more attention to every little detail. It’s respectable. Those core values certainly have helped Apple gain a huge market share and I do agree that there have been some beautiful products that have come out of the company. What do you think about the direction Apple has gone with Tim Cook at the helm? JS: Tim Cook is an outstanding Apple CEO. TNW: What role and ideas did you have to make Apple a product marketing company? What knowledge did you bring from the successes of Pepsi to create the perception that Apple was the product to buy over other computer brands? We see the same kind of marketing now, and have for years, with imagery of people’s lives being vastly improved by Apple products, from listening to music, photography, and even tracking one’s own health metrics. Let’s talk about the focus on targeting the creative community and lifestyle. JS: My role was to teach Steve Jobs about consumer marketing. In the 1970’s, Coca-Cola outsold Pepsi in half the US by 10:1. As Pepsi’s then 30 year old CMO, I realized the reality was: Coke was the most famous and most profitable consumer brand in the world. Coca Cola owned reality. Perception leads reality. So, Pepsi needed to own ‘perception’. We achieved this goal by focusing on the customer’s experience with Pepsi versus Coke. The marketing campaign we developed was called ‘The Pepsi Challenge’. I called it “experience marketing”. Steve Jobs loved our conception of “experience marketing” as he was then developing and building the Mac. The user’s experience was at the heart of Steve Jobs’ vision. Steve told me, “You have got to come to Apple and teach me how to do experience marketing.” The first iteration of experience marketing was the launch of the TV campaign for the Mac, known today as the 1984 Super Bowl TV commercial. TNW: The world of high tech is an incredibly competitive market and one false move can make or break any company, but to be successful, one must take risks. How do you find the balance between sound decision-making and taking chances? What can aspiring business-owners and entrepreneurs learn from our forefathers in the tech community that can lead to success? JS: Most ‘adaptive innovators’ try to fit their innovation into the world. Steve Jobs never cared about fitting into the world. He wanted the world to adapt andfit in to his vision of the future. This is when Steve meant when he said he wanted to put a dent in the universe. TNW: During your time at Apple, you oversaw the development of the Newton. That project specifically ran into many obstacles during development and the competition, Palm Pilot, ultimately gained the market share at the time. Do you think that, even though Jobs terminated the project, he still held onto a little piece of the concept to aid in the development of the iPhone and other touchscreen products? Do you think that the technology would have been as sought-after by consumers had Jobs not famously unveiled the iPod Touch and iPhone the way he did? JS: Newton turned out to be seminal development for Apple. It was the first PDA that used a graphics screen interface. The first machine learning digital assistant. The Newton team co-developed the ARM microprocessor and Apple owned 43% of ARM. If Apple hadn’t of sold their 43% of ARM for a reported $800 million in 1997, Apple would have gone bankrupt. TNW: What is your take on the trending of new technology such as VR/AR? Do you think that there is an important use for it that can be utilized beyond the recreational use of average consumers? JS: I am very involved with AI now. I am vice chairman of ‘Lantern’ a fin-tech company in California that is developing an A platform for consumer credit scoring called BeamAI. TNW: What traits and instincts do Millennials absolutely need to possess in order to compete and earn success in today’s market? JS: There has never been a better time for entrepreneurs. So many exponentially growing technology breakthroughs like: cloud, mobile, unstructured data, AI, IoT.  Milennials need to have insatiable curiosity and they need to find noble causes that inspire them and others that can change the world. There has to be a better way to do things and technology is now reliable, inexpensive, and highly scalable. TNW: You’ve earned a tremendous success during your long career, and continue to do so. What is it like to experience such success and what is the best advice you’ve received throughout your career? What knowledge and experience can you now teach to those who are making the trek behind you? JS: My best advice is: Stay curious. Take chances. Failure is a learning experience. Never ever give up. TNW: Thank you so much for your time, John. It’s been a pleasure to speak with you today.   Learn more about John Sculley through his website, where he shares even more about his wealth of knowledge in specific markets, and shows future entrepreneurs how to create a successful business in today’s market to solve the problems of tomorrow.

The store marks the newest addition to Apple's next-generation retail rollout, following similar design principles and community-focused values seen at Apple Union Square in New York and Apple Dubai Mall. So honored to spend some time this morning with Apple's head of retail @AngelaAhrendts at Apple Orchard Road. She's a rock star!! pic.twitter.com/E2E8dZxYS8— MuttonsInTheMorning (@muttons) May 27, 2017 As the first Apple retail store in Southeast Asia, Apple Orchard Road has received a lot of attention over the past few weeks leading up to its grand opening. Reports began to ramp up in early May when Apple put up a mural in front of the store that displayed large "Apple Loves Singapore" artwork in various places. Upon closer inspection, the details of the artwork represented different "Creative Pros" who will now help run Apple Orchard Road's "Today at Apple" programs. After the opening date was announced, Apple removed the barricades from the storefront, unveiling the design of the inside of the store for the first time. Earlier this week, the Cupertino company then allowed members of the press to visit the store and take pictures of its next-generation design, which included a curved staircase inspired by Apple Park and an upstairs "town hall" gathering space for Today at Apple sessions. Apple Orchard Road is the newest step in the company's plan to eschew more traditional retail establishment principals where the only purpose is to visit the store to buy something, and encourage customers to be inspired by the products through Today at Apple. When the company announced the new sessions would begin expanding worldwide in May, Apple senior vice president of retail, Angela Ahrendts, said that Today at Apple was catalyzed by Apple's "desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve." Ultimately, Ahrendts hopes that the next generation refers to Apple as a meeting spot similar to the communal nature of a place like Starbucks. "Starbucks figured it out, you know? Being a gathering place for – right? 'Meet me at Starbucks,'" Ahrendts said. "And you know, I've told the teams, 'I'll know we've done a really, really great job if the next generation, if Gen Z says, "Meet me at Apple. Did you see what's going on at Apple today?"'"

I will likely get round to visiting it over the next couple of days, as I don't really like crowds, and would like the initial excitement to die down a little first. I have never actually inside an Apple Store, and so am curious as to just what makes it so much better over a third party retail store. I get that it's a very huge building, and that it likely holds a lot of strategic value for Apple, but I am not really in the market for any new Apple products at the moment, and have pretty much interacted with them to death, so I guess I never really understood the hype. I suppose that if my iPhone ever broke down again, I should get a faster response time than the 1 week for a replacement to get shipped to me via third party repair channels. We will see. I imagine come Fall with all the product releases, you're going to really appreciate having that store for any in store purchases. Nonetheless, at least you have your first Apple store in Singapore.

Photo / Getty Images Apple got an early start in artificial intelligence with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn't been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com and Alphabet in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person's view of the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." Improved Performance Continued below.

Fran O'Sullivan: Joyce vision falls short on key elements Half of lowest earners miss out on Budget perks Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc's latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google's data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple's hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, adding that it's unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple's operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone's predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer's conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple's culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker's ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

Ahead of the official opening at 10am, an Apple representative said there were more than 200 people queuing around Knightsbridge Mall along Orchard Road, with some in line as early as 5pm on Friday. First in line: Mr Peter Xiang, from China, flew in specially for the opening of Apple Orchard Road. (Photo: Tang See Kit) First in line was Mr Peter Xiang who has been in line for more than 10 hours. The 25-year-old Chinese national, who has been to several Apple Stores in China, decided to fly to Singapore on May 23 for the opening. "I've been on standby here for more than 10 hours. No matter, I'm still excited (but) a little tired now," he told Channel NewsAsia. "Looking forward most to (getting a) Apple T-shirt and maybe I will buy something. Maybe some accessories."  Advertisement Advertisement Students Timothy Wang and Afreen Akbany were in the queue for more than 10 hours to be one of the first to enter Apple Orchard Road. (Photo: Tang See Kit)  Also in the line for more than 10 hours are Mr Timothy Wang and Ms Afreen Akbany, both 17-year-olds studying at ACS International. Mr Wang said the tech giant's retail outlets stand out for their great customer service and well-planned in-store designs. "I've been to several Apple stores in the US and in Hong Kong, but this is certainly prettier because this is in Singapore ... They have really good customer service too so I'm excited about finally having an Apple Store here." For 20-year-old Tim Shao from China, live trees taking up prominent spots within are what makes the new store in Singapore unique. "The designs of all the Apple stores are uniformed so in terms of the layout, this is nothing special," he told Channel NewsAsia. "What's unique is the trees here and this is the Apple Store version 2 design that only started last year. This is not available in the US." Apple's senior vice president of retail Angela Ahrendts was seen at the opening of Apple Orchard Road on Saturday. (Photo: Tang See Kit) The two-storey Apple Orchard Road is also the first official Apple store in Southeast Asia. “Generally, Apple stores in Hong Kong, Tokyo and many other cities have turned out to be a destination retail space. Tourists as well as locals are often drawn to the stores to experience the offerings as well as to enjoy the new concepts,” said Mr Desmond Sim, head of CBRE Research for Singapore and Southeast Asia. “Hence, it is not surprising that this will also be the same for the first Singapore store.” Apple has nearly 500 stores in 20 countries worldwide and as of April, welcomes more than a million visitors a day. It expects the newly unveiled Singapore store, which it sees as a “modern-day town square”, to be one of its most popular around the world. Apart from having its core products like the iPhone on display prominently on the first level, the store will also be conducting free hands-on educational sessions on topics such as photography and coding. These sessions will be conducted in a space called the Forum on the second level, which is equipped with a large screen and break-out tables. Industry experts say the incorporation of activity-based and experiential-based concept stores is synonymous with brands such as Apple. It also serves as a strategy for brick-and-mortar retailers in their battle against e-commerce. “The business of retail is not only about pure transactions but it has a high experiential component that consumers yearn for and is drawn to. This is especially so for new technology for lifestyle,” said CBRE’s Mr Sim. “Not to mention that the business of retail is also a very visual business. Design of stores will attract crowds.” The crowd seen at the opening of Apple Orchard Road. (Photo: Tang See Kit) One unique design at the Singapore Apple Store that has caught much attention is the two curved stone staircases which drew inspiration from Apple’s new campus in Cupertino. Industry experts expect the Apple Orchard Road, which opened after much reported delays, to be a boost for Singapore’s prime shopping belt and neighbouring stores. Ms Christine Li, research director at Cushman & Wakefield, said: “Before Apple Store came to town, people could have been a bit bored of Orchard Road because there is little differentiation between Orchard Road and, say, a suburban shopping centre as people see more or less the same brands and retail offering. “I personally believe that Orchard Road is not dead, but it needs to be exciting and entertaining in order for locals and tourists to visit it repeatedly,” she added.  Source: CNA/sk Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail More stories for you More information about Channel News Asia jump to top of page Sections Asia Pacific Singapore World CNA Insider Business Sport Lifestyle Technology Health Commentary About Us About Channel NewsAsia Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Advertise with us Contact Sales Online Advertising TV Advertising Get the news that matters in your inbox every morning!

Concepto de Martin Hajek / Computer Bild Phones by Gordon Gottsegen May 26, 2017 11:34 AM PDT @ggottsegen We've suspected for a while that Apple will give the home button the boot on the iPhone 8, but that would mean Apple's fingerprint sensor would have to find a new home. The potential workaround? Put the optical fingerprint scanner into the phone's display. That's what DigiTimes reports, citing China's Economic Daily News. (The source: Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, according to the report.) Enlarge Image iPhone 8 renders imagine what the phone would look like sans home button. Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone is expected to shake up the phone world with changes to its hardware and software. If the iPhone 8 (or whatever it'll be called) is the first to innovate this way, it's a sure bet every other phone maker will follow. The iPhone 8's fingerprint sensor, which also controls TouchID pressure sensitivity, has been hotly contested in conflicting rumors. Some alleged factory renders show that Apple could move the sensor to the back of the phone, similar to what the Galaxy S8 did when it shrank its front bezels. Others believe that the sensor will be integrated into the display. However, reports surfaced that Apple may have trouble making this happen because the technology might not be there yet. In addition, the report claims that the iPhone 8 will get a screen ratio of 18.5:9, similar to other rumors. If true, this would give the next iPhone an almost 2:1 ratio, which means its dimensions could look a lot like the LG G6 or Galaxy S8. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The “Apple Neural Engine” was revealed by a person familiar with the project but the firm, as expected, declined to comment on the matter. If real, it will improve future devices when it comes to handling tasks such as facial and speech recognition. Analysts such as Gene Munster believe that Apple will be moving into augmented reality and self-driving cars, Munster is quoted as saying that the company "is betting its future” on these things; both of which require AI, which makes it all the more likely that the dedicated hardware is being developed. The person that leaked the information said that the new AI chip is being designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time and will arrive on several other devices that the company makes in time, including the iPhone and iPad. If the source is telling the truth, they have already put the chip through its paces on prototypes of future iPhones. It’s unclear if the chip will be ready in the next iPhone iteration, though. With AI computations moving from the general processor to AI chips, processes should be faster and users could probably expect better battery performance as a result.

Perhaps Apple should call it the MacBook Exec or Edition. I won’t bother rehashing the many quibbles that others have already covered. Yet, once again, the punditry has failed to notice the biggest and most obvious flaw and are ranting about the wrong things. Let me rant about the right things for you. You’re welcome. The Touchbar MacBook Pro is a failure because you cannot upgrade its storage capacity. Ever. Why? Because the SSD is a soldered-in and non-upgradable boat anchor. A woman using Touch Bar on MacBook Pro While some may quibble with the 16GB RAM limit, at least there were technical limitations to that. Namely it was limited by the particular Intel chipset. Furthermore, nothing stops you from maxing out the RAM when you order the machine. Generally speaking, Apple lets you buy a Pro laptop with the maximum addressable RAM for its given chipset. However, that argument does not hold water with storage. The Touchbar MacBook Pro is limited to a paltry 2TB SSD. I have an old 2011 17” MacBook Pro with a 2TB SSD, and I can easily put in a 4TB SSD today, and 15TB in the not so distant future. Storage Size Matters for Pros The reality is, professional users need and use lots of storage, and those storage needs change with time. A pro machine needs to be adaptable. By limiting and freezing the machine to 2TB, Apple ensures that professionals who need more storage space need to look elsewhere. Further, it totally makes the machine a ‘disposable’ device for those that buy it today. Once they run out of space, for example, a year later, the only option is to get rid of the machine, and hope there is a new machine with more storage available. That’s nuts! There is no excuse for Apple making storage non-upgradable (other than greed or gross incompetence). They put an upgradeable SSD slot in the non-Touchbar, entry-level MacBook Pro. So whatever marginal idiot reason they trot out for not including it on Touchbar models is total BS. Talk to the hand; I don’t give a $#*%. The machine’s battery or thinness would not have been compromised in any serious way with the inclusion of the slot, again, as evinced by the entry level model. This storage lock-in has no business on any machine with a “Pro” moniker. It just further shows how heinously out of touch Apple has become with its core professional and creative user base. Let’s pray that Apple has woken up, and the next revision of its MacBook Pro will avoid this critical mistake. Otherwise, Apple will continue to bleed its pro users to companies that are not tone deaf to their needs.

Thank You! We need to stand up and scream that the emperor has no clothes. Eventually Apple will get it. May 26, 2017 at 4:50 EDT PM vr8ce May 26, 2017 I completely agree with the premise — memory and storage should be upgradeable on any pro machine, because they both drop in price dramatically over a relatively short period of time. However, there are several problems with the article: 1. This is old news. Really, really old news. 2. No, you couldn’t put a 4TB SSD in a MBP right now. MBP’s don’t use SSD “drives,” and haven’t for quite some time. The 9-to-5 article you linked to even shows you a nice picture of the SSD chips. Which means there may, in fact, have been (and still be) “technical limitations” to the 2TB limit. I doubt it, but it’s possible. Regardless, what kind of SSD drives exist is immaterial for the MBP’s, because they don’t use them. 3. The idea that we would a) run out of room in a year, and b) throw out the machine when we did, is facile. I’m using a late 2013 MBP with only a half-terabyte SSD, and although I don’t have as much free space as I would like, it’s fine. And even if it wasn’t fine, I’d use my 1 TB SSD external drive for whatever I needed to do. (And if I didn’t have one, I’d buy one instead of throwing out a 2K+ machine.) If you want to make a stink about non-upgradable storage, do it when it’s actually news, and don’t make up nonsense in a sad attempt to bolster your case. The case doesn’t need any bolstering, it stands on its own. May 26, 2017 at 4:54 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 @vr8ce So what that the MBP doesn’t use a 2.5″ ‘drive’ the same SSD chips in those drives can and are easily adapted to the stick format used by apple. OWC provides a 3rd party SSD adapted to use with such a slot in the trashcan mac pro, see here: https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/SSDA13MP4.0K/ Or OWC’s upgrade options for even your 2013 MBP via stick: https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ssd/owc/macbook-pro-retina-display/2013-2014-2015 Agreed, it is old news. However, as much bitching as I heard about the 16GB limit, which is a bunch of noise IMO, I really haven’t heard complaints about how this renders the machine disposable. Your comments actually support my pointing attention to this. Now I’m glad for you working on a machine stiffed at it’s storage limit is something you can live with, but for many professionals, this isn’t a ‘fine’ situation at all. And frankly is an unacceptable set of circumstances. And for those that need the expanded storage now or in the future, this is a problem, because for their needs, it will require a machine swap rather than just getting because for many, dangling a brick SSD off their ULTRA LIGHT TINY LIGHT LAPTOP is a bit of an anathema. As always, YMMV May 26, 2017 at 5:41 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 26, 2017 Perhpas what Apple needs a is portable MacBook Pro which is pretty much the current form factor and then a luggable MacBook Pro+ that is thick enough for user replacable hard drives and has more ports than the Hanseatic League May 26, 2017 at 5:58 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Maybe Lee. But the lower end non-touchbar MacBook Pro has a slot for upgrading the SSD, so it really wouldn’t be difficult or cause any extra thickness to put it into the Touchbar model. And I think you may be right and why I think maybe call the Touchbar MacBook the MacBook Executive, or MacBook Edition, and come out with a MacBook Pro that has a bit more expansion and interoperability in mind. Still, it’s wacky that the would put the upgrade slot in the entry level MacBook Pro, but not in the Touchbar model. Weird. May 26, 2017 at 6:16 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 26, 2017 John, would the circuitry for the touchbar take up too much space? I wouldn’t think so, not these days, but I suppose that it is possible. With faster WiFi and cellular data then the storage for big files could be in the cloud or on a server via FTP. May 26, 2017 at 6:26 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Lee. I suspect the touch at does have a bit of circuitry, but I don’t buy that the delta in size is that vast because the entry level MacBook Pro fits in the slot just fine. Any marginal difference in thickness could easily have been accommodated on the chassis being a touch thicker. Probably less than a millimeter difference. Don’t get me started on the cloud , but for creative pros with big heavy files, they need super fast SSD speed (e.g. For videos etc), so the cloud won’t cut it for real pros. For executives and “edition” fashion conscious, that might be more predictable an option. As always, ymmv May 26, 2017 at 6:58 EDT PM belmikey May 26, 2017 I am a professional — a software engineer, in fact. Maybe it’s a failure of imagination, but I cannot actually envision ever needing more than ONE TB of actual, on-board storage, on a portable device. The reason for this is really very simple: no matter how well built it is (and sadly build-quality is not what it used to be, but that’s a different rant, because as I say here, it wouldn’t matter), a portable device is, by its very nature, much more liable than a stationary one to take damage. As such, I am not going to keep anything on its internal drive that I don’t actually need RIGHT NOW for my work. And then, I’m going to back it up at least two different ways to the cloud, and then also to some external drive. And anything I don’t actually need for my work is going to live in cloud storage or on an external drive. Because no matter how well built it is, ALL portable devices ought to be treated as disposable. Let me say that again: all portable devices are disposable. Your phone, your laptop, your tablet? Disposable. It’s your data that’s not disposable. And if you’re keeping it all on one large drive on a portable device? You’re pretty much asking for it to eventually suffer an unrecoverable catastrophe. May 26, 2017 at 7:24 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Ok belmikey, but you can imagine a creative professional, say video user needing more, right? Or are you subscribing to the old bill gates schoo,, of why would anyone ever need more than 640k of memory? And you’re changing the goal post playing semantics, by that token, your home is disposable. The point is many professionals need or will need more storage a year or two after buying the laptop, and won’t be able to upgrade a “professional” machine. That’s a problem. Not for you? Ok, the person that uses pages.app on their iPad thinks that’s plenty machine for their “professional writing/editing” and therefor, programmers like you should get with their program and be fine with iPad power. The professional tarp is broader than just programmers or any one sector, and as such, those machines need to be more, not less adaptable. Storage adaptability goes hand and hand with that. Apple ignored this in their disaster its trashcan Mac and had to do an embarrassing mea culpa because so many pros are abandoning the platform. Being tone deaf to their needs just because it works for some, is exactly how they got lead into the dead end thermal corner with the Mac Pro. I posit, they should avoid repeating the G4 cube/trashcan Mac Pro debacle with their pro laptops, and limiting primary mass storage options is doing just that. As always, ymmv May 26, 2017 at 7:45 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 26, 2017 There is talk of an update and perhaps they will greatly increase the RAM and storage. I was all set to buy one, my reward for meeting a weight loss goal. Instead I decided to put the money into some home improvements and limp along with my 2011 MacBook Pro. That was the basis for my luggable statement, my MBP is a beast compared to the newer models and I almost never use the built in optical drive. A thin and trim MBP to go with my thin and trim body. May 26, 2017 at 8:02 EDT PM BradMacPro May 26, 2017 I’m sure Apple would would tell you a Thunderbolt 3 connected external SSD or array of SSDs would be fast enough to handle data storage needs exceeding the internal capacity. May 26, 2017 at 8:58 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 @BradMacPro. Hehe. That argument worked out great for the trashcan Mac Pro: https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/the-new-mac-pro-is-a-failure May 26, 2017 at 9:22 EDT PM furbies May 26, 2017 I’m with you Mr Kheit And the other thing about the “fixed” SSD ? Repairability: If either the SSD or the Logic Board fails ? Dead SSD ? Just hope you have a backup ! Dead Logic Board ? Just hope you have a backup ! In either case ? Be prepared to buy a new laptop…… 🙁 May 26, 2017 at 10:19 EDT PM vr8ce May 27, 2017 You said you could drop a 4TB SSD drive in MBP right now, and you linked to an SSD drive. You can’t put that drive in a MBP. When called out on your inaccurate reporting, you link to OWC, whose chips on that page max out at 1 TB, or in other words half the capacity of the Touch, not double it. So, again, bad reporting. If you’re going to claim Apple could have put 4 TB of space in the MBP last year when they introduced it, then by all means provide a link to an actual shipping product that can actually be used in the MBP. Otherwise, you’re just a noise-maker. And you know even less than you appear to if you think hanging a “brick” off a MBP is necessary to get extra storage. Several companies make barely over thumb-sized SSD drives these days, including Samsung (one of which I have) and Sandisk (which I do not). The memory limit on the Touch is every bit as bad as the storage requirement, for all the same reasons. I have 16GB on a four-year old MBP; it’s unconscionable to still have that limit four years later. It may not be a big deal to you, but it is to others. Just as storage appears to be to you and isn’t to others. I agreed with the premise from the first — the non upgradability of memory and storage in the Touch is absolutely a failing of the product line, and of Apple to not recognize it as such. But outside that, the article is a bunch of noise and non-facts and a full year too late. May 27, 2017 at 2:45 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The vacation blackout window generally fits with Apple’s typical iPhone release cycle, but the actual dates seem odd, so we’re taking this memo with a big grain of salt. Apple employee time off blackout memo fits with iPhone 8 September launch The memo comes from Benjamin Geskin who has been fairly prolific with iPhone 8-related leaks over the past few weeks. Here’s the memo: The upcoming months are going to be very exciting for all of us and for our customers! As you know, there are new product announcements and launches in September. In anticipation of the upcoming events and the corresponding heightened call volume expected, we will be increasing our stall across all of our programs over the summer. In order to support our client during this very important time of year, we will be implementing Black Out Days in all AppleCare programs for Advisors and Leaders. The upcoming black out dates will be September 17 through November 4. Keep in mind that these dates are subject to change as our support volume expectations fluctuate. We will keep you advised of any black-out date changes and additions as soon as we are made aware of new initiatives. What are Black Out Days? Black Out Days are days in which we expect call volume to be at the highest, and we need all hands on deck. Advisors and Leaders will be restricted from requesting days off for Paid Time Off (PTO) and Unpaid Time Off. It is extremely important that everyone works their assigned scheduled days during this period – absences are unacceptable. Once you get past the “client” reference—which could imply contractors working as part of the AppleCare team, or an english as a second language reference to customers—the black out window dates are just weird. They start on a Sunday, and run through the entire month of October. Typically, Apple’s iPhone launch time off black outs run about two weeks from the device’s release, and they historically start on weekdays. What we can say for sure is that previous iPhone launches have come in September, and Apple employees are prohibited from taking time off for a couple weeks after to deal with new user questions and problems. This memo, legit or not, generally fits with that pattern, but until we see more proof to back it up we aren’t going to ink those dates in on our calendar.

Such a chip could give Apple a significant leg up deploying device-centric-AI, and if it succeeds, few of its competitors could respond. The chip is known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, according to Bloomberg’s unnamed sources. The story doesn’t include a target date, or even how far along the project is. The chip, “would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition,” according to the piece. But let’s talk about why this is important, because that’s a lot more fun. The Whole AI Widget Apple was dismissed as a serious chip maker when reports first surfaced the company was developing its own ARM chip for iPhones. It turns out Apple is really, really good at chip design. No small part of that is rooted in the fact that Apple can custom design both the hardware and the software to meet its exact needs. Apple also has enough volume that it can have these chips made cost effectively. No other company can do this in today’s tech landscape. That’s been huge in the smartphone business, and it could be just as huge in the device-centric AI space. Areas where Apple can focus this chip include security, processing power, and battery efficiency. All three are incredibly important, and no company can match Apple on this because Apple controls the whole widget. Device-Centric AI vs. Cloud AI Apple’s competitors are relying on the cloud for AI-related processing. That’s great in terms of throwing processors at the AI problem, but it carries significant compromises in terms of security and privacy. Amazon’s and Google’s home wiretap devices listen in on you, the product’s, lives. Those devices then send data to those company’s cloud servers, and Big Brother smiles in delight. Apple handles as much as it can local to your device, keeping the data is needs to know about you, the customer, with you. It sends only anonymized data to its servers using differential privacy, improving your personal privacy. Apple currently does a lot of this processing with its A-series of processors and the powerful GPUs on each device. A powerful, dedicated AI chip might allow Apple to do even more processing local to your device, increasing the company’s privacy edge. Apple could also use a custom AI chip to make its devices all that more power efficient. The company already does a lot by turning off components for even microseconds when they’re not being used. A custom chip will further Apple’s control over what’s used when. For each task an appropriate processor—it’s a power-maniac’s wet dream. Apple’s Long AI Game Apple has been playing a long game with AI. That long game has allowed Amazon’s AI shortcut, Alexa, to gain a foothold, but developments like a dedicated AI chip would give Apple a significant edge. It’s possible nothing will come of the Apple Neural Engine—the company routinely kills projects for a variety of reasons. I hope, however, that Mr. Gurman’s sources have it right and that Apple is able to bring this chip to an Apple device near me. Device-centric AI benefits us all.

I’m hoping Apple will give us a decent improvement in capability & accuracy soon (June?) with voice recognition at least, with AI (Siri) not far behind.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS US Edition News Reviews Insights TechRadar Laptops/PCs Printers Hardware Software Mobile Working Security Networks Data Centre VPN Hands on: Voyo VMac Mini PC review A rival to the Mac Mini, you say? Not yet rated By Desire Athow PC & Mac  Shares What is a hands on review? Our Early Verdict If you can live with a relatively noisy computer, then Voyo’s VMac Mini may well be the compact PC you’re waiting for given its superb hardware configuration. For Great value for money Superb design Support for 2.5-inch HDD Fast M.2 SSD Against No Wi-Fi out of the box Review unit was noisy Windows 10 already registered 4K support at 29Hz only You can’t fault Voyo for trying its best: the Chinese company is attempting to differentiate itself from the constellation of other PC makers out there, unveiling the Voyo VMac Mini PC earlier this year. The name is obviously a crystal clear reference to Apple’s popular Mac Mini. Not that Voyo’s PC looks like Apple’s box of tricks. The VMac is smaller at 120 x 120 x 27mm and is available in metallic blue, aurora silver, ‘luxury’ gold or champagne gold colours, not just the standard silver aluminium look.  This isn’t Voyo’s first attempt to create a different mini PC, either. Last year’s Voyo V3 left a lasting impression: hardly bigger than a CD box, it packed some serious punch for the price and had only minor issues. Online Chinese retailer, Geekbuying, sent us a sample for review and sells the VMac Mini for £181 (or $233). Note that, while this price includes delivery, it is exclusive of any taxes that may be levied by HMRC or the courier companies on behalf of the vendor. Want to buy tech from online Chinese retailers? Read this first. The VMac Mini has, therefore, a lot to live up to – the 1-litre chassis of the computer is entirely made of metal and acts as a heatsink to dissipate extra heat (more on that later). There’s a Voyo logo on top with the obligatory Intel Inside sticker, four rubber feet on the bottom, with a power button on one side (plus a white status LED), and on the opposite side are all the connectors: three USB 3.0 ports, an audio socket, a mini-HDMI connector, a microSD card slot, a GbE LAN port and the power supply socket. We’re pleasantly surprised by the choice of ports provided by the device. There’s no USB 2.0 (for a change), a microSD reader (which removes the need for a connector) and a fast Ethernet port. It’s only a shame about the proprietary PSU port. The VMac Mini uses a 36W (12v, 3A) power supply unit, a higher than expected wattage that’s explained by the components found inside the device. At its heart is an Intel Pentium N4200, an Apollo Lake CPU with four cores, four threads, a TDP of 6W, a base clock frequency of 1.1GHz and a burst frequency of 2.5GHz. It also has 2MB of L2 cache and integrated Intel HD Graphics 505, clocked between 200MHz and 750MHz, with 18 execution units. Roughly speaking it’s a souped-up version of the Core M-5Y51 – the CPU found in the amazing Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro – with twice the core count but half the cache. It is worth noting that while the graphics can run 4K at 60Hz, we could only manage 4K at 29Hz on our test PC. The VMac’s CPU is actively cooled by a fan that has a rather high variable pitch and was active for most of the duration of our hands-on review. It was distracting to say the least, and there didn’t seem to be any way of mitigating that irritating whir. Next to the processor is a single 4GB DDR3 RAM module, which can be expanded to 8GB. Sadly, although the N4200 supports two memory channels, there’s only one DIMM slot. What sets apart the VMac Mini from the rest of the competition, and explains the high wattage PSU, is the fact that this mini PC can take a laptop drive (2.5-inch SATA) in addition to the 128GB M.2 2280 SSD and the embedded 32GB eMMC flash storage. Still, we don’t understand the logic of having eMMC flash storage in addition to the SSD – although it does open the way for multiple SKUs (one with flash memory only, one with SSD and flash, and the other with SSD and hard disk drive). The device ran a licensed version of Windows 10 Home which we found to be already registered, a common practice among Chinese manufacturers and something we neither condone nor encourage. The PC logged straight into desktop mode without asking for a password. Unfortunately we couldn’t get Wi-Fi to work at all on the VMac Mini. This is likely to be down to a defective component rather than Windows itself as Bluetooth – which is usually serviced by the same card – was unavailable as well. Expect the device to deliver 802.11n Wi-Fi. When it came to sheer performance, we couldn’t fault Voyo’s mini PC. This is a solid device that will run almost any office or business applications without flinching thanks to a capable processor and a surprisingly nippy storage subsystem. In terms of benchmarks, its CPU-Z single and multi-thread scores are far ahead of the Dell Latitude 12 7202 which is powered by the Intel Core M-5Y71. The Atto benchmark also returned some very good read/write numbers thanks to the M.2 SSD, even higher than the SSD inside the Asus AsusPro B9440UA laptop managed.  Other tests we performed (Passmark, Cinebench, Novabench and CrystalDiskMark) cemented the belief that Voyo may well have struck a sweet spot with the VMac Mini. Early verdict We’ve got mixed feelings about this one. On the one hand, the Voyo VMac Mini will appeal to businesses looking for a reasonably well-specced workstation with oodles of local storage and an affordable price tag.  However, the lack of Wi-Fi out of the box is frustrating, and the noisy fan is equally annoying at times. While you can add a USB Wi-Fi dongle to your device, you cannot really do anything to mitigate the boisterous cooler. Voyo should solve these two issues in the next version of this PC to hit the jackpot. Truth be told, though, none of the existing competitors we’ve tested lately (like the Chuwi HiBox) have the quality of components found in the VMac Mini.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Case about the Downing of an Air Egypt Flight related to Apple Devices is still ongoing with Apple not Involved | Main May 26, 2017 Apple's advances in AI Continue to Surface at a Record Pace as news of a 'Neural Engine' Chip now Emerges   Even though Apple was the first major tech company to adopt a digital assistant for use in their smartphone natively, progress on this front seemed to be at a snails pace. Then out of nowhere Amazon shocked the market with a smarter digital assistant on a home device called Echo. Google Home rapidly followed and their latest upgrade will offer free phone calls within the U.S. and Canada and deeper connectivity to Android. Now Microsoft, Harman Kardon and many tech companies are jumping on the bandwagon with new smart home digital assistant based devices aimed to land on the market this fall.   Even Samsung has technically jumped into the market with Bixby in the last month on their Galaxy S8 that they promise will be integrated into future devices and appliances as part of their IoT roadmap. In fact a new design patent that surfaced on May 16 shows us that they have an advanced Echo-like device with a full flexible display on the drawing board that could run Android as their patent figures suggest below.   We noted in a report back on May 11 that the AI Wars were almost reaching Fever Pitch levels. Almost ever week if not every day there's an AI story surfacing. On May 14 Apple aquired their third major AI company in three years. On the same day we posted a patent report titled "Apple has designed a new Siri Architecture allowing Two Digital Assistants to Communicate with Each Other." Last month we posted a patent report tiled "Apple Patent Reveals a Visual System to Assist Siri in Future Devices to understand Gestures, Activities, & More"   At the top of this month we posted a report titled "Inventec Lands First Order for Apple's Echo-Like Home Device with Siri." Although it's a supply chain rumor, Apple fans hope that this could be a big moment at Apple's WWDC in June. Some believe it will launch this fall. Yet what matters is that Apple brings a new Siri based device into the home to support their Smart Home project and to keep the competition at bay.   Google is crafting the argument that they are the one's to beat in AI without question. Patently Apple covered Google's vision in two reports titled "The Vision of Artificial Intelligence According to the Gospel of Google" and "The Google Manifesto: The Arrival of the AI Revolution."   Apple supplier TSMC sees some of the sand beginning to shift into new directions. Co-CEO Mark Liu.Mobile let if be known last month that while smartphones will still drive the market for them in the short term, that new and innovative features for smartphones and other mobile devices including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), context-aware computation, and artificial intelligence (AI) and deep machine learning require support of more powerful computing technology." Translation: new chips are on their roadmap to power new technologies and features like VR/AR and AI.   The hint of new advanced chips coming to market gave way this afternoon to a new report by Bloomberg claiming that "Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition." So now the chip will have a name.   The timing of this latest leak about the Apple Neural Engine may have been timed perfectly to start cranking up their developers and fans for the WWDC keynote on June fifth.   The news of advances to Siri in the works have been mounting so fiercely in the last few months that it's now time for Team Apple to knock one out of the park and set their developers on fire for the next phase of Apple AI.   On the flip-side, it's always best to not get over-hyped about anything Apple until it actually unfolds. We know positive things are in the works and they'll roll out whenever Apple is ready to unleash them. But I have to admit, I'm definitely pumped-up for next month's event – are you?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Problem Solving | 22 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (19) Never Be Late or Forget a Task Again with “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders” by Scholle McFarland [Tonya Engst here. Little is more embarrassing than showing up late for a meeting or missing an important deadline due to forgetfulness. The go-to solution for Apple users is to offload your fallible human memory to Apple’s Calendar and Reminders apps, which are built into macOS and iOS. But even worse than forgetting a meeting or task is messing up due to a misconfiguration or misunderstanding in Calendar and Reminders. Been there, done that. These apps are the focus of the first Take Control book to be published since we sold the series: Scholle McFarland’s $10 “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders.” It’s a classic Take Control title that explains all you need to know about real-world usage of these heavily used but under-documented apps. I helped Scholle develop and edit the book, learning a lot about Calendar and Reminders that I didn’t know along the way. To give you a taste of her advice, here’s a slightly modified excerpt from the troubleshooting chapter, which addresses a few common problems that can prevent you from using Calendar and Reminders successfully. Whether you’re suffering from one of these problems now, suspect that a family member is, or want to avoid future mishaps, read on for Scholle’s solutions to some common conundrums!] How Can I Change the Default Calendar for New Events on My Mac? -- If new events are showing up in the wrong calendar, choose Calendar > Preferences > General and then pick a calendar from the Default Calendar pop-up menu at the bottom of the preference pane. Now, whenever you create a new event, it will appear in this calendar automatically. Note that the default, Selected Calendar, adds new events to whatever calendar you last selected, which can produce some unexpected results. Why Do Events I Add with My iPhone End Up on the Wrong Calendar on My Mac? -- When you add events with an iPhone, you can use Siri or do it in the Calendar app. Either way, events are placed in your iPhone’s default calendar, so make sure you’ve designated the one you want to use. On your iPhone, tap Settings > Calendar > Default Calendar and choose the calendar you want from the list. How Do I Prevent Calendar Spam? -- It started in November 2016. Suddenly, Mac users were inundated with calendar spam — bogus event invitations from counterfeit companies hawking cut-rate Ray Bans, Ugg boots, and other supposed bargains, often in Chinese (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). Calendar spammers take advantage of the macOS and iOS feature that scans Mail messages for calendar invitations and then sends you a notification. What’s worse, if you click Accept, Decline, or Maybe, you notify the spammer that your account is real and ready for more. To prevent calendar spam, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, click the Settings icon (it’s a red gear), and choose Preferences > Advanced. Then, change the Receive Event Invitations radio button to Email To email address. Now, instead of appearing as notifications, calendar invitations will run through your email account, which undoubtedly checks for spam. You can also safely delete messages there without alerting the spammer. How Do I Remove Duplicate Events? -- If you open the Calendar app and your calendar is littered with duplicate events, try this: On the Mac, choose View > Refresh Calendars (or press Command-R). Or, on your iOS device, tap Calendars to see your list of calendars. Swipe down to refresh. If that doesn’t work, check whether you have an On My Mac calendar that is identical to one of your iCloud calendars. Hide it by deselecting it in the Calendars list and see if duplicates disappear. If they do, you can either keep this calendar hidden or delete the calendar altogether by Control-clicking its name in the Calendars list and choosing Delete. How Do I Delete Duplicate Birthdays? -- If Calendar’s special Birthdays calendar shows a birthday more than once, you can remove the extras. First, on the Mac, choose Calendar > Preferences > General. Deselect the Show Birthdays Calendar checkbox and select it again. If that doesn’t work, duplicate contacts are probably to blame. Open the Contacts app and choose Card > Look for Duplicates. If the app finds them, choose Merge. You may need to repeat this step. If some duplicate birthdays still appear in Calendar, go into Contacts and manually delete the stubborn duplicates that the app is unable to detect. Your duplicate birthdays should disappear. How Do I Get Rid of Duplicate iCloud Calendars? -- If identical iCloud calendars appear to be multiplying like bunnies, first try launching Calendar and choosing View > Refresh Calendars. If you are having trouble verifying whether two calendars have completely duplicated events, try making them different colors (Control-click a calendar in the Calendars list to pick a color). Deselect all other calendars in your Calendars list besides these two. Now you can scan more easily to check for non-duplicated events. If you find a non-duplicated event, move it to the calendar you want to keep. If you are sure you need to de-duplicate, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, and see if the duplicate calendars appear in the list there: If duplicates appear on the iCloud Web site: To be safe, go back to your Calendar app and make a backup of each of the affected calendars by selecting them in turn and choosing File > Export > Export to create calendar (.ics) files labeled with their names. Once that’s done, go to iCloud.com and delete the duplicate calendar(s) from the Web site, by clicking Edit at the bottom of the calendar list and then clicking the Remove button next to a calendar. A warning asks you if you’re sure. If you are, click Delete. Now, return to the app and refresh your calendars by pressing Command-R. Duplicates should disappear. If duplicates don’t appear on the iCloud Web site: That means the problem is on your end. Choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and deselect Calendars. Your iCloud calendars disappear from the Calendars list. Then, choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and select Calendars. As iCloud re-populates your calendar data, this time it should get it right. How Do I Move a Calendar to Another Computer? -- Here’s the beauty of cloud accounts such as iCloud or Google: your calendars show up on any other device that’s connected to that account, no effort required. If you use local On My Mac calendars, though, and want to move one to another computer, you must export a copy and then import it elsewhere. To export a calendar so you can move it to another computer, share it with someone else, or make a local backup: Select the calendar’s name in the Calendars list. Choose File > Export > Export. Choose a location and then click Export. The events are exported to a calendar (.ics) file. Here’s how to import a calendar (.ics) file: Create a new calendar that will hold this file’s events, or choose an existing calendar you want to add its events to. Make sure your choice is selected in the Calendars list. Choose File > Import. (You can import a calendar archive (.icbu) file with the File > Import command, but when you do, it replaces all of your current calendar and reminders information, so make sure you get a .ics file here.) Select the calendar file and then click Import. Alternatively, drag a calendar file from the Finder to the Calendar window to add its events to whichever calendar is selected in the Calendars list. How Can I Merge Calendars? -- If you were over-enthusiastic about making calendars, so long as they are stored in the same account (or are all in On My Mac), you can merge them after the fact. Select one of the calendars in the Calendars list and choose Edit > Merge Calendar. Calendars that you can add events to appear in the submenu. If you can’t merge the two calendars you want, instead consolidate them by exporting the contents of one and then importing it into another, as described earlier in this excerpt. Why Won’t My Calendar Show Maps or Travel Time? -- To see travel time related to a calendar event, you must turn on Location Services on the device where you are working with the event: Mac: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy. Click Location Services, and then click the lock icon and enter your administrator name and password at the prompt. Click Location Services. Then, in the list to the right, select the checkbox next to Calendars. iOS: Open the Settings app, tap Privacy > Location Services, and turn on the Location Services switch. Still on the Location Services screen, tap Calendar and ensure that Never is not selected. With these settings on, Calendar can determine your approximate location using information from Wi-Fi networks, and if your device has cellular data turned on, from the cellular network. Apple asserts that this is collected in a way that won’t personally identify you. Why Can’t I See Any of My Reminders on My iPhone? -- If you’re faced with a blank screen when you try to check reminders on your iPhone or another of your iOS devices, you may be saving them to iCloud elsewhere, but not be using iCloud on this one. Tap Settings > Your Name > iCloud. Now tap iCloud and make sure the Reminders switch is On. How Can I Get an “On My Mac” Option? -- If you want to store a calendar or reminders list locally on your Mac, you need to choose On My Mac from the submenu when you create the calendar or list. If you don’t see that choice, and you don’t have an On My Mac heading in the app’s left-hand Calendars list or sidebar, you can solve the problem by turning off all accounts associated with calendars or reminders and then turning them back on. To see an On My Mac option in Calendars: Go to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts. Select each account listed there in turn and uncheck the Enable This Account box. Your account-based calendars disappear from the Calendars list — do not be alarmed! In fact, if they don’t disappear, try quitting and relaunching Calendar. Choose File > New Calendar and a new calendar appears in your Calendars list under the header On My Mac. If you want to view your account-based calendars in addition to your On My Mac calendar, return to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts and select those accounts’ Enable This Account box. To see an On My Mac option in Reminders: Choose Reminders > Accounts to open the Internet Accounts pane of System Preferences. For each account listed at the left, select it and then see whether the Reminders checkbox is selected. If it is, deselect it. Your account-based lists disappear from the Reminders sidebar — this is okay! An On My Mac option appears. Return to the Internet Accounts pane and for each account where you do want to view its reminders on your Mac, select its Reminders checkbox. Solving any one or the above described problems may put your calendaring and remembering system back on track.

I've found the iOS option to have them display, but they only show until the time of the event. Once the event has passed they mysteriously disappear from the iOS calendar. This inconsistency between iOS and macOS calendars is driving me crazy. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 12:56 Hi Simon, Open Calendar on your iPhone, tap the word Calendars (in red) at the bottom of the screen. Then scroll all the way to the bottom. You'll see a Show Declined Events slider. Toggle that on. Declined events show up in your Inbox. (Which is a bit odd.) Go to Calendar's Year view, tap Inbox at the bottom of the screen, and then tap Replied. A list of events--Declined or not--should appear there. Does that work? Reply Simon  2017-05-23 13:21 Thanks, but as I already mentioned I know how to get them to display. That's not the problem. The problem is they only display in the calendar until the time of the event. However, once the event time passes, they mysteriously get removed from the calendar. So you have no way of going back and checking events in the past if you had declined them. This is highly inconsistent. The macOS calendar does not do this. Events there don't just disappear oon their own. To make matters worse, as far as I can tell there's no option to change this behavior. Apple just decided that nobody would ever need to know about a past event if they declined it. And we users are stuck that on iOS. Argh. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:23 Do you still see them in the Inbox, though? I can see my older declined events there. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:26 I do see older suggested events in my calendar (even from more than a year ago), but only if I didn't accept or decline them. (Once you tap Add To Calendar, they become a regular event.) Reply Simon  2017-05-23 13:28 No, only future events are listed there. Both accepted and declined, but nothing from the past. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:29 Actually, I see that the declined events in my Inbox are in the future (there's just no year with them). I'll research this some more. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 12:32 I started using Reminders recently and was just getting into it when one day all my Reminders were gone. They weren't in iCloud and not on my computer. Just gone. Makes me hesitant to rely on it. Any idea what caused my reminders to disappear after working reliably for months? Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:00 There are a few things that might make this happen. Probably the most likely is that Reminders got turned off for an account. Go to Reminders > Accounts and click on the account the reminders belonged to (or take a look at all the accounts if you're not sure). Reminders should be selected in the account's list. If this is what happened, when you select Reminders for the account again, they will reappear. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 13:36 I did what you said and checked Reminders. However, this did not cause the missing reminders to reappear, even after quitting and restarting Reminders. What else can I try? Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:40 A couple of questions: What kind of account were the missing reminders in (iCloud, On My Mac, etc)? Also, are they missing on a particular device or on all your devices (Mac, iPhone, etc.)? Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 14:11 I entered them into the Reminders app on my iMac. I never used them on iCloud or my iPhone. I have checked now and the iCloud and iPhone have similar lists (with no entries except a few completed items). On the iMac it's different--there's just nothing where there used to be several recurring reminders. Reply Tonya Engst   2017-05-25 19:00 Stan, do you think the problem is that your _list_ disappeared or is the list still around but the entries in it have disappeared? Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-26 20:07 I believe it was the entries. I don't remember creating any new lists--just used the default. Reply Peter U   2017-05-23 21:17 Do you discuss time zones in Apple's Calendar app? I moved from Europe to the US 10 years ago and never managed to change the time zone in Calendar (still on Central European time). Changing to Eastern Time messes up all my future (and past) appointments, i.e. moves them to 6 hours earlier. When I am in a different time zone I like to use the LOCAL time in my calendar not the time zone I live in. Not sure why the damn app doesn't understand that. Thanks :) Reply Peter U   2017-05-23 21:21 PS: I meant the macOS Calendar v7.0 (currently still in OS 10.9.5, sorry, different story). Reply Simon  2017-05-23 21:42 I've had exactly the same problem. It appears the problem is Calendar does not offer support for local time. It's hell bent on being smart so as soon as you move, either all your past or your future appointments will shift to weird times in your calendar. It's frustrating. Apparently it was designed by people who cannot imagine life beyond a single time zone. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-24 12:06 Dealing with time zones is covered in the book. That can get confusing! Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-24 12:05 Dealing with time zones is covered in the book. That can get confusing!

For the second year in a row, 100% of Apple’s tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (3TG) smelters and refiners are participating in independent third-party audits. Apple has also partnered with numerous NGOs to drive positive change on the ground, including Pact, who are working to provide essential health and safety training to artisanal mining and building programs to help children stay in school. In 2016, Apple trained more than 2.4 million workers on their rights as employees. Since 2008, over 2 million people have participated in Apple’s Supplier Employee Education and Development (SEED) program. It offers opportunities to earn higher education degrees, attend vocational training, and take classes in arts, finance and language skills.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple takes supplier clean energy program to Japan Ibiden’s products help bring together the integrated circuitry and chip packages in Apple devices. Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Record-Breaking Holiday Season for the App Store CUPERTINO, California — January 6, 2016 — Apple® today announced that customers around the world made this holiday season the biggest ever for the App Store®, setting new records during the weeks of Christmas and New Year’s.  In the two weeks ending January 3, customers spent over $1.1 billion on apps and in-app purchases, setting back-to-back weekly records for traffic and purchases. January 1, 2016 marked the biggest day in App Store history with customers spending over $144 million. It broke the previous single-day record set just a week earlier on Christmas Day. “The App Store had a holiday season for the record books. We are excited that our customers downloaded and enjoyed so many incredible apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, spending over $20 billion on the App Store last year alone,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “We’re grateful to all the developers who have created the most innovative and exciting apps in the world for our customers. We can’t wait for what’s to come in 2016.” Worldwide, the App Store has brought in nearly $40 billion for developers since 2008, with over one-third generated in the last year alone. Largely as a result of the App Store’s success, Apple is now responsible for creating and supporting 1.9 million jobs in the U.S. alone. Nearly three-quarters of those jobs — over 1.4 million — are attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.* Apple has previously reported that the iOS app economy has created 1.2 million jobs in Europe and 1.4 million jobs in China. Gaming, Social Networking and Entertainment were among the year’s most popular App Store categories across Apple products, with customers challenging themselves to Minecraft: Pocket Edition, Trivia Crack and Heads Up!, and staying in touch with friends and family using Facebook Messenger, WeChat and Snapchat. Games and subscription apps dominated this year’s top grossing titles including Clash of Clans, Monster Strike, Game of War – Fire Age and Fantasy Westward Journey, as well as Netflix, Hulu and Match. The launch of the all-new Apple TV® and Apple Watch® have paved the way for entirely new app experiences, changing how people consume content through their television and providing useful information at a glance on Apple’s most personal device yet. Since its launch in October, the new Apple TV’s most popular apps include Rayman Adventures, Beat Sports and HBO NOW. Chart-topping apps for Apple Watch owners include fitness apps Nike+ Running and Lifesum, and iTranslate and Citymapper in the Travel category. *Job creation estimate based on research by Dr. Michael Mandel, Progressive Policy Institute. “App Economy Jobs in the United States,” January 6, 2016 Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Opening Europe’s First iOS App Development Center in Italy ROME — January 21, 2016 — Apple® today announced the creation of Europe’s first iOS App Development Center in Italy, to give students practical skills and training on developing iOS apps for the world’s most innovative and vibrant app ecosystem. The iOS App Development Center, to be located at a partner institution in Naples, will support teachers and provide a specialized curriculum preparing thousands of future developers to be part of Apple’s thriving developer community. In addition, Apple will work with partners around Italy who deliver developer training to complement this curriculum and create additional opportunities for students. Apple expects to expand this program to other countries around the world. “Europe is home to some of the most creative developers in the world and we’re thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The phenomenal success of the App Store is one of the driving forces behind the more than 1.4 million jobs Apple has created in Europe and presents unlimited opportunities for people of all ages and businesses of all sizes across the continent.” Apple is a powerful engine of growth across Europe and the company’s ecosystem now supports more than 1.4 million jobs, including 1.2 million attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.* The unprecedented growth of the App Store® has helped developers in Europe earn over €10.2 billion from selling their apps around the world. In Italy, over 75,000 jobs are attributable to the App Store and the developer community is vibrant. IK Multimedia launched its first app in 2009 and since then has had over 25 million downloads. Musement, launched in 2013, is now available in seven languages and 300 cities across 50 countries, making it easy for people to book travel and excursions on the go. Roberto Macina, CEO and founder of Qurami, said: “Apple’s continued innovation inspires us to create the best mobile experiences and make our customers’ lives just a little bit easier. Apple’s app ecosystem is the anchor for our business, and developing across Apple’s operating systems has enabled us to easily and quickly bring the Qurami experience to iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch users.” Thousands of companies are expanding because of their work with Apple, which supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in communities large and small across Europe. Milan-based Laboratorio Elettrofisico makes some of the most sophisticated magnetization equipment in the world and their technology enables some of the industry-leading magnetic features found in Apple products. Apple also works with Europe’s leading manufacturers of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, which create tiny components that power some of the incredible sensor and audio technologies found in iOS devices. *Job creation estimate based on research by Dr. Michael Mandel, Progressive Policy Institute. “App Economy Jobs in Europe,” January 21, 2016.

The new iPad Pro delivers incredible performance with the 64-bit A9X chip that rivals most portable PCs, along with a four-speaker audio system that is twice as powerful,¹ new 12-megapixel iSight® camera for shooting Live Photos™ and 4K video, 5-megapixel FaceTime® HD camera, and faster wireless technologies. And iPad Pro includes support for the breakthrough Apple Pencil™ and a new Smart Keyboard™ cover designed to fit the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro. “iPad Pro is a new generation of iPad that is indispensable and immersive, enabling people to be more productive and more creative. It’s incredibly fast, extremely portable, and completely natural to use with your fingers, Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. And now it comes in two sizes,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “The 9.7-inch iPad Pro has a new Retina display with True Tone technology, four-speaker audio system, blazing fast A9X chip, 12-megapixel iSight camera, 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera, faster wireless, and support for Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. It is the ultimate upgrade for existing iPad users and replacement for PC users.” Designers, illustrators and businesses have quickly adopted iPad Pro and it’s changing the way they work: “People don’t realize how much hand drawing is needed to produce computer animation,” said John Lasseter, Chief Creative Officer, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios. “iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are the closest we’ve ever been able to get in the digital world to actually drawing on paper.” “I’ve done everything including designing the latest cycling collection on iPad Pro,” said Alex Valdman, Head of Design for Rapha. “It goes with me everywhere, and has not only replaced my laptop, but my paper notebook as well. For the Rapha design team, iPad Pro will become standard issue.” “At Citi, iPad Pro is truly transforming how we work,” said Stephen Gates, U.S. Head of Design for Citi Global Consumer Banking. “iPad Pro and Apple Pencil have played a huge part in the new Citi Design team’s work to create new innovative customer experiences. We use iPad Pro for sketching out new design concepts, presenting our work, answering our emails, working with our design files on Adobe Creative Cloud and participating in FaceTime meetings with our other design teams all over the world.” Pro display The 9.7-inch iPad Pro features advanced display technologies, including a True Tone display, which uses new four-channel sensors to dynamically adjust the white balance of the display to match the light around you for a more natural and accurate, paper-white viewing experience. The advanced Retina display is 25 percent brighter and 40 percent less reflective than iPad Air® 2, making content even easier to see indoors and out. It uses the same wider color gamut as the iMac® with Retina 5K display, delivering 25 percent greater color saturation¹ for more vivid colors. A custom timing controller, photo alignment and oxide TFT deliver incredible color, contrast and clarity. Night Shift in iOS 9.3 uses iPad Pro’s clock and geolocation to automatically adjust the colors in the display to the warmer end of the spectrum after dark and may even help you get a better night’s sleep. Pro performance The new iPad Pro is just 6.1mm thin and weighs just under one pound, yet delivers groundbreaking performance, connectivity and versatility so you can tackle the most demanding tasks wherever you go. The powerful A9X chip with third-generation 64-bit architecture provides performance that rivals many laptops and console-class graphics, while also delivering all-day battery life.² Ultrafast wireless connectivity keeps you connected wherever you go with 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MIMO technology, support for even faster LTE Advanced with up to 50 percent faster cellular connectivity³ and the most LTE bands supported by any tablet.⁴ Now with Apple SIM embedded directly in the new iPad Pro, it’s even easier to connect to wireless data plans right from your device when traveling in more than 100 countries and territories.5 iPad Pro has an advanced 12-megapixel iSight camera sensor featuring Focus Pixels for fast focusing, an Apple-designed image signal processor, advanced noise reduction, third-generation local tone mapping and better face detection, all resulting in sharp, detailed images, 63-megapixel panoramas and Live Photos.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Union Square Highlights New Design Elements, Community Programs SAN FRANCISCO — May 19, 2016 — Apple® today revealed its new store on San Francisco’s Union Square, offering many new features and services rolling out to Apple retail stores worldwide. The new store will open its signature 42-foot tall sliding glass doors to customers on Saturday, May 21 at 10 a.m.  “Fifteen years ago today Apple opened its first two stores and we’re thrilled to mark the occasion with the opening of Apple Union Square in San Francisco,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail and Online Stores. “We are not just evolving our store design, but its purpose and greater role in the community as we educate and entertain visitors and serve our network of local entrepreneurs.”  Apple Union Square’s glass doors open the store to Post Street and Union Square. The building’s unique position connects San Francisco’s most famous square to a rejuvenated plaza to the north, creating a beautiful gathering place for the community. The art-filled plaza offers seating, public Wi-Fi, a 50-foot tall “green wall” and regular acoustic performances. The store is powered by 100 percent renewable energy, including power produced by photovoltaic panels integrated into the building’s roof. “We have a deep commitment to the cities we work in, and are aware of the importance that architecture plays in the community,” said Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “It all starts with the storefront — taking transparency to a whole new level — where the building blends the inside and the outside, breaking down barriers and making it more egalitarian and accessible.”  Features in the new Apple Union Square design include: “The Avenue,” inspired by the window displays along a boulevard that dynamically change with the season. Avenue walls are interactive themed “windows” where Apple’s products and services come to life, from music, to creativity, apps, photography and more. New “Creative Pros,” Apple experts in creative arts, offer advice and expertise at each of the displays. Customers will also find “Only at Apple” products on the Avenue, a curated collection of third-party accessories. “Genius Grove” invites customers to get support working side-by-side with Geniuses under the comfortable canopy of local trees in the heart of the store. “The Forum” is a vibrant gathering place, centered around a 6K Video Wall. It is home to “Today at Apple,” which brings to the community the world’s most talented artists, photographers, musicians, gamers, developers and entrepreneurs to inspire and educate our customers to go further with the things they are passionate about. Today at Apple includes year-round programs for kids, new monthly events for teachers, sessions for current and aspiring developers, Creative Sessions in partnership with local experts in creative arts, Game Night with editors from Apple’s App Store® and more. The Forum and Video Wall are a place of discovery, including events about the making of movies from iTunes®, or exclusive premieres of new music and music videos from Apple Music™.  “The Plaza” will be found only at Apple’s most significant stores, including Apple Union Square. It’s open to the public 24 hours a day, features public Wi-Fi and seating, and takes Today at Apple outside, with a regular weekend series of well known local acoustic performances such as Travis Hayes and global talents like Escondido, who will then give exclusive interviews about their craft in the Forum. The Plaza at Apple Union Square features a fountain by well-known San Francisco sculptor Ruth Asawa, originally commissioned in 1969, and a new work, “Love” by local artist Laura Kimpton, commissioned by Hyatt Hotels.  “The Boardroom” is an intimate space where the store’s Business Team offers hands-on advice and training to entrepreneurs, developers and other small and medium business customers. Apple’s original San Francisco store opened on Stockton Street in 2004 with about 100 employees. Having welcomed more than 20 million visitors, and seen the launch of iPhone®, iPad®, MacBook Air®, Apple TV®, Apple Watch® and more, the team moving to Apple Union Square has grown to more than 350.  While the store offers regular learning experiences in the Forum and Plaza, Apple is also committed to furthering creative arts education throughout San Francisco. Apple is working with the Ruth Asawa School of the Arts to build a visual arts lab with 45 workstations outfitted with the latest Apple products.  Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Opens Development Office in Hyderabad HYDERABAD, India — May 19, 2016 — Apple® today announced the opening of a new office in Hyderabad that will focus on development of Maps for Apple products, including iPhone®, iPad®, Mac® and Apple Watch®. This investment will accelerate Maps development and create up to 4,000 jobs. “Apple is focused on making the best products and services in the world and we are thrilled to open this new office in Hyderabad which will focus on Maps development,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The talent here in the local area is incredible and we are looking forward to expanding our relationships and introducing more universities and partners to our platforms as we scale our operations.” Apple has been continually updating and adding new features to Maps, including 3D views, the Flyover® feature and tools to help customers find convenient places to shop, eat and explore nearby areas.

But, apparently, no longer. Or, at least, not a physical one. Digitimes is reporting that Apple has licked the rumored problems with the fingerprint sensor, and it doesn’t involve putting it on the back. Instead, they’ve embedded it in the screen, so now you can scan your finger and continue not using Apple Pay. There will probably be a “home” button of sorts, but it’ll be on the screen, and exist as software, as opposed to a clickable button. It’s an interesting, if perhaps inevitable step, as Apple wants a smooth sheet of glass, instead of all those gross buttons and ports. But it does raise the question of what happens if the screen is damaged or otherwise refuses to work. The Home button being a physical thing was something of a fail-safe to ensure you could still use your phone even if your screen was cracked, so what happens when that’s off the table? The designs we’ve seen do have buttons, of course, so they might fill in, or the Home button may still wind up on the side. For now, though, Apple’s goal of a buttonless, portless phone proceeds apace.

By Kristi Myllenbeck | kmyllenbeck@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 26, 2017 at 4:20 pm | UPDATED: May 26, 2017 at 4:38 pm A gas leak at the new Apple Park building in Cupertino earlier today forced the evacuation of “a group” of Apple employees. According to Mayra Tostado, corporate relations spokesperson with PG&E, a gas leak was reported at approximately 2:15 p.m. at the Apple Park campus located at 10956 N. Tantau Ave. in Cupertino. “A third-party contractor working for Apple hit a one-inch plastic gas line while digging with a backhoe in the marked area,” she told this newspaper. “They (previously) called 811 and the area was marked, but when you’re digging in an area that’s marked you should be using hand tools, not heavy equipment. Instead of using hand tools, he was using a back hoe and he hit the line.” Tostado said PG&E “made the area safe and stopped the flow of gas” at 2:58 p.m. She said that a group of employees were evacuated “out of an abundance of caution” but she did not know the number of employees evacuated. She said the evacuation order was lifted shortly after the leak was stopped. The Santa Clara County Fire Department could not be reached for comment.

Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images Gas leak prompts evacuation of new Apple’s ‘Spaceship Campus’ 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Apple employees were briefly evacuated from their new campus in Cupertino when a gas leak was reported in the area on Friday afternoon, officials said. The leak was reported shortly after 2 p.m. on North Wolfe Road, near the western edge of Apple’s 850,000-square-foot corporate headquarters, according to Santa Clara County fire officials. A one-inch gas line was ruptured by a construction crew, and firefighters evacuated one building and set up a perimeter until a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. crew was able to come and cap the leak, said Battalion Chief Mike Krisman. LATEST NEWS VIDEOS The evacuations were a precautionary measure, and the incident was resolved in less than an hour, Krisman estimated. He said the leak was not in the main Apple Park building. “All operations are normal now,” he said. Nicknamed the “Spaceship Campus” because of its resemblance to a flying saucer, the newly built $5 billion facility opened in April and will eventually house more than 12,000 Apple employees, according to the company.

While WWDC is less than two weeks away, we've haven't heard many details on what we can expect. There's talk about an overhauled design and an updated user interface along with rumors of new functionality for the iPad, but beyond that, we don't know what's coming, and we don't know what that new user interface will look like. In the absence of rumors, we've taken a look at some of the most-desired features MacRumors readers are hoping for in iOS 11, culled from our forums. Unsurprisingly, many readers are looking forward to a new design and an overhauled interface. Here are some of the things readers want in a design refresh: - Animated icons - Allowing developers to add small animations to app icons is something that iOS users have been wanting for several years. With access to subtle animations, apps like Fantastical could feature an icon with the current date, or third-party weather apps could display the current temperature. - iPhone complications - The Apple Watch interface features multiple complications or small icons that let Apple Watch users glean information at a glance. On the iPhone, complications could be added to the lock screen or the Home screen to serve the same function, letting users see information like weather or activity level without needing to open an app. - Customizable Control Center - iOS 10 made a mess of the Control Center, splitting it into three screens. MacRumors readers are hoping for a more unified design with the ability to choose what icons and functions are displayed. Expanded 3D Touch for more granular control over Control Center options would also improve the Control Center. - Call interface - When an incoming phone or FaceTime call is received on an iPhone, it takes over the entire display with a call interface, something people would like to see changed in iOS 11. A call interface that pops up over what a user is doing instead of domineering the entire iPhone is a feature several readers mentioned wanting. - Volume interface - On a similar note, there's a lot of hate towards the current volume display that pops up when the volume is adjusted on the iPhone because it's a giant icon in the middle of the screen. Something subtler and less intrusive is at the top of several wish lists. - Widgets - Android-style Home screen live tiles or widgets are another feature that some iOS users have long desired. Apple added widgets to the Notification Center on the iPhone, but some readers want a more integrated, customizable solution directly on the Home screen. - Keyboard - Users who prefer a swipe-based keyboard (where typing is done by swiping across the screen) would like to see that added as an option. A top number row across the default keyboard is also highly desired. - Dark mode - Dark mode was a feature rumored for iOS 10 that never materialized, and MacRumors readers are hoping to see it in iOS 11. A system-wide dark mode that comes on at sunset is something a lot of people want, and with an overhauled interface rumored for iOS 11, it could happen. A dark mode concept from iHelpBR - iPhone 7 Plus multitasking features - Some users would like to see the iPad's multitasking features expanded to the iPhone 7 Plus, including Split View, which allows two apps to be used at once, and picture-in-picture, which allows a video to be watched in the corner of the display while other apps are in use. With a larger 5.8-inch display rumored for the OLED iPhone, it doesn't seem out of the question. Split-View multitasking on iPad Along with the above listed design changes, there are also wish lists for individual apps, Siri, and other internal features, ranging from notifications to Continuity. Photos App Many MacRumors readers want to see some significant improvements to the Photos app, which got a major overhaul in iOS 10. Facial recognition was added, allowing iOS devices to automatically recognize the people in photos and group them accordingly, but the feature is on-device only and does not sync for privacy reasons. Some users want the People option to sync across devices for convenience purposes, while others want to be able to choose specific albums to sync to iCloud Photo Library. Other desired features include options to fully hide photos from albums and options for manually adding things like keywords and location. Camera App Several camera settings for adjusting video and other options are tucked away in the Settings app, and several readers would like to see those options added to the Camera app instead, where accessing them would be much easier. An option for manual controls in the Camera app is also a requested feature, as it would allow users to have more control over photos without needing to download a third-party app. Maps iOS users would like to see an option for offline Maps and multi-destination routes in iOS 11, two features that are available in Google Maps. Siri Along with an overhauled interface, a better version of Siri seems to be one of the features people are most hoping for in iOS 11. The good news is that Apple's rumored to be working on some major Siri improvements, and it's likely we'll see something Siri-related in iOS 11. - Text-based Siri - A Siri assistant would allow people who don't want to talk to their phones to interact with Siri via text, sort of like a chatbot. Google just introduced chatbot abilities for Google Assistant, and introduced a Google Assistant iOS app, which could inspire Apple to release a similar feature. - Unified Search - A merged Siri and Spotlight Search feature goes hand-in-hand with a text-based Siri assistant. The search function could be updated to support Siri-style commands that could be typed into the current search interface. - Offline Siri - Some users would like to be able to use Siri when the iPhone is offline for tasks that are able to be accomplished without an Internet connection. - Extended SiriKit - Opening up SiriKit to more kinds of apps would expand Siri's capabilities. Other Features File management - Several MacRumors readers mentioned a desire for a better file management system that would make it easier to transfer content between apps. MacStories' Federico Vittici made a mockup featuring a drag and drop interface and a file storage shelf on the iPad that would be an ideal way for Apple to implement simpler file sharing options. Federico Vittici's iOS 11 file sharing concept - Notification grouping - A lot of people hate the way notifications are handled on iOS. Options for grouping notifications by app would go a long way towards cleaning up the Notification Center. - Default apps - While it probably won't happen, MacRumors readers would like to see an option to set non-Apple default apps, like choosing Chrome for the default browser or Google Maps for the default mapping app. - Improved Continuity - For those of us with multiple devices, Apple's Continuity features that let tasks be transferred from one device to another are super useful. Improvements to make existing Continuity features more reliable would be nice, as would support for ongoing media -- the ability to transfer a call in progress, or a movie that's playing. Another thoughtful Continuity suggestion involves the Mac and native support for using the iPad as a secondary Mac display, functionality that's currently enabled through third-party apps like Duet Display. Apple could also potentially add support for connecting an iPad to a Mac to enable drawing features, allowing it to serve as a substitute for a Wacom tablet. That's another third-party feature that's already available through apps like Astropad. - Multi-user support - Support for multiple users on the iPad has been a long-desired feature, but Apple has thus far declined to implement it outside of a classroom setting. - Touch ID for locking apps - Third-party developers can use Touch ID as a second layer of security for locking iOS apps, but some users would like to see this feature expanded to encompass all apps. The option to lock apps like Photos with Touch ID would prevent them from being accessed without a fingerprint or a password even if someone bypassed an iPhone passcode. What features are you hoping to see in iOS 11? Join in on the discussion about the update on the MacRumors forums. Apple will unveil iOS 11 on June 5, the day of its WWDC keynote event. The update will be provided to developers immediately, while Public Beta testers can expect access later this summer. iOS 11 will be officially released this fall alongside new iPhones.

Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) said it spoke to sources from Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), who apparently confirmed Apple's achievement during a technology convention held in Taipei on Thursday. Among several design changes TSMC reportedly discussed at the TSMC 2017 NA Technology Symposium was the lack of a home button on the redesigned OLED iPhone, owing to Apple's use of "an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen" in the absence of a physical Home button. In addition to the fingerprint recognition, the sources claimed the new iPhones will also come with "invisible infrared image sensors to enhance the functionality of the high-pixel camera" and to enable augmented reality functions. If true, news of Apple's on-screen fingerprint recognition solution will come as a relief to watchers tracking the development of Apple's "tenth anniversary" edition iPhone. Reports that the company has been researching ways to integrate fingerprint sensors directly into screens go as far back as June 2015, but more recent sources have claimed Apple has struggled to find a solution that overcomes the production challenges involved. Specifically, Apple was said to be facing low yield issues of its in-house fingerprint sensor solution, which may have been forcing it to consider three possible alternatives: remove Touch ID from the 5.8-inch iPhone entirely and rely on other forms of biometric authentication instead, place the sensor on the back of the device (similar to the one on the Samsung Galaxy S8), or delay production of the phone. The security of existing face and iris recognition technology has already come into question, while the idea of a rear-mounted Touch ID fingerprint sensor has received a largely negative response from current iPhone users. Suggestions that Apple could announce the OLED iPhone in September alongside typical "S" cycle iPhones but delay its availability have also been met with skepticism. Additionally, today's news also lines up with previous rumors claiming Apple has been aiming to finalize its fingerprint sensor specification in May all along, in time for mass production in late July, which would fall in line with the company's usual annual iPhone production timeframe. The other design changes mentioned by sources at TSMC suggest additional biometric authentication such as iris/facial recognition could be used to augment Touch ID via a high pixel-density front-facing camera, which is expected to feature next-generation 3D-sensing capabilities powered by PrimeSense technology. The report also claims the screen ratio of the displays on the new iPhones will be adjusted to 18.5:9 instead of the previous 16:9. The "iPhone 8" is thought to have a redesigned steel and glass chassis, an edge-to-edge OLED display, and could carry a "premium" price, compared to previous models. Apple is expected to debut the new iPhone in the fall alongside updated versions of its current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch device lineup. (Via DigiTimes.)

If it leads to a edge to edge screen I don't see people rejecting such a placement. That's design over function. We need to click the Home Button to unlock our phones, so the best place to put TouchID is in the Home button itself. On the other hand, having it on the back makes it impossible to unlock a phone resting on a table. Rating: 13 Votes JaySoul 20 hours ago at 04:00 am Sounds like an Apple Galaxy iPhone S8.

If it leads to a edge to edge screen I don't see people rejecting such a placement. It's awkward to use. On the front you can hold the phone with one hand and use any finger from the other. Or you can one hand it and use your thumb. Or if it's sitting on a table you can use any finger from either hand. (Obviously, yes, you have to teach the finger to the phone, but most people teach multiple fingers from both hands. I know I do). With the sensor on the back you can't activate with your fingers if it's sitting on a table -- eyes, yes, but not finger. That is a security compromise to ApplePay and any app that uses TouchID for verification. You can't naturally hold it with one hand and activate with another. It would be like Hands Yoga. And holding with one hand is also awkward because of the way you have to hold your hand to reach the sensor. It increases the likelihood of dropping it because of the looser grip. Then there are all the issues with cases, esp. ruggedized ones that makes getting to the sensor even more challenging.

Yes please. Sorry folks, but, no, it's no a "Galaxy S8 display", first, because the Xiaomi Mi Mix did that in 2016, second, because Samsung put the fingerprint sensor on the back, trading convencience for looks. There's not a single adavantage to have the sensor on the back. Hope you like fingerprints on your cameras, and not being able to unlock the phone when on a table.

According to a “person familiar with the matter,” Apple is developing a new processor, dubbed the “Apple Neural Engine,” that will be dedicated to AI-related tasks. The goal is to improve how AI tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition are handled by incorporating it into a specialized hardware chip that would optimize performance as well as providing for more advanced capabilities. Complex AI tasks are currently handled by software processes that use the existing CPU and GPU hardware, requiring the workload to be shared with other tasks being performed on the device. A dedicated module would ensure that AI-related tasks are handled more efficiently both in terms of processing speed and battery consumption. Apple would not be the first company to develop a dedicated AI processor, however. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon chip used in some smartphones includes a dedicated processing module for AI tasks, and Google developed a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) last year for use in its data centers. However, Apple appears to be taking its ambitions in a slightly different direction, with plans to integrate the chip into many of its hardware devices, including the iPhone and iPad, in line with the company’s approach of handling machine learning tasks on board the device rather than offloading tasks to the cloud as Google does. The chip could potentially power features such as facial recognition in the Photos application as well as parts of speech recognition and predictive typing. Sources suggest that Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so that third-party apps can take advantage of offloading AI-related tasks. It’s unclear at this time, however, whether the new component is ready to be included in this year’s devices, or is part of a longer-term plan that Apple is working on.

Apple is planning to introduce a new chip to handle the increasingly demanding processor requirements of its artificial intelligence projects, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday. The new chip is known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, and it could handle tasks like facial and speech recognition if it's included in future Apple devices, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Apple already has considerably powerful processors at its disposal: the latest quad-core A10 chip in the iPhone 7 not only offers twice the speed of the iPhone 6, but also rivals the latest chip offerings from Qualcomm and Samsung. But as AI becomes more ubiquitous on mobile devices, Apple can only boost processing power so far before it begins to have an adverse effect on battery life. The solution is a dedicated AI chip, which would handle many tasks that are currently performed by the main A10 processor. Breaking up the tasks would reduce the A10's demands on the battery, and offer room for Siri, Apple's AI-powered voice assistant, to become even more intelligent. Related Apple Flexes its Artificial Intelligence Muscle Apple Flexes its Artificial Intelligence Muscle As Bloomberg notes, Qualcomm and Google both already have their own dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm's version is included in its latest Snapdragon 835 processor, which is found in high-end handsets like the Samsung Galaxy S8. It dynamically allocates processing power for AI tasks, so that one might be assigned to the GPU while another might run on the dynamic signal processor (DSP). Apple has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Qualcomm; some iPhone models have been powered by Snapdragon processors, while others use Apple's own A-series chips. The relationship is currently off-again, thanks to Apple's lawsuit accusing Qualcomm of unfair business practices, which may factor into Cupertino's decision to develop its AI chip in-house. Whatever AI initiatives Apple has up its sleeve, it's a pretty sure bet that we'll hear about them at next month's WWDC. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

But things may be about to get more complicated. Read next: iPad buying guide 2017 The din of the rumour mill is now deafening, with every pundit and their dog predicting that Apple is going to follow up its March launch with a second new iPad for the year - and this time it'll be something exciting, as opposed to the admirably affordable but modestly specced number we got a few months back. We're talking about the iPad Pro 2. In this article we preview the iPad Pro 2, based on our sifting of the huge numbers of insider leaks and pundit predictions zipping around the web at present. Bear in mind that none of this is set in stone - this page will turn into our definitive review as soon as we can get our hands on review samples. Design & build quality Numerous leaks strongly suggest that the new iPad announcement will be or include a 10.5-inch model, sitting neatly between the two currently offered iPad Pro models. Here's a taste of what it might look like, based on leaked photos and dummy models: Render by Benjamin Geskin, for iDrop News The mockups indicate that the 10.5in iPad Pro 2 has a Smart Connector for attaching a Smart Keyboard; it also has a flash on the rear-facing camera, like the 9.7in iPad Pro (and unlike the 12.9in iPad Pro). Expect quad-speaker audio (two speakers at the top, two at the bottom, just like on the existing iPad Pro models). Features Apple unveiled a new iPad this year, but we expect the upcoming tablet to be technically far closer to older Pro range - in terms of features as well as specs (which we discuss in the next section). Principally that means compatibility with all of the Pro accessories: a Smart Connector on the lefthand edge so you can connect a Smart Keyboard, and the ability to use it with an Apple Pencil. We also expect the new iPad Pro to get the True Tone display tech that has so far only been available on the 9.7-inch Pro (the 12.9 missed out, as did the iPad 2017), and we hope it will also get that device's rear-facing camera flash. Tech specs We don't know much about Apple's plans for the next iPad just yet, with the exception of one heavily leaked detail: the screen size. Numerous pundits have predicted, and numerous leaks appear to have confirmed (all of which are detailed in our iPad Pro 2 rumour roundup), that Apple is adding a new 10.5-inch screen size to its range. Screen size At present iPads are available in three sizes: the 7.9-inch mini size, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and iPad 2017, and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. So we're looking at a device that would offer only slightly more screen space than the existing mid-size models - but as discussed in the design section, the company may squeeze this extra display space into a chassis that the same size or even smaller, by reducing or eliminating the bezels and potentially the Home button too. Screen resolution and pixel density For the iPads either side of the proposed 10.5-inch form factor Apple offers a consistent pixel density of 264ppi (pixels per inch) - whereas the iPad mini 4 is rated at a much higher 326ppi. Assuming Apple sticks with 264ppi, and an aspect ratio of 4:3, we should expect a resolution of somewhere around 2,200 x 1,700. Bear in mind, however, that this isn't a commonly recognised resolution like the QXGA (2048 x 1536) of the iPad Pro 9.7: at a stretch the company might go for WQXGA (2560 x 1600), the closest common resolution to what we're looking for, but that would entail a higher pixel density (287ppi) and a different aspect ratio (16:10, rather than 4:3), which would in turn cause headaches for app developers. Other specs As for the rest of the specs, we expect a bump to the processor - this could be the A10 Fusion chip that appears in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, or even a souped-up A10X version - for fearsome processing speed. The 9.7 and 12.9 iPad Pro models come with 2GB and 4GB of RAM respectively; call us optimistic but we're hoping for 4GB in this model, given that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 comes with a minimum of 4 and is available with up to 16GB. Launch date Apple's keeping mum so far (as usual), but multiple sources point to an announcement this summer, most likely at WWDC 2017 in June. In May, for example, ChannelNews, citing local sources, reported that Taiwanese manufacturers started making the new 10.5-inch iPad "back in March or April", and on this basis speculated that a launch could be imminent; a leaked stock listing from an Apple reseller shows a case for the new size of iPad by Urban Armour Gear labelled "Due June 2017". Apple is generally pretty good at achieving a fast turnaround between product announcement and in-store availability. (The main exceptions to this are when an entirely new product line is unveiled, such as the first iPhone and the original Apple Watch, because of regulatory hurdles, but that shouldn't apply here.) We'd be surprised if there's a gap of more than 10 days before the iPad Pro hits the shops. UK price The iPad Pro isn't going to be the bargain offering we got earlier this year in the form of the iPad 2017, which starts at a highly tempting £339. We reckon the next iPad will start at around £570 to £600. Read next: Best cheap iPad deals This is roughly what we expect, price-wise: iPad Pro 10.5 (32GB, Wi-Fi): £579 iPad Pro 10.5 (128GB, Wi-Fi): £679 iPad Pro 10.5 (256GB, Wi-Fi): £779 iPad Pro 10.5 (32GB, cellular): £699 iPad Pro 10.5 (128GB, cellular): £799 iPad Pro 10.5 (256GB, cellular): £899 When it goes on sale you'll be able to order or preorder the iPad Pro 2 from Apple's site. We base our predictions on a simple analysis of the current (correct as of 26 May) pricing of the 9.7-inch Pro: iPad Pro 9.7 (32GB, Wi-Fi): £549 iPad Pro 9.7 (128GB, Wi-Fi): £639 iPad Pro 9.7 (256GB, Wi-Fi): £729 iPad Pro 9.7 (32GB, cellular): £669 iPad Pro 9.7 (128GB, cellular): £759 iPad Pro 9.7 (256GB, cellular): £849 ...and the 12.9inch model: iPad Pro 12.9 (32GB, Wi-Fi): £729 iPad Pro 12.9 (128GB, Wi-Fi): £819 iPad Pro 12.9 (256GB, Wi-Fi): £909 iPad Pro 12.9 (128GB, cellular): £939 iPad Pro 12.9 (256GB, cellular): £1,029 OUR VERDICT There are a lot of leaks pointing to a 10.5-inch iPad Pro that's good-looking (if not exactly radical in terms of design) and impressively specced, and we like the sound of that. But until this all becomes official we obviously cannot offer any kind of verdict. Check back for our review when Apple announces the launch.

Apple is upset thinking she might have ruined the day! It all turns out special as Sweet is treated to all her favorite things – except her own sister. Apple gets upset when she can’t play berry-ball because she isn’t a berry! Shortcake also has to break the news to her that all the girls have worked hard to be where they are but Apple is determined to show she has fancy feet. Creating crazy boots means creating a crazy adventure for everyone. The groove booties are back as Shortcake and Apple turn them into dance teaching groove booties. That’s when Plum gets the idea to teach the doggies how to dance and decide to put on a show. Buck teaches Tom-tom to dance but when the show is about to start, the pup has other plans. Putting a dancing video on Apple’s webpage, she asks Strawberry, Plum and Cherry to help write a diddy to go with it. The problem is that the song has gone crazy and Cherry will do anything to never hear it again including making sure no one else does either. Trying to write a song for the Queen of Berryvania, the doggie ditty is stuck in her head. The Queen brings a surprise to the group that leaves them all laughing and dancing once again!

That’s what continues to bring more and more fans on the journey filled with fun.

James Altucher believes investors can profit by following what the smartest managers like Warren Buffett are buying.More James Altucher believes investors can profit by following what the smartest managers like Warren Buffett are buying. CNBC's Mike Santoli spoke with Altucher in an exclusive interview for CNBC PRO. Santoli asked Altucher about his investment strategy. "I try to look for where are the best investors investing and can I invest at a better price than them," Altucher said. For example, "if Warren Buffett decides I'm going to buy $2 billion worth of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Apple stock goes down a little bit … I'll buy some Apple stock at a cheaper price than Warren Buffett. It's as if Warren Buffett is my unpaid intern giving me his stock picks for free." In similar fashion he also shared his criteria for early-stage startup investments. "I always assume I'm the dumbest person in the room, which is often accurate. I like to look at companies where there is someone smarter than me, co-investing with me, at the same terms as me," he said. "I like to look for companies that have a CEO who has done it before. They built and sold a company before ... in the same area." Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, angel investor and best-selling author of "Choose Yourself." He is an investor and adviser to over 30 companies and hosts the popular business podcast "The James Altucher Show." See here for the full CNBC PRO report and the interview video.

Her first job is to “vet and make sure that the news providers” in Apple News are legitimate, in an effort to cut down on clickbait. Apple News gathers stories from several leading news sources and displays them all in one place. The app launched on iOS 9 in the United States, and it has since expanded to Australia and the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen with the hiring of an editor if Apple has loftier goals for the news platform. Michael Kozlowski (7034 Posts) Michael Kozlowski is the Editor in Chief of Good e-Reader.

According to Bloomberg, Apple's dedicated artificial intelligence (AI) chip could be called the Apple Neural Engine, and it would be used to offload AI tasks that require complex algorithms, such as facial and speech recognition and augmented reality (AR) and other intensive features that rely on computer vision. The chip would improve battery live and overall performance of Apple's devices. Keep in mind Bloomberg also reported earlier this year that Apple seems to be actively lessening its reliance on Intel chips by designing its own A-series ARM-based chips for Macs, even though Intel processors have powered Apple's Mac lineup for more than a decade. Apple reportedly wants to offload the Mac's "Power Nap" feature from the main processor, though it has no plans to dump Intel right away. Apple has been investing a lot into its own series of chips for the last seven years. For instance, it even designed an ARM-based chip - the T1 - for the MacBook Pro last autumn. Also, in April, British-based technology Imagination Technologies claimed Apple had ended its long-running partnership because it wanted to instead design and produce its own graphics chip for use in the iPhone and iPad. Which MacBook is best for you? MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro? Is Apple making its own chips for Macs so it can eventually ditch Intel? Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? As for the dedicated AI chip, Apple primarily wants to separate the most heavy tasks from the iPhone’s processor and graphics chip, but it unclear if the chip will be available in devices this year. Bloomberg said Apple is now testing iPhone prototypes with the chip. CEO Tim Cook has also teased several times over the past couple years that Apple sees AI and AR as the future, so it's perfectly believable that the company may be building such technologies into its devices as well as developing a dedicated chip for them. We may learn more at Apple's developers conference in a couple weeks.  Sections Apple Phones Source: Bloomberg Apple is likely making an AI chip for iPhone called Apple Neural Engine OnePlus 5 vs Samsung Galaxy S8: What's the rumoured difference?

Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Apple engineers are purportedly racing to catch up with Amazon and Alphabet. Siri gave Apple an early lead in voice recognition but since then its competitors have been more aggressive in deploying AI across product lines with Amazon's Echo and Google Home being notable hits. Currently, artificial intelligence is handled with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks to a dedicated module, likely improving battery performance. Apple is apparently planning to integrate the AI chip into many of its devices including the iPhone and iPad. Sources say the company has already tested future iPhone prototypes with the chip but it's unclear if it will be ready this year. There are already features of Apple's operating system that could be offloaded to the chip including facial recognition in photos, speech recognition, and its predictive keyboard. Developers will reportedly be offered access to the chip so that third party applications can also offload AI tasks. It's possible that Apple could discuss its AI advancements at WWDC in June when it introduces iOS 11. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department detectives have reopened a 2005 murder investigation after new leads recently emerged, authorities said Friday. The announcement comes 12 years after 20-year-old Tyrone Bradley was found shot to death in Apple Valley on February 2005.

No, it’s not one of those Apple rumor sites that likes to speculate on things like whether the next iPhone will have a screen that’s 5.6 inches across diagonally or 5.7 inches across diagonally. Rather, Apple News is the news aggregation app that Apple unveiled in 2015. It pulls in news from various outlets like CNN, the New York Times, BuzzFeed, and the Mercury News, and puts stories from those sources in front of iPhone and iPad users based on those people’s interests. You may have recently seen an Apple News item pop up on your iPhone screen telling you about some story that you might want to read. And for the first time, Apple News is getting an honest-to-goodness editor.

CNN reported that New York disclosed Kern’s hiring in an email to the magazine’s staff members.

The company used its events website to say that the conference keynote address will be webcast on June 5.

Oh, my head hurts so bad thinking about it that I feel the need for a bottle of Advil right now. I guess that until now, Tesla hadn’t thought making it as easy as possible for potential customers to figure out which car was best for them was a priority. Well, the pressure on figuring out which Tesla is which has been relieved, thanks to Tesla itself. The company has put out an easy-to-read comparison chart so that if you have a cool $35,000 (the price of the Model 3) just taking up space in your wallet, or an extra $70,000 (what it costs for the Model S), you can now easily go online, look at the cars side by side, and see what your money can buy.

View Full Caption Shutterstock UPPER EAST SIDE — The phone may be smart, but this thief wasn't. An East Harlem teen snatched an iPhone out of a woman's hand last month, using one of her apps to hail cab and flee the scene, snapping a selfie of himself on the device and even logging in to his own Apple account, police said.  The 38-year-old victim was walking home on April 8, around 10:30 p.m., when the 17-year-old suspect ran up behind her outside of 407 E. 61st St. and grabbed her purse out of her hands, the NYPD said. Running toward York Avenue, the teen used her iPhone 6's Gett app to order a taxi back to his home in East Harlem, police said. He also took a selfie, which was uploaded to the victim's iCloud account, and signed into his own personal Apple account on iPhone 6S, according to authorities. Detectives tracked the suspect down and arrested him on May 23 at 11 a.m., police said. He was arraigned on three counts of grand larceny and his bail was set at $7,500 cash or bond. Other notable crimes in this week’s blotter from the 19th Precinct include: ► Elderly Aunt Scammed Out of $6,400 An 85-year-old Upper East Side woman fell victim to a phone scam on Thursday, when a man called claiming to be a detective at 4 p.m., police said. The man told her that her niece was in jail and that the woman could bail her out by purchasing store gift cards from Best Buy, Walmart, Target and Home Depot. The man advised her not to tell the cashier why she would be buying the cards. When she went to Home Depot, the cashier asked why she wanted to purchase $6,400 in gift cards, and the woman made up an excuse, police said. Later, after the woman had given the card numbers over the phone to the scammers, she discovered that her niece was not in jail. ► Breakfast Food Bandit Hits Gristedes A 38-year-old East Harlem man was arrested for trying to steal bacon and coffee from the Gristedes at 202 E. 96th St., near Third Avenue, on Saturday, at 10:50 a.m., police said. When employees caught him on camera putting the items into a laundry bag and tried to stop him from leaving, the suspect grabbed his bag from them, flailed his arms and kicked an employee. The items he tried to steal were eight Café Bustelo Coffee containers worth $52, seven Applegate bacon packages worth $52, five Godshall bacon packages worth $30, and three Oscar Mayer turkey bacon packages worth $17, police said. He was charged with robbery. A manager at Gristedes declined to comment. ► Don't Give Your Purse to Strangers A 38-year old woman had her purse stolen at Ethyl's Alcohol & Food at 1629 Second Ave., near 85th Street, Friday morning at 2:45 a.m., after handing it to a stranger at the bar while going to dance, police said.  When she returned, the person had vanished with the $2,000 Tod's snakeskin purse, which contained a $400 Louis Vuitton keychain, $100 in cash, $200 in makeup, a $400 Tom Ford perfume bottle, her license, and an American Express card. A spokesperson for Ethyl's did not immediately return a request for comment. ► Locker Theft at Lenox Hill Hospital A Brooklyn man had his wallet stolen from a locker at Lenox Hill Hospital when he went for an MRI at the 100 E. 77th St. medical center on Tuesday, police said. At 7 p.m., the 31 year old put his $300 Paul Smith wallet that had cash and multiple credit cards inside of a hospital locker before going in for his MRI, police said. When he returned to the locker, it was missing. Reps for Lenox Hill Hospital did not immediately return a request for comment.  ► Fake Bottle Return at Duane Reade A 28-year-old cashier from Brooklyn was seen on camera processing fake bottle returns and pocketing the cash at the Duane Reade at 1550 Third Ave. at 87th Street, police said. Between April 20 and May 21, he took $2,050, police said. He was charged with grand larceny. ► Bloomingdale's Targeted for Fraud and Theft Two men were arrested for trying to buy high-end items at the 1000 Third Ave. Bloomingdale's with fake credit cards, police said. A 38-year-old suspect purchased two pairs of Ferragamo shoes worth $740 and two Ferragamo belts worth $975 using a fake credit card on Wednesday at 6 p.m. He was charged with grand larceny, two counts of possession of a forged instrument, and one count of criminal possession of stolen property. A 19-year-old Queens man tried picking up two Burberry shirts valued at $288 that he bought with an account that didn't belong to him on Thursday around 7 p.m. He used a fake ID to pick up the items, but store security stopped him and he was charged with petit larceny and criminal possession of a forged instrument. ► Drunk Driver Refuses Breath Test A New Jersey man was arrested for drunk driving when police pulled him over for recklessly driving his 2016 Chevy Wagon along East 60th Street, First Avenue and East 61st Street Thursday shortly after 2:30 a.m., police said. He made an improper turn and disobeyed traffic light, and refused to take a Breathalyzer test when he was stopped. The driver was charged with aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle, unlicensed driving, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol.  Twitter Facebook Email More Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandBattery Park City Is Home to Nation's Priciest Rents: Study Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandNearly 300 'High-End' Trash Bins Added to Upper East Side Streets Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandStraphangers Will Foot the Bill for New MTA Capital Plan, MTA Chair Says Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandYou Have To Earn $240K a Year to Afford a 3-Bedroom in Manhattan Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandFlatiron's 5th Ave. Sees Retail Rent Increases Amid Slowdown, Study Says Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandBoxing Gym Backed by Stallone, Bieber Opening Upper East Side Outpost Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandAlcoholics Anonymous Sues to Get Original '12 Step' Manuscript Back Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandWATCH: Broadway Star Bebe Neuwirth Reads 'War and Peace' to Abused Dogs Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandOverdose Deaths Up Nearly 22 Percent Citywide, Officials Say Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandMore Q Trains Coming to 2nd Ave. Subway During Rush Hour This Fall: MTA Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandBank Robber Hits Same Upper East Side Branch Twice, Police Say Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt Island2nd Ave. Subway's 83rd St. Entrance Reopens After Week of Escalator Repairs Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandUpper East Siders Live Longest as Overall NYC Life Expectancy Drops: Data Next in Upper East Side & Roosevelt IslandWave Sculptures by Slash and Keith Richards Roll Into the City Get our daily Upper East Side & Roosevelt Island news and alerts!

Production Issues Could Postpone Apple's New iPhone, Report Says By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 05/26/17 AT 5:25 PM Close An Apple analyst said Apple’s iPhone 8 will be delayed during shipping and won’t start production until the first quarter of 2018, according to a report from AppleInsider. Jun Zhang, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said in a note to investors that issues with the iPhone 8’s reported rear fingerprint sensor will delay the smartphone’s launch and that materials for its production won’t be available until the holiday 2017 quarter. As a result, Zhang said production orders for the new iPhone 8 will also be smaller than expected. As AppleInsider notes, Rosenblatt has also maintained an aggressively low target of $120 for Apple stock, despite its current price of around $150. Read: Alleged Images Of Apple Smartphone Show Touch ID On Back Of Device, Matte Black Model In the past, Zhang and Rosenblatt's predictions have sometimes been aggressive towards Apple. As AppleInsider pointed out, Zhang previously wrote in 2016 that if the Apple iPhone 7 didn’t have a significant panel upgrade, it would lack a driving feature for sales. The iPhone 7 would go on to fuel stronger year-over-year sales for Apple in the first quarter of 2017. While Apple has kept many details for the iPhone 8 under wraps, various leaks have provided a basic outline for the upcoming smartphone. Apple is expected to pair the iPhone 8 release with an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus refresh. The iPhone 8 is also expected to be a more boutique smartphone model with a possible price point of more than $1,000. The rear of the new iPhone is also expected to include a fingerprint sensor, similarly to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel. The rumored issues with the fingerprint sensor also come alongside similar product delay issues with the iPhone 8. Previously, it was rumored that Apple wanted to include Touch ID — where a user can validate their identity with a fingerprint — directly into the iPhone display. However, Apple reportedly ran into problems during the production process for the feature. At the time, Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri said Apple could potentially choose to either rely entirely on the front-facing camera with facial recognition for user validation. Apple could also move the Touch ID to the phone's backside or delay production on the phone, but still announce it alongside the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Read: Apple iPhone 8's High Price Will Not Dampen Sales, Survey Says For Apple, the company has ample reasons to ensure that the iPhone 8 hits the same heights of past iPhone releases. While the iPhone remains a driving factor in Apple’s current success, the smartphone field will see several high-profile releases this year like the LG G6 and has already seen similar flagship models like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel. Apple likely wants ensure that it gets the iPhone 8 launch right and maintains its current status as a market leader.

The chip, which may be called the Apple Neural Engine, would be used to offload tasks that require sophisticated algorithms related to facial and speech recognition and augmented reality tasks that rely heavily on computer vision. This chip could improve the device’s overall battery life, the report says, and potentially improve overall performance of Apple devices. It’s unclear if the chip would make its way into devices this year, Bloomberg reports, but Apple has already started testing future iPhone prototypes with the chip. The ultimate goal would be to separate the most computationally intensive tasks from the iPhone’s processor and graphics chip — much in the same way Apple uses distinct chips to power motion sensing across its device line and the chip that helps its AirPods more easily sync wirelessly with the iPhone. Apple is getting serious about AI The iPhone maker is typically tight-lipped on any and all developments regarding future products. But CEO Tim Cook has, over the last few years, dropped hints in interviews that augmented reality and AI are the two core pillars of Apple’s future. Both provide avenues into promising new technologies like self-driving cars, more sophisticated digital assistants, and the kind of image recognition that could imbue a smartphone with the ability to understand and contextualize the world. Though we haven’t seen Apple make any public AI announcements outside its occasional Siri update, the company has been on a hiring spree to scoop up top industry talent. Other news of its other commitments to the field have also begun trickling out. In January, Apple joined the Partnership on AI, a research group made up of other Silicon Valley giants concerned with examining the ethical ripple effects of automation, robotics, and digital intelligence. Apple also started allowing its AI researchers to publish papers last year, as a way to retain the field’s best academics. In February, Apple announced that it would be expanding its Seattle office, where much of its AI and machine learning work is done.

Roston - May 26, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple is developing a chip called ‘Neural Engine’ that will be dedicated to artificial intelligence tasks, according to new sources. This AI processor will handle things like speech recognition, facial recognition, and other ‘advanced capabilities’ for Apple products. Artificial intelligence tasks will reportedly be handled by this new dedicated chip rather than the device’s primary processor, helping with battery life and more. The Apple Neural Engine, according to Bloomberg, is part of Apple’s new push to further develop its artificial intelligence capabilities, enabling it to keep pace with Google and Amazon, which are heavily pushing the technology at the consumer level. Sources state this not-yet-confirmed chip will eventually make its way into the iPhone and iPad, among other things, assuming Apple doesn’t scrap the project entirely. Which tasks, exactly, the Neural Engine will handle is unclear. The sources indicate that Apple is considering different things that may be dedicated to the future chip, including predictive text and apps’ facial/speech recognition. It is also possible that Apple will open the chip up to its developers so that third-party AI features can utilize the hardware. One source claimed that Apple is far enough along in the development process to have already tested a future iPhone prototype containing the Apple Neural Engine processor, but whether it will arrive in the iPhone 8 is unknown. It is possible we’ll be hearing about the company’s artificial intelligence endeavors at its upcoming developers conference, though the sources weren’t clear about whether Apple will unveil the technology then.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet says the chip is known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, and its goal is to improve the way devices handle facial recognition, speech recondition and other AI-related tasks. Currently, Apple devices handle complex AI processes with two different chips—the main processor and the GPU. This new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for complex artificial intelligence processing, resulting in better battery life and performance. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. It’s no surprise Apple looking to move quickly with this AI chip. Other manufacturers, such as Google and Qualcomm, are already using dedicated AI modules, and artificial intelligence sits at the heart of two major spaces the company is rumored to be interested in: self-driving vehicles and augmented reality.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Apple is working on a ‘Neural Engine’ to improve AI in iOS devices Image Source: Apple Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 26th, 2017 at 5:07 PM Share Tweet Apple is developing a processor dedicated to AI-related tasks, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Gurman’s source says that the chip is known internally as the ‘Apple Neural Engine,’ and that it will be used to improve the way that Apple’s myriad devices respond to requests that typically require human intelligence, including facial recognition and speech recognition. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the iPhone 8’s most exciting new feature The report claims that Apple is in a rush to catch up with its competition at Amazon and Google when it comes to artificial intelligence. Although Siri was the first virtual assistant to reach the mainstream, it has since been surpassed by the like of Alexa and Google Assistant, both of which have become even more ubiquitous with the release of smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. As it stands, Apple uses the main processor and the graphics chip to run virtually everything on its iOS devices, including AI processes. The Neural Engine would allow Apple to offload those processes onto a discreet module, freeing up the other chips and possibly improving battery life in the process. One source says that Apple will eventually implement the chip into its most popular devices, including the iPhone and iPad. The company has even begun testing new iPhone models with the Neural Engine, but it’s unclear if it will be ready in time for the launch of the iPhone 7s and iPhone 8 this fall. Depending on how far along the project is by next month, there’s a chance Apple will take some time at its annual WWDC conference to discuss it advancements in the AI field. The AI chip would join iOS 11 and and new MacBooks as the featured topics of discussion for the event, which starts on June 5th.

By Tiernan Ray May 26, 2017 4:32 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple (AAPL) is working on a computer chip that would “offload” tasks in artificial intelligence, according to an article today by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, citing a single unnamed source. Gurman writes that the A.I. chip, dubbed "Apple Neural Engine” internally, would be meant for “devices,” meaning, the company’s iPhone and iPad. It’s not yet clear if it will be available this year, according to his source. Gurman writes that the device is meant to take over some processing done currently by the microprocessor or “application processor,” and by the graphics processing unit, or “GPU,” circuitry. Apple’s custom “A” series chips in its iOS devices fulfill both those roles. As Gurman notes, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google unit has developed its own chips for machine learnings, called “TPUs,” the second version of which were shown by the company last week at its annual developer conference. Such chips can to an extent be competition for parts from Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), at least in the data center. I penned an article for Barron’s print magazine in October of 2015 that said cloud computing companies would develop more and more custom parts for tasks that relate to A.I., such as machine learning. Google, for one, has boasted of how its chips can beat traditional CPUs and GPUs in machine-learning tasks. Apple stock today closed down 26 cents at $153.61.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Apple is reportedly developing a dedicated AI chip Khari Johnson@kharijohnson May 26, 2017 1:39 PM Above: HONG KONG - CIRCA NOVEMBER, 2016: Inside an Apple store. Image Credit: Sorbis/Shutterstock Apple is reportedly working on a chip for its devices to process artificial intelligence. Called the Apple Neural Engine internally, the chip will assist in functions such as computer vision, speech recognition, facial recognition, and other forms of artificial intelligence, an anonymous source told Bloomberg. Third-party developers will be offered access to the chip in order to run their own AI, the source said. Most A-Series chips that act as the main processors for iPhones and iPads are currently used to perform AI computation. More news on the subject could be on the way at WWDC, the annual developer conference to take place June 5-9 in San Jose, California. In 2013, Apple brought the M7 motion processor to iPhone 5S to operate alongside its CPU. This AI chip appears to take the same approach. Unlike Google, which has AI chips dedicated to cloud computing, Apple is apparently looking to include AI chips directly inside its devices. The Apple Neural Engine news comes just a week after Google debuted the second generation of its tensor processing unit, a Google Cloud-based chip for both the inference and training of artificial intelligence. Also last week, Google released TensorFlow Lite for Android app developers to incorporate AI into their products.

It has raised speculation the handset will has a port on top to enable accessories to be plugged in - including the camera, which could be used to create augmented reality apps.

It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem using AI - from phones and smart home gadgets to app stores.

Share this article Share A previous tweet shows an extremely small bezel, with Rubin saying he was 'excited to get it into more people's hands'. 'Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter,' Bloomberg said. A search in LinkedIn reveals several of the employees, including Niccolo De Masi, the ex-CEO of Glu Mobuile, who is listed as the firm's President & COO.  Rubin also recently hired Andy Fouché from Magic Leap, a Google backed firm developing AR glasses.  Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Rubin also teased last month that Essential is working on a device that would have 360-degree video recording capabilities ANDY RUBIN'S CAREER  Born in 1963, New Yorker Any Rubin worked on the first generation of wireless digital assistants, known as PDA. In December 1999 he launched Danger, creator of the Hiptop, a proto-smartphone, which was later bought by Microsoft.  Rubin cofounded Android in 2003 and sold it to Google in 2005, moving to the firm. In December 2013, Rubin started management of the robotics division of Google, before leaving on 30 October 2014 to start an incubator for hardware startups. Rubin and his wife, Rie, also own and operate Voyageur du Temps, a bakery in Los Altos, CA.   Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015, and in late 2016, the company registered 'Essential' with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. There, it listed smartphones, tablets, accessories and 'computer operating software for mobile phones' among its goods and services.  According to Bloomberg, the handset will be aimed at the luxury end of the market, and could be expanded using plug in modules.  Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, although they admitted 'all of the plans are still in flux'. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry.  'New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,' he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June.  He believes that AI in the future will go one step further - being so powerful that it underpins every connected device. Mr Rubin said a combination of quantum computing and AI advancements could yield a conscious intelligence that would control every internet-enabled gadget.  Andy Rubin has recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem from phones to app stores and smart home gadgets.  'If you have computing that is as powerful as this could be, you might only need one. 'It might not be something you carry around; it just has to be conscious.' While Mr Rubin's claims are currently theoretical, his investment fund, Playground Global, is investing $300 million in companies trying to make this future of AI a reality. One of the companies his fund is investing in, is a quantum computing firm. Its name has not been disclosed. The company is made up of researchers who may one day be able to commercialise quantum devises using standard manufacturing processes, which could massively boost processing power.  Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin (pictured) discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Mr Rubin said: 'In order for AI to blossom and fulfill consumer needs, it has to be about data. 'That's where robotics come in - robots are walking mobile sensors, who can sense their environment and interact and learn from those interactions.'  Foxconn is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said.   RUBIN'S DOG TAKES ON A ROBOT   While at Google's Rubin's dog hit the headlines after taking on a robot. A feisty terrier has taken on Boston Dynamics' 'Spot' dog by barking at it and even giving chase, showing that in the event of a robot uprising, dogs will still be man's best friend.The dog, named Cosmo, is said to belong to Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android, who has previously managed the robotics program at Google. Google acquired Boston Dymamics, which makes numerous sized robotic animals in differing sizes, including Spot, which can run, climb stairs, jog next to its owner and even cope with being kicked.

Yesterday AAPL: 153.61 -0.26 Report: Apple working on dedicated ‘Apple Neural Engine’ AI processor Jordan Kahn - May. 26th 2017 1:03 pm PT @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Ahead of next-generation iPhones expected to include augmented reality features and updates for Siri, Bloomberg is out with a new report today detailing Apple’s work on a dedicated processor that it says will be devoted entirely to artificial intelligence tech. Dubbed “Apple Neural Engine” internally, the report says the chip will allow for much improved facial and speech recognition applications as well as improved battery life: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance…. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Several reports in recent months have detailed Apple’s plans to include augmented reality tech in next generation iPhones that are said to tap into a 3D-sensing front camera for depth detection. The technology can reportedly allow merging of depth information together with 2D images from the front camera for applications including face recognition, iris recognition, and 3D selfies. Today’s report adds that Apple has already tested prototypes of iPhones using the dedicated AI chip, but it’s unclear if it will be ready to debut in an iPhone 8 with AR features expected this fall. In addition, Bloomberg says Apple has plans to allow developer access to the chip and has tested various applications for its own software such as “offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip.” The news comes ahead of an unveiling of Apple’s much rumored Siri Speaker product expected as soon as next month at its Worldwide Developer Conference kicking off June 5.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The May Cover of the 'The New Yorker' Magazine was designed on an iPad Pro by Artist Jorge Colombo | Main | Apple's advances in AI Continue to Surface at a Record Pace as news of a 'Neural Engine' Chip now Emerges » May 26, 2017 The Case about the Downing of an Air Egypt Flight related to Apple Devices is still ongoing with Apple not Involved   In January Patently Apple posted a report tiled "A Weak Circumstantial Theory by French Investigators Points to Fiery Apple Device Bringing Down Air Egypt." At the time the French newspaper Le Parisien quoted Apple stating that "We were not contacted by the GTA or any other authority investigating this tragic event. We have not had access to the report, but our understanding is that there is no evidence linking this event to Apple products. We are entirely at the disposal of the investigators to answer any question. We rigorously test our products to ensure that they comply or exceed international safety standards."   Today a a follow-up report from the Le Parisien surfaced. The French report supposedly asked Apple again for comment on the matter and Apple gave them a response. However, the response was word for word identical to the statement given in January. So it's either that Apple legal has a set response on this matter or the reporter made no such follow-up call to Apple.   With that said, the report notes that there were three investigating judges in charge of the investigation. On May 17 a document was made public. The French paper notes that the "complexity and the technicality of the Mission", the judges chose specialists who were not on the usual list of experts of the Ministry of Justice. They retained a research engineer at the CNRS, a doctor of solids physics from the Ministry of hosts and a specialist in battery and battery engineering, which also depends on the Ministry of the Armies. Their mission? Determine precisely whether these devices, and in particular their batteries, were able to trigger the disaster. Experts are asked to acquire "three iPad mini Wi-Fi 3G Model A 1455" and "three iPhone 6s, both new and used". Smartphones and tablets will be put to the test.   The report further noted that most importantly, experts will have to "provoke a thermal runaway", write the judges in their mission letter. After determining if the devices can catch fire, the experts will have to cause this fire, in order to calculate in particular the heat radiation produced and to analyze the soots and fumes that come out. By this expertise, filmed and recorded, the investigators seek to know whether the tablet and smartphone can ignite spontaneously and, if so, under what conditions and at what speed; And, finally, to determine whether the combustion of the aircraft was able to make the aeroplane uncontrollable and/or asphyxiate the pilots.   Their report must be submitted to the judge before September 30th. This orientation of the investigation comes after careful work of the search section of the Air Transport Gendarmerie (GTA). They had identified the presence of the Apple products through cameras that scanned the cockpit of the device parked at its departure station at Roissy Airport. But also during the passage to the security control of the crews, who scanned their personal belongings. "The equation of this tragedy is perhaps to be found in the connection of these devices between the current delivered by the plugs behind the copilot and the reception of this current by lithium-battery devices," indicates a source close to the record.   Even with the fire on the Southwest Airlines plane due to a fire from a Galaxy Note 7 battery, the fumes didn't overwhelm anyone on the plane. Making the leap to an Apple device fire overwhelming both the pilot and co-pilot seems to be a wild guess. The testing that is being requested is going to take a long time to examine and there's still no way of knowing what will come of the test noted earlier.   With so much terrorist activity in-play these days, it's bizarre that the focus of the investigation in still on Apple devices. Last September a Russian jet blew up over Egypt due to a terrorist device. In the case focused on Apple devices, the UK's Guardian pointed to Terrorism for the crash of flight MS804 being likely, not Apple devices.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Beddit makes an iPhone-connected Sleep Monitor that tracks a wide range of sleep-related metrics, from heart rate and sleep time to room temperature and respiration. When Apple acquires a company, the company in question typically shuts down and stops selling whatever product it makes as Apple assimilates the technology into its own offerings, but that's not the case with Beddit. Apple is still selling the Beddit Sleep Monitor in its stores, and the Beddit privacy policy has been updated to note that Apple is collecting Beddit sleep data. That raises some interesting questions about Apple's future plans. Will that sleep tracking data contribute to an upcoming Apple Watch with sleep tracking functionality? Does Apple have plans for some other kind of sleep tracking device? Will Beddit be one of several health-related companies Apple purchases so it can sell a range of hardware products? Apple's plans for the Beddit technology may be a mystery right now, but we can take a closer look at the Sleep Monitor to see just what it can do, what kind of data Apple is gathering, and whether it's worth buying. I bought a Beddit Sleep Monitor shortly after Apple announced its acquisition, and I've been testing it for the past 10 days. The Beddit Sleep Monitor belongs to a class of sleep tracking devices that aren't wearable. It's meant to be placed directly on the bed under the sheets rather than on the body. Design wise, it consists of a long strip of fabric that's about 2.5 feet in length and three inches wide. One side is a soft, pliable material, while the other side, which sits on the mattress, is backed with rubber so it stays in place. It's small enough that it's easy to pack up when traveling. The Sleep Monitor is meant to be placed underneath the bottom sheet of a bed, on top of the mattress near where the heart is located when you lie down. It can be placed on one side of the bed in a shared bed, or in the middle for a person who sleeps alone. While it can be used in a shared bed, Beddit is meant for one person, and because the sensor is directly underneath the body, it accurately picks up the movement of a single person even when two people are in the bed. In my testing, the Sleep Monitor never picked up movement or measurements that weren't mine, and it never failed to monitor me. I installed it on my side of a full-sized bed, right at the level where my heart is. Beddit says the Sleep Monitor is unnoticeable during sleep, and while it is indeed made from a thin, flexible fabric, I can feel it under my sheet. It isn't exactly bothersome and doesn't prevent me from sleeping, but I know it's there. It's not supposed to move because of the rubber backing, but it does shift around. I don't move much in my sleep so the movement wasn't an issue for me, but someone who tosses and turns might need to make regular adjustments to its position. It's also worth noting that the Beddit has a thin, unobtrusive cord that needs to be plugged in at all times, so it will need to be near an outlet. So what does the Beddit track? As it turns out, a lot. It goes beyond wearable sleep trackers that rely solely on movement to determine sleep quality, and some of what it tracks is potentially very valuable for people with breathing-related sleep issues. Here's everything it keeps tabs on: Sleep time The time it took to fall asleep Light sleep vs. deep sleep (no REM measurement) Number of times out of bed Restless sleep (lots of tossing and turning) Sleep efficiency (based on time spent asleep) Sleep score (an overall score that takes everything into account) Snoring (via iPhone speaker) Heart rate Respiration (breaths per minute) Average room temperature Average room humidity With so many aspects of the sleeping experience being tracked, the Beddit Sleep Monitor gives a comprehensive overview of everything that happens while you're asleep. Having a complete overview makes it easier to recognize patterns and problems that are interfering with sleep, especially when it's easy to see right in the accompanying Beddit app. So is it accurate? For the most part, yes. My heart rate measurements were in line with what I see with my Apple Watch, and the respiration measurement and temperature were spot on too. Sleep time, sleep efficiency, and the time it took to fall asleep were areas where felt like I had less of a clear picture, though. Beddit provides an overall sleep score each night I'm a light sleeper and it often takes me a long time to fall asleep, but at the same time, I don't move a lot. Beddit could not tell the difference between when I was awake lying in bed and when I was actually asleep, whether it was when I was falling asleep for the first time or when I woke up in the middle of the night. That's led to some overestimation of the amount of time I'm asleep, which in turn impacts the sleep efficiency score. It's not wildly inaccurate every day, but it's been off by as much as a half hour. Someone who lies awake (and still) in bed for long swaths of time may be disappointed with the accuracy of the Beddit. A more restless sleeper won't have this problem because the Sleep Monitor will pick up the movement. The time to fall asleep and awake measurements here are off Though the sleep efficiency/time measurement is not entirely accurate for me, the sleep graph in the app gives me a much clearer picture of how my night went. It measures light sleep and deep sleep, and while the app tells me I was asleep when it dips down sharply, that's actually when I was awake. The Beddit Sleep Monitor seems to be accurately interpreting my sleep/wake patterns, but then misreading some of the data when calculating sleep efficiency and sleep score. When I want a general idea of how I slept in a given night, I check the graph before relying on the sleep time and sleep efficiency numbers. The graph, though, is only divided by hour and so the information I have is limited - this would be a lot more useful if I could drill down into more specific timeframes. As an example, it'll tell me I got out of bed sometime near 3:00 a.m., but it won't give me the exact time. Beddit says I slept roughly the same amount of time on these two nights, but the graph tells a different story. At each dip, I was awake, not in a state of light sleep. Along with the light/deep sleep graph, the Beddit app offers up concrete numbers on all of the different tracking metrics, plus a graph for heart rate. Comparing the sleep graph and the heart rate graph has proven to be interesting because of the correlation between the two. There are often small jumps in my heart rate at the times when Beddit says I'm most deeply asleep, which seems to relate to dreams/nightmares. A sleep graph compared to a heart rate graph from the same night The Beddit app measures two factors I wasn't able to properly test -- snoring and restless sleep. I don't seem to move enough to trigger any restless sleep readings, and I don't snore. My partner snores, though, so I can say that it's sensitive enough to tell my breathing from his. By the way, the Beddit has been able to track my sleeping accurately regardless of position. I'm a side or stomach sleeper, but also tested sleeping on my back. There's no difference in the data. Beddit data is displayed on a day-by-day basis, but there are also options to see trends over 7, 30, and 90 days. Trends cover sleep score, sleep time, heart rate, bedroom temperature/humidity, and a notes feature, which is actually one of the handiest ways to measure sleep trends. Each morning, you can rate how you feel after a night's sleep and add notes and tags to keep track of factors that might have impacted sleep. My cat meows some mornings, so I might add a note that I was woken up by the cat. If I ate something unusual or drank caffeine late in the day, those are also things that could be noted, and over time, I might be able to notice trends. Tags are important because the app will automatically correlate tags with sleep efficiency scores. My sleep is worse on nights tagged "cat," which means my cat was meowing in the early morning. There's a built-in smart alarm feature in the Beddit app, designed to go off up to 30 minutes before the set time whenever sleep is lightest. The idea is that if you're woken up in a light sleep, you'll be less groggy. It worked semi-well, but 30 minutes is a long window and there's no customization option to shorten it. One other thing worth noting -- Beddit can be set to automatically start tracking sleep as soon as you get in the bed at night, so there's no need to open the app and turn it on. I liked the convenience of this feature, but ended up leaving manual activation on because I like to read in bed before sleeping and the Beddit thought I was asleep when I was reading. Overall, the Beddit app is well done and it offers up a lot of info, but there are some negatives. First of all, the Beddit Sleep Monitor needs to be continually connected to the iPhone via Bluetooth when it's in use at night, which Beddit says is necessary because of the amount of data being transferred. With a continual Bluetooth connection, the Beddit is a serious battery drain (it'll suck up a good 30 to 40% on an iPhone 7 Plus). You're going to want to plug your iPhone in at night when using it. Second, snoring tracking is done on the iPhone, and there's no way to disable it. That means Beddit is using the microphone, which happens to disable my AirPods and other Bluetooth headphones. It also prevents "Hey Siri" hands-free commands from working. There is no option to disable snoring tracking, which is a downside for people who don't snore. Third, given the amount of information the Sleep Monitor tracks, I think the app could offer up more detail, like a clearer picture of specific heart rate and respiration rates over time. Luckily, it connects to Apple Health, and all of this data is synced there. In the Health app, you can see each respiration and heart rate measurement during the night, and the Beddit also syncs overall sleep data. Heart rate measurement in Health app on left, respiration on right One last thing -- the Beddit is compatible with nap taking. It tracks nap length just like a standard night of sleep and adds that information to the day's overall sleep score and sleep time. Bottom Line In 10 days, the Beddit Sleep Monitor hasn't taught me anything I didn't already know, but as someone who likes to track things and collect data, I find the information it's giving me valuable, even if some of its conclusions about my sleep aren't 100 percent accurate. I suspect that with longer use and more attention to tags, I might be able to learn more. I've had sleep problems my entire life, so I've already learned to stick to a rigorous sleep routine, but someone who needs help establishing good sleep habits or figuring out what's impacting sleep could potentially benefit from the Beddit Sleep Monitor. With its snoring, heart rate, and respiration features, Beddit will be able to pick up on sleep apnea and breathing issues, and the data combined with user notes can help suss out other sleep problems. $150 is expensive, but if it's able to provide a better night's sleep for someone who's struggling, the high price tag is worth it. People without serious sleep issues who just like to keep track of health metrics will also likely be satisfied with the Beddit given the many things it tracks. In its current incarnation, the Beddit Sleep Monitor is a decent sleep tracker. With Apple's tweaking, I think it could be a lot better. In my experience, it's collecting all the data it needs, but with some fine tuning, that data could be better interpreted and more valuable. I've never used a sleep tracker that can tell the difference between when I'm lying in bed and when I'm asleep, but if anyone can solve that problem and refine sleep tracking algorithms, it'll probably be Apple. I'm interested to see what kind of improvements Apple can make to sleep tracking and what it plans to do with the data and the technology it has acquired from Beddit, so I'll keep using my Sleep Monitor. How to Buy The Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor can be purchased from Apple for $149.95. Tag: Beddit 14 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) IJ Reilly 11 hours ago at 12:59 pm I wonder how the sensor works, and also whether Apple perhaps did not buy the company for this technology primarily. Also, hate to bring it up again but: on top of the mattress is under the bottom sheet, not the top sheet.

Apple Apple’s shiny new $5 billion campus opened to employees in late April. But, so far, it seems only Wired has been granted permission to permeate the four-story glass walls and return to civilization with a breathless review of what’s inside. So breathless, in fact, that some of details seem too fantastical to believe. Consider details from the story like this: Apple custom-designed (and patented) a circular pizza box for its new cafe. “Francesco Longoni, the maestro of the Apple Park café, helped Apple patent a box that will keep to-go pizzas from getting soggy.” Right? In a few cases, writer Steven Levy’s passages about Apple Park are such spectacular examples of tech company indulgence that they sound like they’re plucked right from the pages of The Circle, Dave Eggers’s 2013 book about an influential Silicon Valley corporation that was recently adapted into a film. Look familiar? It’s not Apple Park, it’s the campus of The Circle from the new film STX Entertainment For proof, I pulled a few of my favorite descriptions of Apple Park from Levy’s review and The Circle’s campus from Eggers’s novel. Can you tell which is which? Read these quotes and try to guess if it’s a real-life detail from Apple Park or a description of the made-up campus in The Circle.

Read More , video editors The Top 8 Free Video Editors For macOS The Top 8 Free Video Editors For macOS The best video editors for macOS cost a lot of money, but what if your budget is $0? Read More . And then, of course, there are digital audio workstations (DAWs) for making music. But owning a Mac doesn’t necessarily mean you’re swimming in cash, and music production suites can run into thousands of dollars. Today we’ll look at how you can start making music without spending any dollars. 1. GarageBand In short: Probably the best free music production software on the platform. It has a user-friendly interface, rich library of sounds, and a large number of instruments and effects. Apple just made GarageBand free to all Mac owners. So, there’s never been a better time to download it and give it a go. Previously the company was only giving the software away with new Mac purchases, which means second-hand buyers Apple Tax: Why Do Macs Hold Their Resale Value? Apple Tax: Why Do Macs Hold Their Resale Value? You've probably heard it before: Macs may cost more, but they hold their value. Is this true, and if so why? Read More and those with older machines still had to buy it. You can now download it for free (along with iMovie and the iWork suite Download iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, and iWork Free for Mac and iOS Download iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, and iWork Free for Mac and iOS Every Apple user can now download Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Garageband and iMovie completely free of charge, but what are they good for? Read More ) from the App Store on both Mac and iOS. Projects can be shared between both platforms, which is a nice touch for mobile musicians or simply capturing ideas on the move. Don’t let GarageBand’s simple interface put you off. At its core it’s a powerful tool for recording, arranging, and composing music. The included instruments aren’t bad, and nor are many of the royalty-free samples you get access to for free with Apple Loops. Like iMovie, GarageBand tends to do things the “Apple way,” which can be jarring for some users. It might take a little bit of time to get used to the software’s caveats, but it’s got all the bells and whistles you need to get started. That includes MIDI support, virtual session drummers, and audio effects like amplifiers for plugging in a guitar. 2. Ardour In short: The full package, but unlike GarageBand there’s nobody to hold your hand. The learning curve is steep, but Ardour’s potential for producing, composing and mastering is huge. Ardour is pretty much the opposite of what GarageBand is: a technical, highly-customizable, cross-platform open source digital audio workstation. The interface looks like something you need a degree in sound engineering to understand, and there’s a hell of a lot going on if you know where to look. Unlike GarageBand, Ardour is a serious tool. It includes features like unlimited multichannel tracks, non-destructive editing, time-stretching, video features, a complex mastering interface, and robust AudioUnit (AU) Mac plugin support. Record directly into the timeline using a microphone or audio interface, or create MIDI patterns for use with virtual instruments using the piano roll. If you’re willing to put some time in, Ardour could be a very rewarding choice of DAW. It’s cross-platform and Linux compatible, which is a nice touch if you also happen to run Linux on your Mac Buying MacBooks For Penguins: Linux on Apple Hardware Buying MacBooks For Penguins: Linux on Apple Hardware You'd probably think that the free open source operating system Linux wouldn't mix too well with Apple's proprietary, controlling approach when it comes to hardware — but you'd be wrong. Read More . Check out the Ardour Community website for manuals, tutorials, and discussions relating to the software. 3. LMMS In short: A freeware open source workstation aimed at synthesis and sample-work initially designed for Linux, that includes virtual instruments, bundled samples, and plugin support. LMMS used to stand for Linux MultiMedia Studio, but it dropped that moniker a few years ago when it went cross-platform. It’s now available on Windows and macOS too, allowing for a truly cross-platform setup for those who need it. The project isn’t just free, it’s also open source. That means it’s built by the community Open Source vs. Free Software: What's the Difference and Why Does It Matter? Open Source vs. Free Software: What's the Difference and Why Does It Matter? Many assume "open source" and "free software" mean the same thing but that's not true. It's in your best interest to know what the differences are. Read More , for the community. This model has its limitations, and the LMMS team can’t dedicate the resources to their project like Apple can with GarageBand. As a result, LMMS can feel a bit awkward to use and get on with, though there’s a healthy set of tools and instruments hidden beneath its dated, slightly awkward UI. LMMS isn’t a recording-friendly DAW like GarageBand is, and instead excels at creating melodies and beats using the included piano roll and step sequencer. You can of course import recorded samples, and there are some excellent virtual instruments included like the Nescaline NES emulator, Commodore 64 SID chip emulation, and the triple-oscillator “Monstro” virtual synth. 4. Tracktion T5 In short: A useful (if dated) DAW that includes a full set of editing and recording features, with cheap upgrade options for those who want to take their compositions to the next level. Tracktion make a variety of audio software, including fully-fledged studios like WAVEFORM and T7. They also produce T5, a free cross-platform stripped-down DAW that serves as the perfect jumping-on point for the company’s products. But just because it’s free doesn’t mean it should be overlooked. This isn’t simply a “free trial” with limitations. Though the feature set has been reduced compared to paid versions, Tracktion T5 still includes unlimited MIDI and audio tracks, a full set of recording and editing features, and the ability to mixdown and share your project. So what’s wrong with T5? Well, there’s an inferior time-stretch algorithm, “basic” audio computing, no user scripts, and the UI isn’t as nice. There’s more to it than that of course, but the upgrade to T7 is still only $60. You can even go “full studio” and grab WAVEFORM for $99. 5. Studio One 3 Prime In short: Just like Tracktion T5, Studio One Prime is a capable DAW with some major feature limitations. There’s plenty here to get you started, but a lack of third-party virtual instruments will be a big limitation for some users. PreSonus’ Studio One 3 comes in a variety of versions including Artist and Professional, but it’s the Prime version that’s most appealing to the bedroom producer. The company released a feature-limited version of their $100 workstation for free in 2015, and it comes with pretty much everything you need to get started making music. There’s support for unlimited audio and MIDI tracks, and nine plugin inserts and virtual instruments. The software doesn’t timeout or feature any restrictions on the number of tracks you can create, and even comes with 1.5 GB of samples to get you started. Unfortunately, you can’t host third party software instruments (AudioUnits), which does limit Prime’s potential substantially. However, it still has its merits, particularly if you rarely use virtual instruments and are looking for a basic recording/mastering package. The included effects fall into the “essentials” category, and there’s a quality sampler included too. You can activate a free trial version of Studio One Professional at any point, if you suddenly decide you need more power. Prime is designed to get you hooked on Studio One, but it’s certainly worth a shot if you’re on a budget. 6. Nanostudio In short: A synthesis and beat-making freebie that’s not to be missed, Nanostudio for Mac is a port of the premium Nanostudio for iOS ($7). Nanostudio takes the LMMS approach, with a free version of the popular iOS workstation from developer Blip Interactive NanoStudio: A $14 iOS Music Workstation With Free Windows And Mac Versions NanoStudio: A $14 iOS Music Workstation With Free Windows And Mac Versions Yesterday's iOS digital audio workstation (DAW) round-up listed the best apps of all the budget tools available on the App Store. One of those featured apps was NanoStudio, a $13.99 iPhone and iPad app that... Read More . There was a time when Nanostudio was pretty much the gold standard on iOS for mobile music production, and while the DAW certainly hasn’t gotten any worse it hasn’t changed very much either. A MIDI and sample-based approach mean that it’s not an environment for recording your guitars and vocals. You can load samples using the included sampler and fire them when you want, but you’ll have record them outside of Nanostudio. MIDI patterns are handled with ease, though it’s no secret that Nanostudio was designed with a touch interface in mind. The included Eden synthesizer is a force to be reckoned with, and worth the download alone. You can hit up the Nanostudio downloads page to download synthesizer presets and sample packs, and the forum is still active all these years later. This is free purely so you’ll fall in love with Nanostudio for Mac and download it on your iPhone for $7 so you can use it wherever you go. And that’s not a bad idea, especially when combined with Nanosync for transferring samples, projects, and presets to your iOS device. Other Considerations MuLab Free A mature, self-contained workstation setup with a robust set of tools, MuLab offers a free version of their €69 studio and modular synth. With robust sound synthesis, support for recording, editing and manipulating audio, and modern UI it’s a tempting prospect. However, MuLab Free stops short of being a proper DAW on account of the fact that the software introduces “soft noise” regularly, which is designed to prevent the software being used for finished mixes. It’s more of a full-featured trial than a free version, but it’s still worth a look if you enjoy the MUX synth sound. ohmstudio Free ohmstudio is the world’s first “real time collaborative digital audio workstation” and that means it’s relatively new to the DAW scene. You can sign up for free, download the software, and connect with friends and the wider ohmstudio community to make music together. ohmstudio might seem free, but you can only store 10 songs at a time in the cloud before you need to pay for monthly hosting. You also can’t export your tracks in lossless format using the free version either. These are major limitations that prevent ohmstudio from being a real free alternative. Audacity You should absolutely have Audacity to hand if you’re considering making music on the cheap, particularly if you’re working with samples. The free audio editor and manipulator might look like CoolEdit 96’s uglier cousin, but it’s got everything you need to chop and change audio 7 Audacity Tips For Better Audio Editing On a Budget 7 Audacity Tips For Better Audio Editing On a Budget Want to move beyond simple cut-and-crop jobs? Knowing just a few Audacity tips can make your audio-editing life a whole lot easier. Read More . The software includes a ton of effects like equalizers, reverb, echo, distortion, chorus, and more. It even includes multitrack support for handling multiple wave files at once. This might be good enough for mixing a podcast or recording a vocal track, it’s not a fully-fledged DAW. Audacity works best as an accompaniment to a proper DAW, but isn’t designed to replace one. The same should be said of other multitrack editors (like Adobe Audition). Which is your favorite free DAW? Let us know what we missed and we’ll add it to our list.

The race kicks off with the “Kids Apple Duathlon” Friday night. Organizer Julia Krengel says kids of all ages can take part in the race. “[The kids] six and under, we kind of herd them together and let them run around our parking lot for a 1K and they just absolutely love that.” Two other courses will be set up for older kids ages 7-16. The main adult Apple Duathlon begins Saturday morning. “We’ll open at 6:30 a.m. and everyone will start setting up their bikes and we will start the race right at 8:30 a.m.” Race courses start and finish at Sartell Middle School as well as bring you on a scenic route through Sartell. Nearly 500 athletes are expected to come out to this year’s Apple Dualthon.

The image depicts Brooklyn Bridge Park in Brooklyn Heights that Colombo frequents, with the artwork capturing a couple of basketball games and spectators at the park. Apple CEO Tim Cook shared The New Yorker cover on Twitter this morning, with a quote from Colombo who mentioned his fear that one of the basketballs would fly near him and hit his iPad. It’s one of my favorite places to hang out,” Jorge Colombo says, about the park he sketched, on an iPad, for the cover of this week’s issue. “I live down the street, in Brooklyn Heights, so I go there all the time, either to take the East River Ferry or just to relax by the water. It is a magnet—people come from all of Brooklyn’s many neighborhoods just to take a selfie by the waterfront or picnic by the water. This was a risky drawing to make, though: I kept worrying that the ball would hit me or the iPad.” The New Yorker also shared a video of Colombo's illustration process on its website this week. Apple's iPad and Apple Pencil have been celebrated as tools for artists in the past, with Apple recently highlighting Rob Zilla's NBA illustrations. Apple's tablet was even used to create the poster for Stranger Things on Netflix.Related Roundups: iPad Pro, iPad mini 4 (2015) Tag: Apple Pencil Buyer's Guide: 9.7" iPad Pro (Don't Buy), iPad Mini (Caution), 12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy) Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: The Hollywood Reporter Studio - 2 days ago< > Embed New Details You Have to Know 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' | THR News 02:00 In a new Vanity Fair cover story, director Rian Johnson, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and the film's stars opened up about the sequel.

Apple News is getting its first ever editor in chief. Lauren Kern will leave her role as executive editor of New York Magazine on June 2nd for the Cupertino-based company, New York Magazine Editor-in-Chief Adam Moss announced on Wednesday in a staff memo obtained by CNN. "I am not happy to report that we are losing our beloved Lauren Kern to the Apple corporation," Moss wrote. "I mean, I'm happy for Lauren certainly. It's an exciting opportunity to be the editor in chief of Apple News, to bring a journalistic vigor and intelligence to an operation that has always seemed to me so full of promise." The news was first reported on Thursday morning by Politico. An Apple spokesperson confirmed the news to CNN, but declined to offer further details on what Kern's role will entail and whether the job will based in the company's California headquarters. Apple News is a mobile news aggregation app which launched in the summer of 2015. The app draws in stories from various news partners and personalizes the front page to fit the user's interests. Apple News' partners include CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and others. "Apple has the audience -- all they needed was a superior editorial intelligence to guide it," Moss wrote in his memo. "They recognized that that person was Lauren, and of course we know they are right." Moss praised Kern for the work she has done at New York Magazine, which he said "has been so critical" to its success. "She provided excellent council to me on all sorts of editorial matters, and she was just beginning a new adventure seeding ambitious feature projects across our verticals," he wrote. "There isn't much she can't do. Apple is lucky to have her."

Share this article Share It comes just days after a new video claims to show the upcoming handset in the closest detail yet. Apple's flagship smartphone isn't expected for at least another four months but the clip shows a dummy version based on leaked schematics.   The ten second preview video and schematics show some of the expected features of the final iPhone 8 design.  Apple's flagship smartphone isn't expected for at least another four months but a ten second clip shows a dummy version (pictured) based on leaked schematics. Designer Benjamin Geskin, based in Riga, Latvia, uploaded the sneak preview to YouTube yesterday Designer Benjamin Geskin, based in Riga, Latvia, uploaded the video to YouTube yesterday. He says that the clip shows a dummy display model of the handset created in Chin, based on the schematics. It also contains a number of expected features for the iPhone 8. The sleek black phone is extremely thin and the glass screen area appears to reach to each corner and edge of the front of the phone, in line with rumours of a bezel-less design. The Touch ID button is notably absent from both the front and rear of the display model, following speculation that Apple has worked out a way to embed the technology into the device's screen The rear features a silver oval area which could house the dual-lens 3D camera thought to be a new headline feature of the iPhone 8. The tipster also Tweeted a copy of the schematics, writing a short message on Twitter in which he said: 'Alleged #iPhone8 schematics.' As with the iPhone 7, the schematics seem to show that the iPhone 8 will also not include a headphone socket. Video courtesy of iVenyaWay The eagerly anticipated 10th anniversary edition of iPhone, rumoured to be called Edition, is expected in September. But recent rumours have cast doubt on this time frame. An analyst from Deutsche Bank has released a research note that stated the Cupertino company will not launch its 10th anniversary smartphone in 2017.  The note has pointed at 'key component shortages and technical challenges' as the culprits behind a major delay. The note, which was first reported on by Business Insider, surfaced earlier this month based on a report from ValueWalk. The tipster also Tweeted a copy of the leaked schematics (pictured). The drawings and video show a number of expected features for the iPhone 8 The glass screen area appears to reach to each corner and edge of the front of the phone (left), in line with rumours of a bezel-less design. The rear (right) features a silver oval area which could house the dual-lens 3D camera thought to be a new headline feature IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging  - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area'  - A new 'pure white' model  - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition -Premium model will cost $1,000  'Report suggests no new iPhone 8 this calendar year,' the analysts wrote. 'As we have written in previous [research notes], several supply chain reports have suggested that key component shortages and technical challenges could delay the release of a high-end iPhone 8 device this fall.' 'We believe this report further underscores the uncertainty around the timing of Apple's next- generation iPhone model.'   ValueWalk released insider information it had received from anonymous supply chain sources 'within the critical Foxconn corporation' that packaging materials for the iPhone 8 are not expected to arrive until June – leaving Apple little time to ramp up productions and release a cutting-edge device. However, the sources also revealed that this timeline will allow Apple to release the iPhone 7s line in September. Although sources noted this will send many iOS users into a frenzy, the assured that the tech giant will still 'do something outstanding' in honor of the iPhone's 10-year anniversary. Prior to the disheartening news, the majority of rumours had suggested that the iPhone 8 would simply be late and not cancelled. The eagerly anticipated 10th anniversary edition of iPhone, rumoured to be called Edition, is expected in September. The sleek black dummy phone (pictured) is extremely thin Recent rumours have cast doubt on the anticipated release time frame, potentially delaying it until next year. As with the iPhone 7, the schematics and video seem to show that the iPhone 8 (pictured) will also not include a headphone socket Earlier this month, the Economic Daily News (via Digitimes) had published a report that iOS users would have to wait until October or November to get their new iPhone 8. The delay, much like Deutsche Bank's reason' was said to be caused by technical issues, as suppliers have struggled with the lamination process of the curved OLED panels and adoption of the 3D sensing front-camera technology.    'Technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system may cause the delay of the new iPhone devices,' said the paper. However, Apple has experienced manufacturing issues in the past, so has many other phone makers, but 9to5Mac has shared supporting evidence that suggests this time might be the real deal. A report from March revealed that the Cupertino firm would not start mass production of the so-called iPhone 8 until September.  TIMELINE: TEN YEARS OF IPHONES  2007:  After being unveiled in January, the first iPhone goes on sale amid passionate Apple fan reaction and queues outside retail stores. 2008: On July 11 2008 the second generation iPhone 3G launches, including in a white colour option for the first time.  2009: The iPhone 3GS goes on sale in June, and sales for the year reach more than 25 million. 2010: The introduction of the iPhone 4 includes the first major redesign of the iPhone.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

India! (AAPL) Recent Posts: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) Stock Is the Best of a Bad Breed 8 Dangerous Dividend Stocks That Could Cut or Kill Their Payouts Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can’t Rely on Any Real Help From China View All Posts After years of only achieving minimal traction in the country, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally appears to be making headway in India … a market that sports 1.3 billion consumers who collectively spend $13.9 billion on smartphones, most of which aren’t (yet) iPhones. Better still for owners of AAPL stock, India is in the midst of entering its next era of consumerism, with GDP growth rates persistently around 7%. Spending power is on the rise for a wide swath of its population, two-thirds of which are under the age of 35. That’s Apple’s prime demographic. Source: iphonedigital via Flickr It couldn’t be happening at a more fortuitous time either. See, while Apple is doing well enough in North America and Europe, it continues to slip in China … a market once hailed as the company’s panacea. Though some onlookers are confident the company can turn things around there too, few can afford to be too hopeful. Function Over Label at Apple While Apple’s fiscal second quarter (calendar Q1) report divulged some key details about how the company was faring in China, and elsewhere, it wasn’t a complete look at the situation. Namely, the company’s quarterly filings don’t compare it to other smartphone makers. IDC has crunched the numbers, however, and they’re not great. Technology market research outfit IDC estimates that Apple’s market share slumped from 11% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to only 9.2% in the first quarter of this year. That makes it the country’s fourth-biggest player for the all-important smartphone market. Apple’s loss was Huawei’s gain. Ditto for Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), in China and everywhere else too. After an embarrassing string of exploding Galaxy Note 7’s forced the company to recall all of them last year — taking a huge toll on its results and market share — it reclaimed its market share lead during the first quarter of 2017. Sales in China are a key part of that recovery. Huawei gained global market share in Q1 as well. The shifting market share has, or at least should have, AAPL stock holders asking questions, not the least of which is what these other manufacturers are doing that’s so compelling. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz believes he has his finger on the pulse of this shift, explaining after talking with smartphone makers in China and Taiwan: “There was general consensus among our conversations that confirms our thesis that Apple’s dwindling market share in Greater China is due to the lack of compelling differentiation among hardware and software. The mobile user experience in China is heavily dictated by Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and other local internet companies, making Apple’s software and services ineffective as key differentiators.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/05/apple-inc-aapl-stock-real-help-china/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 8 Dividend Stocks That Could Cut or Kill Their Payouts 7 F-Rated Stocks to Abandon Immediately 4 Technology Stocks to Buy Before They Ride AI to the Sky 3 Top Aerospace & Defense ETF Picks 7 Sports Stocks Everyone Knows — 4 Winners, 3 Losers 10 High-Tech Graduation Gifts for 2017 ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Editor's Picks 8 Dangerous Dividend Stocks That Could Cut or Kill Their Payouts 7 F-Rated Stocks to Abandon Immediately 4 Tech Stocks to Buy Before They Ride AI to the Sky 7 Sports Stocks Everyone Knows — 4 Winners, 3 Losers 3 Aerospace & Defense ETFs on the Move Most Popular The Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now 10 Hot Stocks That Could Crash 20% or More 10 Best Mutual Funds for Retirement Buy Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock for 35 Cents Now! 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 12 Months of Retirement Income 3 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for a 2017 Breakout Poll of the Day View and vote in our How confident are you about the U.S. economy under President Donald Trump? poll Partners ADVERTISEMENT About Us   ·   Press Center   ·   Resources   ·   Advisory Services   ·   Free Newsletters   ·   Free Reports   ·   Contact Us   ·   Advertise With Us   ·   Employment   ·   Privacy   ·   Terms and Conditions   ·   Disclosures and Disclaimers   ·   Media Sites RSS   ·   Sitemap More On InvestorPlace: Choose A Page About Us Press Center Resources Advisory Services Free Newsletters Free Reports Contact Us Advertise With Us Employment Privacy Terms and Conditions Disclosures and Disclaimers Media Sites Sitemap Financial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services, Inc.

The survey asked 83,000 respondents about their customer satisfaction when it came to laptop performance. Apple took home the top spot, with the most reliable computers and the best tech support. Apple’s computers had the lowest “broken or not working as well” percentage, at 17 percent. Samsung ranked at 27 percent, Dell at 29 percent, HP at 30 percent, Lenovo at 31 percent and Asus in dead last at 33 percent. “I can tell you that Apple regularly performs at the top of Consumer Reports’ reliability surveys,” Consumer Reports spokesperson Doug Love told CNBC Friday. The survey also ranked Apple’s desktop as the best performers, with a 15 percent “broken or not working as well” rate. Lenovo came in second at 24 percent, Samsung with 25 percent, Dell and HP at 27 percent and Asus, again in last, at 29 percent. Apple was also rated the best in customer service and tech support, with an average score of 82 or “very satisfied.” Microsoft came in second with a rating of 68 or “fairly-well satisfied.” Though Consumer Reports’ survey gave Apple top marks across the board, a survey released by J.D. Power in April revealed that customers were not as satisfied with the company’s tablets. Customers said Microsoft’s Surface outranked Apple’s iPad in terms of internet connectivity, availability of official accessories, variety of pre-installed applications, attractiveness, quality of materials and size. “The Microsoft Surface platform has expanded what tablets can do and it sets the bar for customer satisfaction,” J.D. Power’s vice president of service industry, Jeff Conklin, said in an April press release. “These tablet devices are just as capable as many laptops, yet they can still function as standard tablets. This versatility is central to their appeal and success.” Despite the results of that survey, Apple still dominated the market in tablet sales. The company has continued to report strong sales, particularly when it comes to iPhones. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for the iPhone 7 Plus,” CEO Tim Cook said in a May press release. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.” Apple laptops are seen inside a store in London, England, Oct. 13, 2016.

It is believed Apple will be able to embed the sensor in the phone's display - but leave it invisible to the user. Scroll down for video Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company revealed the lack of a home button on the redesigned OLED iPhone, owing to Apple's use of 'an optical fingerprint sensor'  IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging   - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) models with a wraparound OLED screen - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass or on the back  - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition -Premium model could cost $1,000 'Apple has successfully finalized a solution to integrate Touch ID fingerprint recognition directly into the display of its upcoming 'iPhone 8', according to a new report on Friday,' Macrumours claims. Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) said it spoke to sources from Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), who confirmed Apple's achievement during a technology convention held in Taipei on Thursday. Among several design changes TSMC reportedly discussed at the TSMC 2017 NA Technology Symposium was the lack of a home button on the redesigned OLED iPhone, owing to Apple's use of 'an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen' in the absence of a physical Home button. In addition to the fingerprint recognition, the sources claimed the new iPhones will also come with 'invisible infrared image sensors to enhance the functionality of the high-pixel camera' and to enable augmented reality functions. Just last week an image of a PowerPoint slide has revealed the Touch ID could be placed on the back, just underneath the Apple logo.  The image was posted to Slashleaks, which highlights a slide from a PowerPoint presentation dating back to March 3, Apple Insider reported.

Share this article Share 23 shares Also shown in the pictures is the camera setup, which shows a vertical camera orientation with the flash underneath the modular – there is a small circle underneath the camera area. These details coincide with a leak from March 29th of an image claiming to be 'a late stage iPhone 8 prototype', which showed the home button also on the back and underneath the Apple logo. If these reports are true, this method could allow the firm to add facial recognition to the device. An image of a PowerPoint presentation has revealed the Touch ID could be placed on the back, just underneath the Apple logo - putting to rest the many rumors that said it would be under the display The 'prototype' image was obtained by iDropNews 'from a source with intimate knowledge of Apple's manufacturing facility'. The anonymous source from Foxconn noted that other leaks floating around the web do look similar to the final product, but with a few exceptions.. Although you will have to pick up the phone to access it – the new setup is believed to accommodate the addition of facial recognition technology. The reposition of the Touch ID is mainly to make room for the edge-to-edge screen and other cutting edge components. But with all of the technology packed in to the small computer, users should expect to pay a hefty price. The image was posted to Slashleaks, which highlights a slide from a PowerPoint presentation dating back to March 3. These details coincide with a leak from March 29th (pictured) of an image claiming to be 'a late stage iPhone 8 prototype' - i shows the home button on the back A research note shared by a Goldman Sachs analyst this month had suggested that the 256GB iPhone 8 will cost consumers $1,099. The note had also stated that the smartphone will boast an OLED display, 3D sensors and augmented reality technologies. Regarding Apple's highly anticipated next generation phone was revealed to CNBC by Simona Jankowski. The reposition of the Touch ID is mainly to make room for the edge-to-edge screen and other cutting edge components  in the iPhone 8(artist impression) LARGER BATTERY  Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has revealed that Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8.  Kuo explained that it will be designed with a 2,700 mAh battery - putting its battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus.  Another feature rumored to appear in Apple's next iPhone is a larger 'L' shaped battery (middle', which would put battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus Will use a 'substrate-like PCB mainboard', which will allow the firm to implement an OLED display in the flagship handset.  The new components are believed to be much more expensive in anything used in an iPhone before, which could increase manufacturing costs by 80 percent.  However, it was revealed last week that iOS users should expect to pay a hefty price tag for their next iPhone. 'The first $1,000 iPhone can drive meaningful upside,' Jankowski wrote in a note to clients Thursday. 'The bottom line is that we are raising our FY18/19 EPS estimates further above consensus 'We think the higher demand for the larger (5.8″) form factor will be supported by the fact that the iPhone 8 will have compelling new features not available in the smaller form factors,' she wrote. She predicted that the 128GB will go for $999, but the 256GB will boast a $1,099 price tag – Apple's most expensive iPhone, the 128GB iPhone 7, is only $749. 'We think the higher demand for the larger (5.8') form factor will be supported by the fact that the iPhone 8 will have compelling new features not available in the smaller form factors,' Jankowski wrote. 'The production level of development on various models are being done such as the models with IPS TFT, AMOLED, the model with or without home button, in addition to the models with a new glass, aluminum chassis, white ceramics etc.' However, the report also noted that Apple has decided on a few features, which includes a 5-inch display, dual-cameras and wireless charging capabilities.   Read more: ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿iPhone Edition¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ | Rumor | Mac ...

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → Thinking About Shared iCloud Photo Libraries  May 26, 2017 ⌘ Permalink I had a very rocky experience with iCloud Photo Library in late 2015: I imported my photos and uploaded my 70GB photo library to iCloud. Everything went very smoothly, so I turned on iCloud Photo Library on my iPad. Aaaaaand it all exploded. Apple Support eventually got me up and running, but it took a while for me to fully trust the system. The reality is that iCloud Photo Library is pretty great when everything is working smoothly.1 Photos show up on my devices quickly, regardless if I snapped them with my iPhone or imported them from an SD card on my iMac. My wife has been using is for as long as I have, and she also enjoys the service. We’re both paying iCloud customers at this point, but like every other family using iCloud Photo Library, our sharing system is a bit of a mess. If I take photos on my “nice camera,” I’ll import the RAW files to my iMac, edit them, then import them into both of our libraries. If either of have an iPhone photo we want to share, we AirDrop it, as Shared Photo Streams downsize images and video: iCloud Photo Sharing supports JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and MP4, as well as special formats you capture with your iPhone, like slo-mo, time-lapse, 4K videos, and Live Photos. You can even share your Memory videos. When shared, photos taken with standard point-and-shoot cameras, SLR cameras, or iOS devices have up to 2048 pixels on the long edge. Panoramic photos can be up to 5400 pixels wide. iCloud Photo Sharing supports both MP4 and QuickTime video file types, and H.264 and MPEG-4 Video file formats. Videos can be up to five minutes in length and are delivered at up to 720p resolution. All of this leads to a lot of duplication between our libraries. Google recently introduced powerful new sharing tools, and as the guys on ATP spoke about this week, its time Apple step up to the plate with something new. Here’s Jason Snell on the subject: My wife and I have wanted to pool our photo libraries for ages now—the alternative is for me to occasionally plug her iPhone into my Mac and import her photos, and for her to ask me to AirDrop photos I’ve taken to her when she wants to post them to Facebook. Google Photos will allow that now—and Apple needs to follow suit. But, you’re saying to yourself, what if you want to share some but not all photos with a partner? Google’s announcement takes this extra step, letting you specify that certain sorts of photos—for example, photos of specific people—be shared, while others aren’t. While offering an all-or-nothing library sharing feature would be nice, it’s even better if sharing can have some granularity. Google’s headed there now. Will Apple follow? In thinking about how Apple could add family sharing to iCloud Photo Library, two types of solutions come to mind. Common Library In this world, Apple would have a way to have multiple iCloud accounts have access to one big, centralized common photo library. Users — let’s say a married couple — could both go in, create albums, make edits and more. Both people would have full read/write access to the library. There are issues with this, of course. Would individuals have their own iCloud Photo Libraries and access to the big shared one? How would Photos.app display this? I think this sort of thing could be confusing, and I bet people would end up with photos in the wrong library pretty easily. If users didn’t have their own personal libraries, I think many would be frustrated and sharing every single photo and screenshot they take. In short, I don’t think a big, shared library is the way to go. Library Access This solution is what I would prefer. In it, my wife and I would continue to have our own libraries, tied to our own iCloud accounts, just like we do today. However, we would be able to add each other as viewers to our libraries. Once access has been granted, her library would show up in the top-level of Photos.app as do things like People, Places, Videos, etc. I could tap her library to see all of her content, including albums, collections, etc. If I were to see something I wanted to add to my library, I could select it and tap “Add to My Library.” Doing so would prompt iCloud to add a full-resolution copy of that file to my personal library. In this world, she would not be able to edit anything in my library, but pull any content from it she wants in hers. This would not take care of the duplication issue, but would be less confusing than having one big library. WWDC is Coming Last year, Photos.app and iCloud Photo Library saw a lot of love, but Apple needs to keep its foot on the gas to stay competitive in this space. I hope they do just that on June 5. It’s still not perfect; I recently had a whole bunch of photos adopt the same description. After some back and forth with Apple, my radar was marked as a duplicate and closed. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Become a Member I've been writing here for almost nine years, but the next decade of 512 Pixels requires your support.     Why is the site gray?

STAT Kate Sheridan 16 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Countries spending the most on war 10 cities where the housing crash still looms largest In March 2015, Apple promised to change the way medical research could be done. They launched ResearchKit, which could turn millions of iPhones around the world into a “powerful tool for medical research,” the company said at the time. Popular Searches UniFirst Corp UNF ▼ 139.75 -0.15 -0.11% Since then, ResearchKit — software that gives would-be app developers a library of coding to create health apps on the iPhone and Apple Watch — has spawned a number of studies: One team has used it to create an app to track Parkinson’s symptoms; another is trying out a screening protocol for autism. A third helps people inventory the moles on their skin and evaluate how they have changed over time. Many of these apps have been downloaded tens of thousands of times, benefitting from Apple’s own huge scale. “Virtually overnight, the research studies that we launched became some of the largest in history,” said Jeff Williams, then Apple’s senior vice president of operations, at an Apple event in March 2016. But much of the early research scientists were doing with ResearchKit wasn’t clinical in nature; rather it simply studied the feasibility of using mobile apps to collect health data. Now, however, ResearchKit seems to be on the verge of becoming medically useful. In recent months scientists have published new data on seizures, asthma attacks, and heart disease using the platform. And scientists are already looking ahead to the next milestone for the technology: Hacking our ubiquitous mobile devices to become potentially lifesaving medical monitors. Studying — and soon, predicting — seizures For epilepsy patients and their doctors, precise answers to standard questions can be hard to get. For example: how many seizures happened in the last month? How many doses of epilepsy medication were skipped? Some patients try to remember, others keep journals or charts; those in a recent Johns Hopkins study were the first to use a ResearchKit app to do so — while also sending the numbers to Dr. Gregory Krauss and his colleagues to help them study seizures as a whole. For the past two years, Krauss has collected data from participants before, after — and even during — seizures. If the users think they’re about to have a seizure, they can open the app on their watch and begin tests to measures their memory along with their state of awareness; if they stop responding to the test, they’re presumed to have lost awareness until they start responding again. That data is coupled with heart rate and accelerometer data. The team’s results were the first to use surveys taken immediately after seizures to document epilepsy triggers — a feat that would have been impossible with previous research methods. Sleepless nights, missed medication doses, and stress were all found to contribute to likelihood of seizure, according to data presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting on April 27. Researchers plan to soon submit the data for peer-reviewed publication and join just a handful of other ResearchKit teams who have published. Load Error Read more:Technology companies are racing to track patients’ behavior in real time And Krauss and his team are already working on the ambitious next stage of their research. They’ve begun analyzing the data they’ve collected to create a seizure detector that aims to warn participants before the terrifying — and potentially dangerous — event sets in. The EpiWatch app, running in the background on a smartwatch, would use physiological data to detect a seizure and alert its wearer. That could be a huge deal for people who have epilepsy, as Shaina Mims described in Apple’s promotional video. Mims said she worried about having a seizure while driving — but a seizure detector could allow her or her loved ones to ensure that she’s in a safe place before a seizure hits. Krauss says the detection function could be available to users of the app by autumn 2017.© Provided by Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC ReseachKit Apple Senior Vice President of Operations Jeff Williams announces ResearchKit on stage during an Apple special event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. (Stephen Lam/Getty Images) Research showing results Meanwhile, other studies using the ResearchKit software are increasingly making their way through publication and adding to the scientific literature. The MyHeart Counts app, for instance, which studies the impact of physical activity on heart health, published preliminary results in January in JAMA Cardiology. Over 20,000 people sent some data about their movement patterns to researchers through the app and about 4,900 people completed a six-minute walk test, an oft-used measure for fitness. Analyzing the data showed that nearly two-thirds of the participants were stationary for half of their day, and people who were among the least active participants had higher rates of cardiovascular-related illnesses. Another team at Mount Sinai published data from their asthma app in March in Nature Biotechnology. Their findings confirmed that more asthma attacks happen in the summer than in the spring and that air quality plays a role in asthma symptoms. Read more:How Apple, Google, and other tech titans aim to shake up the way we treat disease In both these cases, the size of the samples — and the time it took to recruit them — are pretty unbeatable. “I think it would be very hard to do the research without ResearchKit,” Krauss, the epilepsy researcher, said. “We’re able to study people in a large range of ages and a large number of different types of seizures across the entire US quickly.” So far, his team has analyzed data from nearly 1,000 participants. One segment of Mount Sinai’s study included more than 2,000 people — about as many adults with asthma as the CDC reached during its 2015 National Health Interview Survey. And Mount Sinai professor Pei Wang, a co-author of the asthma study, pointed out, their study could gather data from the same individual over several days; each person only took the CDC’s survey once. A work in progress But despite those advantages, ResearchKit faces two major hurdles — one of which was obvious when it launched, and the other of which has become apparent as data have emerged. Firstly, because participants register from their personal devices, they have to have been able to afford an Apple product, be it a smartphone or a smartwatch. Only half of households making $30,000 or less had access to a smartphone in 2015, according to a Pew report; that survey did not break down the numbers by brand. By default, then, many low-income individuals wouldn’t have access to participate in these research studies. And secondly, research done on ResearchKit may suffer from a broader diversity problem. All of the researchers STAT spoke to said they were satisfied with their sample populations but noted that some “techie” cities and regions — looking at you, San Francisco — had a particularly high number of participants. Though the asthma study had about the same geographic distribution of survey respondents as the CDC’s, its cohort was younger, wealthier, more educated, and more male. The sample was also less ethnically diverse. Only 5 percent of the study’s participants were black; according to CDC asthma prevalence data, about 14 percent of all adults with asthma are black. This sampling problem has a few possible solutions. Mobile device prices might get cheaper. More groups might step up to donate devices for research participants to use. Or, developers could just make the apps work on more and different devices. That last approach is being actively pursued by programmers who are collaborating on the development of a ResearchKit-style platform for Android called ResearchStack. In theory, researchers who have already created a ResearchKit-based app could begin developing an Android app using that software today. In practice, however, it’s not a simple leap. Dario Salvi, a postdoc at the University of Oxford, has spent many hours building a MyHeart Counts app for Android, partly because the ResearchStack software is still not very user-friendly. Expanding to Android might do more than just widen the pool of people able to participate in studies — it could also expand the types of data researchers could collect. “The Android operating system allows researchers to easily get access to information about how people are using their phones,” said Lara Mangravite, the president of Sage Bionetworks — including, if the user consents, call logs and internet use data. The latter could be harnessed in surprising ways. For instance, Mangravite says, since people read on their smartphones in the bathroom, combining internet use data along with GPS information might help an algorithm predict when someone is having a flare of irritable bowel syndrome. For his part, Krauss won’t be waiting for ResearchStack to move forward with his work. A system that he could use on Android is a few years away, he said, especially given the technical requirements his study demands of watch-like wearables. “I think the advantage of working with ResearchKit is that it’s up and going and also I think the Apple Watch is particularly sophisticated now compared to other products,” Krauss said. “Eventually, I think [other watches will] all be able to collect biosensor data, have a user interface and support this kind of activity. But the Apple Watch, we can use it to do that right now.”© Stephen Lam/Getty Images iPhone Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Facebook Here’s Why Facebook Is Helping Google and Apple With Instant Articles Mathew Ingram May 26, 2017 If there's one thing you can usually count on with Facebook, it's that any new feature it introduces will be designed primarily to benefit Facebook—in most cases to get users to spend more time inside the company's walled garden. That's why an announcement Facebook made on Thursday is unusual. The company said it would open the technology behind its mobile-focused Instant Articles feature so that it works with similar competing services offered by Google and Apple. With one step, publishers will now be able to use a Facebook software tool to produce articles that fit the Facebook Instant Articles standard, and also comply with Google's competing AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) standard, Support for the Apple News format is coming soon, the company said. This doesn't mean Google or Apple will get any more access to Facebook's platform than they would have before. But it does represent a kind of truce in the mobile news war, and in that sense it is a tacit admission of failure. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. By supporting Google and Apple's technologies, Facebook is essentially admitting that Instant Articles by itself wasn't enough to entice publishers. For the past two years or so, ever since it launched Instant Articles as a limited trial with partners like the New York Times (and Time Inc., which owns Fortune), the social network has been trying to get media companies to adopt it. In a nutshell, the feature takes articles that have been formatted for the web and strips them down to make them load more quickly in a mobile browser. Initially, this was an appealing idea for many publishers, which either didn't have the financial resources or the skills to make their stories load faster in mobile browsers. But at the same time, it was a problematic deal in many ways. Facebook offered anyone who participated in the program 70% of the revenue from ads that Facebook was able to sell, or 100% of the revenue from ads they sold themselves. But this revenue didn't exactly start pouring in. The company made a number of tweaks to try and improve the situation, but it didn't really move the needle for many media companies, especially since one of the main ways Facebook sped up the loading of pages was by blocking certain types of ads. In addition to that, some publishers were leery of giving Facebook even more control over their content. The giant social network already accounts for a huge amount of the traffic that many media outlets get from the web, and uses its algorithm to control who sees their content and when. Some, like the Washington Post, jumped in with both feet, but others—including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and ESPN—balked. Even the New York Times, a launch partner, eventually stopped participating in Instant Articles, and so did The Guardian (which also pulled out of Apple News). In part, that's because both papers were focusing on their digital subscriptions and membership programs, and Instant Articles wasn't really helping. Many publishers seem to be more interested in Google's AMP standard, which is more open than Facebook's. Although the search giant is in charge of the technology, it is an open-source project that makes its code public and theoretically allows anyone to take part in developing it. There are still concerns on the part of some media companies that Google has too much control over AMP, and that it is interested primarily in promoting its own advertising networks and technologies, but AMP still seems to have gotten more uptake than Instant Articles. It also supports subscriptions and paywalls, which Instant Articles doesn't. Apple News, meanwhile, got off to a slow start, with many publishers seeing extremely low traffic from articles they formatted for the service. But more recently there is evidence that some sites are seeing improved traffic from their Apple News articles. Apple also recently hired a managing editor for Apple News, a position that didn't exist before, which suggests that it might be looking to beef up the service and possibly even expand it.

(He instead attended Newcastle Polytechnic.) He is not expected to cut back on any of his duties at Apple, where he helped influenced the architecture of the new Apple Park campus. “I am thrilled to formalise my relationship with the RCA, given the profound influence the College has had on so many of the artists and designers that I admire," Ive said in a statement released Thursday by the college. “Our design team includes many RCA alumni, who embody the fundamental values of the College. I look forward to advising both the College and students, hoping that my experience proves useful in their work.” According to the release, Ive joins the RCA at “a critical point in its evolution into a dynamic, STEAM-focused postgraduate university, expanding its research and knowledge exchange centres into the domains of computer and materials science, the impact of the digital economy, advanced manufacturing and intelligent mobility.” Among his responsibilities, Ive will advise the school on the construction of a new building at Battersea, scheduled to open in 2020. Ive holds over 5,000 patents and received an honorary doctorate from the RCA in 2009. He also holds honorary doctorates from both Oxford and Cambridge Universities.

At its Worldwide Developer Conference -- which confers between June 5-9 -- Apple is expected to announce a broad refresh of its MacBook line, including the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook, Rhoda Alexander, an analyst at market researcher IHS Markit, told Fox News. Alexander’s projection comports with a recent Bloomberg report, which says that Apple plans to update its MacBooks at the June conference. Catching up to Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Dell The updates are expected to bring the MacBook line up to speed with Windows laptops by adopting Intel’s newest 7th Generation “Kaby Lake” processor, which can deliver better performance while extending battery life. Apple, which redesigned its MacBook Pro laptop last October, use Intel's Skylake processor. The 12-inch MacBook, which was updated in spring 2016, also uses the Skylake processor, known in the marketplace as a sixth generation processor. Meanwhile, many of the newest laptop models from HP, Dell and Microsoft have adopted Intel’s latest 7th Generation Core processor. Microsoft recently announced the Surface Laptop – which will go on sale June 15 – with Intel’s 7th Gen processor. Microsoft claims that its first laptop can deliver “up to 14.5 hours video playback” on battery. The updated 13-inch MacBook Pro will use a new low-power version of Intel’s latest chip while the 15-inch model will get an updated quad-core processor, designated "Kaby Lake H," according to Alexander. The 2-pound, 12-inch MacBook will get an ultra-low-power version of the Kaby Lake chip, Alexander added. Apple could not be reached for comment for this story. Pricing is expected to remain largley the same with past models. The 12-inch MacBook starts at $1,299, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro (non-Touch-Bar) starts at $1,499 and the 15-incher at $2,399. Retailers typically discount outgoing models when a refresh happens.  Wither MacBook Air? It is “unclear” if the venerable MacBook Air will see an update in June, Alexander said. Bloomberg said that Apple “has…considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air” but offered no clarity beyond that. Despite its old design, the MacBook Air, whcih starts at $999, has remained popular with consumers. iPad could also see updates It’s possible that Apple also update its iPads along with the MacBooks, Alexander said. The 10.5 inch iPad “is in production now [and] there's a new 12.9 inch model coming as well,” she said on Wednesday, revising an earlier forecast that saw the iPad updates coming later this year. If accurate, the 10.5-inch model would be the first iPad with that screen size. Currently, the iPad is offered in 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch sizes.

More than 20 people - several of them students - were spotted hanging around outside the store on Friday evening, even though security personnel were overheard telling people to “please go home” and to come back at 10am the next day. Fans of Apple told Channel NewsAsia that they were ready to camp overnight (Photo: Howard Law) Some told Channel NewsAsia they have been waiting as early 5pm. Some literally went the extra mile, having flown in from abroad to check out Apple’s first brick-and-mortar retail store in Southeast Asia. ”We are all prepared and ready to camp out here with snacks and drinks,” said Sariddej, who flew in specially with a friend from Thailand and another from Laos for the opening. “We are big fans of Apple,” he said, showing off an Apple logo tee and iPhone and iPod tattoos.

Peter, from China, who was first in line, said he is “really excited” for the launch. Armed with a foldable chair, he said he planned to camp out overnight. “Attending events like this for me is pretty meaningful. I have been to many Apple Store openings in China and this is my first time attending an Apple Store opening in another country. “Normally for an Apple Store opening, they will give out merchandise like T-shirts and playing cards, so I hope to get those.” Peter is first in line for the Apple Store opening (Photo: Howard Law) On top of collectors’ items, Apple has more in store for opening day, including a performance by Singapore Idol 3 winner Sezairi Sezali as well as photo walks with photographer Aik Beng Chia.

Yesterday AAPL: 153.61 -0.26 Tips for working out with Apple Watch Zac Hall - May. 26th 2017 8:51 am PT @apollozac Apple Watch View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple Watch is an excellent fitness tracker and has proved to be an effective workout coach for me personally. If you want to get outside more over the three-day weekend or just use your Apple Watch in new ways for the first time, read along for a few of my favorite tips for working out with Apple Watch. Sony A6500 Hey Siri, start an outdoor walk Starting a workout session from Apple Watch with your voice using Siri is the easiest way to get up and go without much effort. You can activate Siri on Apple Watch by holding down the Digital Crown on the side, or just raise your wrist and say “Hey Siri” when the display is on to activate it. Siri can start specific workouts like a timed outdoor run or a specific distance outdoor walk by saying “Hey Siri, start a 30 minute outdoor run” or “Hey Siri, start a 2 mile outdoor walk.” If you just tell Siri to start a specific workout without specifying a time, distance, or calorie goal, Apple Watch will just start that workout session with an open goal too. Log your workouts to get full credit Using Siri is one of the easiest ways to start a workout, but why should you even take that step? Apple Watch is an all-day activity tracker after all, right? Starting a specific workout actually keeps the heart rate sensor fired up so you get precise measurements for the duration of your activity, and specifying which activity you’re doing helps Apple Watch know how to measure your movements. Apple Watch can more accurately measure your activity if it knows that you’re using the elliptical or running on a treadmill versus outdoors. For outdoor activities including swimming and cycling, Apple Watch will even use GPS data when available to map distance and movement more accurately. Should you bring your iPhone? Apple Watch Series 2 features a built-in GPS for accurately tracking outdoor running, walking, cycling, and swimming, but you can use GPS to accurately track outdoor runs, walks, and bike rides on the first-gen Apple Watch and Apple Watch Series 1 as well. Just bring your iPhone and Apple Watch will rely on its GPS for location tracking. Even Apple Watch Series 2 falls back to the iPhone GPS when tracking an outdoor workout when present. Personally, I enjoy outdoor runs with just my Apple Watch Series 2 and not my iPhone for the most focused experience, but for now that means no access to phone calls and text messages with no cellular connection. Save battery on long workouts Apple Watch battery life will usually get you through about a day and a half before you need to recharge, but firing up the heart rate monitor for an extended period of time can be a big hit to battery percentage. Apple offers two options for extending battery life on long workouts. The first option is to use Workout Power Saving Mode, but Apple notes that this will make tracking how many calories you’re burning less accurate. This mode disables the heart rate sensor for walking and running workouts to preserve battery. You can find this option in the Watch app on iPhone from the My Watch tab under General → Workout Power Saving Mode. The other option is to pair a dedicated Bluetooth heart rate sensor to Apple Watch. This offloads heart rate data collection to the external sensor so Apple Watch doesn’t have to fire its sensor up during the workout. The downside is cost and convenience. I occasionally use the Polar H7 Bluetooth Heart Rate Sensor which goes for around $55, but I generally just start a workout with Apple Watch alone for the convenience. You can pair a Bluetooth heart rate sensor by going to Settings → Bluetooth → Health Devices on Apple Watch. Bring your music along You don’t have to think much about how to bring your music along if you workout with your iPhone nearby, but the same isn’t true for Apple Watch. You can sync music from iTunes or Apple Music to Apple Watch for offline playback, but you’ll probably want to plan ahead the night before for the best experience. Syncing music to Apple Watch takes several steps which I’ve detailed here, but playback is easy once you sync a playlist full of songs to your Apple Watch. Once you have your music synced to Apple Watch, the most important thing to remember is that you’ll need wireless headphones. Any Bluetooth earphones will pair to Apple Watch and enable music playback without iPhone. Personally, I use Apple AirPods for music playback on my outdoor runs but stock is still backordered 6 weeks for new customers. BeatsX wireless in-ear headphones have the same benefits of instant pairing and go for $149.95 which is $10 less than AirPods. Powerbeats3 wireless in-ear headphones also feature instant pairing to Apple Watch and usually retail for $199.95 or less. Prior to AirPods, I used a pair of Bluetooth earphones called JAM Transit that retail for $39.99 and currently go for $21.73 for Amazon Prime members. Two more tips for music playback during workouts: you can adjust the volume by spinning the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch when the Music app is open, and you can double-click to jump between the current and previous app on Apple Watch to quickly go from Workout to Music during an exercise. Customize your metrics You can also personalize which metrics Apple Watch shows you for specific workouts. Open the Watch app on iPhone, then go to Workout → Workout View to find plenty of options for customizing which metrics are displayed during a session. You can customize metrics for each available activity and even pick between displaying each metric or only a single metric which can be changed from the Digital Crown during a workout. A lot of my workouts involve trying to hit a calorie goal so I typically make sure calories are displayed for each workout. You can use third-party apps, too You don’t have to use Apple’s Workout app to track your activity on Apple Watch. I log all my running activity with Nike+ Run Club which works similar to Apple’s run tracking capabilities in the Workout app but includes the NRC community as well. Strava, Runkeeper, and MapMyRun are other examples of popular fitness tracking apps that work with the Apple Watch. You can find more workout apps from the Watch app on iPhone under the App Store tab within the Health & Fitness category. Several apps will even let you start sessions with Siri just like Apple’s Workout app. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple Watch tips!

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Honor 8 Pro A hugely powerful device, without the mega price tag. By Michael Moore Review  Shares Our Verdict The Honor 8 Pro combines high-end hardware with a smooth and polished design. It's easy to use and will comfortably last all day, but is lacking that little bit of sparkle that could tie it all together. Pros Polished design Great battery life Powerful hardware Affordable price Cons Poor availability Annoying EMUI software Lack of killer feature The Honor 8 Pro is the latest premium smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer, best known as a offshoot of tech titan Huawei. The company has grown hugely in the past few years as it looks to offer customers an alternative to the typical Apple or Samsung handsets, offering powerful hardware at a more affordable price. On sale now for £474.99 from the company's own Vmall online marketplace, the Honor 8 Pro looks to be the biggest challenger yet. Building on a number of past handset releases, the Honor 8 Pro is targeting the premium end of the smartphone market, but with a price tag that's slightly less than you'd pay for an iPhone, Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy S8. The design Despite its aim of taking on the likes of the top Android devices from Samsung, HTC or Sony, at first glance it's hard to spot anything too striking with the Honor 8 Pro. Featuring a rounded metal and glass body that bears more than a passing resemblence to Apple's top device, the Honor 8 Pro is comfortable to hold, but its slimline build (at just 7mm across) can mean that it sometimes feels a bit slippery, which isn't ideal if you're heading somewhere fast. The 5.7 inch LCD touchscreen display offers a widescreen experience, with the screen stretching across the whole face, however there are some rather chunky bezels at the top and bottom of the screen. There's a 3.5mm headphone jack in the bottom left corner on the device, which may make listening to music or making hands-free calls a bit tricky if you normally carry your phone around in your pocket. The rear of the Honor 8 Pro is beautifully uncluttered, with just the fingerprint sensor near the top of the rear panel, as the dual-lens camera is moved up to the top-left hand corner. Admittedly, the fingerprint reader is a tad small, meaning you may struggle to unlock it first-try when initially using the device, but it does come with a couple of handy feature, such as the ability to answer calls, take a photo, or stop alarms with just a touch. The hardware One of the most impressive aspects of the Honor 8 Pro is just how much has been squeezed into the device. The Honor 8 Pro is powered by Huawei's own Kirin 960, which isn't as powerful as the top-end chips from Apple and Qualcomm, but runs them both pretty close. There's a choice between 4 or 6GB of RAM, backed up with 64GB of storage, meaning that for the price you're paying there's a lot of power within. Charging is done via USB-C, with the Honor 8 Pro boasting a huge 4,000mAh battery, which is easily enough for all-day usage. Our tests found that the phone lasted over a day, despite heavy usage of web surfing, social media and watching video. It's an incredible battery for a device so slim, and definitely stands out as one of the Honor 8 Pro's key features. On the rear, there's a dual-12MP rear camera, f/2.2, phase detection and laser autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash However the Honor 8 Pro doesn't benefit from Huawei's partnership with iconic camera maker Leica, which has seen the likes of the Huawei Mate 9 and Huawei P10 sport boosted sensors, meaning that photos are good, but not spectacular. The experience If you've ever used an Android smartphone before, you'll immediately be comfortable with the Honor 8 Pro - but if you've ever used another Huawei or Honor device, you'll be speeding along. The device is powered by Android 7.0 Nougat, meaning all the usual apps and services are present - with the notable exception of the Google Assistant. However once again, Huawei has overlaid its own EMUI 5.1 interface on top of this. This allows for a bit more personalisation, with a whole range of custom services and tools, but as with past devices, also loads the Honor 8 Pro with unneccesaary bloatware. It's a real shame, as Huawei seems to have learnt little from past criticism. Asides from these quibbles though, the Honor 8 Pro is a breeze to use. The phone is quick to boot up and get ready, with navigation through app menus slick and speedy too. Verdict So is the Honor 8 Pro worth your money over an iPhone or Galaxy S8? The device has a lot to recommend it for, bringing together a polished design, slick hardware and a huge battery life - all of which make this pretty attractive prospect. However there just seems to be something lacking - a killer feature, or USP - which stops us just short of giving it a top rating. The Honor 8 Pro is missing a certain something, maybe to give it a bit more shine, or refinement - something that would help set it apart. Make no mistake, this is by far and away the best Honor smartphone yet - but if you're looking for a powerful, long-lasting work phone, it's probably best sticking to the big brands for the time being. The Verdict 4 out of 5 Honor 8 Pro The Honor 8 Pro combines high-end hardware with a smooth and polished design. It's easy to use and will comfortably last all day, but is lacking that little bit of sparkle that could tie it all together.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Five apps Donald Trump should have on his iPhone besides Twitter There are over 2 million apps on the iOS Store, please consider these Mr President. By Oliver Cragg Updated May 26, 2017 16:57 BST Close In a related video: Donald Trump's weirdest habits IBTimes UK In 2008, Apple introduced the world to the App Store - an iOS storefront for its first generation iPhone that opened the doors to thousands of applications and forever changed the way people interact with their smartphones. The App Store now boasts over 2 million apps and counting, spanning everything from banking, games, social media, education, news, music and so much more. Imagine, then, being so transfixed by, and obsessed with, a singular app and never sampling the myriad delights within Apple's digital store. It's unthinkable. Yet according to a number of reports, US president Donald Trump is exactly that kind of person with only one app on his smartphone. The app? Twitter, of course - the White House head honcho's social podium where the former business mogul blurts out self-aggrandising rhetoric on a variety of invariably controversial subjects, or brands US media outlets "fake news" ad nauseum. Perhaps Trump is still smarting from leaving behind his Candy Crush Saga progress after ditching his aging, unsecured Android phone in favour of his current Secret Service-approved device in March. Who knows. Whatever the reason, the unverified claim that Trump has shunned all other apps is a blight on his mobile device of (forced) choice. With that in mind, here are five apps President Trump should download immediately: Merriam-Webster Dictionary - Free "I have the best words," Trump famously said. Here are five of them: Bigly Unpresidented Euphenism Yuge Schlonged These are not words recognised by any dictionary aside from the "Urban" kind. Perhaps "America's most useful and respected dictionary" can help the US president correct and potentially expand his bizarre vocabulary. CNN: Breaking US & World News - Free Based on Trump's tweets, it's apparent that the US president has something of a soft spot for the right wing news organisation Fox News. CNN, on the other hand, has been a regular source of ire for Trump, with his frequent use of fake news hashtags on Twitter commonly relating to the Time Warner-owned channel's coverage. Framed as a nonpartisan alternative to both the left and right wing-leaning alternatives, Trump could benefit from familiarising himself with CNN's clips, written stories and photo galleries all contained within the channel's official app. The Blu Market / Apple Trump's Wall: Build it Huge - Free Trump's ambition to construct a gigantic US-Mexico border wall has been somewhat scaled back since the Donald's lofty promises on the presidential campaign trail. The estimated $21.6 billion project is now reduced to a $1.5 billion security investment agreed in the recent Congress-approved budget. Thankfully, Trump can live out his barrier building fantasies with Trump's Wall - Build it Huge, a simplistic block stacking game complete with Trump-esque banners. The Weather Channel - Free If we operate under the assumption that Apple's standard Weather application was a victim of Trump's digital cull, then he is in dire need of a replacement. We all know that the 45th President of the United States loves hitting the greens, just a short drive from the Trump family's gold-adorned Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Jetting off to the "Winter White House" for a round of golf only to be greeted by poor weather conditions would be a tragic state of affairs for Trump, and while an aide would no doubt always be on hand to deliver the meteorological outlook, a quick app tap could expedite the process. Sure the liberals will decry the cost the trips have on US taxpayers and the fake news media will question the frequency of said trips, at least Trump will be able to relax knowing he'll be able to top up that tangerine tan in the balmy Florida sun. Donald Trump plays a round of golf after the opening of The Trump International Golf Links Course on 10 July 2012Getty Do Not Press The Red Button - £0.99 This is fairly self-explanatory, but at least there's a mildly entertaining puzzle-lite game underneath the crucial lesson. If Trump holds any lingering curiosity to see what happens by pressing a bright red button, at least this way nothing else suffers aside from maybe a metaphorical cat.

In March, it revealed that it was planning to build a €1 billion data centre campus in Dublin, and just last month it was granted planning permission for the first phase of that project by Fingal County Council. Now however the project has been thrown into doubt by two objectors who this week lodged objections to the planning decision to An Bord Pleanala, with one of those objectors the same man who is attempting to prevent Apple from building its €850 million data centre in Athenry. The first phase of Amazon's plan is building a huge 223,000 square foot data centre in Mulhuddart, which is estimated to cost in the region of €200 million. However the company has said that if all goes well, it could add up to another seven data halls on the 26-hectare site in Mulhuddart, owned by the IDA - potentially costing over €700 million. Despite the huge scale of the operation, Amazon says the project will only generate around 30 full-time jobs. Fingal granted planning permission for the project last month and the e-commerce giant said that it anticipated construction work would begin on the site in mid-2017. The appeal to An Bord Pleanala - which was confirmed to Newstalk by the agency this week - could delay that significantly. David Hughes, an architect, who also submitted an observation on Apple's planned project in Athenry, is one of the objectors. The other is Allan Daly, an environmental consultant based in Athenry, who is currently one of three people taking part in a judicial review of Apple's $850 million data centre project near the Galway village. The reason for Daly's objection? "The primary ground of my appeal is that the developer failed to disclose the electrical power and energy that the data centre will use, which is an impact that requires assessment under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive," Daly said. Daly already sent his observations to Fingal County Council, pointing out that Amazon had failed to reveal the exact amount of power it would require, but the planning authority decided to grant permission anyway. Energy needs Apple did reveal the amount of energy it would use if the entire project was built, which Daly claimed in his initial submission to Galway County Council, would account for 8 percent of the entire national grid. Daly believes that by not revealing how much energy it is using, Amazon is being given the freedom to draw as much energy as it wants. Daly's objections to Apple's planned development follow a similar line. He feels that planners and regulators in Ireland are not putting in place the right guidelines and regulations in relation to data centres. As a result, the explosion in data centres being built and planned in Ireland could end up crippling the country's power grid. Amazon has failed to respond to a request for comment from Newstalk about the possible delay in its data centre project. It is unclear how much of a delay the objections will have on the project. The next step in the process is that An Bord Pleanala sends a copy of the appeal back to Fingal County Council, where it is available for inspection by the public and to any other parties to the appeal. In most cases the Board then appoints an inspector, who will be a qualified planner, to consider the case. Usually the inspector visits the site and take photographs in order to help make their recommendation. The inspector makes a written report to the Board and members then convene to consider the entire file and make a final decision. In particularly complex cases, or developments of significant national or local interest, an oral hearing may be held. This was the case in the Apple data centre project, after which An Bord Pleanala upheld the decision of Galway County Council. Daly however appeal that decision to the Commercial Court, which heard the case in March and is due to mention it again next month. It is unclear when a decision will be made. It is therefore impossible to say with any accuracy how long of a delay these objections will have on the Amazon data centre - but the Apple case can give some clues. When Apple announced plans to build a data centre campus in Athenry in Feburary 2015, it also announced plans to build one in Denmark. While the planned site of Apple's Irish development lies untouched, in Denmark, the first data centre is set to go online in just a few months time. 16:19 26 May 2017 David Gilbert 15 hours ago 3 Related articles Amazon's €1 billion plan for Dublin Apple named world's greenest tech company North Cork's getting a €64m wind farm most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography Met Éireann issues three rainfall warnings for Saturday LOI Round-up: Cork City beat Shamrock Rovers to continue steady march LOI Premier Division Results site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

The original report comes from Chinese-language site Economic Daily News, which claims to have received the information from sources at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of Apple’s key suppliers. TSMC sources apparently confirmed Apple’s achievement during a technology convention earlier this week in Taipei. At the symposium, TSMC reportedly discussed the lack of a home button on the redesigned OLED iPhone, attributing it to Apple’s implementation of “an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen.” While rumours have appeared over the past couple of years that Apple has been working on a method for embedding the Touch ID sensor behind the screen, it’s only in the past few months that the company has appeared to be getting closer to the reality of doing so. Despite this, however, some analysts have recently suggested that Apple is encountering problems with the technology that could hold up the release of the “iPhone 8.” Other reports have suggested Apple is testing two different prototypes, one of which could have a rear Touch ID sensor.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root gizmodo Battle of the TV Boxes: Android vs Apple vs Amazon vs Roku David NieldYesterday 10:37am Filed to: media streaming set-top boxes Apple TV Android TV Amazon Fire TV Roku 263 3 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Images: Gizmodo If you’re in the market for a dinky little black box to slide under your living room TV set and pipe through some quality content, you’re in luck: there’s lots of them to pick from. All the major names now have established boxes on the market. While Gizmodo is a big fan of the Roku box and everything it can do, it’s not the only media box in town, and it might not even be the perfect box for you. So instead we compared the four major operating systems running in those boxes to help you sort out exactly which platform will best meet your needs. tvOS Image: Gizmodo What works: Classy interface Great integration of apps with first party content What doesn’t: Advertisement Too Apple-centric Apps remain hit and miss Whether you’re an Apple loyalist or not, you can’t deny the company makes some stylish-looking software, and tvOS is no exception. In terms of flow, ease of use, and intuitiveness, this is hands-down the best interface out of the ones we tested, it’s also the only choice if you’re full invested in the iTunes ecosystem, as media purchased there can’t be played on non-Apple devices. Part of tvOS’s success as an interface is due to the Touch Remote that comes with any tvOS device. Swiping and tapping and gesturing on it feels just right. The little touches Apple has added—the animations as you move around, the movie-quality screensavers—all help as well. It’s the kind of interface you just want to sit and play with. Sponsored It helps that there’s stuff to do. While Apple was slow to embrace apps on the set top box, it’s taken no time to build a strong bench of apps you’re familiar with. Though tvOS is still missing some big names, including Spotify. We should also knock it down for being so Apple-focused—getting content up from a Windows or Android device is possible, but not particularly easy. Image: Screenshot Most of the big video names are present: Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Vimeo, and HBO Go. Amazon Video is a big miss, but is reportedly on the way later this year. Getting at your Apple movies, TV shows, photos and music is simple too. Gaming support is...not great. We’re a long way from the stage where cool new iOS games automatically appear on the Apple TV at the same time that the launch for the iPhone or iPad. The critically acclaimed puzzlers Lara Croft Go and Hitman Go are available, for example, but they’re the rare top notch titles available. The tvOS also has the rare useful voice assistant—provided you’re looking for something to watch in the iTunes Store. While it will only currently search for media in the iTunes store the voice assistant, Siri, also allows you to fast forward through a video, or rewind and switch on the captions if you missed a line of dialog. Image: Gizmodo All the box OSes we’re reviewing here, except for the Roku, favor their own video and music platforms over those offered by their rivals, and for many users that makes it obvious which one to buy. If all your music was purchased on the Play Store than think about an Android TV, and if it is all from iTunes than you’ll probably prefer an Apple one. Advertisement Advertisement It’s one major downside is the lack of 4K, HDR, and UHD support. Most new TVs are 4K and enjoy the higher quality picture HDR and UHD afford, so Apple’s inability to give you the best version of Netflix’s latest show is a major mark in the negative column. Android TV Image: Gizmodo What works: Smart interface and voice control Seamless Chromecast support What doesn’t: Advertisement Voice input is limited Options wildly vary between devices Unlike tvOS, Android TV is found on a variety of television sets (including Sony) and boxes (including the Nvidia Shield). For this article we’ve been testing out the Nvidia Shield, showing Android TV in its best light, but the Shield has features (like 4K and HDR support) that might not be available in the Android TV device you’ll find yourself with. The good news is the Android TV interface has gradually found its way to a usable and even vaguely attractive stage: It scrolls well, it’s intelligently laid out, and everything is easy to find. Voice search works well enough, though Android TV pushes you towards Google’s store just as the Apple TV does towards iTunes. Advertisement Advertisement All the major video apps are here now, including Amazon Video. Even Spotify has an official app! And there are a number of Android apps that work right out of the box, including web and file browsers. Image: Screenshot If you’re on the Nvidia Shield the game selection is nearly as good as a console like the PS4 or Xbox One. Nvidia allows streaming directly from the servers so you don’t have to worry about the specs of your local box. But broadly speaking the game options on Android TV seems roughly on par with Apple TV: there are some major names, like Crossy Road, but on the whole developers don’t seem to be rushing to make Android TV versions of their Android games (or indeed their Android apps in general). The voice search functionality, or Google Assistant if you’ve got it, can do basic web queries as well as looking for sci-fi movies or comedy shows, but it’s not as useful as Siri for navigating around inside videos or any extra tricks like that recapping dialog one. Image: Screenshot Where a tvOS can act as an AirPlay receiver, Android TV turns your box or television set into a Chromecast, which means all that casting goodness is available without the hassle of an extra dongle and an extra power supply. Chromecasting works as well on Android TV as it does anywhere else, so you can get a ton of content from your phone up to the big screen without needing to necessarily install a TV app. Amazon Fire TV Image: Gizmodo What works: Advertisement Alexa comes built-in Great for Prime members What doesn’t: Advertisement Limited apps outside movies/TV No extra casting capabilities Like Android TV, the Amazon Fire TV platform is available on a variety of boxes, sticks and televisions, and which model you pick up is going to determine which features you get, like support for 4K streaming and downloading. The Fire TV has been around for a while now, in one form or another, and while the interface doesn’t quite match up to the slickness of tvOS or Android TV in our eyes, it does the job as well as it needs to. A recent revamp means it’s much more modern-looking than it used to be. Advertisement Tiles up and down and from left to right with pleasing style, and fades and overlays add to the aesthetic appeal, though as you would expect, Amazon’s own apps are put front and center. As we’ve said before, this is very much a box for Prime members. Image: Amazon Apps-wise, you get Amazon’s take on the Google Play App Store, and while Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, and some catch-up services are here, you can’t get at content from iTunes, Spotify or Google Play. There’s no proper YouTube app either, though you can install a wrapper for the TV-optimized version of the YouTube website. While Amazon probably wants you to use its boxes as makeshift gaming devices, a good selection of games isn’t on offer. You do get a few titles that are fine for filling a few minutes of spare time, but the big-name titles are few and far between, and here Amazon Fire TV is lagging behind its rivals from Google and Apple. Advertisement Alexa is now on board these devices, which means you get voice search and everything else that Alexa entails: reading out events from your calendar, checking up on the weather (with a rather nice-looking widget), and pulling up information from the web. Image: Amazon You can also use the Alexa voice search through the remote to look for different types of content (with hits from Amazon services shown first), and to control playback while you’re watching movies and shows, Siri-style. Again though it’s going to be of most use if you already use Alexa elsewhere. Advertisement If you’re a Prime subscriber and a heavy user of Amazon’s music and video services, then the Fire TV boxes or sticks are a decent (and inexpensive buy). For everyone else, it’s difficult to come up with a compelling reason why you would prefer this over something running Apple, Google, or Roku software. It’s lack of support for popular apps is a problem. Roku Image: Gizmodo What works: Advertisement The best selection of content Best value range of devices What doesn’t: User interface looking dated Slow performance on some devices We’ve long loved the boxes and sticks that Roku has to offer, and the interface is now making its way to a variety of budget smart TVs as well. As with Android TV and Amazon Fire TV, some of the features you get will vary depending on which device you’re running your Roku experience through. Advertisement Those features make a difference: if you want 4K and HDR, we think the Roku Premiere+ or Roku Ultra are the best set-top boxes you can buy right now, but you don’t get those lovely extras if you’re sticking with a Roku stick. Adjust your expectations accordingly. Roku has always excelled at the number of services it supports, and new ones are still being added. Just about every service out there, except for Apple’s digital stores, have a Roku app to make use of, so whether you’re tuning in with Netflix, Hulu, Plex, Google Play Movies & TV or anything else, it’s a cord-cutters dream. Image: Gizmodo Outside of the entertainment apps, Roku doesn’t quite offer the same breadth of choice as the other platforms we’ve discussed above—the selection of games is pretty meagre, for example—but there are some nice surprises to be found, like the Firefox browser. Advertisement Advertisement Roku doesn’t have a voice assistant to call its own, but you can search using your voice through the remote or the mobile apps, and we found it to be responsive and smart. Most importantly, it covers all the apps you’ve got installed, and the feed idea, which automatically populates with media you’ve followed or previously shown an interest in, is a masterstroke as well. Considering Roku devices are so capable and so well priced, there’s not much to talk about in terms of negatives, but the dated-looking UI is one of them. It feels staid and sluggish compared with the software Google, Apple, and Amazon are putting out right now, and the apps themselves don’t seem to get much developer love either. Image: Gizmodo A slightly old-fashioned interface isn’t the biggest dealbreaker, but it feels like Roku could use a visual refresh everywhere from its software to its chunky remote. Some extra tricks, like in-app voice control and the ability to quickly refine searches, would be welcome improvements too. Advertisement Roku’s independence from Apple, Google, and Amazon remains its main advantage, and if you hop between devices and platforms then it makes sense to have a Roku as your media streaming box of choice (though of course getting anything from iTunes requires an Apple-branded box). On the downside, you don’t get any Airplaying or Chromecasting capabilities, and there’s not the broad developer support you find with tvOS or Android. If Roku wants to remain the go-to streaming device brand it’s become, there’s lots of hard work ahead.

The founder, chairman and CEO of USR is recognized expert is the fields of information systems security and identity authentication, especially computer-based multifactor identity authentication. Before starting USR, Dr. Weiss founded and served for many years as the CTO and Chairman of the Board of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc., now RSA Security LLC, a part of Dell Technologies. Dr. Weiss invented the SecurID tokens and their underlying algorithm: technology that became a leading form of personal identity authentication for computer security and electronic commerce. Dr. Weiss' SecurID technology is being used by more than 150 million people, more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies, and corporations, consumers, governments, and banks in more than 30 countries. His technology has been used by all three branches of the United States government, including the Defense Department, the Treasury Department, the Senate, and the White House. The lawsuit claims that USR had meetings with Visa and sent a series of letters to Apple in the hopes of forming a partnership. USR claims that Apple and Visa then formed their own partnership leaving them out even though it was his original patented concept.   A sample image of the USR ID application running on an iPhone is shown below While Patently Apple covered the New York Times original story on this lawsuit last week in a report titled "Apple Sued by Universal Secure Registry for Patent Infringement regarding Apple Pay," the NYTimes report was only a simple general overview.   Now the full lawsuit has been published and available to view. Below is a broader overview of the lawsuit that covers four specific patents that they allege have been infringed upon by Apple and Visa: 8,577,813, 8,856,539, 9,100,826 and 9,530,137.   Acts Giving Rise to this Action   The patent infringement lawsuit filed by Universal Secure Registry LLC contains a segment titled "Acts Giving Rise to this Action" that provides us with an overview of the case against Apple Inc., Visa Inc., and Visa U.S.A. as follows:   "At the iPhone 6 launch event in September of 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained: 'payments is a huge business. Every day between credit and debit we spend $12 billion. That's over $4 trillion a year and that's just in the United States. And this business is comprised of over 200 million transactions a day.' For decades, in a typical transaction, a customer would slide his or her card through a point-of-sale ("POS") device at a merchant checkout location, and the POS device would read information such as card number and expiration date from a magnetic strip on the back of the card. That information would pass through a card network, such as Visa or MasterCard networks, and ultimately to the issuing bank for transaction approval (or disapproval).   The traditional magnetic strip lacks adequate security and is highly susceptible to fraud. In an attempt to reduce fraud, a consortium of payment-card companies introduced the "EMV chip" into payment cards, which made them more difficult to copy. But cards with the EMV chip, too, are insecure. For example, an EMV chip does not prevent a nefarious actor from carrying out unauthorized transactions using a stolen card, or from intercepting and fraudulently using card information that is transmitted during an ordinary transaction.   Thus, the need existed for technology that would allow consumers to make payment-card transactions conveniently and with a high-degree of security. Recognizing very early on—long before Apple, Visa, and others in the payment industry—that mobile phones and other personal electronic devices provided an optimal platform to meet this need, Dr. Weiss developed and patented superior technology using such devices to provide a mobile, efficient, and highly secure system for making payment-card transactions. Dr. Weiss was the first in this space, and the secure payment technology that he developed is the core of Apple Pay.   Recognizing the enormous promise of his technology, Dr. Weiss and USR sought to partner with both and Apple and Visa to develop a commercial implementation. To that end, Dr. Weiss and USR disclosed their patented technology to Apple and Visa a number of years before the development and release of Apple Pay.   In 2010, USR sent Apple a series of letters describing USR's patented technology. On July 14, 2010, USR sent Apple a letter seeking to partner with Apple to jointly develop a payment-card solution that "is integrated with and centers around a software-modified payment phone."   In another letter sent to Apple on September 7, 2010, USR further elaborated that its patented technology, which employed smart mobile devices for secure financial transactions, "eliminates the need for account numbers or any sensitive or private information to be stored in or transmitted from a smart mobile device." That letter also explained that one of USR's allowed patent applications "employ[s] a biometric for identity authentication on a smart phone." On September 21, 2010, USR sent Apple another letter touting the potential benefit of incorporating USR's technology into the iPhone platform, and describing USR's growing patent portfolio.   Around the same time, USR pursued a partnership with Visa Inc. In mid-2010, Dr. Weiss and USR engaged in a series of confidential discussions with senior representatives of Visa, including then-Chairman and CEO, Joseph Saunders, and then-Global Head of Strategy and Corporate Development, Oliver Jenkyn. During these discussions, USR made detailed presentations of USR's patented technology under protection of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.   Neither Apple nor Visa ever partnered with USR. Instead, they partnered with each other and with other payment networks and banks to incorporate USR's patented technology into a service called Apple Pay, which works in conjunction with Apple products, like iPhones, iPads, Apple watches, and various Mac computers. Upon information and belief, Apple and Visa began working together on Apple Pay at least as early as January 2013, and Visa dedicated approximately 1,000 people towards the development project with Apple.   On September 9, 2014, Apple publicly launched Apple Pay in its keynote address introducing the iPhone 6. In this address, Apple touted the same benefits that USR had introduced to Apple and Visa in 2010. For instance, just as USR disclosed to Apple and Visa that its patented technology eliminated the need to store or transmit payment-card account numbers, Apple bragged to its users that with Apple Pay, "the credit card isn't stored on the device." Since then, Apple Pay's growth has been explosive.   Defendant Visa operates the world's largest payment processing network called VisaNet. Upon information and belief, VisaNet is capable of handling more than 24,000 transaction messages per second and processes more than 150 million transactions every day. Upon information and belief, Visa teamed with Apple to develop and incorporate the Apple Pay service into Apple's iOS devices, enabling users to employ their Visa cards as a part of Apple Pay transactions processed using the Visa Token Service, a digital and mobile payment service developed in conjunction with Apple Pay. On information and belief, since Apple Pay launched in 2014, Visa has supported and processed all Apple Pay transactions made with Visa cards.   Many Delaware-based banks issue US-branded payment cards. Upon information and belief, Apple Pay supports these payment cards and most partner-branded Visa payment cards. Not only do these third-party banks issue payment cards that support Apple Pay, they also authorize and facilitate financial transactions made using Apple Pay. Upon information and belief, these same Delaware-based banks have agreements with Defendants regarding the processing and support of financial transactions made through Apple Pay.   Upon information and belief, at least the following Apple devices support Apple Pay and infringe one or more claims of the Asserted Patents literally and/or under the doctrine of equivalents: Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 5, 5s and 5c (paired with Apple Watch), iPad (5th generation), iPad Pro (12.9-inch), iPad pro (9.7-inch), iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, iPad mini 3, Apple Watch Series 2, Apple Watch Series 1, Apple Watch (1st generation), MacBook Pro with Touch ID, and all Mac models introduced in 2012 or later (with an Apple Pay-enabled iPhone or Apple Watch) (collectively, "Accused Apple Devices"). See "Apple Pay is compatible with these devices," available at https://support.apple.com/en-us/KM207105. Each of the Accused Apple Devices alone, or in combination with one or more other Apple devices, and the Visa payment processing network, the Visa Token Service, and associated Apple and Visa backend servers and systems supporting Apple Pay transactions (collectively, the "Accused Products"), practices USR's patented technology described and claimed in the Asserted Patents.   In short, Defendants have made extensive use of USR's patented technologies, including the technology described and claimed in the Asserted Patents. USR has no choice but to defend its proprietary and patented technology. USR thus requests that this Court award it damages sufficient to compensate for Defendants' infringement of the Asserted Patents, find this case exceptional and award USR its attorneys' fees and costs, and grant an injunction against Defendants to prevent ongoing infringement of the Asserted Patents.   Below Patently Apple provides you with a Scribd document covering the full patent infringement lawsuit filed with the court so that legal professionals and geeks can get sink their teeth into the details of each count in the case.   Patent Infringement Lawsuit - USR v. APPLE and VISA - May 2017 by Jack Purcher on Scribd   The patent infringement case presented in today's report was filed in the Delaware District Court, Wilmington Office. The Referring Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Mary Pat Thynge.   Side Note: One of the main points of this lawsuit was USR having met with Visa executives but only sending Apple a series of letters about their idea. Apple's Legal site makes it clear about idea submissions:   "Apple or any of its employees do not accept or consider unsolicited ideas, including ideas for new advertising campaigns, new promotions, new or improved products or technologies, product enhancements, processes, materials, marketing plans or new product names. Please do not submit any unsolicited ideas, original creative artwork, suggestions or other works (“submissions”) in any form to Apple or any of its employees. The sole purpose of this policy is to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes when Apple’s products or marketing strategies might seem similar to ideas submitted to Apple. If, despite our request that you not send us your ideas, you still submit them, then regardless of what your letter says, the following terms shall apply to your submissions."   Terms of Idea Submissions   Apple's site further notes that "You agree that: (1) your submissions and their contents will automatically become the property of Apple, without any compensation to you; (2) Apple may use or redistribute the submissions and their contents for any purpose and in any way; (3) there is no obligation for Apple to review the submission; and (4) there is no obligation to keep any submissions confidential."   For more on this, see Apple's Legal web page titled "Unsolicited Idea Submission Policy."   Notice: Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of certain legal cases/ lawsuits which are part of the public record for journalistic news purposes.

Close May 25, 2017 Last September, we reported on a study showing that consumers would be interested in vehicles made by tech firms like Apple and Google. The gist was that decades-old car companies like Ford, General Motors, and Toyota could soon face stiff competition from auto industry newbies. Now, there's another study to discuss, and if its findings are accurate, legacy manufacturers could sleep slightly easier. It shows that, while shoppers may be excited about cars from Google and Apple, they have doubts about self-driving vehicles made by ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft. Methods and findings The study in question was the Connected & Autonomous Vehicle Consumer Survey, and it was conducted by INRIX, one of the world's largest transportation research firms. The company polled 5,054 drivers in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy to gauge their feelings about connected and self-driving cars. Here are some of the study's biggest takeaways: Safety When Americans were asked whether autonomous vehicles would be as safe or safer than conventional cars, a whopping 71 percent said yes. The notable exception? Baby Boomers, 73 percent of whom said no, self-driving cars won't be any safer.  In Europe, the responses were similar. In fact, in Italy, some 85 percent of respondents said that autonomous vehicles will be at least as safe as today's cars, if not safer. The U.K. was something of an outlier, with nearly 40 percent of respondents there saying that self-driving cars will be less safe.  Manufacturers When asked which sorts of companies they trust most to build autonomous vehicles, 27 percent of Americans said they preferred tech giants like Apple and Google. Traditional automakers trailed slightly at 23 percent. Just four percent of respondents put their faith in ridesharing firms like Uber. Europeans had a different response: on average, nearly three times as many said they'd trust traditional automakers over tech firms when it came to self-driving cars. The one thing that was consistent, though, was a general lack of trust in ride-sharing companies, which hovered around four percent.  Privacy That same U.S./European split was reflected in respondents feelings about privacy concerns. In the U.S., consumers were 1.4 times more likely to trust tech giants with their data than legacy automakers. Europeans, on the other hand, tended to trust car companies with their data--though it's worth noting that 34 percent said that they didn't trust anyone on that front. More important than nationality, however, was age: younger consumers (i.e. Gen Xers and Millennials) in all countries were more likely to put their faith in tech firms. Those of Boomer age and older preferred to trust car companies. Autonomous features When it came to autonomous features (as opposed to fully autonomous vehicles), respondents were generally more excited. On both sides of the Atlantic, 80 percent or more of those polled were either interested in or already using technology like rear and front collision alerts, blind-spot warnings, automatic braking, blind-spot warnings, and road condition alerts.  More than 70 percent of respondents said that they'd be interested in paying for or having as standard equipment a wide range of features dedicated to safety (e.g. automatic braking), driver assistance (e.g. concierge services), navigation, vehicle management, and driver well-being (e.g drowsiness alerts). Fewer said that they'd be willing to shell out for infotainment services (e.g. Apple CarPlay or Android Auto) Page 1 of 2 1 2 Next > Tags: Autonomous cars Lyft self-driving cars Study surveys Uber Waymo News 2017 The Car Connection See the winners » 2017 The Car Connection See The Winner and Nominees » Recommended Galleries Teaching the classics: how young drivers are discovering manuals 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Limited long-term test: not just a passenger hauler 2018 Subaru Forester turns out lights with new Black Edition 2018 Honda Odyssey boasts premium pricing, lots of amenities People who read this also read 2018 Ford Expedition, 2017 Aston Martin DB11, US sues FCA...

By contrast, there are many millions of PC users who feel the same way about Apple computers. Many men like double-breasted suits, but I wouldn't be caught dead in one. Some people swear by Cadillac cars, but my favorite is Mercedes-Benz. Despite these strongly held preferences, there's no conflict. We never see Apple computer lovers picketing firms that serve PC lovers. Mercedes-Benz lovers don't battle Cadillac lovers. In free markets, people with strong differences in preferences get along and often are good friends. The reason is simple. If you like double-breasted suits, and I like single-breasted suits, we get what we want. Contrast the harmony that emerges when there's market allocation with the discord when there's government allocation. For example, some parents want their children to say a morning prayer in school. Other parents are offended by that idea. Both parents have a right to their tastes, but these parental differences have given rise to conflict. Why is there conflict? The answer is simple. Schools are run by government. Thus, there are going to be either prayers in school or no prayers in school. That means parents who want their children to say prayers in school will have to enter into conflict with parents who do not want prayers in school. The stakes are high. If one parent wins, it comes at the expense of another parent. The losing parents have their preferences ignored. The liberty-oriented solution to the school prayer issue is simple. We should acknowledge the fact that though there is public financing of primary and secondary education, it doesn't follow that there should be public production of education. Just as there is public financing of M1 Abrams main battle tanks and F/A-18 fighter jets, it in no way follows that there should be government production of those weapons. They are produced privately. There's no government tank and fighter jet factory. The same principle should apply to education. If state and local authorities annually spend $15,000 per student, they could simply give each parent a voucher of that amount that could only be used for education. That way, the parent would be free to choose. If you wanted to send your children to a school that does not have morning prayers, you would be free to do so. Free market allocation is conflict-reducing, whereas government allocation enhances the potential for conflict. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. But I'm all too afraid that most Americans want to be able to impose their preferences on others. Their vision doesn't differ from one that says, "I don't want my children to say morning prayers, and I'm going to force you to live by my preferences." Think of the conflict that would arise if government decreed factories will produce either double-breasted, or single-breasted suits or that there will be either Cadillacs or Mercedes-Benzes built, or that there will be either Apple computers or PCs built. Can you imagine how otherwise-peaceable people would be forced into conflict with one another? Government allocation is mostly a zero-sum game, in which one person's win necessarily means another person's loss. The great ignored and overlooked feature of market allocation is that it is what game theorists call a positive-sum game. In positive-sum games, you get what you want, say an Apple computer, and I get what I want — a PC, in this case. My win does not come at your expense. Just as importantly, we can be friends.

All the major names now have established boxes on the market. While Gizmodo is a big fan of the Roku box and everything it can do, it's not the only media box in town, and it might not even be the perfect box for you. So instead we compared the four major operating systems running in those boxes to help you sort out exactly which platform will best meet your needs.<br /></p><hr /><h3><strong>tvOS</strong></h3><figure class="js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed" style="max-width:800px;"><p class="img-wrapper lazy-image "><p class="img-permalink-sub-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%"><picture><source class="ls-small-media-source" data-srcset="/photo/58860327.cms" media="--small" /><source data-srcset="/photo/58860327.cms" media="--xlarge" /><source data-srcset="/photo/58860327.cms" /><img src="/photo/58860327.cms" class="lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag" data-sizes="auto" data-chomp-id="fgywcmbawirmsjiktpvu" data-format="jpg" /></picture></p><figcaption>Image: Gizmodo</figcaption></p></figure><p><strong>What works:<br /></strong></p><ul><li>Classy interface<br /></li><li>Great integration of apps with first party content<br /></li></ul><p><strong>What doesn't:</strong></p><p class="ad-container js_ad-video row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-video-desktop"><p class="ad-instream--waypoint"></p><p class="ad-instream ad-instream--elastic instream-permalink ad-instream__initial"><p class="elastic__wrapper"><p class="ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-video js_ad-video"><p id="ad-container-95776869" class="ad-container js_ad-container" data-media-type="INSTREAM_VIDEO" data-zone-type="INSTREAM_VIDEO" data-instream-position="instream_3"><span id="js_instream_video-placeholder-95776869" class="js_instream-video-placeholder"></span></p></p></p></p></p><p class="js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic"><p class="ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile"><p class="ad-mobile-inner"><p class="ad-label proxima"><small class=" proxima">Advertisement</small></p><p id="ad-container-81523534" class="ad-container js_ad-container" data-zone-type="MOBILE_IN_POST" data-paragraph-position="top" data-change-correlator="true"></p><p class="ad-label-bottom"></p></p></p></p><ul><li>Too Apple-centric<br /></li><li>Apps remain hit and miss<br /></li></ul><p>Whether you're an Apple loyalist or not, you can't deny the company makes some stylish-looking software, and tvOS is no exception. In terms of flow, ease of use, and intuitiveness, this is hands-down the best interface out of the ones we tested, it's also the only choice if you're full invested in the iTunes ecosystem, as media purchased there can't be played on non-Apple devices.</p><p>Part of tvOS's success as an interface is due to the Touch Remote that comes with any tvOS device. Swiping and tapping and gesturing on it feels just right. The little touches Apple has added-the animations as you move around, the movie-quality screensavers-all help as well. It's the kind of interface you just want to sit and play with.</p><p class="ad-promotions-container js_ad-promotion row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-promotion-mobile" data-mobile="true"><p class="ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-mobile ad-promotion js_ad-promotion"><p id="ad-container-85348306" class="ad-container js_ad-container js_ad-container-top" data-zone-type="MOBILE_PERMALINK_NATIVE"></p></p></p><p class="taboola-mobile-second hide-contents ad-mobile"><p class="ad-mobile-inner"><p class="ad-label proxima"><small class=" proxima">Sponsored</small></p><p class="taboola-mobile-article-carousel" id="taboola-mobile-article-carousel"></p><p class="ad-label-bottom"></p></p></p><p>It helps that there's stuff to do. While Apple was slow to embrace apps on the set top box, it's taken no time to build a strong bench of apps you're familiar with. Though tvOS is still missing some big names, including Spotify. We should also knock it down for being so Apple-focused-getting content up from a Windows or Android device <a href="http://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/5-apps-to-get-almost-any-content-on-your-apple-tv-1792299884" rel="nofollow">is possible</a>, but not particularly easy.</p><figure class="js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed" style="max-width:800px;"><p class="img-wrapper lazy-image "><p class="img-permalink-sub-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%"><picture><source class="ls-small-media-source" data-srcset="/photo/58860328.cms" media="--small" /><source data-srcset="/photo/58860328.cms" media="--xlarge" /><source data-srcset="/photo/58860328.cms" /><img src="/photo/58860328.cms" class="lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag" data-sizes="auto" data-chomp-id="rw6ucgezt7riteeika0v" data-format="jpg" /></picture></p><figcaption>Image: Screenshot</figcaption></p></figure><p>Most of the big video names are present: Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Vimeo, and HBO Go.

We're a long way from the stage where cool new iOS games automatically appear on the Apple TV at the same time that the launch for the iPhone or iPad. The critically acclaimed puzzlers <em>Lara Croft Go</em> and <em>Hitman Go</em> are available, for example, but they're the rare top notch titles available.</p><p>The tvOS also has the rare useful voice assistant-provided you're looking for something to watch in the iTunes Store. While it will only currently search for media in the iTunes store the voice assistant, Siri, also allows you to fast forward through a video, or <a href="http://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/everything-you-can-say-to-siri-on-the-new-apple-tv-1759487086" rel="nofollow">rewind and switch on the captions</a> if you missed a line of dialog.</p><figure class="js_marquee-assetfigure align--bleed" style="max-width:800px;"><p class="img-wrapper lazy-image "><p class="img-permalink-sub-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%"><picture><source class="ls-small-media-source" data-srcset="/photo/58860329.cms" media="--small" /><source data-srcset="/photo/58860329.cms" media="--xlarge" /><source data-srcset="/photo/58860329.cms" /><img src="/photo/58860329.cms" class="lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag" data-sizes="auto" data-chomp-id="hxnqp4s5inen6yqzbvis" data-format="jpg" /></picture></p><figcaption>Image: Gizmodo</figcaption></p></figure><p>All the box OSes we're reviewing here, except for the Roku, favor their own video and music platforms over those offered by their rivals, and for many users that makes it obvious which one to buy. If all your music was purchased on the Play Store than think about an Android TV, and if it is all from iTunes than you'll probably prefer an Apple one. </p><p class="js_ad-dynamic"><p class="ad-unit ad-unit--in-post js_ad-unit js_ad-in-post hide-contents"><p class="ad-inner"><p class="ad-label proxima"><small class="proxima">Advertisement</small></p><p id="ad-container-26841072" class="ad-container js_ad-container" data-zone-type="IN_POST" data-change-correlator="true"></p><p class="ad-label-bottom"></p></p></p></p><p class="js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic"><p class="ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-middleboard hide-for-large-down js_ad-middleboard hide-for-large-down"><p id="ad-container-90344628" class="ad-container js_ad-container" data-zone-type="MID_BANNER" data-change-correlator="true"></p></p></p><p class="js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic"><p class="ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile"><p class="ad-mobile-inner"><p class="ad-label proxima"><small class=" proxima">Advertisement</small></p><p id="ad-container-18200311" class="ad-container js_ad-container" data-zone-type="MOBILE_IN_POST" data-paragraph-position="bottom" data-change-correlator="true"></p><p class="ad-label-bottom"></p></p></p></p><p>It's one major downside is the lack of 4K, HDR, and UHD support.

Both Google and Amazon have surged ahead, with the Google Assistant and Alexa landing in UK homes encased in gadgets known as 'smart speakers'. This new category of home automation lets you set timers, play music and even control other devices - just by yelling at them. But the success of Google Home and Amazon Echo has left Apple trailing in third place with just its popular iPhones and iPads listening out for commands. Amazon Alexa, Echo and the All-New Echo Dot Read More Apple's 'next big thing' could be a Siri-powered smart speaker to take on Amazon Echo and Google Home However, internet rumours are swirling that Tim Cook & Co have plans to join the fray with a new Siri-powered smart speaker. Here's what we know about it so far. Latest news According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a track record of leaking accurate information on Apple products, there is an "over 50% chance" the new speaker will be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) next month. The annual event, which Apple usually uses to introduce new software features to developers, is scheduled for June 5-9 . Read More WWDC 2017: Siri speaker to be unveiled alongside iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference Apple's Tim Cook holds up Brandon Moss' 100th career home run during the keynote speech at the Worldwide Developers Conference (Photo: TNS /Landov / Barcroft Media) Kuo added that the device will most likely start selling in the second half of 2017, in order to compete with the new Amazon Echo models expected to launch around that time. "We expect Apple's first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP)," Kuo said in a research note obtained by MacRumors . Release date If analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, then Apple could make its new product available in the second half of 2017. Apple has a long history of revealing its new iPhone models in September and launching them either straight away or in October. If the company is building a smart speaker, it may decide to combine distribution costs and launch it alongside the forthcoming iPhone 8 . Price Apple's pricing is likely to be influenced slightly by the £129 Google Home and £149 Amazon Echo . Current rumours suggest Apple's speaker will be priced higher than Amazon's in an effort to reach the premium end of the market. PC Advisor pegs the cost at potentially around £200. Read More Google’s virtual butler will obey your commands, from turning on music to ordering flowers Apple Music is Apple's music service which it could use with a smart speaker Interestingly, Apple-focused site 9to5Mac predicted back in January that Apple's speaker could come in at only $100. That would make it around £75 here in the UK - a price point that would immediately make it more attractive than its rivals. Design The clearest evidence yet that Apple is building a smart speaker comes from a patent that was granted on May 16, 2017. It describes a cylindrical new gadget with "radially deployed components" that could include lamps, displays, speakers, microphones or a range of different sensors. Another prolific Apple leaker, Sonny Dickson, has tweeted that the new speaker could be similar in appearance to a Mac Pro. Read More We're Siri-ous: Google launches it's voice-controlled Assistant on your iPhone (Photo: USPTO) He said it will have a concave top, built-in controls, and speaker meshing covering the majority of its surface. The device will run a variation of iOS, according to Dickson, and feature technology from its Beats range of audio equipment. Beats already makes a portable speaker called the Beats Pill, which pairs with a smartphone, tablet or computer over Bluetooth and boasts 12-hour battery life. Several design sketches were included with the patent application and could give an idea of what the speaker may look like. Features Industry watchers believe Apple's speaker will run a modified version of iOS with Siri as the interface. It will therefore be able to perform all the actions that Siri can currently do, including answering questions, playing music, reading the news, setting timers and controlling special connected devices. Read More Google I/O 2017 keynote LIVE: Tech giant to announce updates to Android, Home and Daydream at annual developer conference (Photo: Amazon) Apple will likely include its AirPlay technology - which means the streaming would be particularly stable. It could also allow users to access other Apple services like iTunes and Beats radio. Of particular interest is whether Apple would include a screen similar to the Amazon Echo Show . That would enable people to use FaceTime video chat from the same device. Ming Chi Kuo has stated there will be a touch "panel" on the front of the device, but stopped short of saying Apple will include a full touchscreen. When will we know more? With Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference mere weeks away, it might not be long before we know more about this mysterious device. If the company doesn't reveal its finished product at the programmer-focused event, then it may well drop a few carefully placed hints instead. We'll keep this article updated with the latest news on Apple's rumoured Siri smart speaker.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Ask a Fool: Why Doesn't Apple Do Something With Its $256.8 Billion in Cash? Apple has more than a quarter-trillion dollars in cash, but spending it isn't as easy as you might think. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) May 26, 2017 at 10:39AM I read that Apple has $256.8 billion in cash. Wouldn't it be better to use that money to expand its business or pay shareholders a dividend? Ideally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would use its cash hoard to make acquisitions that add value to the company. As my Foolish colleague Adam Levy recently pointed out, Apple could easily buy a major media outlet such as Time Warner or Viacom, a content-distribution platform like Netflix, and a music-streaming company like SiriusXM or Pandora, and still have cash left over to give its shareholders a big one-time dividend payment. I'm not saying that any of these would necessarily be in the best interests of Apple investors, but the point is that the company could do it. The problem is where Apple's cash is. The vast majority of Apple's cash stockpile -- 94% at the end of 2016 -- is held overseas. If it were to bring the cash back to the U.S. to put to work, it would need to pay hefty repatriation taxes on the money. The corporate tax rate is currently 35%, so we're talking about over $80 billion in taxes just to bring the company's money home. President Donald Trump, as well as Republican leaders in Congress, have expressed support for a repatriation tax holiday with a one-time rate of 10%. A similar tax holiday was enacted in 2004, and could potentially save Apple about $60 billion. The bottom line is that if a repatriation holiday takes place, it's a safe bet that Apple won't be sitting on a quarter-trillion-dollar mountain of cash for much longer. Until then, however, Apple feels that repatriation of its foreign profits simply isn't in the company's best interest.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Another Reason Apple Picked Its Fight With Qualcomm Now The flagship iPhone price is expected to go up -- a lot. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) May 26, 2017 at 10:20AM And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risks to any degree and why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history. That was the question posed by Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on the earnings call earlier this month, referring to heightened expectations surrounding the forthcoming 10th-generation iPhone. For the most part, CEO Tim Cook dismissed the risk, believing that the possibility of an injunction was quite low and explaining that the reason Apple is now withholding royalties via its contract manufacturers was because "you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount." Why now? Just days after Cook brushed aside the injunction risk, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was reportedly seeking exactly that. Just this week, Qualcomm officially requested an injunction as part of its legal complaint against Apple suppliers over breach of contract. Image source: Getty Images. In the motion, Qualcomm argues that Apple is attempting to make the situation "unbearable" for Qualcomm, potentially pressuring it into a "forced settlement" as opposed to protracted litigation, since Apple says it won't pay royalties while the litigation is ongoing. This newfound uncertainty underscores Sacconaghi's question: Why now? About that rumored price increase On one hand, the timing seems related to the expiration of Apple's exclusivity agreement with Qualcomm. But there's another possible reason at play here. One of Apple's principle complaints is that charging a percentage-based royalty is inappropriate, since Qualcomm effectively gets to make more money on features that are entirely unrelated to its cellular technology patents. If Apple -- or any smartphone manufacturer -- charges more for some new feature, like a larger display, more storage, or a better camera, then Qualcomm earns more in royalties despite contributing nothing to those features. Meanwhile, there are now expectations that Apple may price its 2017 flagship as high as $1,000 or more. The most expensive iPhone that Apple currently offers is $969 (iPhone 7 Plus with 256 GB of storage), but if the flagship model starts at $1,000, it could potentially reach even higher when adding options. The most likely contributing factor to a price increase is the expected OLED display. Displays are always the most expensive component, but OLED displays are pricey, and Apple has a margin profile to maintain. Qualcomm contributes precisely nothing to OLED displays (another company supplies most of the intellectual property there), and we could be talking about several hundred dollars more in retail price. A numbers game Qualcomm's specific royalty agreements vary by manufacturer, and the precise percentage it charges each customer is a closely guarded secret (all unit royalty figures are redacted from court filings). But generally, Qualcomm charges around 5% for multimode 3G/4G devices, using a royalty base of 65% of the net selling price; this figure was disclosed when Qualcomm settled its dispute with China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Qualcomm has since pointed to these agreements with Chinese manufacturers as justification that these royalties are reasonable and reflect market rates, and we know Apple's contract manufacturers don't bother negotiating better terms because Apple foots the bill. That implies a royalty of a little over $20 per unit, and that's before you include the roughly $20 that Qualcomm charges Apple for baseband modems. For example, if the flagship 2017 iPhone comes with a $200 premium due to a redesigned form factor and other new features like an OLED display, Qualcomm would earn an incremental $6.50 in royalties for that unit -- a 30% increase -- for no apparent reason. There should be little doubt that Apple has been working on the 10th-generation iPhone for a year or more, so it must have known that it was facing a major increase in production costs. At the same time, it already felt that its royalty burden was excessive, and would only get more excessive in the face of a price increase under the current percentage-based royalty structure that Qualcomm's entire licensing business is built on. Decoupling royalties from the retail price could save Apple a boatload of cash, the precise amount depending on how pricing plays out this fall. In doing so, Apple did introduce a risk that Qualcomm could block iPhone imports, but for what it's worth, FOSS Patents believes Qualcomm has a hard case to prove, so the risk may be muted.

Joe Mullin - May 26, 2017 2:25 pm UTC reader comments 35 Share this story The inventor of RSA's famous SecurID dongle has sued (PDF) Apple and Visa, alleging that both Apple Pay and Visa infringe four patents he owns. Kenneth Weiss was the founder and CEO of Security Dynamics, the company that created the SecurID token used around the world to access secure computer networks. That company ultimately acquired RSA Security and took its name, then was bought by EMC. Weiss left the company in 1996. By 2011, he had founded a new company, Universal Secure Registry, where he was working on mobile phone security. Kenneth Weiss WikipediaThe complaint touts the accomplishments of Weiss and SecurID, pointing out that the device is used by more than 150 million people, including "more than 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies, and corporations, consumers, governments, and banks in more than 30 countries." It says Weiss' new company, USR, enables "highly secure" transactions from mobile phones, computers, and other devices. It says the "USR ID" application has been called "the most secure personal proxy in the world." The complaint doesn't stress the point that USR's product is not available. The website for USR says the app is "coming soon." A button to "download client software for your Mac or PC" leads to a non-existent "downloads" webpage. Back in 2011, Weiss told The Boston Globe he would seek to license his patents rather than build a product himself. "He's not planning to start a company to actually build the system, and even the demo he shows on his iPhone is a series of still images, not a functioning prototype," the Globe wrote. Earlier this week, Weiss told the New York Times he's still hoping "to get into a conference room with them [Visa and Apple] and resolve this." He said he had extensive meetings with Visa in 2010 but never struck a deal, and Visa "dropped further communication without receiving a license." The lawsuit claims that Apple and Visa are infringing US Patent Nos. 8,577,813, 8,856,539, entitled "Universal secure registry," as well as 9,100,826, and 9,530,137, "Method and apparatus for secure access payment and identification."

Nothing out of the ordinary. For example, over the past 2 months, I counted a total of 3 weeks of discounted 13'' MacBook Pro models (latest version) with $200 off, 3 weeks of discounted MacBook Air models with $100-200 off; total of 4-5 one-day sales of newest 12'' MacBook $350 discounts, etc. iPhones, iPads, they discount them all the time on latest models. Plus, new MacBook refresh is around the corner. Wouldn't hurt to hold a while and see what Apple has for WWDC and decide. Those same discounts will reappear any time and repeatedly in the future as long as you keep an eye on the particular item you want.

Rating: 2 Votes GrumpyMom 13 hours ago at 10:41 am Lol on me. I bought a Nike Space gray watch two days ago at Best Buy. I can't even go and get the price difference credited because I'm across the country now. I knew when I bought it that this might happen because of Memorial Day sales being right around the corner. But I didn't have much choice because I was heading out the very next day for a hiking trip. I bought the watch as sort of an emergency purchase after finding out just as I was packing up my stuff that my gold sport watch bricked itself. I hadn't worn my Stainless or the gold for months--I have been wearing my Gear S2 watch. But I am on a hiking trip and I really wanted to track my progress as well as keep up with texts from my fellow hikers and the coordinators--who are all on iMessage. Also, the band on my Gear S2 Sport is really not good in the heat and it's hard to find good alternatives on eBay that won't break my skin out in a rash. My Gear S2 Classic is a dress watch and too heavy for what I needed. So I ran out and got the Nike watch at full price the evening before heading out of town. My stainless Apple Series 1 watch is on extended loan to my daughter who is also on the hike. She was going to use the gold sport to track her progress until we discovered it was as dead as a canned tuna. I will sort that out when I get back home. p.s. I'm loving the Nike Swiss cheese band!

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts iPhone 8 to switch from 16:9 to 18:9 display—here’s what this means for you Christian Zibreg on May 26, 2017 9 Apple is expected to change iPhone’s screen aspect ratio from 16:9 on iPhone 7 to 18:9 on iPhone 8, according to multiple reports. Economic Daily News said today that the device’s screen ratio will change to 18.5:9 instead of the previous 16:9. 18.5:9 accounts for the rumored curvature of iPhone 8’s OLED display: the phone’s active display area is understood to be 5.1 or 5.2 inches in the precise 18:9 aspect ratio. Yesterday, DigiTimes said that Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in the second half of 2017, equipped with a 5.8-inch AMOLED panel in the—you guessed right—18:9 aspect ratio. Aspect ratio is the relationship between the height and width of a display. In simpler terms, a 16:9 screen has 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other. The most common aspect ratios are 4:3, popularized by older TVs, and 16:9 found on widescreen ones. 18:9 has been popularized by the latest phones from Samsung and LG, which have screens that are taller than the 16:9 ratio used by the majority of smartphones. Already, these new phones have prompted panel vendors to expand capacity to meet fast-growing demand for 18:9 smartphone displays. It looks like the 18:9 screen aspect ratio is here to stay, but what’s so special about it? Mockup of iPhone 8 with Full Vision Display, via iFanr. For starters, the 18:9 screen aspect ratio (you could just call it a 2:1 display) results in a display that’s a little bit taller than a typical 16:9 screen. As a result, an 18:9 phone may provide a better grip than its 16:9 counterpart. As a bonus, 18:9 is perfectly suited for Split View multitasking that Apple is expected to bring to iPhone with iOS 11. More importantly, on an 18:9 screen you can have one app on top of another in portrait mode. In the Camera app, as an example, you might be able to take a square photo on half of the screen and review it on the other half. 18:9 screens also show more content vertically so users see more of a webpage in Safari, additional images in their Instagram feed, more tweets and so forth, without scrolling. On the downside, a majority of HD videos today are encoded in the 16:9 format and many games and apps are optimized for 16:9 on a landscape mode. If iPhone 8 will really come outfitted with an 18:9 display, all 16:9 videos will show blank space on the sides of the phone. As Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica noted in his review of Galaxy S8, the device’s unusual aspect ratio results in pillarboxing when watching 16:9 video without zooming or stretching it. What’s the point of having thin bezels on a phone if your 16:9 movie-watching experience suffers from blank space on the sides, you might be asking. While this is no doubt concerning, you can always double-tap to prompt iOS’s media player to zoom in the video so that it fills the entire screen, in which case parts of the video would get cropped out. Still, 18:9 could gain momentum if filmmakers adopt it. iPhone 8 concept courtesy of designer Gábor Balogh. For what it’s worth, select new shows on Amazon Video and Netflix are shot in 18:9. Plus, Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro is pushing the new Univisum 2:1 format (or 18:9) versus the typically wider 2.20:1 aspect ratio commonly used in movie theaters nowadays. It’s unclear, and this is important, if iPhone 8’s upgraded camera will feature a new aspect ratio that’s closer to 18:9. Take Galaxy S8’s 12-megapixel camera which shoots in 4:3 by default. But start shooting in the 18.5:9 mode and you only get 7.9-megapixel of its capabilities. In the same vein, LG G6’s thirteen-megapixel camera offers a maximum of 8.7-megapixel capability in 18.5:9 mode, or 9.7 megapixels for 16:9 images. Only 4:3 images can be shot in the full 13-megapixel resolution. On the other hand, as iPhone 8 is said to include an active screen area at the display’s bottom potentially designed for showing persistent on-screen controls, like Android, it’s entirely conceivably that the actual content area could be in the 16:9 aspect ratio. Apps are likely going to need to be updated to take the full advantage of the 18:9 canvas, but having been there before we expect a relatively painless transition. Be that as it may, Apple certainly is no stranger to making an iPhone’s screen taller. Claimed iPhone 8 case (middle) next to iPhone 7 (left) and iPhone 7 Plus case (right). With 2012’s iPhone 5, Apple made the display a tad taller without making it wider so that users could still reach corners at the top in one-handed mode. It took developers several months to update their apps to take full advantage of the new screen format. It follows that existing apps on an 18:9 iPhone would show black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. At any rate, Google has urged developers to work with newer 18:9 aspect ratios for their apps and Apple is expected to do the same if iPhone 8 adopts the new screen format. In other words, expect 18:9 to quickly become the new norm for smartphones. As we reported before, iPhone 8 should manage to squeeze a 5.8-inch AMOLED panel (with an active display area measuring 5.1 inches) inside a chassis that would be just a little bit wider and a tad taller than the existing 4.7-inch iPhones. Hopefully, Apple will achieve this by drastically reducing or eliminating the bezels and integrating the Home button, Touch ID, the camera and sensors into the display assembly. Fun fact: the original iPhone had a screen aspect ratio of 3:2. iPhone 8 mockup top of post via Benjamin Geskin.

The course will take place at the University of Federico II in Naples, Italy, officially starting in October 2017. Applicants can be of any nationality, with last year’s programme including students from Mexico, Turkey and Latvia. It is the first time Apple has brought this programme to Europe, with the tech giant wanting 1,000 students to attend their courses over the next three years. Apple is already doubling its intake from 2016 – it’s up from 200 to 400. Though, to provide some perspective, there were about 4,000 applications last year. See related  Is Apple building an iCar? Apple is patenting ad-targeting tech that checks your bank balance How secure is Apple Pay? The programme is designed for budding entrepreneurs and those looking to become software developers, although the course will converge with other fields. You don’t need a background in coding, a general interest in business will suffice. Those with design skills are also welcome, with the course touching on marketing elements as well. Apple aims to make the programme as inclusive as possible and, as such, they’ll supply an iPhone and Mac to every student who attends the academy. It might sound like Apple just wants to be seen doing their bit for youth development, but they’re putting in several million euros to keep this free for all students. The curriculum has been designed by Apple’s technical experts and engineers, so you’ll be learning how to build iOS apps right from those who built the system. If building software in Italy sounds good to you, the application form can be found here.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5 iPhone 7 deals Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Report – The iPhone 8 will feature Touch ID in the front glass Report – The iPhone 8 will feature Touch ID in the front glass by Joseph Carey 17 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Apple will use optical fingerprint technology in the next iPhone that will allow Touch ID to be integrated into the glass on the front of the smartphone, according to a new report. The report, published by the Economic Daily News (via Digitimes), claims Apple will not put the fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, as many had speculated it might. Instead, the company is said to have chosen the more elegant solution of allowing the user to place their fingerprint on the glass front to unlock their phone. Related: iPhone 8 Many analysts have predicted the Touch ID sensor on the iPhone 8 would be integrated into the display, though some have claimed Apple is facing difficulties developing the necessary technology. The company has previously touted the functionality of its Taptic Engine in replicating the feel of a user pressing a button without a physical click required. But developing a working, in-display fingerprint sensor is a much more difficult technology to develop, which is the likely reason Samsung opted to place the sensor on the rear of its recent Galaxy S8. The new report also claims Apple will be ditching the standard 16:9 aspect ratio in favour of a Samsung S8 chocolate bar-esque 18.5:9 ratio. This report coincides with previous rumours that the next iPhone will have an incredibly high screen-to-body ratio that leaves next to no bezels visible on front of the device. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of this report is the claim that the information has come from TSMC, the company that's allegedly manufacturing Apple’s A11 chip, which is said to power the next iPhone. The fate of the home button has been debated somewhat in the 2017 iPhone with earlier rumours suggesting it had moved to the back of the device to a position similar to the Google Pixel. For now, it remains unclear what the plan is in that respect, as there's no way to verify the latest report so approach all the claims with due caution for now. The iPhone 8 is expected to be debuted around September, so expect the cavalcade of leaks and rumours to continue in the coming months. Where do you want to see the home button placed in the next iPhone?

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) May 26, 2017 at 9:17AM You don't become the largest publicly traded company in history without beating the market averages for years, if not decades. Just look at how tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has outperformed the major U.S. benchmarks over the past decade: AAPL data by YCharts Of course, this kind of backward-looking evidence tells us little about the case for investing in Apple, so here's a snapshot of some of the company's current fundamental metrics: Price Per Share Market Capitalization P/E $156.73 $813 billion 18.7   Data source: Yahoo! Finance.  Assuming you're interested, how do you invest in Apple stock? First, you'll need to know how to open a brokerage account as well as how to buy a stock; our guides on both topics are required reading for all investing newbies before proceeding further. Once you've mastered the basics of personal finance and investing and you're ready to add Apple shares to your portfolio, you still need to understand why you might want to own Apple. Let's take a look. Inside Apple's iEmpire Founded by two legendary Steves -- Jobs and Wozniak -- Apple played a leading role in spurring consumer-tech revolutions in personal computing, digital music, MP3 players, smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. Ushering in just one of those revolutions would be enough to mint a lasting legacy for a tech company, which makes it astounding to realize that Apple's entry into each of those areas -- all of which existed before Apple's entrance -- was the catalyst that elevated their products into the mass market. Since its launch, the iPhone has become the primary engine powering Apple's financial performance. Here's a snapshot of iPhone sales in the context to the Mac maker's revenue base: Metric 2016 2015 2014 iPhone revenue   $136.7 billion  $155.0 billion  $101.9 billion  Apple total revenue   $215.6 billion  $233.7 billion  $182.8 billion  iPhone as a % of total revenue   63% 66% 56% Data source: Apple investor relations.  Because of its cushy margin structure, the iPhone also contributes the bulk of Apple's profit, though the company opts not to break out its profits by segment. In fact, the iPhone so dominates the global smartphone market that, along with rival Samsung, it's estimated to collect more than 90% of worldwide smartphone operating profits.  As for the rest of Apple's product mix, the electronics giant splits its sales among the iPad, Mac, services, and "other products." For 2016, Mac, iPad, and services sales each totaled between $20 billion and $25 billion, and other products provided $11 billion in revenue.  Now that Apple has grown so large, it might be easy to conclude that its size would be an anchor on continued growth. That's true to a degree. After all, at 41 years old, it is a mature company. But Apple shares still offer an attractive opportunity for prospective investors today, for both long-term and short-term reasons. Image source: Apple The future is still bright for Apple Later this year, Apple will launch a redesigned iPhone to celebrate the device's 10th anniversary. As with most major iPhone releases, rumors are already swirling regarding the new design and features Apple will include. As is also typical, multiple media reports have coalesced around several features that seem more likely than not to appear. Among others, these include an all-glass body with an edge-to-edge display, an integration of the home button into the glass panel, wireless charging, and more. There are also rumors that Apple might plan to launch three new iPhones, one featuring the radical redesign at a higher price point and two more standard models that resemble improved versions of current iPhones. In any event, research suggests that Apple's iPhone installed base will be primed to upgrade en masse. Analysts at BMO estimate that 31% of the nearly 800 million iPhones in use will be two years old or more by the time of the new iPhone's expected launch this fall, priming the company for another record-setting fiscal year so long as Apple can deliver an enticing enough iPhone. Looking further out, Apple also has at least two compelling projects in development that should allow the company to continue to grow, even as its revenue base continues to swell. The first is Apple's "secret" automotive project, dubbed Titan. With much of the tech industry focused on the continued integration of the tech and auto industries, this project makes sense, particularly given Apple's peerless ability to produce end-to-end consumer experiences that rely on software and hardware expertise. So long as it can figure out the appropriate business model -- and outsource the low-margin assembly, as it does with the iPhone -- even capturing a small share of the global auto market could move the needle for Apple's massive revenue base in the coming years. The next opportunity, augmented reality (AR), is far less clearly defined. Analysts have recognized that many large players are shifting their focus toward AR; Snapchat and Facebook are two such examples. As software embraces AR, a new opportunity will arise for Apple and other tech companies to introduce new devices. It isn't yet clear what hardware Apple could create, but it seems clear that it would be interested and well positioned to succeed in these emerging hardware markets.  Apple is one of the strongest tech companies on Earth, and management's long-term vision and ample financial resources should be enough to keep the company at the forefront of the technology industry, even as it changes dramatically in the years to come.

Ben Lovejoy - May. 26th 2017 6:04 am PT @benlovejoy Feature iPhone 8 Touch ID View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The latest in a long line of will-they/won’t-they reports on Touch ID embedded into the display of the iPhone 8 says yes – but there have been so many conflicting reports, it remains an unknown for now. Conflicting reports have suggested that Touch ID could be moved to the back of the iPhone or even dropped altogether in favor of face-recognition. Some have suggested that Apple could move Touch ID to the power button, but it seems unlikely this would offer sufficient surface area for the type of sophisticated sensor used in existing iPhones … NordVPN When I expressed my own view on the subject, some 85% of you said that Apple’s best move would be to wait until it can embed a fingerprint reader into the display, even if that meant delaying the launch of the iPhone 8 until late this year or early next. That’s my view too – that it would be better for Apple to ride out the inevitable market storm of delaying an iPhone launch in order to get the right tech. But what if it doesn’t? Let’s consider the pessimistic scenario here: that Apple can’t get the technology to work with sufficient reliability, or can’t achieve the yield rates needed for volume production. That it makes the call to go ahead with iPhone 8 production without the embedded reader, and instead simply move it to the rear for now. The sheer volume of Apple patents makes it likely that the company would still plan to introduce an in-screen Touch ID sensor in a later model, so would you wait? Or would you be unable to resist the near-bezel-free design even if it does have a rear Touch ID sensor? Please take our poll and share your thoughts in the comments.

This is a rare occurrence in which the setting sun aligns with the street grid of Manhattan. (Alba Vigaray | EPA) By Len Melisurgo lmelisurgo@njadvancemedia.com, NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Get your cameras ready, and set up an alert on your smartphone. If you live or work in New York City, or plan to visit the Big Apple on Memorial Day, you may have an opportunity to catch the often-stunning solar phenomenon known as "Manhattanhenge." If you're in Manhattan shortly after 8 p.m. on Monday, May 29, or Tuesday, May 30, and you look west towards New Jersey on clear cross streets, you can catch a glimpse of the sun making its evening descent -- perfectly aligned with the Big Apple's street grid. The best times to look, according to Business Insider, are Monday at 8:13 p.m. and Tuesday at 8:12 p.m. Don't fret if you happen to miss this phenomenon; you'll have another shot on July 12 and July 13. These will be the only four days this year when the sun's alignment closely matches Manhattan's street grid, allowing the sun's rays to brightly shine down scores of city streets, lighting up the north and south sides of each block, according to the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. Here's a memorable photo from one of last summer's Manhattanhenge sunsets.  Stunning shot of the sun aligning with the streets of NYC last night. #Manhattanhenge [?] : @maximusupinNYc pic.twitter.com/KoAd6eVGJ3 -- Good Morning America (@GMA) July 12, 2016 For the best view, the planetarium recommends standing as far east as possible in Manhattan, but sun watchers should make sure they can see New Jersey when looking west across the avenues. Among the clearest cross streets with the best visibility are 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd and 57th streets, and a few blocks adjacent to them, the planetarium says. Business Insider, however, notes that 34th and 42nd streets tend to get very crowded because of the views of two major city landmarks: the Empire State Building and the Chrysler building.  During Memorial Day weekend last year, the two-day Manhattanhenge event was spoiled by cloudy skies. The weather was cooperative in July 2016, allowing photographers to get some spectacular shots. Although it's still early and the weather forecast could change, the National Weather Service is calling for mostly cloudy skies in Manhattan, with a slight chance of rain showers, on Memorial Day 2017.  By the way, the nickname of this rare solar event stems from the sunrises seen each year on the summer solstice at the massive Stonehenge monument in the United Kingdom. On the first day of summer, the sun aligns with the center of the stones.  Len Melisurgo may be reached at LMelisurgo@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @LensReality or like him on Facebook.

That, at least, is according to a report from Chinese publication Economic Daily News, which cites sources from Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). According to the paper, as relayed by MacRumours, details about "an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen" came during TSMC’s annual Technology Symposium held in Taipei. This was not the only thing reportedly discussed at the conference. The sources also claimed that augmented reality functions would be enabled in the new phone thanks to "invisible infrared image sensors”, which would also enhance camera functionality. They also claimed that the screen ratio would change from the iPhone 7’s 16:9 to 18.5:9. Apple is thought to have been developing on-screen fingerprint identification for the last couple of years. The iPhone 7 was for a time thought to feature the technology, but in the end opted for a standard Touch ID home button. Seeing as Samsung ditched a front-facing fingerprint sensor in favour of its edge-to-edge ‘Infinity’ display, it could be that Apple is similarly looking to maximize display space for its new flagship.   Talking of Samsung, the iPhone 8 will have a huge fight on its hands when it arrives. Samsung has thrown so many new features at the Galaxy S8, but the edge-to-edge ‘Infinity’ screen, a buttonless design, and new AI assistant are the main things you need to know about it. Therefore, Apple will have to make the iPhone 8 relatively revolutionary, and new report from iDrop suggests it’s starting with a new vertical camera. The rumour comes from a Foxconn source, and states that the new iPhone 8 Edition will have a vertical dual-camera, rather than a horizontal one. iDrop says the iPhone 8 will also feature a double camera set up above its screen too. iDrop’s source also says the iPhone 8 won’t have an under-screen Touch ID sensor, but will use an OLED screen, with an edge-to-edge display just like the Samsung Galaxy S8. Everything else we know (and guess) about the iPhone 8 1. There could be THREE new iPhone 8s New rumours suggest those models will be joined by a third, higher-end model. According to a report from the Japanese website Mac Otakara, this new phone will be called the iPhone Edition, in the same way the higher end Apple Watch is called the Apple Watch Edition. Fast Company previously suggested the next iPhone would cost over $1,000, and it’s possible this is the handset its source was talking about. What’s not yet clear, is how the iPhone Edition will be different from the other two handsets. A look at the Apple Watch line-up reveals the only difference between the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition models is the use of a high-end ceramic finish, and it’s possible Apple could be bringing the same ceramic finish to the iPhone 8. For the last few years Apple has concentrated in giving consumers more choice – when it comes to colours and finishes at least – so this rumour is certainly viable. 2. We pretty much know the iPhone 8 (7s) release date Apple hasn’t announced anything about the iPhone 8 (7s) yet, but we already have a good idea of when it will be released. Apple tends to stick to a pretty rigid timeframe when it comes to iPhones, and a quick look at previous iPhone release dates will give a very good idea of when the next iPhone is due. Apple tends to release an iPhone every year in the last two weeks of September, so we should see the iPhone 7 around this time next year. 3. It should be easier to get an iPhone 8 (7s) when it is released A new report by BlueFin Research Partners, and reported on by MacRumors, suggests that Apple will begin making the iPhone 8 earlier than usual – but states that it doesn’t necessarily report to an earlier release date. Instead of changing the release date, it looks like Apple will begin production earlier, this time round, so it has more handsets available when then expected September release date does roll around. 4. The iPhone 8 might not have Touch ID According to renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 8 is going to feature a bezel-less display – just like the LG G6 and Samsung S8. That way, Apple will be able to give the new iPhone a larger screen, without making the handset itself larger. However, it looks like the Home button is going to be the first casualty in the new change, and according to Kuo, Apple is set to replace it with a new function area. This new area of screen could work like like the MacBook Pro’s TouchBar, giving users relevant controls when needed, but disappearing altogether when watching something like a movie, for example.  5. The iPhone (8) 7s could feature wireless charging This year the iPhone 7 debuted water-resistant capability, something already seen on Android phones for the past few years – and it’s possible Apple will follow the Android crowd with another feature, too. Phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 feature wireless charging, and it’s possible Apple will introduce that feature in the next iPhone. Apple tends to wait a while before introducing new technologies, and the introduction of wireless charging could provide a good incentive to get the updated iPhone. 6. The iPhone 8 (7s) should cost the same as the iPhone 7 Apple hasn’t changed the price of the new iPhone recently, and that looks set to continue for the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t end up shelling more for the iPhone 7s: Apple may have kept the prices the same, but it’s also dropped and added storage options over the iPhone range. That’s forced owners to buy a smaller-capacity iPhone – or upgrade to a larger-capacity, more expensive model than before. 7. The iPhone 8 (7s) could finally use an OLED screen For the past few years we’ve expected Apple to put an OLED screen in the iPhone, and now the Sharp CEO, Jeng-wu Tai, has pretty much confirmed the iPhone 8 (7s) will have one. Late last year, Tai said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS to OLED panel. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." Tai is an executive at Foxconn, the parent company of Sharp, and also the people that make the iPhone – so it’s very likely he’s privy to some serious insider knowledge.

DailyCaller The DC Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Outdoors Deals Issues Blogs Send a Tip Columnists Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas           DailyCaller   Search:     Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Outdoors Deals Daily Dealer Wine Club Issues Defense Education Energy Blogs The Mirror DC Trawler Send a Tip Tech ‘First Billionaire In Hip Hop’ Dr. Dre Celebrates Beats Headphones Sale To Apple [VIDEO] Giuseppe Macri Tech Editor Giuseppe Macri12:20 PM 05/09/2014      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP After news broke late Thursday that Apple is working on a $3.2 billion deal to buy Beats Electronics, the developer behind the popular headphones of the same name, company co-founder and hip hop producer Dr. Dre, appeared in a video online and declared himself “the first billionaire in hip hop.” Actor Tyrese Gibson was apparently celebrating with Dre in the producer’s studio following the reports, and posted the video to his Facebook page. “They need to update the Forbes list,” Gibson said in the video referencing the magazine’s list of the world’s richest people, and described Dre as having joined the “billionaire boys club.” “In a big way — understand that,” Dre followed up. “The first billionaire in hip hop.” Though the expletive-rich video appears to show Dre celebrating the deal, he doesn’t explicitly reference or confirm the news. The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 26, 2017 6:26 pm According to CMR’s India Quarterly Mobile Handset Market Review, 1Q’ CY 2017 – Xiaomi, vivo and Oppo featured in the top five list 1Q’ CY 2017′. Chinese smartphone brands continue to dominate the Indian smartphone market in in 1Q’ CY 2017. According to CMR’s India Quarterly Mobile Handset Market Review, 1Q’ CY 2017 –  Xiaomi, vivo and Oppo featured in the top five list with 11.7 per cent, 11.5 percent, and 10.6 per cent shares respectively. Samsung secured the top spot with 29 per cent share, while Apple was the fifth largest smartphone vendor in India in 1Q with 8.8 per cent share. “In the smartphone arena, the Chinese brands have already kicked out domestic players from the top five list and in the near future, we will see Chinese players wiping out the Indian brands from the top five chart of overall mobile handset segment too. We can’t deny the fact that in the next quarter we may see that happening. For the first time in 33 quarters that might happen. Since 2009, brands like Micromax and Intex have shown their presence in the top five list,” said Krishna Mukherjee, Telecom Analyst with CMR. The report points out that mobile industry recorded revenues of Rs 346,295 million, an eight per cent decline when compared to the previous quarter. “The revenues of Chinese vendors grew 180% in 1Q’ CY 2017 as against the same quarter last year,” the report reads. Shipments saw a decline in  India as well, as only 57 million mobile handsets were sold in 1Q, a fall of about 11 per cent over the previous quarter. Presently, there are 151 OEMs in India, and Samsung topped the list with 29 per cent share. Further, Rising Stars with 8.08 per cent share and Shenzhen Tecno with 7.53 per cent share took the second and the third spot respectively. Samsung secured the top spot with 29 per cent share, while Apple was the fifth largest smartphone vendor in India in 1Q with 8.8 per cent share. The report also provided insights on strategies that seem to help various brands in India. For Samsung, sales of Galaxy S8 smartphones is one of the biggest things to look out for, though it is highly unlikely that Chinese brands will take over the world leader in the coming quarters. While we’ve been seen Chinese smartphone makers now turning to offline mode of sales for their products, it will take “a long time for them to replicate the strengths of Samsung in Offline selling mode”. For Chinese brands, which have been leveraging aggressive marketing strategy to sell their value for money devices, the biggest challenge would be to sustain such a campaign. Now with Indian smartphone brands wiped out of the top five list, the competition between Chinese players is likely to get more intense. Apple, with its ‘Make in India’ iPhone SE will change the market dynamics as it will open up a serious competition for players like Vivo and Oppo, according to the report. Presently, there are 151 OEMs in India, and Samsung topped the list with 29 per cent share. Further, Rising Stars with 8.08 per cent share and Shenzhen Tecno with 7.53 per cent share took the second and the third spot respectively. Apple, with its ‘Make in India’ iPhone SE will change the market dynamics as it will open up a serious competition for players like Vivo and Oppo, according to the report. Lenovo and Motorola need to pitch the two portfolios more clearly in the market, and Lenovo “needs to intensify the aggression”, the report points out. Offline channels has been a focus for Oppo for quite some time now, and consumers have come to associate the brand with selfie camera smartphones. However, the two things are being replicated by rivals as well. “The challenge for Oppo now would be to create a new threshold, which can’t be replicated easily,” the report reads. Vivo, which is also the official sponsor of IPL in India, has so far managed to take advantage of the cricket season. However, whether it can maintain the same popularity otherwise as well, remains to be seen. Xiaomi recently announced it will venture in to offline marketing, and the company already has a Mi Home store in place in Bengaluru. The store showcases company’s range of products including smartphones, air purifiers, power banks, and more. For Xiaomi, its budget and mid-budget phones have done quite well online. Whether the company can replicate the sales via offline channel as well is something to look out for. Coming to Indian smartphone makers, Micromax will face tough competition from brands like Xiaomi and Vivo, as well as newcomer itel. The challenge for the company is to position itself in sub 10k price-segment, and it latest offering Dual 5 could help with that. Intex, on the other hand, has largely been associated with ‘first smartphone user’ brand, and the company needs to steer away from the image.

Apple has stopped paying royalties to contract manufacturers for phone patents owned by Qualcomm over an “unresolved issue” – a move that will hit the US-chip maker’s financial results. In a court filing, Qualcomm asked for a preliminary injunction against four of Apple’s suppliers – Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron, and Compal – all of which it began suing for breach of contract earlier this month, the Verge reported on Thursday. According to Qualcomm, Apple had instructed these companies in April not to pay royalties for devices they made using Qualcomm technology. “Apple could litigate against Qualcomm indefinitely; it has virtually unlimited resources (more than $256 billion in cash reserves) and already has filed multiple cases against Qualcomm not just in this court, but around the world. And when those cases end, Apple can file more cases,” Qualcomm wrote in the court filing. Qualcomm also alleged that Apple was trying to force a settlement by throwing its weight around. Because of the missing payments, Qualcomm would suffer a loss of $500 million in revenue this quarter alone. Earlier in April, the US chip manufacturer lambasted Apple for breaching deals between the two companies and urged that the lawsuit filed in January against it by the iPhone maker should be rejected. Qualcomm also accused Apple of harming its business and sought unspecified damages. Apple sued Qualcomm in January for nearly one billion dollars over royalties, with the Cupertino-based tech giant alleging the wireless chipmaker did not give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. But Qualcomm refuted the allegations, saying that Apple had intentionally mischaracterized the agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology they had invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers “through our licensing programme”.

But few look at the other side of the coins: what you get for your money. In Apple's case: the best reliability and tech support. By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | May 26, 2017 -- 12:07 GMT (05:07 PDT) | Topic: Apple More speed, better battery life for Apple's 12-inch MacBook Consumer Reports surveys its subscribers annually to learn about their experience with cars, appliances, retailers, and computers. In their latest survey, almost 83,000 readers shared their experiences with computers. Not everyone was pleased. Winners and losers read this Not your father's MacBook: The pros and cons of Apple's tiny ultrabook With all the griping about the new MacBook Pros, how does the mid-range MacBook stack up? Here's the good and the bad. Read More In laptops and desktops Apple was the most reliable. Plus it's tech support was - by far - the highest rated. Is it any surprise that Apple customers are satisfied? Since I last wrote about CR's results, their survey has used a broader definition of problems. According to CR's James McQueen they now ask people: . . . to recall if their laptop has broken or stopped working as well in the past couple years since they bought it. Specifically, we ask about laptops that have been purchased new from 2012 through 2016, and predict the breakage rates at 3 years of ownership. Laptops Among the top laptop brands, Apple's "broken or not working as well" percentage is 17. Other brand percentages: Samsung 27; Dell 29; HP 30; Lenovo 31; and Asus 33. Desktops Among desktops Apple's trouble rate is 15 percent. Other brands: Lenovo 24; Samsung 25; Dell 27; HP 27; and Asus 29. CR cautions that differences of 5 percentage points are not significant. Essentially, there's Apple and then everybody else. Tech support The differences are even more stark on tech support. 9,756 Consumer Reports subscribers also weighed in on their 2016 Technical Support Survey, covering support experiences with 14,889 desktop, laptop, 2-in-1 PCs, and Chromebook computers. The reader score for Apple was 82, while number 2 Microsoft earned a 68, with Dell at 56. A reader score of 80, means respondents are very satisfied on average; 60, fairly well-satisfied; and 40, somewhat dissatisfied. Differences of fewer than 4 points are not meaningful. What surprised me is that people said that Apple solved their problem 79 percent of the time, while Microsoft managed a near statistical tie at 74 percent. So MS is almost as good as Apple at solutions, but make their customers significantly less happy in the process. Another surprise: Apple's Genius Bars were tied with independent computer stores for in-store satisfaction. So if you must have Wintel, find a good local computer store. The myth of the Apple tax As I noted in my recent piece, the tiny MacBook is competitively priced with similarly spec'd Wintel Ultrabooks. Likewise, the iMac is competitive with Wintel all-in-ones with similar specs. Which shouldn't be too surprising since Apple's limited number of models enables them to buy in huge volumes, cutting component costs, and they cut the fat out of the supply chain at every step. The Mac Pro and Mac Mini are overpriced for what you get, but they don't have the volume. On the other hand, they still offer Apple's excellent reliability. How do you put a price on that? Also: iPad Pro vs MacBook: Which to buy and why | Speed up your Mac in a few clicks with CleanMyMac 3 | How I saved nearly $7,000 on Apple gear this year The Storage Bits take Personally, I put a premium on reliability because I'm cheap. Stuff that doesn't break - and need replacement - is much cheaper in time and money than stuff that does. Here in a not-affluent corner of Arizona, I regularly see people who have and use 10-15 year old Macs. Check out the prices of used Apple gear on Craigslist and you'll see the other benefit of reliability: resale value. So the CR survey results prove a key point around Apple's $800 billion market cap: they produce quality products. They aren't perfect, but they consistenly outperform the Mac's competition on reliability and support.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: sylvie muller More like this Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Google Assistant for iPhone: An enterprise perspective Expect more A.I. in Apple's iOS enterprise future Video Mingis on Tech: Energy microgrids, what's up with Apple TV -- and drones! New information from Sensor Tower confirms that whether you’re developing apps for consumers, or if app development for others is your business, Apple’s App Store is a good place to do business. Millionaire class The data shows that at least 69 iOS developers managed to make their first million-dollars in app revenue last year, and that’s just on the U.S. App Store. In fact, despite a smaller relative market share in comparison with Android, the store created almost twice as many millionaires in 2016. “In all, 66 publishers met or surpassed this benchmark figure on Apple’s store in 2016, which was 1.7 times more than the 39 that managed the same degree of success on Google’s platform,” Sensor Tower said. Not only this, but the number of publishers breaking that million-dollar mark was almost double the throng who did so in 2015, when 34 developers achieved the target. (Android saw some growth, from 14 to 39, suggesting the platform is edging slowly toward profitability). This is not a game What is also interesting about this data (which is based solely on app revenue, without advertising income) is the diversity of apps categories that are driving success on iOS. You see, while game publishers “accounted for the single largest category of first-time million-dollar earners across both platforms”, Apple has also seen developers of utilities, photo and video, social networking, and lifestyle apps achieve this target. This means its platforms are becoming capable of supporting a much more mature selection of solutions. So what? What does this mean for enterprise IT? It means iOS users are already far more open to engaging with sophisticated solutions on their platforms. There are at least two reasons that’s great news if you’re a big firm standardizing around Apple’s mobile solutions: It means on-boarding staff to your systems will be less challenging, as those new hires are already familiar with using them for more complex tasks. It suggests investment in developing apps for the iOS platform will likely work in the long-term, given growing consumer buy-in for apps and services on that platform. Acceptance, loyalty and familiarity with the inherent technologies will drive significant benefits to employee productivity as CIOs attempt to evangelize use of digital business processes. Marketing communications Sensor Tower’s findings also bode well for enterprises wishing to open up multichannel communications with customers. There are quite clearly some excellent sponsorship/marketing opportunities available to firms that are prepared to think tangentially about what they do. One of the earliest examples of brand-led sponsorship of an at the time compelling app was iPint, sponsored by Carling. This amusing app let iPhone users pretend to pour and drink a pint of lager beer. More recently, we’ve seen apps appear that push the envelope in terms of branding and utility. L’Oreal’s Makeup Genius was a great example of how brands can create relatively useful apps that bond well with their brand identity. News that iOS consumers are prepared to spend millions of dollars on utility and productivity apps means brands that can provide authentically useful digital productivity solutions could help build improved brand recognition and loyalty. Imagine something like Happy Magenta’s Spyglass app being made available for free by a leading outdoor equipment manufacturer, or SketchAR if sponsored by an arts equipment maker. Enabling brands to create branded apps as a service in this way is already part of the core business for firms like Blippar. Developers, developers, developers The big obstacle facing almost anyone in the fast rush to digital remains access to human resources. The best developers are over-subscribed and the biggest tech firms are recruiting as many of the best as they can reach. The current U.S. administration has its own problems with tech-related immigration, and the world’s biggest tech firms are creating research centers worldwide. Apple is attempting to create new generations of developers with its new Developer Academy in Naples, Italy, where it is currently recruiting a new intake of students. The company also recently introduced a complete college-level course, App Development with Swift. Perhaps even more telling: Sir Jony Ive is now chancellor at one of the world’s most well-known art and design academies (the RCA). Ive will help the RCA expand its knowledge of computer and materials science, the impact of the digital economy, advanced manufacturing and intelligent mobility. Long-term stability That’s great from the point of view of educating tomorrow’s developers, but it’s also good for enterprise users who now know that Apple is investing deeply to ensure its ecosystem has the breadth of talent it needs in order to maintain for at least the next 10 years. Sponsorship of expensive educational schemes shows a tangible commitment to nurturing tomorrow’s tech talent. This in itself is a strong suggestion that Apple’s vision for the future extends further than the introduction of its next iPhone. Which bodes well for enterprise users pondering big investment in the Apple ecosystem.

As with the previous update, there are no public release notes, but the update likely focuses on bug fixes (see “Apple Silently Updates AirPods Firmware to 3.5.1,” 1 February 2017). First, check to see if you need the firmware update. Connect your AirPods to your iPhone and go to Settings > General > About > AirPods, where you can check your firmware version. If the AirPods menu item doesn’t appear, open the AirPods charging case until the charge status alert appears at the bottom of the screen and then check again. If you still don’t see the AirPods menu item, make sure they’re connected in Settings > Bluetooth. I had previously reported that you need to connect the Lightning cable to the AirPods charging case to install the update, but that appears not to be true. Once the AirPods are connected to your iPhone for a few minutes, the update will be applied silently and automatically. Unfortunately, the firmware update has done nothing to fix the VoIP issues Julio Ojeda-Zapata and I experienced during our initial testing, including the awful jackhammer noise when trying to use the AirPods for a Slack call in iOS (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). Fingers crossed that the next update finally does the trick!   PDFpen and PDFpenPro 9 add 100+ enhancements to improve your PDF editing experience, with annotations, Tables of Contents, and more export options.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM lawyers WTR 300 Research Legal updates Events Directory Media adidas, Amazon and Apple team members head up list of the world’s leading corporate trademark professionals 26 May 17 < Back to Blogs Trevor Little Last week, World Trademark Review published the WTR 300: The World’s Leading Corporate Trademark Professionals. The list was generated from a community led research project designed to identify the individuals deemed to be the leading lights of the industry. Amongst the companies with the most trademark team members included are those from adidas, Amazon, Apple, Google, Mars, Red Bull and Sky. The publication is available here to World Trademark Review subscribers. To arrive at the list, we ran a four-month campaign to elicit nominations from the community. We specifically asked for nominations for individuals performing trademark-related duties to the highest standards, adding true value to their organisations and exemplifying the qualities that other counsel should aspire to. Only individuals who received multiple nominations from outside of their own organisation were long-listed for consideration. Our team then approached qualifying individuals for supporting information and references before deciding on the final list. As a result, many nominees did not receive the requisite number of nominations or make it through the rigorous vetting process (the full methodology is available here). Analysing the list, the brands with most individuals listed include adidas, Amazon, Apple, Google, Louis Vuitton, LVMH, Mars, Netflix, Red Bull and Sky. Overall, adidas boasts the largest number, with the iconic German sporting goods company having senior executives from China, the US and across Europe included. The tech industry is also well-represented in the top 10 - and that Google, Apple and Amazon boast deep trademark expertise is no great surprise. They have recently been named the world’s three most valuable brands, and protecting this key corporate asset is rightly front of mind. Similarly, for those in the fashion and clothing world, such as Louis Vuitton and adidas, brand integrity is key to success, and the need to fight infringers and copycats necessitates canny trademark strategies. A notable company in the top ten is Netflix. The media giant has been strengthening its trademark bench of late, as it seeks to ensure that the brand’s innovative onward march into content creation and delivery continues unabated. In our recent Global Trademark Benchmarking Survey, we found that trademark teams are, in many instances, under pressure, under-funded and under-appreciated – with a quarter reporting that their budgets had been cut in 2016. However, their work is critical to corporate performance and the WTR 300: The World’s Leading Corporate Trademark Professionals is designed shine a light on the often unsung heroes of the business world. We cannot promise that every corporate trademark counsel who deserves to be described as a world-class industry leader has made it into this publication. However, those that are listed certainly deserve to be. If you disagree with our opinion, we would like to hear from you. We would also encourage you to make nominations for those who have not made this year’s edition when we embark on the next round of research later in the year. The full list is available now to World Trademark Review subscribers here.

Smartflash owns three patents at issue, and had initially won $533m in damages from Apple, on the basis that it infringed these patents in its iTunes product. Smartflash then appealed to a US federal court for triple damages but Apple succeeded in having that and the $533m award thrown out, with a panel decision invalidating Smartflash's data storage patents as "abstract ideas". Smartflash petitioned the Federal Circuit court for a rehearing in April in light of other recent patent-eligibility rulings made by the court and Apple's latest brief is a response to that. “Smartflash identifies no error in the panel’s analysis that might warrant panel rehearing, and it does not even attempt to establish that there is a conflict among this court’s precedential decisions that warrants resolution by the full court,” Apple maintained. The three US patents – 7,334,720, 8,118,221 and 8,336,772 – cover "data storage and access systems ... for downloading and paying for data such as audio and video data, text, software, games and other types of data." Apple is now trying to persuade the Federal Circuit court to invalidate the patents, alleging they refer only to an abstract idea which is not patentable. Smartflash claims that is wrong. The case - Smartflash LLC v. Apple Inc, number 2016-1059 in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit - continues. ® Tips and corrections 4 Comments MORE Itunes Apple Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Net scum lock ancient Androids, force users to buy iTunes gift cards Weirdo attackers shirk Bitcoin ransom for more easily cashed-out artefact 18 Comments iTunes snafu: DNS fail borked Apple's app & iTunes stores for 10 HOURS Updated TITSUP: Total Inability To Support Uber-expensive Purchases 24 Comments TITSUP: Apple Music, App Stores, iCloud, iTunes, Radio, iBooks Updated Total Inability To Sell Usual Pish 24 Comments Doh! iTunes store goes down AFTER Apple Watch launch 'STATUS_CODE_ERROR' heaps misery on pro-strapon fanbois 33 Comments iTunes Connect does developer shuffle Oh look!

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Apple iPhone 8 rumour alert: Apple's 2017 iPhone launch date, availability details surface online Apple's anniversary mobile iPhone 8 (aka iPhone X) and the generic iPhone 7s and the 7s Plus are slated to debut in the third quarter of 2017. Rohit KVN   May 26, 2017 16:57 IST [Representational Image] Apple iPhone 8 rumour alert: Apple’s 2017 iPhone launch date, availability details surface online In Picture: The new iPhone 7 smartphone is displayed inside an Apple Inc. store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Unlike previous years, rumours related to Apple iPhone specs and launch dates are leaking thick and fast in 2017, and this apparently affected Apple's revenue as most fans and consumers are restraining from buying the current iPhone 7 series in anticipation of hyper publicised anniversary iPhone 8 (aka iPhone X). And now, a new report detailing the device debut date and availability has surface online. Twitter spy, Benjamin Geskin, claiming to be in possession of Apple's keynote presentation details has revealed the Cupertino-based company will host an product launch event on September 17 to unveil the Apple's 10th commemoration iPhone 8 and also the generic iPhone 7s (& the 7s Plus) and release them to the markets in the following week on September 25. Also read: Android co-creator Andy Rubin set to launch game-changing Essential smartphone next week; all you need to know This is in contrary to recent reports, which suggested Apple might stray away from annual September event to October, some even pointed it might get delayed further to November, as the company is reportedly facing low production yield for iPhone 8 series. The latter is said to boast advanced display panel with inbuilt fingerprint recognition sensor and its a very delicate procedure to mass produce them that too with strict quality standards set by Apple. Apple's iPhone 8 / 7s Keynote will be held on September 17. Sales September 25.— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 25, 2017 Apple iPhone 8 rumour alert: Apple’s 2017 iPhone launch date, availability details surface online Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) via Twitter Further, there is another anomaly, which casts shadows on the launch time-line claimed by Geskin. September 17 and 25, which fall on Saturday and Sunday, respectively goes against customary Friday schedule, which Apple has been traditionally following for product launches since ages. So, we urge our readers to take this report with the proverbial pinch of salt. Apple iPhone 8: Most expected features Apple's iPhone 8 will be the company's first to flaunt OLED-based display and is expected to come with the new-age wraparound technology, wherein key components such as the earpiece, FaceTime camera and Touch ID fingerprint sensor will be integrated right into the display panel resulting in a true edge-to-edge display, without having to increase the dimensions of the device. It is believed that iPhone X will have 5.0-inch active display having dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.7mm, same as the generic iPhone 7 (display diagonal: 4.7-inch; front panel whole: 5.44-inch). Apple iPhone 8 is also expected to boast facial and gesture recognisable laser sensor with front-camera to help authenticate owner's face and also scan the eyes' iris pattern to unlock iPhone screens. Further, the front-camera will have 3D capability, wherein the iPhone X users will be able to play AR (Augmented Reality) games on their devices with protagonist featuring 3D image of their own face. Other stipulated specifications include True Tone display feature (as seen in the iPad Pro), new generation Apple A11 Fusion CPU, higher RAM and battery capacity. Apple iPhone 7s series: What we know so far Besides the anniversary special edition iPhone 8, Apple will also be unveiling the generic iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. They are said to have identical design language as seen on the current models-- iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, respectively. The good news is that they will have incremental upgrades in terms internal hardware, which includes new A11 series Fusion CPU backed by 3GB RAM and bigger battery.

This should enable users to rest their finger on the display to authenticate themselves. According to a Chinese-language Economic Daily News report, citing sources from Apple’s chip supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Apple has managed to develop an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo first called it in January. He said because Touch ID’s capacitive sensor does not work through the display’s cover glass, Apple could go with an optical sensor which doesn’t require physical contact with a user’s finger. Other iPhone 8 features, according to a TSMC source, include no physical Home button, the screen ratio of 18.5:9 instead of the previous 16:9 and invisible infrared image sensors to enhance camera functionality and enable augmented reality features. Apple is understood to have been plagued with yield issues regarding the new optical fingerprint sensor. It’s unclear if the company has managed to resolve those technical issues.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this The state of the Apple HomeKit market: Apple's smart-home ecosystem has yet to... WWDC wish list: What we’d like from the Siri Speaker WWDC wish list: What we’d like to see from watchOS 4 Video Is Google Assistant better than Siri? | The iPhone Show Since it first introduced HomeKit back in 2014, Apple has been dancing around the idea of the smart home and automation. Since then, it’s expanded its offerings bit-by-bit. It added the Home app in 2016, finally putting a front-end interface on controlling smart home tech and adding the ability to use the Apple TV as a home automation hub. But despite those improvements, HomeKit has yet to really catch on. It’s still missing more than a few pieces, but with the annual Worldwide Developers Conference just over a week away, it’s possible the company has something up its sleeves to finally turn the smart house into a smart home. The home hub I’ve spilled plenty of ink on a theoretical Siri Speaker elsewhere, but the lack of a real home hub is part of why I think HomeKit feels so unanchored. Using the Apple TV (or an iPad) feels like a stopgap measure, chosen simply because they’re devices that are almost always on and connected to your local network. [ Further reading:The best home security cameras ] But with competition from the Amazon Echo, Google Home, and soon even Microsoft’s smart speaker entries, the Apple-TV-as-home-hub feels particularly kludgy. Beyond its capabilities as a platform for automation (more on which in a bit), it’s far less powerful or convenient than a comparable smart speaker device. Yes, it has Siri built in, but you have to turn on the TV and other attendant devices and then find a remote just in order to use it. Nobody’s going to use that as the primary way of controlling their smart lights; that’s the definition of a high-friction experience. Meanwhile, the Home app on iOS is good for setting up scenes, but then you’ll likely never visit it again. Even the Control Center interface takes too many taps and swipes to find the right options, and I constantly have to switch between the Scenes and Accessories views to find the thing I’m looking for. And don’t even get me started on the Home app on watchOS—it’s far too cumbersome and slow to be reliable. Even with it in my Watch’s Dock I never use it. A home hub needs to be integrated, easily accessible, and always available, and those are all places where a smart speaker fits the bill. A real home hub would go a long way to finally giving HomeKit some of the weight it’s been lacking. Automation station One of the great advantages of smart home technology is the ability to easily automate your devices. Want your lights to turn on at a specific time? Your door to automatically lock when you leave the house? Your thermostat to know when you’re not home and adjust the temperature accordingly? Yes to all of that. And while the Home app does offer some automation capabilities, the options are pretty limited and, in my experience, less than reliable. (I have a relatively simple automation that’s supposed to turn off a light every night at 12:30 a.m. It works only about 75 percent of the time, and that’s about the simplest automation you can have.) Belkin Belkin's home automation technology, WeMo, currently has more flexibility with settings than Apple's HomeKit. HomeKit currently offers automation based on arriving and leaving locations, time of day, when an accessory turns on or off, and based on some sensors. It’s not bad, but within those categories, some of the options are limited. For example, you can turn a light on or off at sunset or sunrise, but not a set time before or after that. Belkin’s WeMo app, by contrast, lets you select an offset from those times—an hour before sunset, for example. (For me, by the time the sun has actually gone down, it’s already too dark and I’ve turned the light on manually.) Belkin’s WeMo also offers a nice feature in its “Away” mode, which can stagger timers by a random amount, while, for example, you’re gone on vacation. That gives it a less predictable appearance, which better simulates someone being home. Clever features like that again showcase the real power of smart home tech, but Apple’s options are rather staid and boring by comparison. The house party of the first part HomeKit adoption by third-party vendors has certainly increased over the past few years, but it still faces stiff competition from vendors focusing on their own standards or emphasizing compatibility with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. I’m not sure that Apple is particularly interested in making its own HomeKit devices, but I can see arguments for it doing so. It would have an opportunity to show off its own best practices for creating devices, as well as showcasing the legendary combination of hardware, software, and services that the company likes to put forth as its greatest strength. Apple smart bulbs or an Apple thermostat don’t seem likely, but I could see the company developing smart sensors for things like temperature and humidity, light, and even air quality, all of which could be deployed to help bring more information into HomeKit, thus helping automate other, third-party devices. Of all the HomeKit-related moves go, this seems like the least likely to me. And that’s fine, because it’s the lowest on my list, as well. A home hub and better automation would be the biggest steps to making HomeKit more attractive than it is today, and perhaps finally making the idea of an Apple-based smart home a reality.

This year holds yet another stellar lineup as well as all the other attractions and experiences that make the Governors Ball one of the premiere music festivals on the East Coast. Thousands will flock to Randall’s Island June 2 to 4 to see the likes of Chance the Rapper, Phoenix, Childish Gambino and many others. This year’s lineup is stacked. Let’s take a quick run through some of the highlights from each day. On Friday, June 2, Charles Bradley and His Extraordinaires are a can’t miss performance under the Bacardi tent. Then later in the evening, LCD Soundsystem’s Nancy Whang will be performing a DJ set before Lorde takes to the Gov Ball NYC stage. If Lorde is not your thing, indie powerhouse Beach House will be on the Big Apple stage. Both acts wrap up before Chance the Rapper’s headlining set to close the day so you can’t go wrong! Early-ish on Saturday, June 3, two indie studs, Car Seat Headrest and Local Natives will be bringing it on the Big Apple stage. Then at the end of the day, festival-goers will be faced with one of the toughest decisions ever: Phoenix or Childish Gambino. The french band is working up to the release of their new album “Ti Amo,” their latest album since “Bankrupt!” was released back in 2013. On the other hand, Gambino struck gold with his album “Awaken, My Love!” a throwback R&B album that is a major departure from his previous rap albums. With a scarce number of tour dates on the horizon, Gambino might be the prudent choice but Phoenix playing hits from “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix”? It’s a real tricky decision! Sunday, June 4, closes out Governors Ball strong. Ron Gallo, The Orwells and Parquet Courts are all performing on the Gov Ball NYC stage. The stage might not be well suited to these smaller indie acts but hey, we shall see. Then later Mac DeMarco will be playing some tunes from his great new album “This Old Dog” on the Honda Stage. Oldies but goodies Franz Ferdinand and the Avalanches will be playing at the same time in the early evening. Choosing between the “Take Me Out” boys and the cherished DJ act will be difficult, maybe flip a coin? Outside of the music there is plenty to keep you occupied. Artists will be signing autographs, Vitamin Water will be giving out drinks and mini-golf will be played. Hopefully the weather will comply and everybody will have a grand ol’ time! Some tickets are still available for Sunday as of May 25. Hope to see you there!

Countless rumours and whispers about the next-generation iPhone, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the best-selling smartphone range, have appeared online in the last few weeks. One prominent designer has decided to mock-up a series of promotional photos of the iPhone 8 based on the latest rumours. And it looks awesome. The glossy Apple-esque photographs showcase the widely-tipped edge-to-edge display, that will purportedly cover the front of the smartphone. Apple is expected to ditch the iconic Home Button, allowing the display to bleed to the very edge of the phone chassis. The Touch ID fingerprint scanner, which was previously built into the Home Button, will purportedly be incorporated beneath the glass display. INSTAGRAM • APPLEDESIGNERiPhone 8 is tipped to include a dramatic new design, with an edge-to-edge display That will enable the Cupertino-based company to increase the size of the screen, compared to the current-generation iPhone 7, while maintaining the same physical footprint. Apple will not use a dual-curved display, like those featured in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, but will subtly curve the glass on the front and rear of the device. Some sources claim the iPhone 8 will have an industrial design closer to the iPhone 4 than the current generation iPhone 7. It is also expected to ship with an OLED display with True Tone, which uses sensors to measure ambient light colour and brightness and adjust the display to correct white point and illumination based on your current environment. Apple includes the below example of the technology on its website – Wireless distance charging is also tipped to feature in the iPhone 8. The next-generation iPhone will also reportedly include OIS, Optical Image Stabilisation, to both lens used in the rear dual-camera set-up – something that was missing in the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple will also purportedly include 3D sensing facial recognition functionality in a dual front-facing camera set-up, as well as better speakers and enhanced waterproofing. There are still a number of unknowns around the hotly-anticipated smartphone – not least, the price. Earlier this month, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich has set-out his predictions for the next-generation iPhone price. Apple Park HQ in pictures - take a look at Apple's stunning new office Wed, February 22, 2017 APPLE will open its new office in April and it feature a forest and 1,000 seat theatre Play slideshow APPLE 1 of 8 Apple Park HQ in pictures According to his sources, Milunovich has determined the Apple iPhone 8 will start at $870 (roughly £670) and top-out around $1,070 (some £824). Realistically, if these purported US pricing tiers are accurate, Apple is much more likely to charge a similar figure in the UK. The company sells the iPhone 7 in the United States for $649, roughly £500 converted, whereas the same model sells in the UK for £599. Likewise for the iPhone 7 Plus, which starts from $769 in the States, some £592 converted, but retails for £719 in UK Apple Stores. The most expensive iPhone currently on sale in the Apple Store is the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus, which maxes out at £919. Given that, it's a fair assumption to think the iPhone 8 will break through the £1,000 mark. DEUXANI • MACRUMOURSMacRumours' reader Deuxani has visualised the latest rumours around the iPhone 8 UBS analyst Milunovich believes this top-end model will ship with 256GB of inbuilt storage, although he does not specify how much memory will be included with the alleged $870 model. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski published an investor note that predicted iPhone 8 would cost $999 for 128GB and $1,099 for 256GB.   Apple is expected to debut the iPhone 8 alongside the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, which will feature only a few minor upgrades, in September. According to JPMorgan, these iterative updates will have some slight aesthetic changes when compared to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The analyst note claims Apple will move from anodised aluminium so that it can include wireless charging capabilities.

Apple's head designer Sir Jonathan Ive spoke to BBC Radio 4's Today programme about the vital role that immigration and the large-scale intermingling of different cultures plays in Silicon Valley. "[One] thing that is particularly unusual about the area is that people have travelled from all over the world to participate in the energy and to join other like-minded people to be here," he said. "And so I think there's a tremendous sort of diversity, a cultural diversity, but there's also, I think, that sense of people electing to be in a particular area, to develop their ideas and to see what's possible." "That general principle [of people coming together] is terribly important for creating a context for multiple companies to grow and in a healthy way explore and develop new products and new product types," Sir Jonathan said. "I think at Apple we've been very clear on how important it is that we have a diverse pool of talent that we can hire from." In the midst of calls for stricter immigration laws and lower caps following Brexit, some British businesses are worrying about the impact that less immigration will have on their ability to hire skilled workers, particularly tech firms.  These fears may not be unfounded, as early figures indicate that EU migrants have already begun to desert Britain en masse, potentially including many skilled IT staff. The Institute of Directors has already warned that employers "risk losing key members of staff in positions that cannot easily be replaced from the homegrown pool available".

The bridge will enable all Wemo devices currently on the market to interact with an Apple user’s HomeKit setup. This will allow voice control of Wemo lights, plugs and switches via Siri as well as manual control through the iOS 10 Apple Home app. Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial The bridge will be available to buy in the fall for an unannounced price. The small puck-sized bridge connects to the home Wi-Fi router via an Ethernet cable. It then uses the Wi-Fi signal to communicate with Wemo devices in range and any iOS devices on the network, allowing the products to interoperate via HomeKit. Like bridges from other HomeKit accessory makers, the Apple Home app will display all Wemo accessories independently even though they are originating from the single Bridge. This allows users to individually toggle lights and add select accessories to scenes and automation triggers, as if they were independent products. The news means current and future Wemo products will work seamlessly with Apple devices (including a potential Siri Speaker rumored to be announced next month) once the bridge is available to buy. HomeKit integration means that Wemo users will be able to tell Apple’s voice assistant, Siri, things like ‘Turn off the lights’ and have their Wemo light switches dutifully obey. Belkin says the announcement answers an overwhelming request from customers who want to use Wemo devices with HomeKit. “Wemo is offering this bridge to address the overwhelming request from customers to make currently installed Wemo products work with HomeKit and other HomeKit compatible products,” said Brian Van Harlingen, chief technology officer at Belkin International. “We’re proud to work with Apple to bring together two of the most influential Smart Home platforms.  Wemo has been providing smart home devices for more than five years, and millions of people use Wemo devices every day.  The Wemo Bridge will allow current and future Wemo users to experience the benefits of HomeKit, including Siri integration and interoperability with other HomeKit devices while also leveraging all the Wemo features customers enjoy.” The beauty of HomeKit is that it allows iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch owners to integrate smart home products from different manufacturers into a single experience. This means if you already own some Wemo smart devices today, you can add them into your HomeKit home alongside accessories from Philips Hue, or whoever else. The Wemo Bridge will be available in the fall with pricing yet to be announced. Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

One notably missing feature is the glass staircase which has traditionally been a signature design element of Apple’s retail stores. There is instead what is being reported as a stone staircase but may be a ceramic one. This design was first seen in the Nanjing store in China, and appears to be destined for the refitted 5th Avenue store in NY too … NordVPN CNET draws attention to the handrail, which is a carved slot in the wall following the spiral curve of the stairs – and looks quite stunning. Another rarely-seen feature is a boardroom intended for private meetings. Some other stores have these, using them for meetings with business customers and sometimes individuals, but they are tucked away out of sight. During the Apple Watch launch, they were used to hold private try-on appointments for the gold Edition model. The boardroom also has paintings of the Apple Park. Other interior elements are by now familiar: the Genius orchard, the wooden ‘bowling ball’ headphone holders, the giant screen and cube seating.

May 25 AAPL: 153.87 0.53 Qualcomm accuses Apple of blackmail, seeks injunction against iPhone suppliers Ben Lovejoy - May. 25th 2017 4:06 am PT @benlovejoy AAPL Company iPhone Qualcomm View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The legal battle between Qualcomm and Apple over patent royalties for wireless chips has been further escalated. Qualcomm has effectively accused Apple of blackmailing it by instructing its suppliers to withhold royalty payments. Qualcomm makes the accusation in a court filing requesting an injunction against all four of Apple’s iPhone manufacturers … NordVPN Barrons cited the relevant section – the bold part is our emphasis. Apple has interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing contracts with the Contract Manufacturers, instructing them to withhold more than [redacted] in royalties (to date) owed under the terms of their license agreements. But Apple has not stopped there. Instead, Apple has made clear that it will continue to embargo all Qualcomm royalties, for all Apple products, for the indefinite future. By withholding billions of dollars in royalties so long as Qualcomm defends itself against Apple’s claims, Apple is hoping to make litigation unbearable for Qualcomm and, thereby, to extract through a forced settlement what it knows it cannot obtain through judicial process—a below-market direct license. Apple’s tactics are egregious. Apple is tortiously interfering with the Contract Manufacturers’ license agreements; its conduct also provides a separate and independent basis for concluding that Apple is an unwilling licensee; Apple is not disputing that it must pay royalties to Qualcomm for patented wireless technology, but it believes that a contract which requires it to pay a percentage of the cost of an iPhone is unreasonable. CNET highlighted comments made about the case by Apple CEO Tim Cook during the most recent earnings call. The reason that we’re pursuing this is that Qualcomm’s trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s Q2 investors call. “And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it’s one small part of what an iPhone is. It’s not — it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don’t think that’s right, and so we’re taking a principled stand on it.” Although a percentage of the iPhone cost has always been the basis of the agreement between the two companies, Apple likely wants to change this as it prepares the iPhone 8, which is expected to sell for a higher price than earlier models. The most recent analyst estimate suggests that the iPhone 8 will max out at $1,070. The battle began when the FTC accused Qualcomm of effectively giving itself a monopoly by saying that it would charge Apple higher patent royalties unless the company agreed not to source baseband processors from its competitors. Apple then sued Qualcomm in several different countries, Qualcomm countersued, tried to get iPhone imports banned and said that iPhone suppliers were withholding around $1B in overdue royalties. It subsequently sued the suppliers directly, and now seeks an injunction forcing them to continue payments until the main case is resolved.

May 25 AAPL: 153.87 0.53 Apple transitions to Newsroom portal for press releases, updates executive bios page design Benjamin Mayo - May. 25th 2017 4:55 am PT @bzamayo Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has today officially transitioned away from its aging press portal in favor of the modern Apple Newsroom, which combines company press releases, photo coverage and other news into one place. All links to apple.com/pr now redirect to apple.com/newsroom. At the same time, the company has also updated its executive biography pages with a fresh design update to fit in with the company’s recent website design trends and adopts the San Francisco typeface, finally retiring the Lucida Grande font. Try Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial The default Newsroom page focuses heavily on imagery, resulting in a pretty appearance but low information density. An Archive view exists for journalists that just want to see a compact list of press releases. The refreshed Apple Leadership page removes the extraneous surrounding chrome and focuses on the Apple executive’s photos and titles. The site now resides at a new URL: apple.com/leadership. The design of detail pages for individual executives have also been modernized, with a simpler header and two-column text layout. Any outdated elements present in the previous design, like the bezelled content view or janky ‘Continue reading’ pagination, have been removed. You can see a comparison of Tim Cook’s bio page in the screenshots below. Previous design New, modern, design As part of these changes, Denise Young Smith is now named as ‘Denise Young’. Her bio has not yet been updated to reflect her new role as Vice President of Inclusion and Diversity. The update brings a cleaner look and feel to a part of Apple’s web presence that was certainly showing its age; many of the elements of the previous design hadn’t even been updated for Retina displays. With iOS 10, Apple introduced a new application theme for stock apps like Music, News, and Home. Various parts of Apple’s website have also adopted this kind of appearance in recent months. About a month ago, Apple moved the Newsroom to a bolder San Francisco font weight too.

May 25 AAPL: 153.87 0.53 Continuation patent shows that Apple is still exploring virtual keyboards for MacBooks Ben Lovejoy - May. 25th 2017 7:07 am PT @benlovejoy MacBook Patent View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has patents for virtual keyboards on MacBooks dating back as far as 2009, but a continuation patent application published today shows that the company is still exploring the idea. A virtual keyboard was of course a headline feature of the iPhone when it was launched in 2007, and Apple also introduced the feature to the latest MacBook Pro models in the form of the Touch Bar. Patently Apple illustrated the patent using a Lenovo Yoga Book, showing what is in effect a giant Touch Bar replacing a physical keyboard. If the idea fills you with horror, as it does me, we may not need to worry too much … NordVPN Those of us who use our MacBooks predominantly for writing or coding would have a terrible user experience were Apple to replace a moving keyboard with a screen-based one. It’s extremely unlikely that Apple would take this approach across all models, even if it were to use it for one or more. The company has also shown interest in mechanical dynamic keyboards, such as the Apple-like Sonder e-ink keyboard. This is a Magic Keyboard style device with each keycap being a tiny e-ink display that can dynamically adjust to different languages and other specialist functions. Crucially, you still get real keyboard movement. There are also more sophisticated dynamic key systems such as that used in Elgato’s Stream Deck, in which each moving key has a full-color LCD display. This is available today. Patently Apple notes that what Apple may have in mind for this particular patent is more of an iPad-style device. The secret to this invention is that it also oddly covers tablets […] Technically it could be some kind of hybrid device […] This past February, an Apple patent application covered an iPad Pro smart cover that supported a new virtual keyboard. So it’s evident that Apple is coming at this project from many angles. I’ve argued before that I’m pretty sure that Apple’s long-term plan is for MacBooks to have some form of dynamic keyboard. The ability to have a keyboard adapt to each app would be of huge benefit, as demonstrated by the market for keyboard overlays and dedicated keyboards for pro apps. Apple’s inclusion of the Touch Bar in the latest MacBook Pro models is evidence that Apple understands the appeal. But while it may have made moves to reduce the movement in MacBook keyboards, I don’t see it abandoning the physical form factor in its mainstream laptops – not for as long as typing remains a key input method.

Sony A6500 Apple News first launched back in 2015 on the iPhone and iPad as a new platform for discovering and reading content from a wide variety of news outlets including 9to5Mac. While Apple News doesn’t produce original content, editorial decisions are made from staff about which stories to promote and feature in various sections including News Editors’ Picks and News Top Stories. Apple News also featured a now retired curated category called Election 2016 ahead of the U.S. election last fall. Apple News even has a dedicated Twitter account for promoting topical stories found within the service with links that launch the News app on iOS and default to the web on other platforms. Lauren Kern, the first-ever editor-in-chief of Apple News, most recently worked at New York Magazine where she was promoted from executive editor to a new role at New York Media that covered more publications. Here’s how New York described her new role back in November: Lauren Kern is becoming executive editor, New York Media, creating an integrated feature and enterprise operation that will span across all publications, including Vulture, the Cut, Daily Intelligencer, Select All, Science of Us, Grub Street, and New York Magazine, working with the editors and building on her accomplishments in the print magazine and on the Cut to produce ambitious journalism throughout the company. Politico says it’s “unclear what exactly the role will entail” for Kern at Apple News, but you can see how her most recent role could apply to Apple’s news aggregator service.

Up Next is a new documentary artist series from Apple Music that focuses on up and coming musicians. The Up Next series started last month with R&B inspired hip-hop artist 6LACK (pronounced “black”). Apple Music’s Up Next page was dedicated to the artist including a personal documentary with the artist, and an interview with Zane Lowe. Sigrid is a Norweigan singer-songwriter who gained traction recently with her release of “Don’t Kill My Vibe.” From her Up Next profile this month: Armed with an electrifying voice and an effortless gift as a songwriter, Sigrid is a love-at-first-listen pop star. She was only 16 when her first song proved she was destined for stardom beyond small-town Norway, and she delivered an international hit with the raw, radiant energy of “Don’t Kill My Vibe.” Explore Sigrid’s music, watch an exclusive short film, and check out her intimate interview with Julie Adenuga. it's an honour to be @AppleMusic's #UpNext artist. here is a snippet of a documentary we did together back home in Norway 💜 pic.twitter.com/0mnZKcCtEE — sigrid (@thisissigrid) May 25, 2017 Get to know Sigrid on Apple Music’s Up Next at apple.co/upnext.

May 25 AAPL: 153.87 0.53 Facebook adding Apple News support to Instant Article tools to increase adoption Zac Hall - May. 25th 2017 9:47 am PT @apollozac Apple News View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Facebook introduced its Instant Article format for publishers two years ago as a way to make loading content in the News Feed much faster, but the format hasn’t been adopted as widely as the social network had hoped. Now Facebook is rolling out new tools for publishers to make Instant Articles compatible with Apple News and Google AMP formats. Sony A6500 Facebook says it has heard from publishers that supporting multiple formats like Google AMP, Apple News, and Instant Articles can require a lot of upfront work. Facebook’s solution is adding a new export option for publishers to use when creating Instant Articles that works with Apple News and Google AMP. The updated SDK transforms the markup publishers use to create Instant Articles to generate the code needed to build these other formats, removing what we’ve heard can be a resource-heavy step in publishing on multiple platforms. With an easy way to get from one markup format to another, publishers can then plug-and-play the markup in their content management systems or third party publishing tools. Publishers will still need to put in the work to support Instant Articles, but Facebook is hoping that working with Apple News and Google AMP will push publishers to play ball. Google AMP support is also live now, and Facebook says Apple News “will be ready in the coming weeks as we learn how these tools can best support our partners.” For its part, Apple has had its own challenges with The Guardian recently pulling out of both Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles last month. Apple shared last fall that its News app hit 70 million users. Apple News is pre-installed to iPhones and iPads but only available in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Publishers can read more about the Instant Articles SDK Extension here. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news!

May 25 AAPL: 153.87 0.53 Apple releases a new video showing off iPhone reincarnation with LIAM Greg Barbosa - May. 25th 2017 11:08 am PT @gregbarbosa Lisa Jackson Earth Day Liam Sarah Chandler TJ Tyler View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has released a new environment focused video today in the same style as those shown off last month celebrating Earth Day. The previously shared videos discussed the company’s environmental efforts and the science behind it all. The comical illustrations featured Apple Execs like Vice President Lisa Jackson. Today’s video re-illustrates LIAM, Apple’s environmental robot that takes apart iPhone components for recycling. Titled “Does my iPhone believe in Reincarnation,” Lisa Jackson, Sarah Chandler, and TJ Tyler of Apple’s Environmental Initiatives explain the goal with the recycling system: Lisa Jackson: Liam takes an entire iPhone and takes it apart. Sarah Chandler: In the process, you end up with these perfectly separated bins of parts. And figuring out what to do with those is kind of where the magic is. TJ Tyler: Let’s try to put them back into our own supply chain and literally reuse our own material that we generated. Chandler: Treating that material as the amazing gift that it is and sending it back around that cycle again and again so that we don’t have to extract new material from the earth — that’s the goal. And that’s really exciting. Chandler is currently speaking at this year’s Sustainable Brands 2017 in Detroit to discuss the environmental plans the company is working on. Announced earlier this year, Jackson shared that Apple had achieved 96% worldwide renewable energy up from 2015’s 93%. Within the US and 23 other countries Apple is at 100%, and pushing the remaining few to catch up. Jackson said that currently “seven members of our supply chain who have committed to making their Apple operations renewable too.” Greg Barbosa @gregbarbosa Greg Barbosa is the Product Manager at Electrek, 9to5Google, 9to5Mac, and 9to5Toys and a writer for 9to5Mac.

Apple’s WWDC 2017 opening keynote, which Apple will live stream, will be the first major event the company has held since last fall after foregoing a spring event this year. Sony A6500 Apple first announced WWDC 2017, which is being held in San Jose rather than San Francisco this year, earlier than usual back in February. The early announcement has helped attendees adjust plans while a variety of community events have followed WWDC from San Francisco to San Jose this year. While the venue may be changing, Apple officially confirmed that its major keynote will still be held at 10 am PT on the first Monday of the keynote. 9to5Mac will be covering all the announcements out of the keynote and WWDC 2017 so stay tuned for all the news and analysis. Apple has also added its usual calendar reminder to www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2017/ which adds Apple Special Event to your calendar with a 15 minute alert. The event entry includes this teaser: “Join us for the WWDC keynote presentation and watch every moment live.” WWDC has strictly been a software event in recent years, but this year Apple is expected to introduce new hardware on stage as well. Alongside iOS 11, macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and tvOS 11, Apple is expected to possibly unveil new MacBooks and MacBook Pros, the first-ever 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and the first Siri Speaker which is expected to be an Amazon Echo competitor.

Well, we were there when Apple recently hosted a media preview, so here’s what you’re in for! If you’ve ever been to Apples sleek San Francisco Store then the design aesthetics of Apple Orchard Road shouldn’t be a surprise, as Apple intend to apply this Foster and Sullivan design throughout all their stores worldwide. For Apple Orchard Road the design has been tweaked to take into account Singapore’s tropical heat and humidity – apart from full air-conditioning the design has a smoked glass overhang above the huge glass frontage to diffuse direct sunlight and provide rain shelter for pedestrians. Walk through the main doors and you’ll encounter the Avenue – the main Apple product display area, with rows of shiny MacBooks, iPads, iPhones and Watches in all their colour variations. There’s also not only no genius bar but no sales counter as well – customers interact casually with Apple staff on polished wooden tabletops, who use iPads to process orders and warranty issues. Stylishly displayed on the walls are third party products – from wearables to drones and iPhone camera accessories. On both sides of the Avenue are sweeping marble staircases that bring you to the Forum, a huge second floor area with a huge tree-lined presentation area. It’s here that you’ll be able to attend a variety of events – from musical performances to presentations from one of Apple’s Creative Pros. For example on the 28th of May Singapore street photographer Chia Aik Beng (more famously known as ABC) will be hosting a photowalk from the store. In fact, Apple has a daily program of activities that you can attend – click here for more information. You can’t miss the Apple Store in Singapore The Avenue has every Apple product available iPads MacBooks, iMacs and Mac Pros Watches and iPhones Beats headphones Gaming accessories Apple TV Lots of Watch Straps Drones 2nd floor Forum area.

May 26, 2017 at 12:10 pm Shawn Chung Its actually the other way around. It’s Apple who dictates the interior design of its dealer stores. What’s the real big deal about Apple’s flagship stores is that they intend to provide novel experiences via the Today@Apple programme, not just sell them Apple stuff. That’s why they headhunted Angela Ahrendts, the former CEO of Burberry, in late 2014 as VP for Retail. Under her watch she rejuvenated Burberry and tripled it’s brand value by creating new experiences for Burberry’s consumers, including hosting rock concerts in its London store and live-feeding to it’s Shanghai store. May 26, 2017 at 7:50 pm Gatsby the Great I’ve been to one in Santa Monica. It really didn’t make me feel any different, nor did I experience anything special. Today@Apple? Yet to find out. Thanks for the heads up Shawn. May 27, 2017 at 11:33 am Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published. Name Email Website Comment Sign me up for the newsletter!

We’re not so sure iPhone 8 launch date leaked on Twitter? We’re not so sure by Sean Keach 22 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Apple fans are always keen to find out when the next iPhone is coming, but one mobile leaker claims to already know. Every September, Apple shows off a brand new iPhone. This year, we’re expecting to see two fairly incremental iPhone 7S models, as well as a special edition iPhone 8 in celebration of the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. But as far as an exact launch date goes, we’re largely in the dark. Or we were, until prominent mobile tipster Benjamin Geskin took to Twitter, suggesting that he already knows when this year’s Apple keynote will be held. In a tweet, he wrote: “Apple’s iPhone 8 / 7s Keynote will be held on September 17. Sales September 25." If it’s true then that’s good news, as the iPhone 8 has been mired in controversial rumours over supply chain delays. We’d previously heard that the phone could be pushed back as far as October or November, although the latest rumours suggest any manufacturing delays have now been resolved. However, we’re not entirely convinced that Geskin is on the mark when it comes to his latest tip. According to Geskin, Apple would be revealing the new phone(s) on a Sunday, and launching them for retail on a Monday. But for recent iPhone launches, Apple has consistently opted for either Tuesday or Wednesday for iPhone reveals, and Friday or Saturday for retail release: iPhone 7: Wednesday, September 7 (reveal) | Friday, September 16 (release) iPhone 6S: Wednesday, September 9 (reveal) | Saturday, September 19 (release) iPhone 6: Tuesday, September 9 (reveal) | Friday, September 19 (release) iPhone 5S: Tuesday, September 10 (reveal) | Friday, September 20 (release) iPhone 5: Wednesday, September 12 (reveal), Friday, September 21 (release) Based on that information, we think it would be more likely that the iPhone 8 will be revealed on either Tuesday, September 12, or Wednesday, September 13. Similarly, we’d expect that the iPhone 8 release date would fall on either Friday, September 22, or Saturday, September 23. If Geskin’s predictions are right, it would be a major break from tradition for Apple. That said, this is the 10th anniversary iPhone, and Apple is expected to host the event at its new Apple Park campus, so maybe that could explain a change in protocol.

Image Credit: Screenshot Apple design chief Jony Ive has added another job to his resume. The Royal College of Art in London on Thursday appointed Ive as it chancellor, a position he will hold for five years starting in July. As chancellor, Ive will serve as the head of the college and join the school’s Council governing body. It’s an unpaid position. The Royal College of Art, founded in 1837, is one of the world’s most highly regarded art and design institutions with programs including art, design, and architecture. In a statement, the college called Ive, who has been knighted in the U.K. for his achievements at Apple, “the world’s leading designer.” The college awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2009 for his work designing Apple’s products. Ive, who has been at Apple since 1992, has played a critical role in designing everything from the company’s iPhone to minute details in its retail stores. He also worked with architects on Apple’s new Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, Apple Park. While Ive’s role is largely honorary and won’t require him to step away from his job at Apple, he said in a statement that he will act as an adviser to students and employees at the college. The school added that Ive will have a say in a new building it plans to open in 2020. For his new role, Ive succeeds James Dyson, founder of his namesake company that is best known for its Dyson vacuum cleaner. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

Just $12,000 ... NBD. Image: HODINKEE By Nicole Gallucci2017-05-25 13:45:52 -0700 If you've got $12,000 to blow and already own every Apple product under the sun, we've got great news — you can now buy this impeccably sophisticated hourglass to fill the void in your life. Channelling the tech company's innovation, Apple designer Marc Newson revamped the traditional hourglass to create this ridiculously expensive, limited-edition product for HODINKEE, a publication specializing in wristwatches. SEE ALSO: Tim Cook will take his Apple Watch secret to the grave Now okay, sure, The Marc Newson Hourglass technically measures time. But tbh, this is pretty pointless. I mean, when was the last time you needed an hourglass? TBH unless you're a hardcore Days of Our Lives fan, when was the last time you even thought of an hourglass?  This is just an unbelievable amount of money for an object with essentially no use. Just use your Apple Watch and hold on to your life savings? Right? That said, there's no denying that the product is pretty impressive. Newson strayed from the typical sand-filled hourglasses, and instead, filled his 150mm tall hand-blown borosilicate glass creation with over one million "nanoballs."  According to the HODINKEE shop's description, the hourglass contains approximately 1,249,996 little spheres made from solid stainless steel, covered in a fine copper and an anti-corrosion layer that will prevent them from turning green over time.  Weighing at about 3.3 lbs, the balls are so tiny and smooth that they flow through the hourglass like liquid. It's definitely not a horrible thing to stare at for ten minutes. If you want this magical item, you can place an order online — but you must put down a $6,000 non-refundable deposit and wait a few months for production. Hold up, a $6,000 NON-REFUNDABLE deposit?! Are you kidding, Newson? Only 100 pieces were made in the collection, so if you want one you'll have to move quickly. Or you can simply watch the mesmerizing hourglass experience below, and, you know, save your cash.  WATCH: Scuba dive tankless with this floating air caddie Topics: Apple, Conversations, Fashion, Tech, time About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone 8 hands-on video leaked: No home button, dual rear camera, bezel-less screen & more In this video, a dummy model of iPhone 8 is shown to reveal the exterior design with little left to our imagination. Sami Khan   May 26, 2017 13:36 IST Apple is rumoured to make significant modifications to its next-generation iPhone 8 to compete against Samsung's radically designed Galaxy S8.Apple Rumours about Apple's upcoming flagship aren't new at all. Details about iPhone 8 have been leaked several times, sometimes in the form of spy shots of the device and mostly the specifications leaked by inside sources. In what appears to be the biggest leak so far, the unannounced iPhone 8's hands-on video has made it to the wild. Although it appears to be a dummy model of the iPhone 8, but the design of the handset can clearly be seen in the video. Leaked by mobile tipster Benjamin Geskin on YouTube, the iPhone 8 shown in the video is everything what the rumours have projected so far. The front design of the dummy iPhone 8 in the video is particularly interesting. Apple seems to be doing away with the physical home button that has been a part of the iPhones since their birth. If the video is accurate, the iPhone 8 will have a near bezel-less display, and the space left by the home button will be acquired by the display. A good example of that is Samsung Galaxy S8's Infinite Display. While the front design looks appealing, there are concerns about the placement of the fingerprint scanner. The rear design of the dummy iPhone 8 shows two vertically placed camera sensors, which is different from the current iPhone 7 Plus setup. This particular change is expected to add more detail and depth of field to images. Exclusive: #iPhone8 Dummy Hands-On Video pic.twitter.com/1Ro6umrdpT— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 23, 2017 The entire rear panel seems to be made of glass and there's no sign of a fingerprint sensor at the back. This leaves Apple with one option – to place the biometric sensor under the display. This piece of technology was supposed to be seen in the Samsung Galaxy S8, but the company placed the fingerprint scanner at the back. It remains to be seen how Apple will implement this new technology in time for September release of the new iPhone. But it's worth noting that the iPhone 8 will be a premium model priced above $1,000, whereas the company also has plans to launch the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus as standard upgrades. The iPhone 8 will have top notch features, such as a bigger OLED display, revamped design, 128GB and 256GB storage options, wireless charging, 3D face-recognition and much more. While some leaked photos of the iPhone 8 suggested a fingerprint scanner at the back and no bezel-less display, Geskin denied saying they're false. All my sources said that this is totally wrong design. #iPhone8 is not going to look like that. pic.twitter.com/8BtXD0zQL2— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) May 25, 2017 Apple is still months away from launching the real deal iPhones. The latest leak is also of a dummy model, which may not be the final design chosen by Apple. It's best to take this piece of rumour with a pinch of salt.

By contrast, there are many millions of PC users who feel the same way about Apple computers. Many men like double-breasted suits, but I wouldn't be caught dead in one. Some people swear by Cadillacs, but my favorite is Mercedes-Benz. Despite these strongly held preferences, there's no conflict. We never see Apple computer lovers picketing firms that serve PC lovers. Mercedes-Benz lovers don't battle Cadillac lovers. In free markets, people with strong differences in preferences get along and often are good friends. The reason is simple. If you like double-breasted suits and I like single-breasted suits, we get what we want. Contrast the harmony that emerges when there's market allocation with the discord when there's government allocation. For example, some parents want their children to say a morning prayer in school. Other parents are offended by that idea. Both parents have a right to their tastes, but these parental differences have given rise to conflict. Why? The answer is simple. Schools are run by government. Thus, there are going to be either prayers in school or no prayers in school. That means parents who want their children to say prayers in school will have to enter into conflict with parents who do not want prayers in school. The stakes are high. If one parent wins, it comes at the expense of another parent. The losing parents have their preferences ignored. Or they must send their children to a private school that has morning prayers and pay that school's tuition plus property taxes to support a public school for which they have little use. The liberty-oriented solution to the school prayer issue is simple. We should acknowledge the fact that though there is public financing of primary and secondary education, it doesn't follow that there should be public production of education. Just as there is public financing of M1 Abrams main battle tanks and F/A-18 fighter jets, it in no way follows that there should be government production of those weapons. They are produced privately. There's no government tank and fighter jet factory. The same principle should apply to education. If state and local authorities annually spend $15,000 per student, they could give each parent a voucher of that amount that could only be used for education. That way, the parent would be free to choose. If you wanted to send your children to a school that does not have morning prayers, you would be free to do so. And I could send my children to a school that does. As a result, you and I would not have to fight. We could be friends, play tennis and have a beer or two together. Free market allocation is conflict-reducing, whereas government allocation enhances the potential for conflict. But I'm all too afraid that most Americans want to be able to impose their preferences on others. Their vision doesn't differ from one that says, "I don't want my children to say morning prayers, and I'm going to force you to live by my preferences." The issue of prayers in school is just a minor example of people's taste for tyranny. Think of the conflict that would arise if the government decreed that factories will produce either double-breasted or single-breasted suits, or that there will be either Cadillacs or Mercedes-Benzes built, or that there will be either Apple computers or PCs built. Can you imagine how otherwise peaceable people would be forced into conflict with one another? Government allocation is mostly a zero-sum game in which one person's win necessarily means another person's loss. The great ignored and overlooked feature of market allocation is that it is what game theorists call a positive-sum game. In positive-sum games, you get what you want, say an Apple computer, and I get what I want--a PC, in this case. My win does not come at your expense, and your win doesn't come at my expense. And just as importantly, we can be friends. ------------v------------ Walter E. Williams is a professor of economics at George Mason University.
