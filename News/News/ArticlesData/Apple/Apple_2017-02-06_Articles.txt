David A. Graham Feb 10, 2017 Michael Flynn's Debacle David Frum Feb 10, 2017 Matthew Hutson March 2017 Issue Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size In the coming decades, artificial intelligence will replace a lot of human jobs, from driving trucks to analyzing X-rays. But it will also work with us, taking over mundane personal tasks and enhancing our cognitive capabilities. As AI continues to improve, digital assistants—often in the form of disembodied voices—will become our helpers and collaborators, managing our schedules, guiding us through decisions, and making us better at our jobs. We’ll have something akin to Samantha from the movie Her or Jarvis from Iron Man: AI “agents” that know our likes and dislikes, and that free us up to focus on what humans do best, or what we most enjoy. Here’s what to expect. 1 | A Voice in Your Head Anyone who’s used Siri (on Apple products) or Alexa (on Amazon Echo) has already spoken with a digital assistant. In the future, such “conversational platforms” will be our primary means of interacting with AI, according to Kun Jing, who oversees a digital assistant called Duer for the Chinese search engine Baidu. The big tech companies are racing to create the one agent to rule them all: In addition to Siri, Alexa, and Duer, there’s Microsoft’s Cortana, Facebook’s M, and Google Assistant. Even Mattel is getting in on the action: It recently announced Aristotle, a voice-controlled AI device that can soothe babies, read bedtime stories, and tutor older kids. These voice systems might eventually go from something you talk to on a device to something that’s in your head. Numerous companies—including Sony and Apple—have developed wireless earbuds with microphones, so your virtual helper might be able to coach you on dates and interviews or discreetly remind you to take your meds. You might even be able to communicate back without making a sound. nasa has developed a system that uses sensors on the skin of the throat and neck to interpret nerve activity. When users silently move their tongues as if speaking, the system can tell what words they’re forming—even if they don’t produce any noise and barely move their lips. Dea / G. Dagli Orti/ Getty; © Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello / on loan from the University of Virginia; str / Calvin Campbell / AP; Ben Margot / AP 2 | Talking Cereal Boxes Your main AI agent won’t be the only new voice in your life. You’ll likely confront a cacophony of appliances and services chiming in, since companies want you to use their proprietary systems. Ryan Gavin, who oversees Microsoft’s Cortana, says that in 10 years you might select furniture at the mall and say, “Hey, Cortana, can you work with the Pottery Barn bot to arrange payment and delivery?” Consider this a digitally democratized version of the old power move: “Have your bot call my bot.” Nova Spivack, a futurist and entrepreneur who works with AI, says a wearable device like Google Glass might, for example, recognize a book and then connect you to an online voice representing that book so you can ask it questions. Everything in the world could be up for a chat. (“Hello, box of Corn Flakes. Am I allergic to you?”) Your agent might also augment reality with visual overlays—showing you a grocery list as you shop or displaying facts about strangers as you meet them. All of which sounds rather intrusive. Not to worry, says Subbarao Kambhampati, the president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence: Future agents, like trusted friends, will be able to read you and know when to interrupt—and when to leave you alone. 3 | Smarter Together In 1997, a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, lost a match to the supercomputer Deep Blue. He later found that even an amateur player armed with a mediocre computer could outmatch the smartest player or the most powerful computer working alone. Since then, others have pursued human-computer collaborations in the arts and sciences. A subfield of AI called computational creativity forges algorithms that can write music, paint portraits, and tell jokes. So far the results haven’t threatened to put artists out of work, but these systems can augment human imagination. David Cope, a composer at UC Santa Cruz, created a program he named Emily Howell, with which he chats and shares musical ideas. “It is a conversationalist composer friend,” he says. “It is a true assistant.” She scores some music, he tells her what he likes and doesn’t like, and together they compose symphonies. IBM’s Watson, the AI system best known for winning Jeopardy, has engaged in creative collaborations, too. It suggested clips from the horror movie Morgan to use for a trailer, for instance, allowing the editor to produce a finished product in a day rather than in weeks. Eventually, digital assistants may co-author anything from the perfect corporate memo to the next great American novel. Jamie Brew, a comedy writer for the website ClickHole, developed a predictive text interface that takes examples of a literary form and assists in producing new pieces, by giving the user a series of choices for what word to write next. Together he and the interface have churned out a new X-Files script and mock Craigslist ads and IMDb content warnings. 4 | Mutual Understanding Most machine-learning systems are unable to explain in human terms why they made a decision or what they intend to do next. But researchers are working to fix that. The military’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency recently announced a plan to invest significantly in explainable AI, or XAI, to make machine-learning systems more correctable, predictable, and trustworthy. Armed with XAI, your digital assistant might be able to tell you it picked a certain driving route because it knows you like back roads, or that it suggested a word change so that the tone of your email would be friendlier. In addition, with more awareness, “the robot would know when to ask for help,” says Manuela Veloso, the head of Carnegie Mellon’s machine-learning department, who calls this skill “symbiotic autonomy.” From Our March 2017 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe Researchers are developing artificial emotional intelligence, or emotion AI, so that our agents can better understand us, too. Companies such as Affectiva and Emotient (which was bought by Apple) have created systems that read emotions in users’ faces. IBM’s Watson can analyze text not just for emotion but for tone and, over time, for personality, according to Rob High, Watson’s chief technology officer. Eventually, AI systems will analyze a person’s voice, face, posture, words, context, and user history for a better understanding of what the user is feeling and how to respond. The next step, according to Rana el Kaliouby, Affectiva’s co-founder and CEO, will be an emotion chip in our phones and TVs that can react in real time. “I think in the future we’ll assume that every device just knows how to read your emotions,” she says. 5 | Getting Attached We already know that people can form emotional bonds with Roomba vacuum cleaners and other relatively rudimentary robots. How will we relate to AI agents that speak to us in human voices and seem to understand us on a deep level? Spivack, the futurist, pictures people partnering with lifelong virtual companions. You’ll give an infant an intelligent toy that learns about her and tutors her and grows along with her. “It starts out as a little cute stuffed animal,” he says, “but it evolves into something that lives in the cloud and they access on their phone. And then by 2050 or whatever, maybe it’s a brain implant.” Among the many questions raised by such a scenario, Spivack asks: “Who owns our agents? Are they a property of Google?” Could our oldest friends be revoked or reprogrammed at will? And without our trusted assistants, will we be helpless? El Kaliouby, of Affectiva, sees a lot of questions around autonomy: What can an assistant do on our behalf? Should it be able to make purchases for us? What if we ask it to do something illegal—could it override our commands? She also worries about privacy. If an AI agent determines that a teenager is depressed, can it inform his parents? Spivack says we’ll need to decide whether agents have something like doctor-patient or attorney-client privilege. Can they report us to law enforcement? Can they be subpoenaed? And what if there’s a security breach? Some people worry that advanced AI will take over the world, but Kambhampati, of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, thinks malicious hacking is the far greater risk. Given the intimacy that we may develop with our ever-present assistants, if the wrong person were able to break in, what was once our greatest auxiliary could become our greatest liability. Share Tweet Comments Latest Video The Crippling Fear of Everlasting Life While many dream of an afterlife, people with apeirophobia are terrified of eternal existence. Caitlin Cadieux and Daniel Lombroso Feb 8, 2017 About the Author Matthew Hutson is a science writer based in New York City. He is the author of The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking. Most Popular Presented by Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement Rosie Gray White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is reportedly a reader of neoreactionary political theory. A tour through the pro-authoritarian philosophy gaining visibility on the right. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been in contact via intermediaries with Curtis Yarvin, Politico Magazine reported this week. Yarvin, a software engineer and blogger, writes under the name Mencius Moldbug. His anti-egalitarian arguments have formed the basis for a movement called “neoreaction.” The main thrust of Yarvin’s thinking is that democracy is a bust; rule by the people doesn’t work, and doesn’t lead to good governance. He has described it as an “ineffective and destructive” form of government, which he associates with “war, tyranny, destruction and poverty.” Yarvin’s ideas, along with those of the English philosopher Nick Land, have provided a structure of political theory for parts of the white-nationalist movement calling itself the alt-right. The alt-right can be seen as a political movement; neoreaction, which adherents refer to as NRx, is a philosophy. At the core of that philosophy is a rejection of democracy and an embrace of autocratic rule. Continue Reading Jeffrey Smith How to Build an Autocracy David Frum The preconditions are present in the U.S. today. Here’s the playbook Donald Trump could use to set the country down a path toward illiberalism. It’s 2021, and President Donald Trump will shortly be sworn in for his second term. The 45th president has visibly aged over the past four years. He rests heavily on his daughter Ivanka’s arm during his infrequent public appearances. Fortunately for him, he did not need to campaign hard for reelection. His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains. The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies and his TrumpWorks infrastructure program.

There might be no getting around what Albert Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” With an experiment described this week in Physical Review Letters—a feat that involved harnessing starlight to control measurements of particles shot between buildings in Vienna—some of the world’s leading cosmologists and quantum physicists are closing the door on an intriguing alternative to “quantum entanglement.” “Technically, this experiment is truly impressive,” said Nicolas Gisin, a quantum physicist at the University of Geneva who has studied this loophole around entanglement. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Who Will Be the First Victim of White House Chaos? David A. Graham Michael Flynn reportedly misled the vice president about conversations with Russia. Sean Spicer has never found his stride. Kellyanne Conway is in Congress’s sights. Welcome to Survivor: West Wing. It is a truth universally peddled by wisemen and -women in Washington, though not necessarily obeyed by presidents, that when the White House is in trouble, the best cure is to hoist the head of an adviser on a spike of the fence encircling the executive mansion. Firing—sorry, accepting the resignation of—an adviser makes for an easy way to demonstrate that the administration understands it has a problem and is working to fix it. That person doesn’t necessarily need to be the root of the problem, though it’s helpful if they’re at least somewhat involved. Other times, some bad press offers a useful pretext for pushing out someone who was already on thin ice. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Michael Flynn's Debacle David Frum Trump’s national security adviser’s potentially false statements about his pre-inauguration contacts with Russian officials are a major scandal. “This reminds me of the run-up to Iran- Contra.” The person offering that gloomy observation was a veteran of many years in and around the US defense community. Unusually for a person with such a background, he had been a Trump supporter even during the Republican primaries. Now, though, he was worried. The new National Security Council leadership was taking form—and he feared he saw history repeating itself. “The National Security Council,” he warned, “is not one executive body. It is a deliberative body.” But the new national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, obviously hungered to carry out policy, not merely preside over policy formation. That way lay the disaster that had befallen Reagan's national security advisers Bud Macfarlane and John Poindexter in the 1980s, who were convicted of lying to Congress about the administration selling arms to Iran to finance anti-communist militants in Nicaragua. Continue Reading Doane Gregory / Universal Studios Fifty Shades Darker: A Spoilereview Christopher Orr A blow-by-blow recounting of an awful, retrograde sequel “I want you back. We can renegotiate terms.” Ah, love. The above line is delivered to Anastasia Steele by Christian Grey near the beginning of Fifty Shades Darker, the second movie adaptation of the trilogy of zillion-selling erotic novels by Erika Mitchell (pen name E. L. James). But one imagines similar words being spoken by executives of Universal Pictures to Mitchell herself following the completion of the first installment in the series, Fifty Shades of Grey. That film was directed by the respected artist Sam (short for Samantha) Taylor-Johnson, and she and Mitchell reportedly fought over almost every aspect of the production, the latter having been granted uncommon creative control when she signed over the rights to her books. The result was a very bad movie, but one considerably less bad than the book it was based on. Continue Reading Daron Dean / Reuters Conflict Over Trump Forces Out an Opinion Editor at The Wall Street Journal Rosie Gray The departure follows weeks of reports of tension on the paper's news side about how to cover Trump. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial features editor has left the paper following tensions over the section drifting in a pro-Donald Trump direction. News of the departure of Mark Lasswell, who edited op-eds for the Journal, comes as the paper’s internal tensions over Trump have begun to spill into public view. The reliably hawkish, pro-trade, small government conservative Journal op-ed page has been challenged by the rise of the populist, nationalist Trump movement. The Journal’s opinion pages have been a showcase for the intra-right divide over Trump, featuring Trump-sympathetic writers like Bill McGurn alongside anti-Trump columnists such as Bret Stephens. Lasswell appears to be a casualty of that divide, and his dismissal a victory for the pro-Trump faction on the editorial staff. Continue Reading Mike Blake / Reuters 'Give Us Your Passwords' Kaveh Waddell What happens if border agents are allowed to demand access to your phone and online accounts—and turn you away if you don’t comply? “What sites do you visit? And give us your passwords.” That’s what U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly wants foreign visitors to hear before they’re allowed to enter the United States. “If they don’t want to give us that information, then they don’t come,” he said, while testifying in front of the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday. The suggestion was met with horror among privacy advocates. “With that kind of access, they can not only see what you’ve publicly posted, but things you haven't posted yet, private messages, private lists, they can impersonate you, and even do these things on accident,” wrote Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, on his website. “This kind of access is profoundly invasive.” Continue Reading Michal Novotný How Your Cat Is Making You Crazy Kathleen McAuliffe Jaroslav Flegr is no kook. And yet, for years, he suspected his mind had been taken over by parasites that had invaded his brain. So the prolific biologist took his science-fiction hunch into the lab. What he’s now discovering will startle you. Could tiny organisms carried by house cats be creeping into our brains, causing everything from car wrecks to schizophrenia? No one would accuse Jaroslav Flegr of being a conformist. A self-described “sloppy dresser,” the 53-year-old Czech scientist has the contemplative air of someone habitually lost in thought, and his still-youthful, square-jawed face is framed by frizzy red hair that encircles his head like a ring of fire. Certainly Flegr’s thinking is jarringly unconventional. Starting in the early 1990s, he began to suspect that a single-celled parasite in the protozoan family was subtly manipulating his personality, causing him to behave in strange, often self-destructive ways. And if it was messing with his mind, he reasoned, it was probably doing the same to others. The parasite, which is excreted by cats in their feces, is called Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii or Toxo for short) and is the microbe that causes toxoplasmosis—the reason pregnant women are told to avoid cats’ litter boxes. Since the 1920s, doctors have recognized that a woman who becomes infected during pregnancy can transmit the disease to the fetus, in some cases resulting in severe brain damage or death. T. gondii is also a major threat to people with weakened immunity: in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, before good antiretroviral drugs were developed, it was to blame for the dementia that afflicted many patients at the disease’s end stage. Healthy children and adults, however, usually experience nothing worse than brief flu-like symptoms before quickly fighting off the protozoan, which thereafter lies dormant inside brain cells—or at least that’s the standard medical wisdom. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters Trump Tried to Intimidate the Judges Over His Ban, and He Failed Garrett Epps Presidents have thought before that they could roll those wimpy-looking nerds with their gavels and robes. It usually doesn’t work out all that well. “Make this one out of cast-iron,” the late Judge John Butzner said to me one day in chambers. “There are going to be a lot of weasels sniffing around it.” I was Butzner’s clerk. He was assigning me to draft an opinion in a case on an abstruse point of federal law. No court had ever decided this particular question—and a lot of money was riding on the answer. Some judges on the Fourth Circuit would object to the result his panel had reached. Once Butzner’s opinion was published, they might try to persuade the other judges to rehear the case “en banc”—meaning on a bench including all members of the Circuit. It was a high-stress assignment, even though he gave me all the time I needed. Imagine the atmosphere in chambers this week as three Ninth Circuit judges and their clerks worked frantically to produce an opinion in Washington v. Trump—the case testing the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive orderbanning refugees from around the  world, and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

 'Like a painting' — How Apple's $5 billion campus was built Julia Love, Reuters Feb. 7, 2017, 9:05 AM 4,856 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's campus in January, 2017.Matthew Roberts/YouTube SAN FRANCISCO - Inside the original Macintosh computer, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs inscribed the signatures of his team, revealing his deep concern for even the hidden features of his products. His last work - Apple Inc's sprawling new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. - will be a fitting tribute: a futuristic campus built with astonishing attention to detail. From the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of a hidden pipe, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny. But constructing a building as flawless as a hand-held device is no easy feat, according interviews with nearly two dozen current and former workers on the project, most of whom would not be named because they signed non-disclosure agreements. Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded: Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project. A lengthy approval process with the city contributed to the delay. Apple has not revealed the total price tag, but former project managers estimate it at about $5 billion - a figure CEO Tim Cook did not dispute in a 2015 TV interview. More than $1 billion was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. For all the time and money sunk into the project, some in the architecture community question whether Apple has focused on the right ends. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at U.C. Berkeley. Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. "It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company," she said. "They are creating an icon." An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. World's largest piece of curved glass YouTube/Duncan Sinfield Tech companies have long favored generic office parks, which allow them to lease and shed space through booms and busts. Jobs' unveiling of what's formally known as Apple Campus 2, months before his death, marked a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. When completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees, according to the 2013 project description. The main building - which boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass - will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees. Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact as the land passed from tech giant to tech giant. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics. Apple's in-house construction team enforced many rules: No vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. Guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages. Tolerances, the distance materials may deviate from desired measurements, were a particular focus. On many projects, the standard is 1/8 of an inch at best; Apple often demanded far less, even for hidden surfaces. The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said. "With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances," he said. "You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam." The project, which generated about 13,000 full-time construction jobs, took a toll on contractors. The original general contractors, Skanska USA and DPR Construction, left after work began, which construction experts called a rare development for a project of such scale. The reasons for the departures are unclear, and neither Apple nor the firms would comment. Faithful to design principles  A leaked photo of the interior.Apple/MacG.co Apple's novel approach to the building took many forms. Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products. The elevator buttons struck some workers as resembling the iPhone's home button; one former manager even likened the toilet's sleek design to the device. But de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. "They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles," de la Torre said. Fanatical attention to detail is a key tenet. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. Thus, each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. "The things you can't see, they all mattered to Apple," the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm. The rationale? If engineers had to adjust their gait while entering the building, they risked distraction from their work, according to a former construction manager. "We spent months trying not to do that because that's time, money and stuff that's never been done before," the former construction manager said. Time and time again, Apple managers spent months perfecting minute features, creating a domino effect that set back other parts of the project, former construction managers say. Signage required a delicate balancing act: Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency. Dirk Mattern, a retired deputy fire chief who is representing the Santa Clara County Fire Department on the project, estimated he attended 15 meetings that touched on the topic. "I've never spent so much time on signage," he said.   Like a painting  When Apple tapped general contractors Holder Construction and Rudolph & Sletten to finish the main building in 2015, one of the first orders of business was finalizing a door handle for conference rooms and offices. After months of back and forth, construction workers presented their work to a manager from Apple's in-house team, who turned the sample over and over in his hands. Finally, he said he felt a faint bump. The construction team double-checked the measurements, unable to find any imperfections - down to the nanometer. Still, Apple insisted on another version. The construction manager who was so intimately involved in the door handle did not see its completion. Down to his last day, Apple was still fiddling with the design - after a year and a half of debate. When construction wraps, the only fingerprints on the site will be Jobs'. Workers often had to wear gloves to avoid marring the delicate materials, said Brett Davis, regional director of the District Council 16 union for painters and related crafts. "It's like a painting that you don't want to touch," he said. "It's definitely going to be something to see, if they let you in."

 Apple once built a $7,500 Mac that was delivered by limo — and the first thing Steve Jobs did as CEO was kill it Matt Weinberger Feb. 7, 2017, 2:43 PM 12,879 facebook linkedin twitter email print This year marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, leaving the world to wonder if Apple is going to pull something special out of its sleeves with this year's much-anticipated new model.  But back in 1997, right when it looked like the company was about to completely implode, Apple was celebrating another anniversary. It had been twenty years since Apple had officially incorporated, and it marked the occasion with the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, or TAM. The TAM, retailing for a whopping $7,499, was an all-in-one PC, kind of a spiritual ancestor of the iMac, back when the whole idea of a monitor that contains the computer was totally crazy. It was designed by a young Jony Ive, who would go on to become Apple's resident creative genius. Take a look: WIkimedia Commons If you feel like you've seen this before, you might be right. Jerry's apartment sported a Twentieth Anniversary Mac during the final season of "Seinfeld," and Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred had one in "Batman & Robin." Apple history holds that the TAM started as a prototype for a mass-market consumer device, but then-Apple CEO Gil Amelio and his executives rushed it to market as a luxury novelty. This little monster has some weird features, including a CD drive that would keep playing on the high-end Bose speakers even if your Mac crashed, an FM radio, a TV tuner card to watch cable television on the screen, and a leather palmrest on the keyboard.  The best and weirdest part is that if you paid the $7,499 for the Twentieth Anniversary Mac, Apple would hand-deliver it via limo and set it up for you, in a full-on concierge experience. The rumor is that your Apple deliveryperson would actually wear white gloves, to really hammer home the premium feeling. Jobs takes control The TAM was introduced at a crucial moment in Apple's history: Cofounder Steve Jobs had just come back to Apple as a "consultant" following 11 years in exile, after Amelio masterminded the purchase of his startup NeXT for $429 million. Amelio was betting big on Jobs — Sun and others had previously passed on a bid to buy up Apple for a meager $6 per share, and the company was facing the very real threat of insolvency. In January 1997, Amelio hosted a Macworld keynote intended in large part to reintroduce Jobs to Apple fans, concluding with the unveiling of the Twentieth Anniversary Mac. That three-hour keynote is widely regarded as a complete disaster, with the New Yorker describing a visibly nervous Amelio's performance as "unrehearsed." Meanwhile, Jobs got a standing ovation. Watch the very long highlight reel from that Macworld here: The Twentieth Anniversary Mac launched in March 1997. By that July 4th weekend, Jobs had convinced Apple's board to oust Amelio and give him control — winning out over Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who famously wanted the job.  And one of the very first things Jobs did was kill the Twentieth Anniversary Mac and institute price cuts to clear out the final stock. The price was cut to $3,500, and then by March 1998, down to $1,995. All in all, the TAM only sold 12,000 units. The conventional wisdom is that Steve Jobs thought it was a symbol of Apple's out-of-control excess and lack of focus. The TAM was a casualty, along with the Newton eMate PDA and the Apple QuickTake digital camera. Jobs also reportedly told Ive that he never wanted Apple to make a television again. Still, the weird legacy of the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh lives on, as Jobs and Ive would collaborate on the very first iMac, a hit that would bring Apple back to profitability. The very first iMac was released a mere five months after the TAM was fully taken off the market in 1998. And the rest, as they say, is history.

 Apple, Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter have legally opposed Trump's travel ban Shona Ghosh Feb. 6, 2017, 4:00 AM 6,324 facebook linkedin twitter email print People protest against President Donald Trump's travel ban in New York. Thomson Reuters Legal challenges to President Donald Trump's travel ban are flying in thick and fast. The latest is a brief from 97 tech firms, including Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Google, filed Sunday as part of a case brought by Minnesota and Washington state against the ban, which temporarily bars travel to the US from citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and from all refugees as the US reviews its vetting procedures. The companies have filed an amicus brief, a legal document that can be filed by parties that have a strong interest in the case but aren't directly taking part. According to Bloomberg, the brief outlines the importance of immigrants to the US economy. It says: "Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies. America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants—through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country." Other companies listed include Netflix, Spotify, Lyft, and LinkedIn. Amazon is not among the companies on the amicus brief, but executives at the company have filed legal documents acknowledging that some Amazon employees would be directly affected by the ban. Tesla is also missing from the list. CEO Elon Musk sits on Trump's business advisory council, which had its first meeting Friday. The meeting is not public, and Musk subsequently tweeted that he had put immigration top of the agenda. At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2017 Uber does appear on the list. CEO Travis Kalanick dropped out of Trump's council a day before its first meeting after a massive outcry among Uber's users. Trump's team is appealing the case in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after a federal judge temporarily suspended the travel ban last week. Trump used Twitter over the weekend to attack the judge, James Robart, calling his decision "ridiculous." The appeals court is expected to decide on Monday on whether to block Robart's order.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides MWC 2017 LG G6 Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch iOS 10.3 News MacBook Pro 2017 release date, news and rumors MacBook Pro 2017 release date, news and rumors By Joe Osborne Laptops   Plus, what we want to see from Apple’s next pro laptop Shares Apple released its massively updated, new MacBook Pro in October 2016 to an awfully mixed crowd of press and general public alike. The device’s new Touch Bar wowed, whereas its price for the parts inside certainly did not. Just four months since that tumultuous release, reports and rumors of what Apple’s MacBook Pro 2017 follow-up will be like have surfaced, and all signs point to better parts for the price. However, there is also so much that we don’t know, so check back on this space every once in a while, as we’ll be updating it with the latest regarding the would-be 2017 MacBook Pro. Cut to the chase What is it? The new MacBook Pro’s successor When is it out? Anywhere between spring and fall 2017 What will it cost? Likely as much as – if not more than – current models Anticipate seeing the Touch Bar on the next MacBook Pro models MacBook Pro 2017 release date Sadly, this is one of the facets to the new MacBook Pro story that we know very little about. The closest thing to an idea is a report from famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that the next MacBook Pro models will go into production in Q3 2017, so around July. That would logically place the new MacBook Pro in an October 2017 release window, which would make a whole lot of sense considering when the updated MacBook Pro released in 2016. (Hint: it was in October.) However, Apple has debuted new MacBooks in the past during the months of March and April as well as during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. Without an alluring email invitation from Apple, anything is possible. MacBook Pro 2017 price Considering the backlash to the price hike we saw coming from the generation of MacBook Pro’s into the current one, we wouldn’t expect to see major changes in MacBook Pro pricing. Of course, we wouldn’t anticipate them coming down in price by comparison. That would just be ludicrous. So, it would be safe to expect the next line of MacBook Pro models to start at $1,499, £1,449 or AU$2,199 – starting with the lowest-power, non-Touch 13-inch model – and top out around $2,799, £2.699 or AU$4,249 for the highest-end, 15-inch model with Touch Bar. Then again, Apple has a way of introducing new, exciting features to dull the blow of an increased price, if last year is any indication. In this age of Apple, be prepared for a wild, new feature that could potentially drive the price up. The 2016 MacBook Pro in an exploded view (Image: © iFixit) MacBook Pro 2017 specs Probably the biggest point of discussion regarding the new MacBook Pro is what Apple will choose to place inside. This is one of the most divisive points surrounding the current range of MacBook Pro’s and continues to be so as long as Apple continues its particular trend of price per part. The current line of MacBook Pro’s has been criticized for its low RAM, or memory, threshold of 16GB as well as its use of “dated” 6th generation (Skylake) Intel Core i-series processors. Naturally, the latest rumor surrounding the would-be new MacBook Pro is that it will contain both the latest, 7th generation ( Kaby Lake) Intel Core i-series chips as well as room for up to 32GB of RAM. These details were first brought to the public via the same aforementioned report in which Ming Chi-Kuo projected the release window for the new MacBook Pro’s. But since, evidence of these Kaby Lake-equipped models has allegedly appeared within the code of the macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta – the one currently underway, as of this writing. Further to this scuttlebutt regarding what will be inside the new MacBook Pro’s is a Bloomberg report citing sources with claims that Apple is working on its very own Mac processor to work in tandem with Intel chips for future Mac products.  According to the report, this chip will be a logical extension of the ARM-based T1 processor currently used to power the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. This chip would reportedly take on more power management tasks that Intel's processors currently handle, with the goal of increasing battery life. For starters, we'd like to see even sharper screens MacBook Pro 2017: what we want to see Beyond these reports, we know little else about what the new MacBook Pro will be capable of. Of course, we’ve drafted up a brief wish list for Apple’s next pro-bent laptop. Longer battery life This is no doubt low-hanging fruit, but being one of the primary complaints lobbed toward Apple for the MacBook Pro’s of today, we couldn’t help ourselves. After all, Apple once prided itself on the longevity of its laptops. And, the firm has quite a lot going for it in this direction. Between rumors of more power-efficient Kaby Lake processors inside and those of a special power management chip, longer battery life should be in the bag for the new MacBook Pro. Sharper screens Apple no doubt spurred the obsession with screen resolution in all consumer electronics once it unleashed its “Retina” screen standard years ago with the iPhone 4. But, the rest of the technology world has at last caught up to the firm’s screen sharpness. Frankly, in computing, Apple’s Retina display was surpassed years ago, and it’s about time that its standards for “Retina” were updated. Especially for the price, the new MacBook Pro’s should come sporting 3,200 x 1,800 QHD+ displays at least – and that’s at 13.3 inches. Naturally, what we’ll see is some incredibly particular resolution that hovers around industry standards but doesn’t get too close. Jokes aside, it’s time for sharper MacBook Pro screens. More (and more varied) ports Throwing a glut of Thunderbolt 3 ports, while impressive, at a laptop doesn’t solve the users’ problem of not having compatible connectors or accessories to use them with. To that end, we need to see either more variety in the ports that the new MacBook Pro offers or for Apple to include more adapters in the box. Professional users need to be bridged between where they are technologically right now and where a creator like Apple envisions them being in the next few years. At the very least, a few more USB-C adapters would go a long way. These are the best laptops that the new MacBook Pro is up against Tags MacBook Pro ABOUT THE AUTHOR Joe Osborne Joe has worked in games and technology media for nearly a decade for several publications.

 Apple beat Samsung in smartphone shipments for the first time in 5 years Eugene Kim Feb. 6, 2017, 3:18 PM 5,902 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Apple reclaimed the top spot of the smartphone market last quarter for the first time since 2011, in large part due to the release of new iPhones and Samsung's exploding Galaxy Note 7s. According to new data from IDC charted for us by Statista, Apple shipped 78.3 million units in the fourth quarter, up 4.7% year-over-year, and slightly surpassed Samsung's 77.5 million units shipped. IDC pointed to the success of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus for Apple's comeback. Apple, in fact, had a record for iPhone sales last quarter, although for the full year, it saw declining iPhone shipments for the first time in 2016. Samsung's exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones likely played a part too, as Samsung previously disclosed the "Batterygate" cost it $3 billion in lost sales.

Trump's January 27 executive order temporarily barred entry into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority nations as well as suspending the US refugee program, sparking protests and chaos at US and overseas airports. On Friday, a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked the order. The Trump administration had a deadline on Monday to justify its action at the appeals court.

Refugee resettlement also resumed. The companies, backing a lawsuit brought against the ban by Washington state, argued that Trump's order created uncertainty for companies depending on talent from overseas and global business travel to innovate and create jobs in the United States.

"Multinational companies will have strong incentives ... to base operations outside the United States or to move or hire employees and make investments abroad." "Ultimately, American workers and the economy will suffer as a result," the companies argued.

In its response to the lawsuit, the government argued in legal filings that the president was exercising his constitutional authority to control US borders and that the law allows him to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners who "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States." The Department of Justice declined to comment beyond the filed court papers. The government had until Monday afternoon (Pacific Standard Time) to submit additional legal briefs to the appeals court in support of the executive order. Following that, the court was expected to act quickly. A decision either way may ultimately result in the case reaching the US Supreme Court. The brief filed by the companies hailed the contributions inclusive immigration policies have made to the American economy. It claimed that immigrants or their children have founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. In addition to some of the companies filing the brief, the attorneys pointed to companies such as Kraft, Ford, General Electric, AT&T, McDonald's, Boeing , and Walt Disney. "Collectively, these companies generate annual revenue of $US4.2 trillion ($5.5 trillion), and employ millions of Americans," the brief said. Susan Cohen an attorney at Mintz Levin in Boston who represents big companies in immigration matters, including global information company and Reuters parent Thomson Reuters, said lawyers were advising clients to get to the United States as quickly as possible because the current situation allowing travel could change. She said that businesses were going out of their way to provide the most up-to-date information to their employees as the fast-moving court battle developed. "Many businesses are extremely upset and confused," Cohen said. "They don't know if meetings will be able to go forward or they will be able to bring people in for work. They can't plan."  Reuters Advertisement HuffPost Australia Government Plans To Slash Youth ... Contains: External link Dick Pratt's Family Donated Way More To ...

Elyse Betters7 February 2017Headphones Apple W1-enabled Beats X will launch in black and white colours They'll be available in US and UK on 10 Feb for $149/£130 For iOS 10 users, the W1 offers one-step Bluetooth pairing Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment When Apple unveiled the AirPods last autumn, it also showed off a custom-designed W1 chip specifically for wireless headphones. Now, months later, Apple-owned Beats is launching the $149 Beats X, and naturally, they're equipped with W1. The new wireless headphones -- like the W1 chip -- were announced last September. A number of delays have pushed back their launch date, making the Beats X the last in the first round of W1-enabled headphones to become available. The first ones were the Beats Solo 3, Powerbeats 3, and Apple AirPods. Here's everything you need to know about W1 and Beats X. What makes Apple W1-enabled headphones different? It's weird to think about headphones launching with their own chips and the ability to get firmware updates over the air, but that's the high-tech world we live in now, thanks to companies like Apple. Apple's W1 chip is unique because it simplifies wireless Bluetooth pairing by automatically prompting you to connect through a paired iPhone, and then it shares pairing data with all your other iCloud-connected accessories and headphones. The proprietary chip also improves connectivity and range over standard Bluetooth. According to Apple AirPod's website, the W1 chip "produces extremely efficient wireless for a better connection and improved sound" while also managing battery life so that you can listen for five hours on a charge. Meanwhile, optical sensors and motion accelerometers work with the W1 chip to "automatically control the audio and engage the microphone, giving you the ability to use one or both AirPods". This wireless technology also enables the AirPods to play sound as soon as they’re in your ears. How do Apple W1-enabled headphones work? The first thing you do when you get a pair of W1-headphones such as the Beats X is turn it on next to your unlocked iOS 10-powered iPhone or iPad, then click "connect" to seamlessly pair it with any other Apple gadget that's signed in to your iCloud account. From there, switching from iPhone to Mac and back takes a click. You can learn more about how Apple AirPods work, specifically, from Pocket-lint's in-depth review. The W1 chip basically just makes Bluetooth a lot more user-friendly. While it debuted on the AirPods last autumn, it's also available for the Beats Solo 3 Wireless, Powerbeats 3, and new Beats X. In many ways, all these W1-enabled headphones are standard Bluetooth headsets. They'll work with any Android phone, Windows PC, or whatever other type of gadget you might happen to have lying around. But you'll get the most bang for your buck if you use W1-enabled headphones with an Apple device like iPhone or Mac. When used with an Apple device, the W1 chip is supposed to significantly boost your range. You should be able to vacuum your entire house with your phone still charging in a room, and you won't lose any audio. And because of the optimisation technology, you'll get a greatly extended battery life. With the W1, Apple is trying to provide something different and convenient, as well as something that encourages you to buy Apple devices. The W1's it-just-works experience is meant to sway you from an Androids and PCs. When will the W1-enabled Beats X be available? The $149 (£129.95) Beats X will be available for purchase in the US and UK on 10 February. The shipping date was announced by the Beats Twitter account. You can get them in black or white at launch, with blue and grey versions coming at a later date. They promise up to 8 hours of playback from a battery charged via a Lightning port. They also feature a "Flex-Form cable" and magnetic ear buds, both of which allows them to hang tangle-free around your neck. And they easily coil into a case for storage.

Samsung patent case sent back to lower courts to determine if damages retrial is necessary Chance Miller - Feb. 7th 2017 3:13 pm PT @ChanceHMiller AAPL Company Samsung View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In what has become a never-ending patent battle, a federal appeals court on Tuesday ordered that the Apple v. Samsung case be sent back to a lower court. As noted by CNET, the district court will decide whether or not to hold another damage retrial or settle the case in another fashion. The Samsung v. Apple case will be sent back to where it originally started back in 2012, the Northern District Court of California. Today’s ruling comes two months after the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that damages for design patent infringement shall only be based on the affected components rather than the entire product. Siding with Samsung, that ruling stated that an “article of manufacture” may be a component of a device but not the whole device. The Supreme Court, however, didn’t offer decision on whether or not Samsung’s design infringements affected a component or the entire device. Prior to that, a lower court had decided on $399 million in damages owed to Apple by Samsung, but it’s now unclear as to how much Samsung will owe Apple. There are a few possibilities that could emerge from the lower court’s decision. It could rule that another damage retrial is needed to adjust the damage amount based on the Supreme Court ruling. On the other hand, it could rule that the $399 million is an apt amount. “Trial courts are well suited for this type of analysis, so it makes sense that the Federal Circuit — rather than create a procedure from whole-cloth — would like to see how the trial court approaches the problem,” said Case Collard, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney. “On remand, the trial court should consider the parties’ arguments in light of the trial record and determine what additional proceedings, if any, are needed,” it said. “If the court determines that a new damages trial is necessary, it will have the opportunity to set forth a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture for purposes of [Section 289 of the Patent Act of 1952] and to apply that test to this case.” As for when to expect a new ruling, that’s unclear. But we’ll be sure to have the details when they come. Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

Announced back in September alongside the iPhone 7, the BeatsX were originally slated to be released sometime during the fall, but were then pushed back. Now that we have a solid release date, and that AirPods are on the market as well, do you plan on purchasing the BeatsX? Or has the delay caused you to look at other options such as Apple’s own AirPods? Take Our Poll The BeatsX differ from AirPods in that the aren’t truly wireless, but rather connected by a cord between each bud, much like offerings such as the Jaybird X2 and Powerbeats3. The BeatsX also feature an in-ear bud design, which some users find to be more comfortable than the AirPods design. The BeatsX do, however, use Apple’s new W1 chip to make pairing between devices much easier between devices. The BeatsX mark the fourth pair of headphones on the market to support W1, following the Beats Solo3, Powerbeats 3, and Apple’s AirPods. Personally, I plan on purchasing a pair of BeatsX earbuds despite already owning a pair of AirPods. I don’t necessarily intend on keeping both pairs, however, and will likely sell or return the pair I like least. While I have been pleased with AirPods, I’m curious to see how the sound quality compares between them and the BeatsX. I also sometimes have difficulty keeping AirPods in my ears during exercise. One of the biggest reasons some might prefer BeatsX over AirPods is for their in-ear design. While the majority of 9to5Mac readers said their AirPods stayed in for the most part, there’s still a large untapped market of users who can’t wear Apple’s headphones. For those, the BeatsX might be the perfect solution. Other features of BeatsX include Fast Fuel, which gives the earbuds 2 hours of playback in 5 minutes of charging, as well as magnetic design for keeping them tangle-free. When released this coming Friday, February 10th, BeatsX will come in at $149, making them $10 cheaper than Apple’s AirPods. Do you plan on purchasing a pair of BeatsX?

It has always been about providing real choice and real competition for consumers and facilitating innovation and investment in the digital wallet functionality available to Australians.” The comments follow a submission by Apple lodged with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) praising the competition watchdog’s draft ruling proposing to deny a request by a group of some of Australia’s largest banks to collectively negotiate with Apple on the terms of the Apple Pay platform. In its submission, Apple suggested that the attempt by the local banks to collectively negotiate on Apple Pay terms could be viewed as a sort of “Trojan Horse” manoeuvre used to normalise the public’s acceptance of new mobile payment fees. “Apple has been puzzled by the applicant banks’ logically inconsistent argument that they wish to have the ability to charge consumers per transaction fees for using Apple Pay, but are unlikely to be able to do so owing to competition from other issuers like ANZ who do not,” Apple said in its submission. “Perhaps the explanation might be that it is perceived by the applicant banks as a way of introducing and then proliferating a new revenue stream in the digital payments age." Now, the banks have reiterated their previous claim that their fight to form an authorised cartel to negotiate on Apple Pay terms is about competition in the local contactless payments market. “Our application remains focused on providing Australian consumers with real choice and better outcomes for mobile payments, mobile wallets, and a range of other potentially NFC-powered functions such as public transport, airlines, store loyalty and rewards programs, and many more applications yet to be developed,” payments specialist and spokesperson on behalf of the banks, Lance Blockley, said. Read more Apple attacks Aussie banks over “Trojan Horse” manoeuvre “This is about the future of mobile payments in Australia. Will it be ‘Apple's way or no way’, or a genuine level playing field so all consumers can have the best digital services, no matter what device they own." The latest war of words follows months of lobbying on the part of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac, National Australia Bank (NAB), Bendigo and Adelaide Bank for permission from the ACCC to essentially form an authorised cartel to negotiate terms on the Apple Pay platform, which gives iPhone owners the ability to use their phones for contactless payments. The ACCC released its draft ruling on the proposed cartel authorisation last year, with ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, saying at the time that, “while the ACCC accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited”.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Guest Why mobile app stores are on their way out Jonathan Lister, PensionBee@jayfresh February 7, 2017 3:15 PM Tags: App Store, google play, Jonathan Lister Above: The Google Play Store. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google announced last week an upcoming change to its Android mobile phone operating system that threatens the future of its own mobile app store, Google Play. And the resulting shift is likely to threaten Apple’s App Store, too. It is likely that in 2018 or 2019, we will no longer perceive a difference between a website and a mobile app, and we’ll wonder how Apple and Google ever managed to control the market for mobile apps so completely. The new feature on Android lets users “install” web pages from the Chrome web browser so that, for all practical purposes, they look just like apps downloaded from the Google Play store. This is a significant improvement in a feature that has been available from the earliest days of smartphones  — the iPhone launched in 2007 with the ability to “save to Homescreen,” creating shortcuts for your favorite websites, but it never took off. To pay or not to pay For developers hoping to create native app-like experiences from these “homescreen apps,” there has never been anything like feature-parity between apps downloaded from app stores and those saved from websites. Even when the homescreen apps have been technically adequate for the job, the poor usability around installation and poor visibility on phones has been a barrier to adoption (particularly on Android where a homescreen app doesn’t even make it into the main “apps” menu). So homescreen apps have always been the poor cousin of native apps, making native apps the only viable choice for most companies, despite bold examples like the Financial Times pursuing the homescreen app route since 2011. One of the major stumbling blocks for many businesses adopting homescreen apps has been the lack of integration with Android Pay and Apple Pay, the built-in payment technologies on Android and iOS. These take the pain out of mobile payments by allowing customers to verify an online transaction using their fingerprint, rather than having to type in card details over and over again. Last summer, Apple announced it was integrating Apple Pay into Safari, which would allow creators of ordinary websites to take advantage of the technology. Google made a similar announcement in the autumn. An app by any other name As a customer of a personal finance service, there are some key tasks you’re looking to achieve: track your money, make payments, securely upload and receive documents. For many businesses, the recent integration of Android Pay and Apple Pay into homescreen apps fills a significant gap. Given that mobile is a significant driver of traffic to e-commerce websites, anything that makes it simpler to complete a purchase in the moment will be rapidly rolled out. And with last week’s Google announcement closing the usability gap between native and homescreen apps, app stores will be less important when it comes to rolling out better mobile experiences to our customers. Everyone likes a prediction, so here is mine: The next six months are going to see major brands shifting their attention to developing and releasing mobile web apps and canceling planned updates to their native apps. By the end of 2018, the mainstream consumer mindset will have shifted enough to make the oligopoly of Apple’s App Store and Google Play seem like ancient history.

Here's why it should be the other way around. Neil George Feb 7, 2017 2:58 PM EST Right now, there's a conundrum in the stock market. And if you can look beyond investor sentiment at the truth behind this puzzle, you could stand to profit. Both Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) released quarterly reports last week. According to Apple's results, the company is faced with a dwindling market share and shrinking margins. This should send up a red flag for investors, warning them to get out fast. But instead, investors are falling over themselves to grab more shares, sending shares of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company higher. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. See how Cramer rates the stock here. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL? Learn more now. On the other hand, Amazon reported its seventh consecutive quarter of profits, along with soaring revenue. Meanwhile, new research shows the company is responsible for 53% of all online sales growth in the U.S. But investors apparently can't wait to dump their shares of this e-commerce behemoth. Clearly, something is wrong here. My guess is that it has to do with the "church of Apple." Apple's fans and investors are like a cult, so enamored with the company that they don't read behind the lines in the company's earnings report. Yes, Apple sold 5% more iPhones year over year. But there's more than meets the eye here. Apple has pulled off a sleight of hand, changing the day count for the latest quarter by adding an extra week. That means some of those extra iPhone sales came from added days. Apple's got other troubles, as well. The gross margin was 38.5% in the latest quarter, down from 40.1% a year earlier. So while more iPhones and other gadgets were sold, the company's gross margin actually fell by 2.6 percentage points. Perhaps Apple would do well by not picking fights with -- or even suing -- its suppliers, including Samsung Electronics, Qualcomm  (QCOM) and Foxconn Technology. But it gets worse. China is the world's largest cellphone market. Yet, here Apple recorded a 12% drop in sales for the quarter. The company's China market share has fallen to 9.6%. Meanwhile, Chinese smartphone makers Oppo, Huawei and Vivo each had better year-over-year performance than Apple during the fourth quarter. Moreover, worldwide, Apple is losing its market share, with only 11.5% of global cellphone users using Apple's iOS. Investors should be wary of Apple's faltering business.

Early: January-April Mid: May-August Late: September-December For example, when the original MacBook Pro with Retina display was released, Apple gave it a “Mid 2012” model name because it was released in June of that year. Up until the latest MacBook Pro, which were released in October of 2016, Apple continued this trend. However, Apple has dropped the “Late” part of “Late 2016” with this model. Apple blog Pike’s Universum reports (via MacRumors). Apple now refers to it as the “2016” model on its website, tech specs page, and in the latest macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta. There are a few exceptions to this rule, though. For example, the company still references it as the “Late-2016 MacBook Pro” on a few of its support documents. Given that Apple only refreshed the MacBook Pro once last year, it makes sense for Apple to drop the title. However, the company still references the 12-inch MacBook as “MacBook, Early 2016” even though it only has a yearly refresh cycle thus far. Same thing goes for the “Mid 2014” MacBook Pro, with it being the only MacBook Pro refresh for that year.

How exactly do you get started? And can you really move all of your important files over easily? Here's everything you need to know about switching from Mac to Windows. Image: Gizmodo The first point to make is that Windows and macOS are still pretty different operating systems, and you may well hit a few bumps in the road as you make the switch. It's certainly much easier to do for someone who spends all their time in a browser, for example, than someone heavily invested in the likes of Pages and Numbers. With that in mind, it's a good idea to take stock of what you need to move before you get started in earnest. It might be better for you to use your old macOS machine alongside a new Windows 10 device, at least for a while, until you've got the kinks ironed out. We should also note that we're concentrating on the most recent versions of macOS Sierra and Windows 10 for the purposes of this guide, just for the sake of space and simplicity. A lot of the same points will still apply to older versions of the OSes, however, even if the details are different. Photos and videos Image: Screenshot Few things will confuse a veteran Windows user more than a glance at the way macOS and its Photos app arrange pictures and videos on the local drive. Apple's basically wont organise photos in folders — the whole system is proprietary and pretty opaque — which is fine if you love Apple's approach but not so great if you want to switch to Windows. The good news is iCloud for Windows can download all your pictures, assuming you're using iCloud and not just keeping all your photos and videos stored locally on your Mac. You can also download them direct from the iCloud web interface, though it's not the quickest or most elegant of solutions. If you can't use iCloud as a go-between, use the File, Export, and Export Unmodified Original option in Photos on your Mac to get pictures to a FAT32-formatted external hard drive that will work with both macOS and Windows. If you've got thousands of files to move over, you might be waiting a while. Image: Screenshot Instead of paying for an external hard drive, you could pay for some storage space on Google Drive or Dropbox and sync your files over the web instead. The Google Photos uploader for macOS will spot your Photos library straight away, and you can use the Google Drive desktop client for Windows to get everything on your PC. Just make sure there's a Google Photos folder visible in Google Drive, which you can set from the Google Drive settings on the web. In the case of Dropbox, there's not yet integrated support for a macOS Photos library, but you can still export your files to your Dropbox folder, and sync them from there. iTunes, music and movies Image: Screenshot iTunes is on Windows of course, and as soon as you verify your Apple ID credentials, you should be able to download and watch or listen to anything you've purchased through the iTunes Store on your PC. Don't forget to unregister your Mac as one of the machines linked to your Apple ID, if you're getting rid of it. For music and movies you've imported yourself, the process is less straightforward — again you're relying on an external drive or a syncing service, as we talked about above, to get all your files from one place to the other. You can find where your iTunes folder is located by choosing Preferences from the iTunes menu then opening the Advanced tab. Everything you need will be in this folder, as long as you've got the Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library box ticked. Image: Screenshot If you haven't, you need to consolidate your library first. You can do this by choosing File, Library, Organise Library, and then ticking the Consolidate files box. If you've forked out for a Pro account (or you have a small library) then Dropbox can sync your iTunes library from one machine to another, but it's a method only for the brave. You'll need to have all your music and video content in the designated Media folders, and you need to then point iTunes (on Windows) to your newly synced library inside Dropbox by holding down Shift when you launch the program. The benefit is you get all your metadata (such as playlists and play counts) carried over at the same time, but it can get tricky, and you have to remember to keep just one instance of iTunes open at any one time to avoid conflicts. If you want to give it a go, there are guides on the web to lend a hand. Applications and documents Image: Screenshot The web life — making use of apps such as Netflix and Spotify — certainly pays off when it comes to switching from Mac to Windows or back again. The likes of Gmail and Amazon Video and so on will of course work wherever you have access to a web browser. Chrome, Firefox and Opera are available on Windows and macOS, though Apple has pretty much given up on Safari on Windows, so you're going to have to leave it behind. Make sure you've exported any bookmarks you need before you go (if necessary, install Chrome, Firefox, or Opera on your Mac first, copy the bookmarks, then sync with Windows). Given Apple's reluctance to release its software on other platforms, you're going to have to say goodbye to applications like iWork and GarageBand. On Windows you can turn to either LibreOffice or Microsoft Office for your productivity needs, while LMMS is a good (and free) alternative to GarageBand on Windows. Image: Screenshot Earlier, we mentioned doing an audit of your system before you switch, and weighing up which applications you're going to lose access to are an important part of this. While Adobe Photoshop is available on both platforms, for example, smaller but well-loved programs such as Day One or Ulysses aren't. Moving personal documents is pretty straightforward: again, you can use a FAT32-formatted external hard drive or a syncing service like Dropbox to get everything from one machine to another. If you're using iCloud on your Mac, iCloud for Windows will move files from all the key folders open for you. Getting those files open is much more of a challenge. Files from apps like Pages and KeyNote just won't open on a PC, so you really need to save them in compatible formats before you ditch your Mac. If you forget, you can download them in alternative formats (such as PDF and Microsoft Office) from iCloud on the web. Emails, contacts and calendars Image: Screenshot Don't forget your emails and contacts in the move. If you're already on a webmail system like Gmail, you're all set. Alternatively, if you're just using iCloud, you can enter the relevant mailbox settings to get a matching inbox in Outlook or whatever your client is on Windows. If you get iCloud for Windows up and running, and you use Outlook on your Windows machine, then emails, contacts, and calendar information can be synced across for you without too much difficulty. The iCloud email system works via IMAP, which means the same messages appear wherever you've set it up — delete an email in one client, and it disappears from the others too (including web clients like Gmail). Note that if you've set up two-step authentication on your Apple account (and you really should), you'll need to head to the account on the web to create app-specific passwords for your new email clients. Image: Screenshot It's when you've got years of emails in Apple Mail and not in iCloud that you want to take with you that it gets complicated. Mailboxes can be exported from Apple Mail (Mailbox, Export Mailbox), but not in a format that Windows clients can understand. Your best bet might be to try a third-party tool like Emailchemy to run a conversion for you, but you'll usually have to pay. If you don't want to take the iCloud for Windows and Outlook route for your contacts and calendars, you need to take the old-fashioned export and import route: there are export options in both the Contacts app for Mac (File, Export) and iCloud on the web (select all your contacts then click the cog icon and Export vCard). There's no option to export calendars in iCloud on the web but you can do it from the Calendars app on the Mac machine you're about to leave behind: click File then Export then Export again. You'll get an .ics file you can then import into Google Calendar or somewhere else (if you are switching to Google services, this might be helpful). What about my iPhone? Image: Screenshot If you're ditching your Mac and sticking with your iPhone, you'll find Windows isn't quite as friendly but is still prepared to make an effort, thanks to all the Microsoft apps now available for iOS (you can even install Cortana on your iPhone if you want to). In the Windows 10 taskbar search box, type "phone companion" and click the top result that appears. Select iPhone or iPad from the app that appears and Windows will guide you through the process of getting emails, photos, files, and more synced between iPhone and PC, mostly using Microsoft's own apps. For those of you who don't want your hands held quite so much, you can set up all kinds of custom configurations. Simply switching to Google apps (if you haven't already) is a good idea, as all the emails, contacts, and calendars on your phone can then be accessed from any computer with a web browser. Image: Screenshot You can use the likes of Dropbox or Google Photos to sync snaps from your iPhone, though if you want to stick with iCloud you can always use iCloud on the web and iCloud for Windows to manage everything, as we've already mentioned. The only downside is that Apple might not be as keen to keep its Windows software updated as Google is to keep improving its web apps. While Apple has done a lot to improve iOS-macOS integration in recent years, it's still relatively easy to use an iPhone with Windows, not least because iPhones are very much standalone devices these days. If you want to use iTunes syncing and backups, you can of course use the Windows version. There are an almost limitless variety of configurations here — depending on how your Mac is set up and how you want your new Windows machine to work — but we've hopefully given you some useful pointers on the biggest issues you're likely to face.

I have more issues every day on my MacPro at work than I have on my PC laptop at home in a year. We're still on El Capitan, and it's easily the most stable version I've ever used, but it is nowhere near as robust as Windows 10 on a decently specced PC. It is also much less user-friendly into the bargain, thanks to Apple's wanton removal of features it decides you don't need any more. e.g. In El Capitan, we can no longer play several Tb of stock footage that we've collected over the years, because Quicktime can no longer play anything using its own Animation codec. It can't even transcode it any more. It would be like Microsoft deciding that Windows Media Player woudl no longer be able to play WMV files. i.e. Utter madness.

Reuters/Regis Duvignau Good news, Apple fans. The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is reportedly going to start making the iPhone 8 earlier than expected. This year marks the 10th year anniversary of Apple’s iconic mobile phone, and the upcoming feature-packed flagship promises to have a grand launching. According to a new report, Apple may begin production of the iPhone 8 ahead of schedule. The company may start putting together the much anticipated smartphone as early as June, although it really doesn’t guarantee a pre-September release. John Donovan and Steve Mullane of research firm BlueFin Research Partners provided the new information that was first published by Barron’s Tech Trader Daily. “The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms, although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8/X,” the report stated. “Builds have been pulled in a few months while aggregate next generation forecasts have increased 10 percent from last month to 122 million. Additionally, AAPL has adjusted iPhone 7, 7 Plus and SE production downward in preparation for the next generation launch.” The authors said that the most recent update they received from their AAPL supply chain sources points out that no changes are made to the 50 million March quarter build forecast. They added that the attention of the supply chain remains primarily focused on the overwhelming anticipation for an iPhone 8/X super cycle tangled with certain mid-year transition hurdles. “Interestingly, our present reads suggest a 300 percent increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9 million,” said the authors. “As a result, overall June quarter builds have increased from 45 million to 48 million, with the sharp increase in iPhone 8 offset somewhat by modest declines in legacy models.” Fans expect great things and new features from the iPhone 8. Apple is reportedly boosting its all-important follow-up with specs and features not seen on previous models. These iPhone 8 innovations supposedly include an edge-to-edge OLED curved display, upgraded front and back cameras, an all glass back cover, wireless charging, advanced biometrics (including facial recognition and even iris scanning), the latest A11 chipset (which is said to be faster and more energy-efficient than the current A10 processor) and an IP68 rating (which would allow the phone to be submerged underwater 1.5 metres deep for half an hour with no problem).

He led sales teams charged with pushing Apple hardware and software to big companies and government agencies with large technology budgets. Apple confirmed his departure to Reuters, but refused to comment further. Solomon wouldn’t reveal why he left Apple either. It’s unclear if losing a key executive for business sales might slow Apple’s efforts to push its solutions to large businesses in recent years. Apple hasn’t hinted who Solomon’s replacement might be. Prior to joining the iPhone maker in 2015, Solomon was running Hewlett-Packard’s international consumer printing business for more than twenty years as the company’s General Manager of the Global Consumer Printing Unit. He’s credited with brokering some major deals during his tenure at Hewlett-Packard, including one providing hardware to the United States Air Force. Apple CEO Tim Cook began doubling-down on corporate sales with a major 2014 deal with IBM which led to the creation of custom-designed business apps for large corporate customers and increased deployment of iOS hardware. Last year, the Cupertino company struck a deal with networking giant Cisco that would let iPhones integrate more deeply with Cisco’s networking equipment. Also in 2016, Apple inked a deal with business software maker SAP to “revolutionize the mobile work experience for enterprise customers of all sizes.” The joint effort combines powerful native iOS apps with the cutting edge capabilities of SAP’s HANA platform. And later that same year, Apple and Deloitte formed a partnership to push further into the enterprise space and transform the way companies work using iOS devices. For context, Apple had about $25 billion in enterprise sales in 2015. “This is not a hobby,” Cook said of Apple’s enterprise efforts at the time.

Samsung legal battle goes back to its roots A federal appeals court says it's up to a district court to decide if there should be a damages retrial in the long-running patent case. Tech Industry by Shara Tibken February 7, 2017 1:41 PM PST @sharatibken An appeals court has ordered Apple v. Samsung back to a lower court in San Jose, California. Shara Tibken/CNET Apple v. Samsung Electronics is headed back to where it all began: district court in San Jose, California. A federal appeals court on Tuesday ordered that the long-running patent dispute be sent back to a lower court. That lower court, where the trials originally took place, will decide whether to hold another damages retrial or what other recourse to take. "We look forward to making our case at the district court and prevailing on behalf of all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace," Samsung said in a statement. Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple and Samsung have been battling over patents since 2012, and a question about how much money could be owed for infringing design patents made it all the way to the Supreme Court in late 2016. In December, the Supreme Court said in a unanimous opinion that damages for design patent infringement can be based only on the part of the device that infringed the patents, not necessarily on the entire product. Samsung wins in Supreme Court battle against Apple The ruling says that Samsung doesn't have to pay all its profits from sales of devices based on copied designs. by Lexy Savvides 1:14 Close Drag That ruling reshapes the value of designs, and how much one company has to pay for copying the look of a competitor's product. Before the ruling, the law said an award could be collected on the entire profits of an infringing device. In this case, that's the $399 million Samsung paid Apple late last year. The Supreme Court didn't give guidance on how damages should be decided, though, and now an appeals court isn't weighing in, either. With Tuesday's ruling, the US court of appeals for the federal circuit has punted the case back to district court for the Northern District of California.

Apple had asked for the appeals court to uphold the earlier damages ruling because Samsung never showed an "article of manufacture" to be anything other than an entire phone. Samsung, meanwhile, wanted the case sent back to district court for a new damages trial. Instead, the federal circuit said it will be up to the district court to decide if a new trial is needed. "On remand, the trial court should consider the parties' arguments in light of the trial record and determine what additional proceedings, if any, are needed," it said. "If the court determines that a new damages trial is necessary, it will have the opportunity to set forth a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture for purposes of [Section 289 of the Patent Act of 1952] and to apply that test to this case."

Apple Proposing A New, Lower-Level Graphics API For The Web Written by Michael Larabel in Standards on 7 February 2017 at 05:46 PM EST. 69 Comments On the desktop there's now Vulkan for Linux/Android systems, Direct3D 12 for Windows, and Metal for macOS systems as the latest-generation, performance-focused graphics APIs. On the web front, WebGL is the current dominant API that's derived from OpenGL ES but Apple is pushing an initiative for a new graphics API. Apple is pursuing with the W3C a new graphics API for the web that will be more lower-level and similar to the concepts of Vulkan/D3D12/Metal. The goals of this proposed API would be something that maps nicely to modern web platform design patterns, a lower-level API for allowing greater performance, an API to expose GPU computation functionality (compute), and does not follow a single native API. The matter of a design goal for "A technology that does not follow a single native API, which reduces the difficulty of implementation on platforms that do not support the chosen native API," may be a bit of contention by some developers... And likely signals Apple's unwillingness to support Vulkan on macOS even though there are drivers available for it on Linux and Windows and Android while D3D12/Metal are limited to their own single platforms. But on the other hand, not forcing a particular API by the system's hardware driver may end up working out better for some platforms, such as shoddy OpenGL ES drivers that caused early problems for WebGL on Windows and then efforts for mapping OpenGL ES / WebGL back to Direct3D for better driver support. So this new web graphics API would need to map nicely to Metal, Direct3D 12, and Vulkan for effective hardware support across platforms as well as supporting a common shading language. The draft of their charter for this new W3C group can be found here. There is a brief posting about it via the W3.org community blog. Apple's WebKit team has also written about the proposal at WebKit.org. It will be interesting to see what comes of this API proposal. The post does also talk about interoperability of any new graphics API with WebAssembly and WebVR. The blog post also covers some basic proposals for this new API they are just calling "WebGPU" for now. With their WebGPU approach they are looking for it to be more object-oriented than WebGL, still interacting with HTML5's canvas element, WebGPU contexts exposing graphics commands and parallel compute commands, and for their WebGPU prototype they are using the Metal Shading Language as their default shading language. Check out the WebKit blog post for a lot more detail on their WebGPU thoughts. There are certainly many developers that would like something lower-level than WebGL and more akin to D3D12/Vulkan, but at least from Apple's stated goals, they aren't for something like "WebVulkan." It will also be interesting to see how they end up handling GPGPU/compute in the browser and what restrictions are placed. 69 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint This winter, hip-hop frontiersman Chance the Rapper made music history when he earned seven Grammy nominations for a release that is not available for purchase. The Chicago artist issued his “Coloring Book” as a stream. That’s it. You couldn’t buy it if you wanted to. His feat was the most recent indication of yet another seismic shift in online music retail. From instant downloads to all-you-can-stream plans, the state of digital music consumption has been in flux. Whether it receives trophies or not on Sunday, “Coloring Book,” with its nominations, portends a new norm. Streaming music on audio and video platforms now represents 38 percent of total audio consumption, according to Nielsen Music. That’s a jump from 23 percent in 2014. Eventually the big players — Spotify, Apple and Tidal — would like to do for music what the likes of Net­flix, Hulu and Amazon Prime did for TV, only there’s a catch: They offer virtually identical catalogs. “Coloring Book,” for instance, is on Apple Music, Tidal, Google Music, Spotify, iHeartRadio and Deezer. Constant rumors of consolidation are coming to pass. Recently, phone carrier Sprint announced the purchase of a 33 percent stake in the Jay Z-owned Tidal, and Web radio innovator Pandora has unveiled its much-delayed intention to enter the market with an on-demand plan of its own. Jeff Chiu - Associated Press Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, and Beats by Dre co-founder Jimmy Iovine launched the Apple Music streaming service in 2015. Each service in the increasingly crowded field is working frantically to overcome the perception that the main distinction among the uniformly priced $9.99-a-month offerings is little more than font style, quirky play­list title and color scheme. In contrast to the vast programming differences among Hulu, Net­flix, HBO Go and other video streaming services, music platforms have long fought against the perception that they are selling a nearly interchangeable product, said Mark Mulligan of Midia Research. “You’re getting sold the same car. It’s just got a different lick of paint on it.” In turn, some are banking on exclusive releases. Subscribe to Spotify? Forget, then, about hearing the latest Frank Ocean “video album.” Others are betting fans want innovative content that merges playlist, podcast and radio station. In 2017, personalization engines claim to deliver sounds with the adeptness of an expert record store clerk. Playlists don’t just recommend music, they attempt to “tell stories,” said Apple’s Zane Lowe, who oversees the company’s Beats 1 radio initiative. Yet as services attempt to diversify, there’s also the risk of alienating fans. Online exclusives, for instance, can lock an artist into a particular outlet — and lock nonsubscribing fans out of hearing new music. (If only until their friend Airdrops them a copy.) Apple Music stormed into the market in 2015 with a seemingly bottomless budget, not to mention famous executives, and has shown itself willing to invest in exclusives, most notably in its relationships with Taylor Swift, Ocean, U2 and Travis Scott. Amazon jumped in with its own marketing coup: exclusive access to country superstar Garth Brooks’ music. Such deals have proved controversial. According to a 2016 report in Bloomberg News, Apple-only artists have been threatened with being excluded from key Spotify playlists. “We think exclusives are bad for artists and bad for fans,” said Jonathan Prince, Spotify’s head of communications and public policy. “Artists want as many fans as possible to hear their music, and fans want to be able to hear whatever they are excited about or interested in — exclusives get in the way of that for everyone.” But even with all-access, can a playlist generator peek into your psyche? It’s possible, said David Bakula, analyst for Nielsen Music. “People get paralyzed by the amount of choice out there.” The path to success is still being defined. Thus, even if some long-rumored industry consolidation occurs, most music fans won’t shed tears because they haven’t developed emotional relationships with the product, theorizes analyst Mulligan. “The reason why most people stay with specific platforms is more inertia than loyalty,” he said.   View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The move comes after days of heated rhetoric and protests in Silicon Valley over the new administration’s statements and policies. Contrary to any business-as-usual atmosphere, President Trump has thrown the tech industry into turmoil. Confusion, friction, obstruction Though some upsides to Trump’s IT policy may emerge, a lack of internal structure in the White House is adding to the uncertainty that began on the campaign trail. The president’s tech agenda is largely a blank slate. During the election, candidate Trump issued no major tech policy briefs, gave no major IT speeches and generally only talked about tech to hammer Apple or Amazon on jobs. His transition team and White House communications office did not respond to multiple requests to discuss tech policy priorities or appointments for this story. The White House Office of Science and Technology’s website is down and only one (known) White House staff tech adviser — Trump family friend Reed Cordish — has been named. During the election, candidate Trump issued no major tech policy briefs, gave no major IT speeches and generally only talked about tech to hammer Apple or Amazon on jobs. The administration’s first tech-related policy initiative, an executive order on cybersecurity, first faced big questions, then was scrapped. After an acrimonious campaign relationship with the technology sector, the play-nice period fostered by Trump’s December 15 Tech CEO Summit has definitely waned. Discord between the White House and Silicon Valley is already factoring on several fronts. At the CEO level, industry leaders are verbally, legally and organizationally clashing with Trump’s policies. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned from Trump’s business advisory board over the travel ban. Before this week’s en masse industry challenge, Microsoft and Amazon had already filed a federal lawsuit against the executive order. Google announced a $4 million fund to help those affected by Trump’s immigration orders. And in anticipation of administration restrictions on the H-1B visa program, some tech co-founders established an industry contingency plan — True North — to relocate their foreign workers to Canada. There’s also the increasing possibility of frequent protests and flat-out obstruction by tech leaders and workers against Trump administration policies, some of which may already be in play. There is a lack of clarity regarding Trump’s technology policies. Most campaigns lay out specifics on a whole range of issues. The fact that he didn’t concerned me.— Steve Case, CEO of Revolution LLC Last week, Google employees worldwide staged walkouts over the travel ban. IT workers — some affiliated with a new Tech Solidarity group — also recently protested in front of Palantir on fears the Peter Thiel co-founded company could assist a Muslim registry. And on the extreme end, the Calexit movement for California secession — elevated by venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar — cleared administrative hurdles to become a ballot initiative in 2019. In the meantime, pressure on industry executives to weigh in against the travel ban is mounting. Elon Musk — who was also named to Trump’s business advisory board with Uber’s Kalanick — is facing calls to step down. Though not part of the original grouping, his companies Tesla and SpaceX joined the list of firms backing the amicus brief lawsuit against Executive Order 13769. Cabinet, management style, potential upsides For all the current distress around Trump and tech, there could be some policy upsides down the road. Steve Case, the internet pioneer and co-founder of the Washington-based tech investment firm Revolution LLC, saw a mixed bag in the wake of the inauguration. “There is a lack of clarity regarding Trump’s technology policies. Most campaigns lay out specifics on a whole range of issues. The fact that he didn’t concerned me,” he said. “But now that he won, that lack of clarity could create greater opportunity to influence the policies.” These early opinions from Case, made in the first days after the election, have shifted with the President’s performance in his first weeks in office. “Now that we are seeing President Trump’s initial policies, I certainly have concerns. Like many in the tech community, I am strongly against the executive order on immigration,” Case wrote in an email. Outside of the policy realm, Case also thinks Trump’s election win — which was driven by a surge in rural and rust-belt support — could “serve as a wake-up call” for Silicon Valley to widen its perspective, “be more sensitive to the broader societal impact of technology,” and “lead to greater investment” in more regions of the country. Steve Case, chief executive officer of Revolution LLC and co-founder of America Online Inc. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images While it’s hard to determine the new administration’s tech agenda, Consumer Technology Association CEO Gary Shapiro  believes industry benefits could come through Trump’s other policy priorities. “If there’s an infrastructure bill, there’s a possibility to include broadband, to build smart highways with fiber underneath. These are bi-partisan things and I don’t think Trump is going to disagree on them,” he said. Shapiro also sees tech opportunities in Trump’s trade policies: “Redoing NAFTA could be a good thing. It was negotiated in 1993, it hasn’t dealt with intellectual property, it hasn’t dealt with the internet, it hasn’t dealt with data flows.” Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, points to possible industry benefits from Trump’s tax repatriation plan. “We’d like to see that money trapped overseas come back…to strengthen the American economy and our companies,” he said. Guardino also believes tech policy under a Trump administration could be positive if the president lets his appointees lead. Beyond the White House, there are multiple executive agencies and commissions — from the FAA and FCC to The Department of Labor — that regulate the tech industry. “It will be interesting to see his style with his cabinet members. Will he follow more of a CEO ‘I hired you because you’re smart, go’ model, offering independence?” Guardino said. “If that’s the case, for example, with someone as competent and capable as Transportation Secretary Chao — whose agency will co-regulate drone delivery and self-driving cars — then we have great hopes. If his style is more micromanagement, then it will be more challenging.” Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Donald J.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson More like this iPhone 7 Plus accounts for bigger piece of U.S. pie Apple's bezel-free iPhone 8 -- what to expect 10 years -- The Evolution of Apple's iPhone Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price Features limited to the iPhone 7 Plus helped boost sales of the larger smartphone, but they were not the only reasons why a higher percentage of customers went big last year, analysts said. "The nature of the market is also shifting," said Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, in a recent interview. As consumers encounter large-screen smartphones with more frequency -- especially ones owned by friends -- there's a bandwagon effect, he explained. Although the shift to bigger screens has been strongest in China and other Asian markets, the iPhone 7 Plus accounted for a larger proportion of new iPhones sold in the U.S. as well, said Bajarin, citing his firm's research. Apple does not separate iPhone sales by market, or even say exactly what percentage of total sales was of the 7 Plus, but CEO Tim Cook did claim that the number was the highest yet for its 5.5-in. model. "We saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past," Cook said during the December quarter's earning call on Jan. 31. Even before Apple disclosed iPhone sales -- for the December quarter, the Cupertino, Calif. company booked 78.3 million -- analysts expected that the average selling price, or ASP, would be up over the same period the year before, in part because of the widespread belief that the iPhone 7 Plus had done better than its 2015 and 2014 forerunners. That was, in fact, the case: The December quarter's iPhone ASP was $694.57, a record. Some credited the iPhone 7 Plus's performance to the features Apple offered only in the large-screen model, notably Portrait Mode. Bajarin agreed that Plus-only features could be selling points. But they were no guarantee. Those specific to the iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus, for example, weren't enough to make those models as successful as the 7 Plus. More telling than differences between iPhone models, he said, was the consumer perception of the total package. "The evidence we see from China is that when something [is seen to be] the pinnacle at that moment, that's when China moves toward that product," Bajarin said. "So there is some value in keeping interesting and expensive technology as a differentiator." Among the features that the supply chain rumor mill has posited for this year's iPhone, several might appear only in the most expensive model, such as a curved OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display and wireless charging. Not every analyst concurred with the concept of burnishing the Plus model with extra features if that came at the expense of the smaller-sized models. "It's more important that Apple makes [each new generation of the] iPhone durable and powerful," said Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research. "That's recognizing the reality of the market, and justifying what is an increasing price delta." Gottheil's take was based on smartphones' lengthening life spans as consumers hold onto their devices for longer periods. "The smartphone market is shifting into a lifecycle like the PC market," Gottheil said. "Ideally, Apple wants to stay somewhat ahead of the technological curve so that its customers feel they can live with the phone for as long as they want."

While Apple’s AirPods have received the most attention, there are now at least half a dozen of these cord-free earbuds, with more to come. Jabra’s entry, the Elite Sport, adds a fitness element: They have an optical heart-rate monitor and connect to an app that can coach you through a variety of workouts. At $249, however, they’re $100 more than Samsung’s Gear IconX, which can do many of the same things. Furthermore, Jabra’s earphones don’t perform as well as promised. Design: Conspicuously Inconspicuous Jabra’s Elite Sport earbuds stand out for their plainness. The buds are nondescript, black blobs that are remarkable for their lack of styling. I get that they’re supposed to blend in — that is, as much as large, black nubs in your ears can blend in — but a little pizzazz wouldn’t have hurt. The earbuds protrude a bit from your ear — about the same as Bragi’s The Headphone but more so than the Samsung Gear IconX. At least they don’t have a dangling white section as the Apple AirPods do. The bottom of the right earbud also has a small optical heart-rate sensor, similar to the one on the Gear IconX. With the earbuds, Jabra includes six sets of tips and three sets of wings, the latter of which are designed to hold the earbuds in place as you run. None of the tips are attached to the earbuds when you first open the box, because Jabra wants to ensure that you pick the right-size tips. The earbuds come with a case, about the size of a small jewelry box, that not only protects the buds but also has a small battery that recharges them. Like the earbuds, the small, black case lacks any sort of styling. It’s so symmetrical, and has so few visual cues, that I often tried to open the wrong end. The earbuds are waterproof and have a three-year warranty for damage from sweat, which is reassuring  for runners like me. Exercise Performance Unlike the Gear IconX earbuds, which have accelerometers (and a music player) built right into the earbuds, the Jabra buds require you to bring your phone with you as you work out. You gain more features, such as training programs, but you lose the mobility of going phone-free on your runs — one of my favorite features of the IconX. Through several runs, the Elite Sport remained securely in my ear, and its Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 6s (which was on my left arm) never You have to push hard on the Jabra’s buttons to get them to work, which caused the buds to really jam into my ears. During less-intense activities, the Elite Sport buds maintained a steady connection to my iPhone (in my pants pocket) as I walked around. Whereas the Motorola Verve Ones+ constantly cut out, the Elite Sport let me listen to music and podcasts without interruption. Physical buttons on the left and right earbuds let you control the volume, music and several other functions, but I tried to use them as little as possible. You have to push hard on the buttons to get them to work, which caused the buds to really jam into my ears. Although they can be finicky, I prefer the style of touch controls on the Samsung Gear IconX. I’ll choose slightly erratic performance over physical discomfort any day. As you run, the Elite Sport will tell you, at regular intervals, your pace, heart rate, training zone and more. You can customize what the buds tell you and when, in Jabra’s app. There’s a multitude of stats to choose from, including distance, duration, split times, speed, cadence and even workout guidance. Although my distance and pace were recorded accurately (this data was gathered from my iPhone), the heart-rate tracking was not only inaccurate, but erratic. On my first two runs using the Jabra Elite Sport, the earbuds recorded my max heart rate at 208 beats per minute, with an average of 172 bpm. In comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 235, whose wrist-based heart-rate monitor I’ve found to be accurate, said my max heart rate was 184 and my average was 165.  The Jabra has a cross-training program, which is great for runners who need to work on other aspects on the days they’re not pounding the pavement. Even without the Garmin to verify my findings, if my heart was pumping at 208 bpm, then I’d be in serious trouble. The chart on Jabra’s app showed how my heart rate jumped all over the place. By comparison, the same chart, as recorded with the Garmin, shows much less variation. On a third run, the Jabra reported a max heart rate of 187 bpm and an average heart rate of 168 bpm. That was more in line with what the Garmin Forerunner recorded (179 bpm max, 166 bpm average) but still higher than what’s typical for me. In addition to its running-focused features, the Jabra app has a cross-training program, which is great for runners who need to work on other aspects on the days they’re not pounding the pavement. Cleverly, accelerometers in the earbuds themselves make sure you’re actually doing the workout. I rued the fact that they wouldn’t let me cheat on my sit-ups, but that’s probably for the best. Jabra Sport App In Jabra’s fitness-focused Sport app, you create a profile where you input your height, weight and age. The top section of the app has some handy icons that show, at a glance, whether both earbuds are in, your heart rate and battery life remaining. Through the app, you can track a handful of activities. In addition to running and walking, you get spinning, cycling, skiing and skating, to name a few. There’s also a cross-training section with a number of exercises, most of which are between 6 and 15 minutes. Each exercise also has a small video to show the correct way to perform it, which is very handy. You can also create your own cross-training regimen and select from the more than 50 exercises, from arm curls to windmills. In addition, a VO2 max test, which calculates how efficient you are at processing oxygen, also lets you determine your overall fitness level. This test, which previously was limited to much more expensive devices, is now making its way into consumer trackers, such as the Garmin Forerunner 235 and the Fitbit Charge 2. Though I generally liked Jabra’s app, there are a few big limitations. For one, you can sync your data only with Strava, which is a good fitness app, but it’s not as popular as MapMyRun, for example. You can, however, manually export your data as a CSV file if you want to manually upload it to another fitness app. Also, there’s no way to sync your settings and data from the Jabra app — such as completed and custom workouts — in the cloud, so if you were to switch phones, you would lose everything. One minor point: I wish the Sport app had the ability to adjust the audio properties of the Elite Sport, as you can with other Jabra headphones. Audio Performance Unlike on the IconX, you can’t store music on the Elite Sport earbuds themselves. Rather, you have to stream music from a connected Bluetooth device. That’s a bit of a downer. One of the things I really like about the IconX is the ability to leave my phone behind when I go for a run and still track  not only my heart rate and distance, but also listen to tunes. Putting that aside, the Elite Sport delivered excellent audio that was full, yet balanced. The bass line in Michael Jackson’s “Billy Jean” was driving, yet clear, and didn’t overwhelm the vocals. I found the same went for other genres of music, ranging from classical to classic rock. Unfortunately, I couldn’t select my running playlist from within Jabra’s app; I had to cycle through my entire music library (by pressing a button on the earbud) to find my favorite running songs. Other Features A double-press on the bottom button on the right triggers Hear Through mode, which pipes in ambient sounds so you can be more aware of your surroundings. It works but makes everything around you sound tinny. Long-pressing the same button will activate Siri, but it also will turn on Hear Through temporarily. When a call comes in, the Jabra lets you say “Answer” to accept a call, which is a pretty clever feature. A caller could hear me clearly, and I could hear her, even with a slight wind blowing. Battery Life The Elite Sport earbuds hold a 3-hour charge, with 2 more hours stored in the case. That’s on a par with the IconX, which will last 1.5 to 2 hours with workout features and Bluetooth on, and 3 to 4 hours of music-listening time stored on the headphones. On paper, the Jabra Elite Sport earbuds have a lot of potential... The Bragi buds, which don’t have a heart-rate monitor or other workout features, lasted nearly 6 hours on a charge. However, unlike Apple, Samsung and Jabra, their case lacks a battery to recharge the buds. After a 45-minute run, the battery life had dropped from 3 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes. Not too shabby for their size. Bottom Line Jabra packed plenty of features into its Elite Sport earbuds, but they’re not upper-echelon. They deliver great sound, and their Bluetooth connection is steady and strong. But while I like that Jabra’s app offers a comprehensive training regimen for runners and cyclists, it was a letdown that you can sync it only with Strava, and the music controls were disappointing as well. One of the biggest reasons to get the Elite Sport — the heart rate monitor — is also the earbuds’ biggest weakness; it delivers inaccurate and erratic results. If you want wireless earbuds for your workouts — and you have an Android phone — consider the Samsung Gear IconX earbuds, which deliver equally robust sound, a more accurate heart-rate monitor and built-in storage for music. Runners who want to listen to tunes and measure their heart rate would be better served by the TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music GPS watch, which comes with its own Bluetooth headset. You’ll lose some features, such as cross-training, but you’ll get a more accurate heart-rate monitor and better music controls, and you’ll be able to leave your phone at home. On paper, the Jabra Elite Sport earbuds have a lot of potential, but they have too many issues for us to recommend them. Photo credit: Jeremy Lips/Tom's Guide 5/10 Quick Take Skip the Jabra Elite Sport. These wireless earbuds can also act as a personal trainer, but the Samsung Gear IconX and the TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music are better options. $249.99 Amazon About the author Mike Prospero @mikeprospero Michael A.

That's when you'll be able to buy a pair from Apple's online stores, authorized resellers, as well as the Apple physical stores. The BeatsX will set you back $150, £130, or AUD 200, depending on where you live. At first they will only be offered in black and white, but a couple of newly unveiled color versions are coming soon: gray and blue. The BeatsX were allegedly designed by Apple-owned Beats with the help of Apple engineers, and they include the custom W1 chip that makes pairing them to an iPhone as easy as powering them on and holding them near the handset. The BeatsX aren't sweatproof, however, do keep that in mind. The battery life is said to be up to 8 hours, while a five-minute charge will bring you two hours of listening. Speaking of which, these charge by using a Lightning connector (so you can be sure they were actually designed at least in part by Apple engineers). If you don't have an iPhone or Mac, fret not for the BeatsX will work with non-Apple hardware too, since they use Bluetooth after all.

Apple hired Solomon, a longtime HP Inc. executive who had run HP's global consumer printing business, in 2015 as vice president for enterprise and government.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > As Apple pursues perfection, new campus frustrates… As Apple pursues perfection, new campus frustrates builders and officials By Adam Ismail — February 7, 2017 12:32 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Apple's extravagant monument of a main campus is further proof of the company's continued growth -- and its eye for flawless design. Apple has long been lauded for its attention to detail and emphasis on build quality and it seems that ambition extends to the construction of its facilities. According to Reuters, the company made numerous demands as it prepares Apple Campus 2, more colloquially referred to as the “spaceship campus,” to ensure a level of craftsmanship more befitting of a phone or watch than a building meant to employ 14,000 workers. For starters, Apple’s new Cupertino, California, headquarters supposedly boasts the largest panel of curved glass ever made — though that was probably evident from the exterior shots. Inside, Apple has stipulated a lengthy list of requirements. More: Apple is looking to double the size of its famous flagship retail store in NYC The ceiling tiles, made of polished concrete, were each examined twice by company representatives to ensure perfection. The door handles, free of imperfections down to the nanometer, according to the construction team, were rejected by Apple in favor of a redesign. All pipes and beams in the ceiling had to be concealed from view, so they would not appear in reflections off the glass. Even the signage was a source of frustration. The Santa Clara County Fire Department reportedly clashed with the company over designs that emphasized minimalism over function in the event of an emergency. Retired Deputy Fire Chief Dirk Mattern told Reuters the issue came up in 15 different meetings, and that he had “never spent so much time on signage.” These considerations might be commonplace for a handheld device but for a facility of Campus 2’s scale, they are unheard of. In most buildings, the tolerance that materials are allowed to differ from specific measurements is about 1/8 of an inch. Channeling the iPhone’s seamless panel gaps, Apple mandated far tighter tolerances, even for inconspicuous surfaces. “You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building,” one architect said. “The doors would jam.” Speaking of which, Apple was reportedly adamant that the doorways throughout the entire building be perfectly flat, with no thickness around the threshold. If an engineer had to adjust his form to move differently through a doorway, he might become distracted from his work, the company reasoned. One former construction manager said he spent months pushing back on the request, “because that’s time money and stuff that’s never been done before.” The spaceship campus has been said to evoke many design cues from famous Apple products. Lead architect German de la Torre likened the building’s curves to the rounded rectangle motif the company employs in much of its hardware and software. Other employees compared the elevator controls to the iPhone’s home button. It may come as little surprise that Skanska USA and DPR Construction, the contractors on the project when it broke ground in 2011, eventually bailed. Experts estimate the facility has cost Apple $5 billion and those close to the project said difficulties with the approval process have nudged completion to the spring.

A new patent describes adding special sensors to the device that activate a ‘speaker mode’ when the headphones are placed in a certain position. Called ‘dual mode’, users could switch between personal listening and speaker mode by rotating the earbuds or cups outward at a 90 degree angle. Scroll down for video  A new patent describes adding special sensors to the device that would activate a ‘speaker mode’ when the headphones are placed in a certain position. According to the illustrations, Apple's Beats (top) and EarBuds (bottom) would be part of the next-generation line  HOW DOES IT WORK?  Apple's latest patent suggest the firm is working on a new line of Beats, AirPods and EarPods. These devices could be transformed from a pair of headphones to a set of speakers on the go. Sensors would be placed inside the headphones and when the earbud or cup is turned at a 90 degree angle, the sensors would activate a speaker mode and turn up the sound volume.  The sensors would also be designed to monitor proximity, in order to keep speaker mode from activating while the user has the headphones on or in their ears. The patent, titled ‘Dual mode headphones and methods for constructing the same’, was filed in May 2011 and describes in-ear and clip-on headphones that would embody the same sensors and amplifiers to be used as speakers. ‘A sensor in the headphones can detect the current position of the headphones, and can change the mode of the circuit to correspond to the detected current position,’ reads the document published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday. ‘For example, the sensor can change between an in-ear mode in which the amplifier is bypassed and a speaker mode in which the amplifier is powered and used. ‘In some cases, the headphones can include a sensor for preventing the speaker mode when the headphones are positioned near a user's ears.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Apple is TRIPLING production for the iPhone 8: Production of...

Special sensors would be placed along the inside of the headphones that could detect the orientation of the device. The patent describes a pair of over-the-ear headphones, similar to the popular Beats (pictured), which have two cups attached by a head strap. Special sensors would be placed along the inside of the headphones that could detect the orientation of the device ‘Any suitable type of sensor can be used including, for example, a mechanical sensor, a photoresistive sensor, a capacitance sensor, a proximity sensor, an IR sensor, an ambient light sensor, a Hall effect sensor, a resistive sensor, a sensor detecting impedance or voltage changes due to a contact between the headphones and a user, or any suitable combination thereof,’ reads the patent. For example, a proximity sensor could detect that wearer’s ear and know that it should be in headphone mode – this way the sensors will not activate speaker mode and damage the user’s eardrum. But when the cups are turned outward and on their side, the sensors will know to turn up the volume for speaker mode. The patent illustrates that its EarPods and AirPods could also be redesigned with this technology. Apple may also incorporate a snap band headphone into the mix that would be equip with a button that users could press to activate speaker mode – instead of sensors that monitor its position These sets would have the same sensors and amplifiers as what appears to be the larger Beats headphones, but ‘on a smaller and more compact scale, reports Apple Insider. Apple may also incorporate a snap band headphone into the mix that would be equip with a button that users could press to activate speaker mode – instead of sensors that monitor its position. As Apple Insider notes, the technology listed in the patent is not far fetched, as Apple designed its iPhone 7 family with a speaker arrangement that produces stereo sound when the handset is in landscape mode.    Read more: Apple granted patent for 'dual mode' headphone that doubles as a speaker United States Patent: 9565490 Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

To me it’s all one thing. It’s Apple Music, and it happens to have video and audio. … It has nothing to do with what Netflix is doing. Iovine also revealed that he knew from the start that his original Beats Music service was not something that they ever expected to be able to scale to a large subscriber base on their own, and that joining Apple was basically the outcome they were looking for when they built the service. Despite heavy consolidation and turnover in the music streaming space, however, Iovine makes it clear that he doesn’t see it as a “winner-take-all” proposition, and that there’s room for multiple players “if streaming is done right.” Iovine explains “right” by pointing out that each service needs to be “culturally different” so that there’s something to offer that builds on top of the catalog of music to give the service a personality and feel. A key differentiator for Apple Music out of the gate was Beats 1, and clearly Apple’s move into original video content for Apple Music subscribers is expected to allow them to keep building Apple Music into its own distinct music culture. Iovine also points out that as a streaming service, Apple Music is able to take more risks than mainstream radio can, providing periodic shows from established names while also improving exposure for emerging artists. Asked about Apple Music’s exclusive releases, Iovine suggests that they’re not at all central to what Apple is doing (“We did ‘em. We’ll do some more.”), and that in many ways they’re still just experimenting.

The tvOS 10.0.1 update released in October added support for the new features, but Apple only recently made the necessary information available to partners in the Made-for-iPhone/iPad/Apple TV licensing program. Now accessory makers producing things like game controllers can instruct the device to prompt users to install companion apps like iOS devices already do, simplifying the installation process and handling things like firmware updates. WiFi Accessory Configuration is also enabled to allow wireless devices piggyback off of the Apple TV to avoid manually selecting the correct network and entering the password to connect. VoiceOver features to provide audio cues for what’s on the screen for the visually impaired is also now possible.

Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4 Beta 2 to Developers, iOS 10.3 Public Beta 2 GO macOS 10.12.4 Public Beta 2 is coming tomorrow Feb 7, 2017 22:01 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  As expected, Apple has seeded today the second Beta build of the upcoming macOS 10.12.4 Sierra operating system to registered developers, along with the second iOS 10.3 Public Beta to everyone else who wants to get an early taste. These new Beta versions come just one day after the release of the Beta 2 builds of Apple's upcoming iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2 operating systems, as well as Xcode 8.3 IDE. Tagged as build 16E154a, the second macOS 10.12.4 Sierra Beta is now available for installation to all registered developers, who only need to run the Sierra Developer Beta Access utility to download and install the latest macOS Sierra Beta. macOS 10.12.4 is the fourth maintenance update to the macOS Sierra series and promises to introduce a Night Shift functionality just like the one we're using on our iOS devices, which should improve our sleep. It also brings Siri support for checking Cricket scores, player rosters, and schedules from the International Cricket Council and Indian Premier League, dictation support for Shanghainese language, and better PDF manipulation. iOS 10.3 Public Beta 2 now ready for public testing We also promised to inform our readers on the immediate availability of the second iOS 10.3 Public Beta release, which is now available for installation using the built-in OTA (Over-the-Air) system update of your supported iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch device. If you're running the first iOS 10.3 Public Beta, we recommend updating your devices as soon as possible. Otherwise, if you don't intend to jump on the Public Beta bandwagon, it is recommended that you wait until the final iOS 10.3 release hits the streets. In related news, Apple also seeded the first Beta release of Classroom 2.0, an application that turns your iPad into a powerful teaching assistant, helping teachers from all over the world to guide their students through a lesson, keep them on track, and watch their progress.

Instead, Iovine told Variety that Apple’s venture into original television programming will exist within the confines of Apple Music. Those with subscriptions to Apple’s music streaming service will be able to access any exclusive show the company releases as part of their current plan. Iovine did not offer any hint that Apple will increase the cost of a plan based on whether or not users wanted access to original programming, but it’s clear the move into TV is on the forefront of Apple’s mind. “We’re trying to make the music service a cultural point of reference, and that’s why we’re making video,” Iovine said. “We’re making video for our Apple Music customers and our future customers.” Related Want to know where TV is headed? Take a look at music streaming services Apple first announced it was moving into making original, exclusive TV series last February. The first scripted series, Vital Signs, hails from Dr. Dre (one of the executives working on Apple Music) and consists of 30-minute dramatic episodes that are semi-autographical, based on the rapper-turned-producer’s life. Those close to the project told The Hollywood Reporter that Dr. Dre would star in the show and it contains “no shortage of violence and sex.” Five months later, Apple confirmed it had purchased the rights to “Carpool Karaoke.” The popular segment that occurs on The Late Late Show with James Corden stars the titular comedian driving around Los Angeles with a variety of celebrities singing different songs. It’s one of the most popular ongoing late night variety show segments, which each new episode racking up millions of views on YouTube. Apple’s version of the series won’t star Corden, but will feature numerous celebrities each week essentially doing the same thing. During a recent quarterly conference call, Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri confirmed that Services (Apps, Apple Music, etc) had grown far more than they originally thought it would and were planning to greatly increase the profit they saw brought in each different service by 2020. One of those ventures includes introducing more, HBO-quality original series that will be available exclusively through Apple. “We’ve put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music and that will be rolling out throughout the year,” Cook said during the call. “We’re learning from that, and we’ll go from there.” Related Apple wants to invest heavily in exclusive streaming, so how does TV fit in? Despite Cook and Maestri’s commitment to producing more original series, Iovine confirmed Apple isn’t looking to take on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Prime at this time. Apple isn’t going to create its own service that would operate as a stand-alone streaming platform Apple consumers could subscribe to. Instead, the shows will act as additional benefits Apple Music subscribers will get with their $9.99 monthly fee. “To me it’s all one thing,” Iovine said. “It’s Apple Music, and it happens to have video and audio … It has nothing to do with what Netflix is doing.” Apple is gearing up to invest in more series, along the lines of Netflix’s Stranger Things or HBO’s Westworld, with more announcements expect to roll out over the course of the year.

That would amount to nearly 80 percent of the total smartwatch market for the quarter. “Apart from the hardware and software improvements of the new models, Apple succeeded mainly due to its streamlined marketing and re-aligned pricing, which helped it address a wider audience,” said analyst Jason Low in a press release from Canalys. "The Series 1’s lower entry price and Apple’s more focused fitness messaging made its Watch both more attainable and more relevant.” “The holiday demand was so strong we couldn’t make enough.” As reported by 9to5Mac, Canalys estimates that Apple sold around 6 million units last quarter, a year to year growth of 12 percent. Overall, Canalys estimates that Apple sold 11.9 million watches in 2016, holding 49 percent of the market share for the year. That number places Apple at the top of the smartwatch market by a significant amount. The next two largest smartwatch vendors in 2016 were Fitbit and Samsung, which held 17 percent and 15 percent of the market share, respectively, according to Canalys’ estimates. (Fitbit’s “smartwatch” is actually a smart fitness watch, which has a smartwatch form factor but doesn’t support third-party apps.) Other vendors held around 19 percent collectively. Canalys also noted Xiaomi’s record quarter of 5.5 million Mi Band sales. iPad sales and revenue were both down 20 percent year over year Along with the record-setting performance of the Apple Watch, Apple tallied its highest quarterly revenue ever. “We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac, and Apple Watch,” Cook said on the Q1 earnings call. The company also noted that Apple’s App Store had record levels of activity in its letter to investors. But not all of Apple’s products are doing as well as the iPhone or the Apple Watch. iPad sales and revenue were both down 20 percent year over year. While the wearables market has shown signs of weakness in recent quarters, wearable makers seem to be keeping at it for now.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple Campus 2 represents the best and worst of Apple’s obsession Chris Davies - Feb 7, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple’s obsessive attention to detail has delayed its spaceship-like Campus 2 almost as much as it has frustrated those working on it, a new report suggests. The donut-shaped facility which, eventually, will house more than fourteen thousand of Apple’s staff after they move from their current sprawling facilities is being treated with the same fastidious care as the iPhone 8 is. However, in typical Apple fashion, actually delivering that isn’t quite such an elegant experience as using it. Apple has built its reputation on sweating the small stuff. Problem is, sources involved in Campus 2’s construction tell Reuters, it’s a big stretch from making a smartphone, smartwatch, or laptop to making a building. Never mind one with a footprint that measures in at 2.8 million square feet. Expectations for Campus 2 were high from the start. As it wooed with its initial renderings, it promised features like the world’s largest single piece of curved glass, entirely hidden parking under the ground, and a veritable fruit grove of trees. Staff would, at various times of the year, find themselves walking among plum, cherry, persimmon, olive, apricot and – of course – apple trees. That was back in 2013, though the project itself was one of the last announced by Apple founder Steve Jobs. The original 2015 completion date has come and gone, and Apple is still yet to move in. However that’s not to say things haven’t been busy in the meantime. Negotiations – and design revisions – of simple items like door handles have taken in excess of a year, sources say. Apple has demanded perfectly flat thresholds for the doors, justifying the need for such precision with the argument that engineers could otherwise be shaken from their train of thought by a change in gait otherwise. Basics like emergency signage, that typically would be a box-ticking exercise, have spiraled out into dozens of meetings as Apple’s desire for minimalism butts up against legal requirements from the fire department. On the one hand, you could see all this focus on detail as being admirable. After all, part of Apple’s allure among consumers is that holistic embrace of minutiae, whether that be trademarking the distinctive aesthetic of its stores, or the way it packages cables and accessories in its boxes. Giving the same attention to its new HQ would be the perfect example of just how much more effort the Cupertino firm puts into things than rivals. However, were you an Apple investor, the news that the company is insisting that concrete that will never be seen after construction be finished to superlative standards, and that no pipework or ventilation fixtures ever be reflected in the building’s glass, might give you pause. It’s no unusual thing for building projects to go over budget, and that’s with typical tolerances. Apple’s budget for Campus 2 isn’t known, but north of $5bn is widely believed to be the figure. When it’s complete, it’ll be a halo in both shape and function for Apple. It’ll also be a place where the company can hold its launches and house its increasing workforce, particularly as divisions like the much-rumored Project Titan “Apple Car” continue to operate in secrecy. How many building contractors experience migraines along the way will remain to be seen.

The interview comes ahead of The Grammys this weekend, an event that could see the mark of Prince’s music coming to streaming services. As Apple battles President Trump’s immigration order in several different fashions, Iovine offered his not-so-eloquent opinion on the situation. “The guy is f–king crazy,” he said referring to Trump. One interesting tidbit from the interview is Iovine’s view of original content. Apple has pushed hard to gain exclusive rights to music since Apple Music’s launch, an effort that it has faced some criticism for in the music industry. In today’s interview, Iovine explains that while he doesn’t lean on them too heavily, it’s something Apple will continue to do. “I don’t lean on them too heavily myself,” he says. “We did ’em. We’ll do some more. But we’re just experimenting. I just know that if something feels right and someone wants to, we’re willing to do it, to help them really market their record, get the word out, and spend what it deserves.” Iovine also touched on the difference between free and paid streams and how they affect chart performance. Essentially, the Apple exec explained that free streams shouldn’t be weighted as heavily as paid streams. This comment is especially interesting seeing that this year marks the first time that streaming-only albums, such as Chance the Rapper’s ‘Coloring Book’, are Grammy-eligible. “A free stream shouldn’t be weighted the same as a paid stream — I don’t think there’s a sane person in the world, other than a promotion man, who would advocate that,” he says. “And that is one of the many things that someone has to fix in order for the whole thing to move forward.” He continues: “A chart that weighs some ad-supported streams the same as a pay stream …encourages artists to promote free tiers to have a No. 1 record. That’s great for the tech companies, but not for artists.” Building on that, Iovine pointed to a “fear” in the record business, partly due to the race towards streaming growth numbers, chart performance, and too heavy a focus on business rather than creativity. “Right now there’s a lot of fear in the record business,” he says. “And the [parent] corporations should make it so the labels can relax a bit and be more adventurous. When the businesses are leveling out or going down, and you’re still asking for growth, you don’t have to be a mathematician to know what happens.” Lastly, Iovine explained that he doesn’t view Apple’s original content efforts as direct competition to Netflix. Apple is currently planning several original content efforts, including a Dr. Dre documentary, Planet of the Apps, and its Carpool Karaoke spin-off. Iovine, asked if he sees Apple Music attempting to become competitive with the likes of Netflix in the original-content sphere, demurs. “I wouldn’t put it that way,” he says. “When I read that, or I read that we’re taking on whomever, I say no. To me it’s all one thing. It’s Apple Music, and it happens to have video and audio. … It has nothing to do with what Netflix is doing.” “Dre’s purpose in life is to come up with something that moves the needle,” Iovine says. “He’s done that really seriously a bunch of times. And now he’s experimenting with video. And what he does will be unique, and he will get there. My responsibility to Apple and to him is to put him in that position where he can.” Head to Variety to read the full feature on Jimmy Iovine.   Guides Apple Music Apple's streaming music service View THe Guide Jimmy Iovine View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Target is having a big sale on eight different Apple Watch models Zach Epstein @zacharye February 6th, 2017 at 2:23 PM Share Tweet Opinions are still divided when it comes to the future of wearables. Market research companies take every opportunity they can to draw linear growth lines and get their tech industry clients excited, but they were clearly a bit overzealous when it comes to smartwatches. Only a small handful of companies have found any success at all in the emerging space, but Apple is definitely at the top of that short list. In no time at all, Apple managed to catapult itself to the No. 2 position globally in watch sales, coming behind only Rolex. No other smartwatch company is anywhere to be found on that list. While the Apple Watch Series 2 is the latest and greatest offering from Cupertino, Apple also released a second series of new models alongside the Series 2. Dubbed Apple Watch Series 1, this series offers a lower-cost alternative with still sports an upgraded processor compared to the original Apple Watch, but doesn’t feature water-resistance or GPS. If those features aren’t on your list of must-haves, you’ll be excited to learn that Target has a big sale going on right now covering eight different Apple Watch Series 1 models, while supplies last. Don't Miss: Here’s the full list of 97 companies that just filed against Trump’s immigration ban If you want to buy a new Apple Watch Series 1 model from Apple, prices start at $269. You can also save a tiny bit of cash by shopping on Amazon, where prices typically start at around $255. At Target right now, however, you’ll find fantastic Apple Watch Series 1 deals with 38mm models priced at just $199.99 and 42mm versions priced at $229.99. You won’t find better pricing at any big-name retailer right now. There are eight different Apple Watch Series 1 models covered in this big sale, including four 38mm models and four 42mm models. As you might have guessed, each of the two Apple Watch Series 1 sizes come in four different aluminum finishes, and they’re all covered in this sale. You can shop the full sale right here on the Target website, or you’ll find direct links to each of the eight different models listed out below.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Apple releases iOS 10.3 public beta 2 Jordan Novet@jordannovet February 7, 2017 1:04 PM Tags: Apple, iOS 10, iOS 10.3 Above: iOS 10.3 public beta 2 is rolling out. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Apple today started rolling out the second public beta of iOS 10.3, a tweak to iOS 10 that will become available to everyone in a matter of weeks. Today’s update comes almost two weeks after Apple released the initial iOS 10.3 public beta. Like the first public beta, this release again comes with the Find My AirPods feature in Find My iPhone, your personal information is now at the top of the Settings app, you can opt in to iCloud Analytics to provide more information to Apple, you can see what’s taking up your iCloud storage space, there’s a redesigned area for showing Siri app suggestions, and the animations for going to and from the home screen have been revamped, as 9to5Mac’s Jeff Benjamin pointed out. To me, the new animations seem to show more detail inside of the app even as it fades away back into its home screen icon. But if you’ve enabled the Reduce Motion setting through Settings > General Accessibility, then you notice no change. Also, if you’ve enabled Reduce Motion, then now you can view certain websites with reduced motion in Safari if web developers have alternative versions of their websites. These first and second iOS 10.3 betas are also notable because they switch iOS devices from HFS+ file system to the Apple File System (APFS). Note that the change won’t result in the deletion of any of your data. It has become clear with these betas, though, that support for 32-bit apps will be going away at some point. Today’s update doesn’t appear to have many big changes, although there is one addition that might be nice for people who use United Kingdom carrier Three: Wi-Fi calling is now available, according to MacRumors. Developers have also gotten this beta, but with the public beta you don’t have to be a registered developer to try out what’s new, and in fact you can try it for free. Or you can just wait until the final version of iOS 10.3 comes out. But if you are a member of Apple’s Beta Software Program and you’d like to try public beta 2, just go to Settings > Software Update and start downloading and installing the over-the-air (OTA) update. If you’re not a member of the Beta Software Program, you can sign up here. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Code spotted within the new macOS 10.12.4 beta shows three new board IDs that suggest an upgrade on the current trio of models are being prepared. Related: MacBook Pro review The discovery of motherboard identifiers was made by Apple blogger Pikeralpha on his site Pike’s Universum. According to the code, which does not appear in previous versions of macOS, there may be two new 13-inch MacBook Pro models with function keys, three new models with the TouchBar and three new 15-inch laptops with the TouchBar.

And the good news continues. Strategy Analytics forecasted back in September that Apple would post record iPhone sales in Japan in Q4 2016. Today the analytics company posted a report stating that "Apple finally broke 60% share threshold in Japan smartphone market during Q4 2016, posting yet another record market share in this country, mostly driven by the robust sales of the new flagships iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus." Apple started with a low single digit share in Japan prior to 2010, but has been growing significantly up to 60% share level by the close of 2016 at the expense of other competitors' share including local vendors.   It's always great to hear a story like this because Apple's CEO Tim Cook spent some time in Japan in early Q4 to announce a new R&D center for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Engineering, met with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and rode the famous Yamanote Transit Line, paying entry to the line with Apple Pay on his iPhone 7 Plus, a feature added to the iPhone 7 in September.   The new iPhone 7 models specifically added Sony's Felica technology (like NFC) to make that possible. By the jump in market share in Japan it would appear that this new feature is a hit with Apple's Japanese customers.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Join For Free In a continuing series of articles sharing what I've learned about Oracle JET, I'd like to extend upon the previous article talking about installing Oracle JET for web application development, and this time look at installing Oracle JET for hybrid mobile application development. Oracle JET is capable of not just building client-side web applications, but thanks to the underlying power of Apache Cordova it can build & deploy hybrid mobile applications too, for Android, iOS and Windows UWP. Installing the base tooling for Oracle JET is relatively easy, and extending it with Cordova is easy too. However installing the tooling for each mobile platform for the uninitiated can be challenging and why I thought I'd attack this "beast" in a separate article to help others. Installing the Oracle JET Prerequisites In the previous article for web application development, I covered what you needed to install for Oracle JET. This included installing Git and NPM first, then via NPM installing Yeoman, Grunt, Bower and the Oracle JET generator. It just so happens this set of packages is the prerequisite for installing the additional hybrid mobile tooling. So, for all intents and purposes, Oracle JET hybrid mobile development is just an extension of Oracle JET web development. While there are certainly some tasks that are mobile specific (such as integrating the camera or GPS), it's useful to understand from a learning perspective that an Oracle JET mobile app is pretty much the same as an Oracle JET web app, just deployed to a mobile device. This means that when things don't work in your JET mobile app because of a bug in your code, but say the Android Emulator is being its usual painful self during debugging, you can often run and test apps in your development machine's browser to get around this sort of development grind. There are a few mobile specific tasks we can't test in the browser, but thanks to the mock plugins provided by Cordova you can actually do a lot. Installing Apache Cordova Having installed the Oracle JET tooling from the previous article, using NPM we can install Apache Cordova for mobile development as follows: npm install -g cordova To check which Cordova version was installed run the following: npm list -g --depth=0 An example result from my Mac: /usr/local/lib
├── bower@1.7.9
├── cordova@6.3.1
├── generator-oraclejet@1.1.0
├── grunt-cli@1.2.0
├── node-inspector@0.12.5
├── npm@2.15.9
└── yo@1.8.4 From here we need to make a choice of which mobile platform we're going to support. Apache Cordova itself supports (at last count) eight different platforms, but Oracle has made the decision upon extending itself on top of Cordova to only support Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps (deployable to Windows 10 devices). Which we choose is up to us and our needs, each of us will need to pick our own poison (as the saying goes, which nicely sidesteps me from any Android-vs-iOS-vs-Windows debates I hope ;-). From a development perspective, it's worth noting of the 3 mobile development platforms we're about to talk about, that is the Android SDK for Android development, Apple Xcode for iOS, and MS-Visual Studio for Windows UWP, only the Android SDK is capable of being installed on Windows, MacOS, and Linux development machines. Xcode is tied to MacOS only, and Visual Studio to Windows only. In Oracle's mobile team when writing tutorials for developers to use, as the Android SDK covers virtually all the PC operating systems that developers can bring to a classroom, we tend to focus on the Android SDK first as a pseudo-universal development platform, as we know (hope?) all students can install this. So I'll cover Android first, but, skip to your favorite mobile platform if you're interested in iOS or Windows instead. Android, the Android SDK and Android Emulator For hybrid mobile development on Android, we require the Android SDK. The Android SDK is either bundled with Android Studio or a separate download from the following page. The SDK is now somewhat obscured as "command line tools" at the bottom of the page, where we find the downloads for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. For this article, we'll assume you download & installed the SDK rather than Android Studio. The SDK zip does not come with any specific version of Android installed, known as an Android API, so you must run the SDK Manager to download these in turn. Once the SDK is installed we start the SDK Manager via <install-dir>/sdk/tools/android(.exe). On opening it for the first time the SDK Manager at the bottom will report it is loading from an external repository to determine what is available for download. If you are behind a corporate firewall you will need to open the SDK Manager preferences and set the proxy settings for this to work correctly, remembering to restart the SDK Manager if the process is stuck. By default the SDK Manager will suggest some required packages it will automatically download, but from there we need to pick a specific Android API. In doing so we need to be mindful that the version of Cordova we download has its own dependencies of what Android API level it supports, so you should check this yourself. For Apache Cordova 6.3.1 at the time of writing, according to the Cordova documentation that is Android 6.0 (API 23). In expanding a specific API, it includes a whole bunch of system images for different Android platforms including ARM and mobile devices, as well as specialized TV and Wear platforms. We'll drop the later two to save some unnecessary downloads. From the Extras top level option, it's also useful to select the Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM Installer). I'll talk about this more in a moment. Once we've selected the options, we then select the Install Packages button, accept the relevant licenses then wait for everything to download. Be patient. It can take a while on slow connections. Like downloading the APIs as an extra step, assuming we don't have an Android device to run with, Android makes our job harder as we also need to setup the Android Emulator before we can start developing and testing our app. In turn, the Android Emulator is notoriously slow making it painful to develop with. This is where the Intel HAXM installer from above comes in. While there are some other options to the slow Android Emulator such as Genymotion, the Intel HAXM driver if installed on an Intel-based PC including Intel-based Windows, MacOS & Linux will significantly increase the speed of the Android Emulator. It does this by allowing the emulator to access the Intel CPU virtualization optimizations. There are some prerequisites such as your Intel CPU supports Intel's Virtualization Technology and VT-X, and if running on Windows Hyper-V must be disabled, which you can read about here. By default the Intel HAXM drivers are not installed when downloaded via the SDK Manager, you need to execute the file downloaded to the <android-home>/extra/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager directory, typically called something like intelhaxm.exe or IntelHAXM_X.X.X.dmg. The install instructions are fairly self-explanatory. My tip is to make sure you reboot your PC once installed, at least on MacOS I've had some problems with the drivers not properly applying post install unless I reboot. Now that we have the HAXM drivers installed we can setup the Android Emulator. The Android Emulator requires that we configure an Android Virtual Device (AVD), which is a configuration set of the Android device we want to emulate. Luckily it has a number of predefined templates that make this easier. With the SDK Manager running select the Manage AVDs menu option. In the resulting AVD Manager window, select the Device Definitions tab where it will list a number of preconfigured AVDs for known devices like the Nexus 5. On selecting this, then Create AVD, we will be presented with the remaining options we need to configure. From experience, first-time users tend to try to max out the AVD settings. But as the emulator can be so slothful, I recommend trying to keep this to a minimum. The target represents the Android API level we downloaded earlier. Remember to select something relevant to your Cordova release. For the CPU/ABI, for the Intel HAXM driver to work, we must select a System Image built by Intel, typically "Intel Atom (x86)" or "Intel Atom (x86_64)" (the difference being the 64 image emulates 64bit Intel Atom devices). For the Skin select "Skin with dynamic hardware controls," and then the rest of the options are left as default. Finally, note the default AVD Name at the top. Change this to something simple like "MyAVD" with no spaces, then press Ok. Next, for building Android apps, Apache Cordova requires that the Java Standard Edition SDK be installed (v7 or the latest v8). Having installed the Android SDK and Java SDK, Cordova then requires environment variables ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME to point at these. The Cordova documentation gives instructions for how to set the environment variables on different operating systems. Phew. Android certainly requires the most steps to setup.  At this point, we've set up the Android SDK & Android Emulator and we're ready to return to working with Oracle JET. Skip right down to the last section before the conclusion to see what to do next. iOS, Apple Xcode, and the iOS Simulator If we instead choose to go the iOS route we can take some satisfaction that getting up and running is much easier than with the Android SDK. As a reminder, though, Apple's Xcode is only available on MacOS, there are no Windows or Linux versions. As such you will need a Mac to develop iOS applications via Xcode with Oracle JET. To install Xcode, we need to check what versions of iOS and Xcode are supported by Cordova before continuing. At the time of writing, Cordova supports Xcode 7, by the time you read this Xcode 8 may be supported. Cordova does great work in supporting the latest and greatest, but, if the latest version just came out a few days before you sometimes need to show some patience and download an older version. You can download the latest version from the Apple App Store for free, or older versions via the Apple Developer Center. Once installed we need to run Xcode at least once to accept the terms and conditions. Also, in the past, from experiences, it's been important to run iTunes at least once to do the same as can block iOS app builds & deployments. We've found in running a number of workshops corporate users of MacOS/OSX have never run iTunes unlike regular Mac users and this has caught them out. Having done all this, by installing Xcode we get a full set of device simulators at the most recent O/S version supported by that version of Xcode. If we want older simulators we can download them via the Preferences -> Components -> Simulator window. Otherwise, we're ready to kick on with JET. Skip right down to the last section to see what to do next. Finally Cordova itself requires we install the following via the command line, to support Cordova installing through Xcode. xcode-select --install
npn install -g ios-deploy Windows 10 UWP and MS-Visual Studio 2015 and the Emulator Setting up the development environment for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps is also straight forward. In this case, we need to download and install MS-Visual Studio 2015 to our Windows 10 PC. The free Community Edition of Visual Studio 2015 is a good option. On installing Visual Studio we need to ensure during the install process to also select "Universal Windows App Development Tools" and the associated children. If you miss the option during the install, try the Tools menu -> Extensions and Updates and Tools section. Once installed we need to run Visual Studio once to accept the terms and conditions. Note here how I'm not telling you to check the Cordova documentation. At the time of writing while Cordova does support Windows 8 & MS-Visual Studio 2013 development, for Oracle JET, Oracle has decided to only support Windows 10 UWP apps via MS-Visual Studio 2015 going forward. So you need to be cognizant of Oracle's support for Windows, not Cordova's in this case. Once complete this is a fairly rudimentary install compared to Android. Having finished the install we not only get some Windows device simulators, but we can also deploy our app directly to our development machine (unlike iOS & Android). Continue to the next section to find out what to do next with Oracle JET. Creating, Building and Running Oracle JET Hybrid Mobile Apps Once we have the respective mobile development platform installed on our development PC, we're ready to return to Oracle JET and create a hybrid mobile app. Like the previous article we use Yeoman on the command line to generate an Oracle JET scaffold, with a slightly different syntax from just creating a web application: yo oraclejet:hybrid MyMobileProject --template=navbar --platform=<android|ios|windows> Note for the "platform" (singular) option we must specify our mobile platform of choice without the brackets, such as the following: yo oraclejet:hybrid MyMobileProject --template=navbar --platform=android We can also use the "platforms" (plural) option to specify multiple platforms to support.  Wait patiently for the components to download and install. Next, we can build and serve our app: cd MyMobileProject
grunt build
grunt serve By default, the last two options will build the app for our selected mobile platform via Cordova, then start the associated emulator or simulator for our platform, deploy the app to the emulator or simulator and finally start the app for us. For platforms like Android where we may already have a number of emulator AVDs configured, or on iOS where we might want to pick out a specific simulator, we might like to use the extra option "destination" to specify the AVD name we set up earlier: grunt serve --destination=MyAVD ...and the result: Another option as explained earlier is to bypass the mobile emulator or simulators using the development machine's browser, instead, with the browser option. The browser can be a much faster route to development particular when fixing layouts for example. grunt serve --browser ...which will look like: At this point we're now up and running with the hybrid mobile development platforms for Oracle JET mobile development, and we're ready to continue learning about Oracle JET. As previously recommend if you're new to Oracle's JET I highly recommend hitting the Oracle JET homepage which includes links to the documentation, tutorials, videos, demo applications and a detailed cookbook. Conclusion The nice thing about learning Oracle JET for web development is everything we learn is extensible to Oracle JET hybrid mobile development. Yes there are plenty of arguments from the native mobile development camp about native mobile apps are best, but there is a great attraction to being a JavaScript developer and being able to develop solutions for web and mobile apps using exactly the same skillset.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

That said, if you have already jailbroken your device, or you are getting ready to, you will want to know about some of the best new iOS 10 jailbreak tweaks you can get, and that’s what we’ll be talking about in this roundup. The best new jailbreak tweaks for iOS 10 Sorted in no particular order, here are some of the best jailbreak tweaks that have only been released within the last couple of months. All of these have been designed with iOS 10 in mind: Horseshoe Horseshoe is definitely one of the coolest iOS 10-specific jailbreak tweaks I’ve seen so far, as it takes the multi-page Control Center that comes stock with iOS 10 and consolidates it into a single-page interface. In doing so, not only does the UI look better, but it means you can access some of the most important music settings with just a single tap, rather than having to swipe over first. I’m also particularly a fan of that new slider, which can be toggled between brightness and volume mode on demand, rather than having two separate sliders eating up space individually. The same can be said for the buttons for AirPlay/AirDrop/Night Shift mode, which are all now consolidated into a single bar, rather than eating up two separate rows of space. Horseshoe is a $1.99 tweak, but a lot of time and development went into its creation to make Control Center look sleek, as you would expect it to, all while keeping all of the functionality there at the same time. You can learn more about Horseshoe from our full review. Eclipse 4 Eclipse is just about one of the jailbreak community’s most sought after jailbreak tweaks, so when it was finally updated with full support for iOS 10, there was no doubt that would make this list. With this tweak, you get a system-wide night mode across all of your iPhone or iPad’s apps. The night mode can be toggled on or off at any time with Activator or Flipswitch. More importantly, you can control the colors that are used and you can even control what apps and what interfaces get colorized. With this high level of customization and uniformity, this tweak is a step above any night mode jailbreak tweak ever produced, hands-down. Combined with other tweaks, such as the one we’re about to show you below, you can have one wicked-looking jailbroken iPhone. You can read our full review of Eclipse 4 to learn more about it and how it works. Noctis For those who have always wanted a kind of ‘dark mode’ for iOS, just like the one that has been available on macOS for some time, Noctis is the tweak for you. This tweak darkens interfaces like Control Center, the application dock, application folders, the volume HUD, and even Control Center. It doesn’t darken app interfaces, but it can be used in junction with tweaks like Eclipse or Nightmode9 to make a fuller effect. You can read our full review of the iOS 9 version of Noctis to learn more about what to expect from the iOS 10 version of Noctis when it hits Cydia in the future for $2.00. CCRecord CCRecord is a really simple and free jailbreak tweak for iOS 10 devices that adds a shortcut to Control Center for recording your iPhone’s screen. Interestingly, there is already code in iOS 10 for doing this, and there’s even a toggle for Control Center for it, but the jailbreak developer found a way to enable this native feature for jailbreakers. Once you tap on the button, Apple’s native screen-recording process begins, and it will continue until you re-open Control Center and tap on the button again. At this point, a .MOV file gets saved to your Camera Roll that shows everything you just did on your iPhone. To learn more about CCRecord, you can read our full review. CCLowPower CCLowPower is yet another free Control Center tweak aimed at iOS 10 devices, which enables a hidden Low Power Mode toggle button in Control Center. It appears Apple is experimenting with this feature and has hidden code in iOS 10 already, but this tweak simply enables the feature prematurely for jailbreakers. The button, when tapped, enables Low Power Mode, and when tapped again, disables it. The button glows green when it’s turned on, and dims out again when you turn it back off. You can read our full review of CCLowPower to learn more about it and its features. Evanesco Evanesco is another great tweak that can be had for free that was designed with iOS 10 in mind, and it’s meant to give your iPhone a cool aesthetic whenever it’s left to sit idle for a few seconds. Whenever you don’t touch your iPhone for a while, it will dim the objects on your Home screen to make your wallpaper easier to see; these objects include the app icons, dock, and the Status Bar. When you touch your device’s screen again, everything will return to normal. For the most part, you’re not going to be sitting and gawking at your Home screen all day long, but it’s still a pretty cool aesthetic that you can add to your jailbroken iOS 10 iPhone. You can read our full review of Evanesco to learn more about its purpose and what it’s all about. Cream 2 Cream 2 is a jailbreak tweak for Control Center in iOS 10 that lets you colorize the toggle buttons to appear any color you want them to whenever they’re enabled, and it can be had for free. This tweak is perfect for those of you that like to customize your device so it doesn’t look like anyone else’s, and because you can choose your own colors, you can give it a splash of your own personality. You can read our full review of Cream 2 to learn more about how it works and how it’s configured. Creamless Creamless is basically the exact opposite of Cream 2; rather than colorizing your Control Center toggle buttons, this tweak extracts the color away from them. Despite being the opposite, it’s still the same in that it’s free. This tweak is best for minimalists who don’t want to see a rainbow whenever they’re using their toggle buttons in Control Center. It effectively makes the toggle icons simply glow white when enabled, and dim back to black when disabled. You can read our full review of Creamless to learn more about how it works. Littlemoji iOS 10 comes with bigger Emojis in the Messages app whenever they’re sent or received without any additional text, a feature that’s reminiscent of Facebook Messenger’s stickers. For those who don’t like this, and want to go back to how things were in iOS 9, Littlemoji is a free tweak that returns the size of sent and received Emojis in the Messages app to the size of a line of text. This means Emojis take up less space and you can see more of your conversation at a glance. You can read our full review of Littlemoji to learn more about the tweak. Cuttlefish Cuttlefish is a free tweak that tints your 3D Touch menus and their blurred backgrounds to match the dominant color of the app icon you’re using the 3D Touch gesture on. This tweak is fully aesthetic, offering no functional use, but it does look pretty nice and makes your iPhone stand out from everyone else’s. More importantly, this tweak works flawlessly with extensions like Forcy and RevealMenu on devices that don’t support 3D Touch natively, so everyone can cash in on the fun. You can read our full review of Cuttlefish to learn more about it. CCTButtonActions CCTButtonActions is another pretty cool free jailbreak tweak for iOS 10. This one lets you use 3D Touch gestures on your toggle buttons to get to their respective preference panes in the Settings app. If you need to get to your Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Do Not Disturb preference panes quickly without navigating the Settings app, for example, then this tweak is for you. It also brings you to the Airplane Mode preference pane when the Airplane Mode toggle is 3D Touched and to the Display & Brightness preference pane when the Rotation Lock toggle is 3D Touched. To learn more about the tweak and how it’s useful, you can head over to our full review of the tweak. NoSharePlz NoSharePlz is a simple tweak for iOS 10 that gets rid of that annoying “Share This App” option in the 3D Touch menus via the Home screen. For the most part, no one really uses these menus, and it has been requested time and time again for a jailbreak tweak to remove these menus to cut down on clutter. You can read our full review of NoSharePlz to learn more about it and how to get it. Gorgone Gorgone is a free jailbreak tweak that enables Slide Over and Split View on unsupported devices, which includes those running iOS 10. Because the feature was normally limited to only certain iPads before, there were some iPad models that couldn’t utilize the feature, while iPhone and iPod touch users were also included in that discrimination. After you install this tweak, you can slide over from the right side of the screen to access your app picker, which lets you do into dual-app mode and see them running side-by-side. You can read our full review of Gorgone to learn more about how it works. Honorable mentions 1) Activator Activator is a true staple for any jailbroken iPhone, and on Ryan Petrich’s beta repository, you can download a beta version of Activator for iOS 10. Need I say any more? 2) Barrel A true classic, this tweak lets you change your page-to-page Home screen animations. It still works flawlessly on iOS 10. 3) CallBar A great way to change up the incoming call interface in iOS 10 without being too rudely interrupted by a full-screen notification. 4) ForceInPicture If you have a device that doesn’t support Picture-in-Picture mode natively, you can use this tweak to forcefully enable it. 5) iFile iFile is a staple for jailbroken devices, and allows you to browse and edit your iOS filesystem. It’s good for cleaning out junk files from time to time. It’s not officially supported on iOS 10, but everything appears to work. 6) PowerDown My personal favorite way to force a respring when you need to. It lets you choose from several power options when you press and hold the power button, such as respring, reboot, shut down, and safe mode. 7) TetherMe Another classic. If you want to use your iPhone as a personal hotspot, but your carrier doesn’t let you, you can use this for forcefully enable the feature. Other stuff you need to know More jailbreak tweaks are being released almost every day, so it’s hard to keep up with them in a single roundup and continue to go over every single one of the classics that have existed for years. That said, if there’s something you want to know about that isn’t on this list, then I will redirect you to the iOS 10 compatibility spreadsheet, which has a full list of compatibility statuses for most jailbreak tweaks in existence today. Keep in mind that because the Yalu jailbreak for iOS 10.0-10.2 is still in beta, many jailbreak developers are still developing for the iOS 9 platform, and many haven’t even upgraded. That said, both the iOS 9 and iOS 10 jailbreaks are considered “modern” at this point in time, so we’ll probably continue to see iOS 9 jailbreak tweaks despite having a public jailbreak for iOS 10. Since Saurik finally enabled purchases on iOS 10 with the release of Cydia 1.1.28 (stable), developers can now offer paid jailbreak tweaks on iOS 10. This will spur the launches of several more jailbreak tweaks to come. Finally, remember to be careful when installing tweaks on iOS 10, as not all jailbreak tweaks are compatible or completely stable. You try jailbreak tweaks and jailbreak your iOS 10 device at your own risk, with no warranty implied, as has been the story since the first jailbreak was conceived.

Just a small, less obtrusive bar at the top of the screen. Agneev Mukherjee Ok. Thanks. :D FlipControlCenter should be here! It’s one of the first tweaks I installed. Sadrazam Does anyone know if there is an alternative for OpenNotifier or Protean for iOS 10? I really miss those tweaks Samuel L. Jackson OPENNOTIFIER HAS BEEN UPDATED Sadrazam Holy.. Yes it appears it has. Thanks Sam Jackson loorey It installs another package called ‘libmoorecon’ for it to work. I had problem with it at first, but reinstalling it did the job. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a54401363898709e42d96c06fa71ee52dd62fe48b7cf17cd247be47fc861f797.png Sadrazam libmoorecon helped indeed. How did you get to use the gmail and whatsapp icons? They don’t show in the list..? loorey It’s ‘Opennotifier flat icon pack’. It has notification icons for almost all the major apps. Blip dude Has libmoorecon been updated?? I had to uninstall that thing in iOS 9 because my phone basically became unusable and my battery was heating up. loorey Yes, it’s been updated. Install the ‘opennotifier 10 tateu’, libmoorecon should be installed with it. Garry please make a post guiding the tweaks which are currently working on the iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus for people who are on ios 10.1.1 Garry UpUp droid3000 any status update for xhtml? for life of me i cant get lockhtml4 to work, puts my phone in safe mode the moment i activate a widget faisal repo dot lockhtml dot com Jonathan i cant install any tweaks im jailbreak it today helpppppp Jesus Question to those who have jailbroken. Did either 102 or Cydia app give you the 32 bit warning when running the first time? I’m blind and had a hard time doing the drag and drop methed with Impacter. I used the device menu, and install package. Just wondering. Bryan Gibson I don’t believe they did. I’m not blind and I find the drag and drop method for Cydia Impactor to be rather finicky. Did you get it to work for you? Jesus Hey, does anyone use ShareMe? I like exporting message logs from time to time. Tried installing it last night but it didn’t seem to work.

I feel safer with jailbreak than the one from Pangu. iOS Kush Its been a week for me also performed it last Monday very stable. baddestsammaritan Is the new iOS 10 JB untethered? Where can I find info to install? Timothy Semi-untethered, same as Pangu and jailbreakme for iOS 9. Prasoon Singh CCTButtonActions should be replaced by FlipControlCenter. It let’s you add custom toggles and you can use 3D Touch as well on the icons. Rochell Marco Totally agree with you. These IOS jailbreaks tweaks that you mentioned is cool. Last week, I installed Horseshoe. Swagat Don’t use ifile. It deletes the whole directory if you search anything. Use Filza instead. The Zlatan Immortal should be a must for everyone! It prevents the expiration of signed iOS apps including the yalu jailbreak Steve Harvey It does not work for the Yalu jailbreak. Well, it technically does, but when you reboot and are unjailbroken it does not work. Jip2 what about localapstore work on ios 10.1.1 ??? or any in app purchase tweak ?????? Timothy Those tweaks enable you to do what is called “stealing from developers,” to use the technical term. Considering that this is (a) illegal and (b) immoral, and that (c) a lot of developers read this blog, you won’t find many people here willing to aid and abet you. Gabriel Schwartz Apple TV 4 JB now !!! Jayy I want ccrecord but I’m on iOS 9.0.2 oh well I’ll just stick with display recorder. Sukhchain Singh Hello i want to hide hotspot bar in iOS 10.2 JB.. Any tweak for this? disqus_M4rIeW3CxS Is there any way to combine CCLowPower and Horseshoe to get six icons on the top of the Control Center, as seen in the picture in this article for CCLowPower?

 Apple completely dominates Samsung in profits — this stat shows why Kif Leswing Feb. 7, 2017, 2:53 PM 9,488 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple took 92% of the total smartphone industry profits last quarter, according to a research note by Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley distributed to clients on Tuesday.  This means that Apple's iPhone is dominating the high end of the smartphone market. It's the most popular and profitable expensive phone by far.  Here's one stat that drives that home. Samsung, Apple's primary smartphone rival, sold slightly more phones than Apple did last quarter — it sold 90 million phones, of which 77.5 million were smartphones and 12.5 million were older feature phones. Apple sold just about the same number of smartphones, coming in at 78.3 million. But consumers paid way more for an Apple phone.  The average selling price for a Samsung phone sold last quarter was $182. The average iPhone sold for $695 — almost four times the average price of a Samsung phone, according to Walkley's research. That's how Apple can take the vast majority of the smartphone hardware industry's profit even though it only accounts for 17.6% of the market.  Here's Canaccord's takeaway: Given the Galaxy Note 7 issues and strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus models, we believe Apple will extend its leading market share of the premium-tier smartphone market installed base during 2017. We believe these trends enabled the iPhone installed base to exceed 570M exiting 2016, driving record December quarter services revenue. We also believe the impressive installed base should drive strong iPhone replacement sales and earnings, as well as cash flow generation to fund strong long-term capital returns. While we anticipate a stronger upgrade cycle in 2018 with the 10-year anniversary iPhone 8, our surveys indicate solid iPhone 7 demand that should bridge the gap until a new form factor iPhone is likely released in September. Cannacord rates Apple a buy and raised its price target to $154.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Laptops The best 12-inch MacBook alternatives Emily FerronFebruary 8th, 2017 6 pictures New Atlas rounds up the best alternatives the the 2016 12-inch MacBookView gallery - 6 images The 12-inch MacBook is Apple's lightest and thinnest laptop – it also has its smallest display, only one USB-C port and a starting price of US$1,299. Before you take the plunge, what are your other options? New Atlas has rounded up a few. Asus Zenbook 3 With its sleek stylish chassis, 12.5-inch display and yes, a single USB-C port, the Asus Zenbook 3 is clearly angling itself as a MacBook competitor. Depending on what you're looking for, it does have a few advantages. Most notably, it packs in significant processing power. It uses the latest seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, as opposed to the MacBook's more modest (but still capable) dual core m3, m5 or m7 chips. It also packs in 512 GB of flash storage, 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM, as well as impressive-sounding speakers. It also comes with a splitter accessory that plugs into your USB-C port and converts it into a USB-C, HDMI out and a legacy USB 3.0 port. Of course, the Zenbook is a Windows 10 device, which could be a benefit or a disadvantage depending on your feelings about macOS. It also has relatively poor battery life and a slightly lower resolution display. Starting price is $999 for the i5/8GB RAM version, or $1,599 for the version sporting an i7 chip and 16 GB of RAM. MacBook Air When it was introduced, the MacBook Air was Apple's ultra-slim laptop with a greater focus on luxury than functionality. Now that the 12-inch MacBook has overtaken the compact title, you could think of the MacBook Air as a slightly larger, older option with some more user-friendly details. MacBook Air has a 13.3-inch display, but at 1,440 x 900, it's lower resolution than the MacBook. As the oldest laptop in Apple's current lineup, it lacks some recent updates – but that could be a good thing. It still has a hinged trackpad as opposed to the newer solid state Force Touch models, but it's also one of the last MacBooks with a dedicated MagSafe charging port and legacy USB 3.0 ports (it has Thunderbolt/USB-C x 2 and USB3 x 2). Although it still has fifth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, it can be configured with additional RAM and storage so as to be very forward-friendly, without driving you crazy with dongles in the process. MacBook Air starts at $999. Huawei Matebook It seems strange to think of an accessorized Windows-10 running tablet (coming from a Chinese manufacturer little known in the US) as an alternative to an Apple laptop, but hear us out. The sleek 12-inch tablet has several features in common with the MacBook in a convertible form factor. If you add on Huawei's keyboard cover and MatePen, the Huawei Matebook tablet becomes a super portable 2-in-1 that stands in well for a laptop in many situations. Its m3/m5 processor options aren't as powerful as some other desktop-running tablets, but they rival the MacBook's. This spec comparison shows a more direct side-by-side look at the two machines. Of course, you can also use the tablet alone, which is a nice feature if you want a truly versatile machine. Take note, however, that the type cover – which props up the tablet in laptop mode – has only two positions and can be flimsy. It doesn't have the 360-degree movement of higher-end 2-in-1s. Huawei Matebook starts at $699 for just the tablet; the MatePen stylus is an additional $59, while the keyboard cover is $129. Buy Huawei Matebook on Amazon Microsoft Surface Pro 4 If the MateBook's tablet-into-laptop form factor caught your eye, but you want something slightly more heavy-duty, check out the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. Its entry-level processor is Intel core m3, but (unless you really care about the silence of a fanless machine) we recommend the i5-sporting variant for its processing boost. The Surface Pro 4 comes with the pressure-sensitive Surface Pen; the keyboard cover is sold separately. For both the tablet and the keyboard, the m3 variant starts at $1,030 while the i5 version starts at $1,130. The Surface Pro 4 also has a lone USB port, but it's a legacy USB 3.0 port and not the newer USB-C. It also sports a microSD slot and mini DisplayPort. Its 2,736 x 1,824, 12.3-inch display is slightly more pixel dense than that of the MacBook. We do expect Microsoft to release the Surface Pro 5 (or its equivalent) sometime in the first part of 2017. It could be worth seeing what the new generation brings. Even if you don't end up purchasing the latest edition, its release will likely drive down the price of the Surface Pro 4. Buy Microsoft Surface Pro 4 on Amazon 13-inch MacBook Pro (non-Touch Bar) Paying just $200 more will get you the latest 13.3-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar, and it's worth considering. It offers the latest Apple tech, sans the debatable Touch Bar and its associated price hike. The MacBook Pro is heftier than the MacBook, but as you can see, this is still a slim device with the same characteristic Apple unibody. There are many spec and build similarities, but the MacBook Pro's main advantages are a larger display, much faster i5 processor, one more USB-C port and a higher resolution webcam. You may have noticed we included both Apple laptops and Windows 2-in-1s, but not the iPad Pro, Apple's only offering that could qualify as a 2-in-1. Because the iPad Pro is a strictly mobile machine that runs iOS 10 instead of macOS, we don't consider it a true laptop alternative. If you want to investigate this option, check out our iPad Pro (12.9-in) review and roundup of alternatives. If you're still deciding about the 12-inch MacBook, refresh yourself with New Atlas' review of the 2015 model. We've also summarized the 2016 edition's incremental upgrades.View gallery - 6 images The best 12-inch MacBook alternatives 1 / 6 Tags #Asus #Laptop #Apple Share this article Post a comment   Over 255,000 people receive our email newsletter See the stories that matter in your inbox every morning Your Email Top stories Harley-Davidson’s Road King Special gets the bagger treatment Three new uranium-rich minerals unearthed in Utah LG Watch Sport vs. Samsung Gear S3 Walking robot takes first steps into the market Recommended for you Latest in Laptops The best MacBook Air alternatives The best 12-inch MacBook alternatives Review: Asus Zenbook 3 is an ultra-portable mini powerhouse The best Microsoft Surface Book alternatives The best MacBook Pro (2016) alternatives Dell's latest laptops are built to survive the classroom Samsung Notebook 9 vs. Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch) 12-inch MacBook case would add ports, power, protection Hands-on: An accessory that gives the MacBook Air a touchscreen Hands-on with the updated Gram, LG's light and capable laptop Hands-on with Samsung’s Chromebook 2-in-1 and fleet of 2017 laptops Dell's new laptop leaves the power cord in the past Editors Choice How do you solve fake news problem in the post-truth era?

After all, that’s what Apple does every year with its MacBooks, even if not every year brings over a major Mac redesign. But thanks to Apple’s own macOS 10.12.4 beta files, we now have a pretty good idea of what to expect this year for the MacBook Pro update. Don't Miss: The Mars rover just sent back data that has scientists completely stumped Apple blog Pike’s Universum discovered in the new macOS beta release three motherboards that do not correspond to any current MacBook Pro model. The motherboards would not fit future desktops, and they use the exact same processor management data as the 2016 MacBook Pro models. The 2017 line of MacBook Pro models is expected to feature faster, more efficient Intel Kaby Lake processors. The blog looked at the various Kaby Lake CPU versions currently available and discovered which chips will probably be used in each new MacBook Pro.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Apple’s Goals for the Mac Operating System  February 7, 2017 ⌘ Permalink A month or so before introducing the original iPod, Steve Jobs and Phil Schiller stood on stage at Seybold and announced that Mac OS X 10.1 was shipping shortly: “Now is the time to upgrade,” said Jobs, “this is the mainstream release.” Jobs continued with the clock metaphor, saying that Mac OS X’s original release was noon, and that we are now at six o’clock. He ended his part by saying that he has been impressed with the speed of Apple’s OS division’s development of Mac OS X 10.1. “Most programmers go on vacation after a major release,” said Jobs, “but Avie Tevanian and his team have kept working to improve Mac OS X.” Jobs said that Mac OS X already has one major update before Windows XP even ships. In that keynote — which has been mostly forgotten today — Schiller said that Mac OS X was designed to power the Mac “at least fifteen years, or more.” We now live in that more timeframe. I don’t think a huge change like the OS 9/OS X transition is coming anytime soon, but that macOS will continue to slowly and quietly evolve and improve over the next many years. As recently as the OS X Mavericks keynote, Apple has talked about the future of the operating system in terms of a “decade or more.” Mac OS X 10.1 was an important releases, but it is not the only thing worth noting in this announcement. Before the 10.1 demo, Schiller discussed the goals Apple had for Mac OS X beyond its desired longevity. I think this list is really interesting to consider today. Sierra and Puma have a lot in common, but it’s clear that the 15 years between them have brought a ton of change and a lot of improvements. Let’s look at a few of these goals1 with that timeframe in mind: The Power of Unix and the Simplicity of Mac At the time, there was a lot of concern that Mac OS X left behind a lot of the design elements (and quirks) that made the classic Mac OS so lovable. That OS came with a cost. It could prove unstable and didn’t offer a lot of modern technologies found on other systems. OS X really was an all-new operating system. Aqua was a big departure from OS 8 and 9’s Platinum theme, but the company worked to return some of old OS’ features — like spring-loaded folders — to OS X. As time has moved on, most users have come to think of Mac OS X’s features and behaviors as “Mac-like,” forgetting how it used to be. Embrace open standards Schiller said that Apple did not just support open standards, but wanted to embrace them in Mac OS X. While Apple’s services are chock-full of purpose-built, closed standards, macOS makes use of numerous open standards on the system level Quartz, OS X’s 2D rendering engine, uses PDF and PostScript in the windowing system. Today, Quartz is still hard at work. Beyond the display layer, macOS is full of open standards. AppleTalk gave way to TCP/IP. Even AFP has lost out to SMB/2 as of Mavericks. Ultimate Engine for the Digital Hub The Digital Hub drove Apple’s software direction for many years. The Mac became the central device for photos, video, music and more. Now, a lot of that has shifted to the iPhone and iCloud, but in its heyday, iLife was a huge deal on the Mac. As important as the Halo Effect was in the early 2000s as iPod owners flocked to the Mac, I think programs like iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand had a lot to do with it, too. Seamless Mobility In 2001, Apple was shipping Titanium PowerBook G4 and a range of iBooks. Even then, the company was working to make Mac OS X a good mobile OS. Battery life was a concern even then, as was having good support for wireless and eventually Bluetooth. This would would pay off in the iPhone. Instead os building atop the iPod’s embedded operating system, Apple started with OS X. In that famous Macworld 2007 keynote, Jobs said: Software on mobile phones is like baby software. It’s not so powerful, and today we’re going to show you a breakthrough … software that is at least five years ahead of what’s on any other phone. So, how do we do this? We start with a strong foundation. iPhone runs OS X. Why would we want to run such a sophisticated operating system on a mobile device? Because it’s got everything we need. It’s got multitasking. It’s got the best networking. It already knows how to power manage; we’ve been doing this on mobile computers for years. It’s got awesome security, and the right apps. It has Cocoa, and the right graphics and Core Animation built in. And it has the audio and video that OS X is famous for. It’s got all the stuff we want. Enable Killer Apps This was a big deal during the OS X transition. Every time an Apple executive got on stage, there would be an update about the number of apps for OS X, and sometimes even an update or demo from someone like Adobe or Microsoft. Schiller recalled the past, when many apps would have Mac-specific or even Mac-only features, and painted a picture of the future, where that would be true again. While today the Mac’s app ecosystem is somewhat stagnant compared to that of iOS, it is still rich and broad. While there will always be Windows-only enterprise tools, almost everyone else can get by with a Mac and a modern web browser.2 Conclusions Some will say macOS is the past. They may or may not be right, but today, it’s still a vital part of many people’s work. It doesn’t enjoy the spotlight it once did, but Apple continues to work on it. Apple has kept it updated to work well with iOS, while keeping the Mac the Mac. In hindsight, the goals Schiller shared in 2001 seem completely reasonable, and I think Apple met them all. Some of them aren’t relevant today, and some new ones have surely been added to the list, but I think macOS is still an important part of Apple’s overall strategy, 16 years into its life. Some of the other goals listed included things about graphics, Internet integration, international support and the migration path from OS 9. ↩ Something the Mac didn’t have for a long time. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → RSS Sponsorship: HoudahSpot: File search for Mac — powerful, fast and easy-to-use.

It seems like an automatic sort of pleasantry, but several minutes later he asks again. On the third refusal, he takes matters into his own hands and picks up his house phone, saying, “Look, I’m just gonna get you a tea anyway.” A housekeeper brings the two cups, and he looks on, studying your reaction. After a few sips, he stops to explain the recipe. This story first appeared in the February 07, 2017 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. “It’s basically steamed almond milk, vanilla, and then green tea we get from the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf,” he says. “But then we took the recipe and kinda f–ked with it a little bit. It’s pretty good, huh?” The tea is, in fact, pretty good, and Iovine’s enthusiasm for it is instructive. A green tea latte is not a new innovation, but neither is a record company, a pair of headphones, a Bruce Springsteen album, nor a music streaming site. If there’s a thread that unites Iovine’s various careers as a record engineer, a label boss, a consumer electronics kingpin, and a technologist, it’s his obsession with futzing over the details of his products and his tirelessness in selling you on the result. josé mandojana for Variety Iovine lives in Los Angeles but travels once a week to Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, where he’s known simply as “Jimmy” — he has no public job title. Dressed in cool but modest attire, save for a gold bracelet bearing the name of his wife, 38-year-old model-actress Liberty Ross, the 63-year-old mogul holds court on a plethora of topics, from the state of pop studio- craft (“If you’re looking for a quick hit, that means you’re looking for something disposable”) to his youth (“I wasn’t a good student, I couldn’t concentrate, I probably needed both Prozac and Klonopin”) to his views on President Trump (“the guy is f–king crazy”). But whatever the subject, Iovine almost always manages to find some connective thread back to Apple Music and his vision for turning the company into one that holistically blends the fundamentally entwined yet oft incompatible worlds of Silicon Valley and the entertainment industry. “When I first met Steve [Jobs] and Eddy [Cue] in 2003, I said, ‘These guys should have an entertainment company,’” Iovine recalls, referring to the late Apple founder and the senior VP of internet software and services. He lauds the vision of Akio Marita, who bought Columbia Pictures and Columbia Records for Sony, with the idea of combining Sony technology with Columbia content, but died before he could capitalize on the investments. “They had all these technologies and these entertainment companies, but they couldn’t put it all together,” he explains. “Apple, of all the global tech companies, was the one that understood why artists make things.” Before Iovine’s arrival in 2014, Apple was struggling to adjust to the transition from downloads to streaming, which currently comprises 38% of the recorded music business. Since jump-starting Apple Music in June 2015 — built on the $3 billion acquisition of Iovine and Andre “Dr. Dre” Young’s streaming and headphones company, Beats Electronics — Apple has returned to flexing its muscle in the music space. In 2016, Apple Music doubled its subscriber base from 10 million to 20 million users, each paying a base fee of $10 per month. The number falls far short of the totals of Spotify, YouTube, and Pandora — all of which have the advantage of free, ad-supported options — but Apple is making waves in other ways. For one, five of the albums to reach No. 1 on the weekly Billboard album chart last year debuted exclusively on Apple Music, including the year’s best-seller, Drake’s “Views,” which topped the chart for 13 weeks. With “Views,” Apple presented a test case for how to exploit the breadth of its various platforms. Not only did the album enjoy a heavily marketed two-week exclusive streaming window on the service, but Drake himself teased new tracks on his Apple Music radio show; Apple’s flagship DJ, Zane Lowe, conducted the only extensive pre-release interview; and the company sponsored the rapper’s summer tour with supporting act Future, who also had recently released an Apple-exclusive album. The strategy was, in Iovine’s words, “a complete thought.” The service will soon add a significant new wrinkle to its offerings. Last year, Apple Music made its first serious move into original video content when it greenlit the Dr. Dre-created, six-episode scripted series “Vital Signs,” then signed a deal with James Corden to turn his popular “Carpool Karaoke” segments into a stand-alone series, albeit without regular appearances from the CBS late-night host. Iovine declines to offer specifics on exactly where the future of Apple Music’s original content strategy lies, but he stresses that the service’s forays into video will be Apple Music-specific. “We’re trying to make the music service a cultural point of reference, and that’s why we’re making video,” he says. “We’re making video for our Apple Music customers and our future customers.” In a Jan. 31 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the importance of the ventures: “In terms of original content,” he said, “we’ve put our toe in the water doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out throughout the year. We’re learning from that, and we’ll go from there.” Iovine, asked if he sees Apple Music attempting to become competitive with the likes of Netflix in the original-content sphere, demurs. “I wouldn’t put it that way,” he says. “When I read that, or I read that we’re taking on whomever, I say no. To me it’s all one thing. It’s Apple Music, and it happens to have video and audio. … It has nothing to do with what Netflix is doing.” Wherever Apple Music’s video strategy leads him, Iovine remains obsessed with harmonizing the respective dialects of the entertainment industry, which he claims is insecure, and the tech sector, which he calls “slightly overconfident.” “Big tech companies are buying up entertainment companies,” Iovine says. “But someone at these companies has got to speak both languages, or it’s never going to work.” With that in mind, Iovine and Dre are putting their money into finding youngsters who can straddle technology, business, and the arts, ponying up $70 million between them to create the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation at the University of Southern California. The Academy’s inaugural class is in its junior year. The program offers B.S. degrees, with current undergrads working on everything from interfaces for cancer patients to global Wi-Fi development. “It began as a hypothetical conversation about what higher education was and had been,” says Erica Muhl, founding executive director of the Academy, and dean of USC’s Roski School of Art and Design. “The idea was to hack the undergraduate degree and start from scratch to rethink how we could educate for this generation’s profile of students.” Founding a high-tech Bachelor’s degree program couldn’t be further removed from Iovine’s roots in Brooklyn’s working-class Red Hook neighborhood, where he grew up the son of a longshoreman. He was nicknamed Moochie, after the Disney character. “But in my neighborhood, man, I was lucky to get away with that one,” he says. “Everybody had a nickname; it was like hip-hop.” In the 1960s, his neighborhood was rechristened Carroll Gardens. Every family on his block chipped in $15 toward planting trees, and a period of economic revitalization soon followed. “Somebody had a vision,” he says, perhaps unintentionally drawing a parallel to his latest pursuits. “You go there now and it’s like, ‘Holy s–t! It’s f–king beautiful.’ These giant trees. And of course, you got all these bohemians living there now.” Bohemians? “To us, everybody who lived there that wasn’t Italian was a bohemian,” he explains. “That’s just what we called them. I’ll never forget, some bohemian family moved in across the street from me, and they had a kid called Zane. That blew our minds. We were all Jimmy, Johnny, Tony, Tommy, Frankie … and then there’s this kid Zane? I was like, ‘Holy s–t, this kid’s gotta live with that name his whole life?’ ” josé mandojana for Variety After high school, Iovine was forced to lose his outer-borough provincialism in a hurry, finding work as an assistant engineer at the New York studio the Record Plant, where he ended up looking across the glass at music icons. Within a five-year period, he worked on three albums with John Lennon, engineered Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run” and “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” and produced Patti Smith’s “Easter.” “That was my college education, those six albums and those five years,” he says. “Everything I am today is because of those five years. I had no feel for culture before. I had no information. I had nothing.” Sony Music Entertainment chairman Doug Morris first met Iovine in 1979, and recalls him as being “very energetic, very ambitious,” and possessing an impressive ability to predict the direction of the industry: “He had this unique antenna where he had very good ideas about what was going to happen, and how to get to the places he wanted to go,” Morris says. “It’s a very unique quality to be able to see around corners.” As Beats Electronics president Luke Wood notes, “You really needed chops to survive in the studio. And Jimmy’s first real client, at 22 years old, is John Lennon. He would just say into the mic, ‘Jimmy, set up the echo on the quarter-inch machine so I can hear it where I like it.’ I don’t think a 22-year-old kid from Brooklyn had any idea how to do that. But he figured it out.” Wood, who oversees Beats’ headphone and speaker lines — the company claimed six of the 10 bestselling headphone models in the last quarter of 2016 — has been part of Iovine’s team since 2003, when he joined Interscope as an A&R exec. It was Iovine’s lingering obsession with music tech that drew the two together. “I sat down with him for breakfast, and probably within 10 minutes he asked me to play him some music I’d been working on,” Wood recalls of their first meeting. “I remember the first song I played him; we got to the bridge, and Jimmy pointed out how the Boss compression was affecting the emotional delivery of the lead vocal. And I think that was the minute we fell in love.” Among other record-business confidantes Iovine brought to Apple are Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor (an Interscope artist-turned-Beats’ chief creative officer) and former Interscope A&R man Larry Jackson. Yet none of his current co-conspirators loom as large as Dre. The two met in the early 1990s, shortly after the launch of Iovine and Ted Field’s Interscope Records, which notched early pop-rap hits with Gerardo’s “Rico Suave” and “Marky” Mark Wahlberg’s “Good Vibrations.” But the label lacked street cred until the arrivals of 2Pac and Dre in 1991 and ’92. Impressed with Dre’s grasp of sound, Iovine helped sell a skeptical industry on the artist’s first solo venture, whether that meant comparing Dre and protégé Snoop Dogg to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for rock-centric journalists or buying blocks of commercial time on radio to tease segments of their single “Nuthin’ but a G Thang.” After the multiplatinum success of Dre’s “The Chronic” and Snoop’s “Doggystyle,” Interscope became the home of West Coast hip-hop. Iovine and Dre remained close through Iovine’s eventful run at Interscope, helping to sign and develop acts including No Doubt, 50 Cent, Marilyn Manson, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, and Lady Gaga — each withstanding the mid-’90s protests over gangsta rap that saw the label change hands from Time Warner to what would become Universal Music Group, and each enduring splits with Suge Knight’s Death Row Records, after which Dre started the Interscope affiliate label Aftermath Records. Iovine and Dre ventured into consumer electronics together in 2008 with Beats, and cashed out spectacularly with the Apple acquisition in mid-2014. The relationship between the two will soon be the subject of a four-hour documentary, “The Defiant Ones,” directed by Allen Hughes for a spring release on HBO. If that title seems exaggerated on first blush — taken from Stanley Kramer’s 1958 film about two prisoners, one white and one black, forced to work together after escaping a chain gang — Iovine points to their shared background in rough, racially charged neighborhoods, and their ability to stay together “through some of the most difficult circumstances in the history of entertainment, some of [which] I can’t even talk about. And I’ll put that against anyone.” “Jimmy is unlike anyone I’ve ever known,” Dre says. “When I left Death Row, and probably when Aftermath was off to a slow start, Jimmy always had my back. We have a different kind of relationship. ” The two still speak every morning, and they appear to collaborate in a decidedly complementary fashion — Dre, the quiet partner, tinkering on projects in seclusion; Iovine the brash promoter, slipping Beats headphones over the necks of athletes and taking the stage at industry events to plug the brand. “Dre’s purpose in life is to come up with something that moves the needle,” Iovine says. “He’s done that really seriously a bunch of times. And now he’s experimenting with video. And what he does will be unique, and he will get there. My responsibility to Apple and to him is to put him in that position where he can.” Their loyalty is clear. “Over the years, Jimmy and I have encountered enough people to fight with,” Dre says. “We never had time to fight with each other. ” Iovine concurs: “I don’t know why, but we’ve always stayed together. And we’ve never had a single argument. Probably because he doesn’t speak,” he deadpans. While he acknowledges that there were flaws in Apple Music’s initial iteration, Iovine — perhaps taking a cue from his partner — stays mum on exactly what they were. (“I can’t say it, because then my competitors would know what I have in mind.”) Nonetheless, he certainly had a crash course in the economics of streaming before Apple entered the picture. BRAINTRUST: Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre sold Beats Electronics to Apple in 2014 for $3 billion. Damian Dovarganes/AP/REX/Shutterstock As Beats by Dre became a giant in the consumer audio world, Iovine and Wood set their sights on creating a boutique streaming service. After abandoning attempts to build it from the ground up, in 2012 they acquired an existing service, MOG, and used that as a foundation to develop the subscription-based Beats Music. Despite the service’s splashy January 2014 launch, Iovine acknowledges: “We were never going to be able to scale it, because the business model was very difficult, and still is. I didn’t think I could have finished it on my own. I don’t think any of us did. We knew exactly what we were doing, meaning that [joining Apple] is the outcome we wanted.” The streaming space has undergone a good deal of consolidation, as the model’s royalty payment structures prevent any company without deep pockets (or investors with a high tolerance for initial operating losses) from staying in the game for long. Yet despite competition from Spotify, Jay Z’s Tidal, and others, Iovine doesn’t believe that streaming has to become a winner-take-all proposition. “Not if streaming is done right,” he says. What “right” means is that each service is culturally different, he explains, so that each has a different feel. “Yeah, they all have the same catalog, but what we’re doing is we’re just building on top of that. That’s where the personality and the feel will come from.” Apple Music’s radio presence — most notably primary station Beats 1 — has been key to differentiating the service from its competitors. Tastemaker DJ Lowe was recruited from BBC’s Radio One to helm a daily show on Beats 1. “We looked at [Beats 1] as a living, breathing, fast-paced organism,” Lowe says. “We thought that if we could build something that can even remotely keep up with the pace that people are consuming music and culture these days, then we have a shot at being something usable that adds value to people’s lives.” In addition to Lowe’s daily broadcasts, Beats 1 hosts periodic shows from established names like Dre, Drake, Elton John, St. Vincent, and Mary J. Blige. Yet Lowe is quick to cite Beats 1’s successes in gaining exposure for the emerging likes of Halsey, Bryson Tiller, Christine and the Queens, and current Grammy nominees Anderson .Paak and Sofi Tukker — significant successes, considering streaming music’s limitations as a way to discover new artists. “Let’s be honest,” Lowe says. “Mainstream radio is not in a place where it can afford — literally afford — to take that many risks on a regular basis. And we are more than happy doing the legwork.” Much ink has been spilled on the streaming services’ battles over exclusive releases from superstars. Tidal bowed three huge releases last year in Beyoncé’s “Lemonade,” Rihanna’s “Anti,” and Kanye West’s “The Life of Pablo.” Apple secured exclusive windows on hits like “Views,” DJ Khaled’s “Major Key,” Chance the Rapper’s “Coloring Book,” Future’s “Evol,” and perhaps most contentiously, Frank Ocean’s “Blonde.” Ocean’s album was the cause of much industry hand-wringing, leading to Universal Music Group’s Lucian Grainge reportedly declaring a kibosh on allowing his acts to participate in service-specific exclusives going forward. Asked if his tenure at Apple has caused friction with former music-business colleagues, Iovine is noncommittal. “Not really. Maybe? I don’t think so.” But he does downplay the centrality of exclusives. “I don’t lean on them too heavily myself,” he says. “We did ’em. We’ll do some more. But we’re just experimenting. I just know that if something feels right and someone wants to, we’re willing to do it, to help them really market their record, get the word out, and spend what it deserves.” A fierce proponent of the paid subscription model for streaming, Iovine faults changes in chart methodology that give the same weight to all streams — paid and free — in tallying the top albums and singles. “A free stream shouldn’t be weighted the same as a paid stream — I don’t think there’s a sane person in the world, other than a promotion man, who would advocate that,” he says. “And that is one of the many things that someone has to fix in order for the whole thing to move forward.” He continues: “A chart that weighs some ad-supported streams the same as a pay stream …encourages artists to promote free tiers to have a No. 1 record. That’s great for the tech companies, but not for artists.” Iovine claims to not regret leaving the recording studio behind. “Not for one second,” he says. “I love daylight.” Yet he’s quick to lament the idea that the music industry is losing its sense of freedom, and risking a brain drain in the process, as the best and brightest are drawn toward the wider horizons that tech companies offer. “Right now there’s a lot of fear in the record business,” he says. “And the [parent] corporations should make it so the labels can relax a bit and be more adventurous. When the businesses are leveling out or going down, and you’re still asking for growth, you don’t have to be a mathematician to know what happens. “You gotta remember,” he continues, “the record industry, in order for it to really thrive, has got to attract great people. And I think there might be some suffering there right now. I always tell people about this one kid, my daughter’s boyfriend. He’s a great piano player, his father was a record producer, and he makes records on the weekend. But he works at Snapchat. He’d be incredible in the music industry. And the only way to get people like that back is to give them the same kind of freedom.” Filed Under: Apple Music Jimmy Iovine Want to read more articles like this one? SUBSCRIBE TO VARIETY TODAY.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Apple patent describes headphones that flip upward… Apple patent describes headphones that flip upward to double as speakers By Kyle Wiggers — February 7, 2017 10:11 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Apple's patent for headphones that double as a pair of speakers may sound innovative, but Flips Audio already built something similar. Patents are like the Wild West of product design: Romantic and imaginative, but often deceiving. They look cool but often don’t see the light of day. Such is probably the case with a new Apple application which shows a pair of headphones that serve double duty as loudspeakers. The patent, granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, shows a basic pair of over-the-ear headphones that contain two cups connected by a head strap. Apple’s innovation concerns what is on the outside: Special sensors that determine the headphone’s current orientation. When the cups are facing inward and a built-in proximity sensor detects a nearby ear, the system recognizes they are in headphone mode. When the cups are flipped outward and on their side, on the other hand, the sensor signals that they have been removed. More: Future iPhones could automatically censor music and audio books That data is fed into built-in amplifiers that ramp up and down sound depending on the headphone’s orientation. When the headphones are on-ear, they function like an off-the-shelf pair of cans. But when the aren’t being worn, a special mode activates, ratcheting up the amplifier and effectively transforming the cups into speakers. Apple envisions the tech applied to more than just headphones. The patent describes in-ear and clip-on headphones with the same sensors and amplifiers on a smaller scale format, much like the current generation of EarPods and AirPods. It also proposes snap-band headphones, a button that would activate the speaker on command, and secondary sound ports for earbud-style headphones. Interestingly, the approach described is not exactly new. As Apple Insider points out, the iPhone 7 packs a speaker array that switches to a stereo-sound mode when the phone is in the landscape orientation. It achieves the effect by amplifying the audio output from the iPhone’s ear speaker and returns the speaker volumes to a level appropriate for calls when sensors detect that the device is in portrait mode and near a user’s ear. More: Running Windows boot camp on the 2016 MacBook Pro may kill your speakers But Apple was beaten to the punch. The Flips Audio work much as the patent describes: When the cups are fixed in headphone orientation, they function as a stereo model, and when the cups are flipped outward, they become loud enough to serve as an external speaker. The Zumreed X2 take a different approach: The cups flip downward, using a table surface as an amplifying sound source.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Apple Pay is the most popular mobile payment… Apple Pay is the most popular mobile payment system in the U.S. By Lulu Chang — February 7, 2017 11:16 AM Subscribe Share Apple Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you While there are plenty of players in the mobile payments game, it looks as though Apple Pay is surging ahead of the competition. If you’re making a digital payment, chances are you’re doing so by way of Apple Pay. Despite a highly competitive landscape, it looks as though the iEmpire reigns supreme when it comes to adoption in the U.S. According to new research from Boston Retail Partners (BRP), Apple Pay boasts the largest percentage of supporting U.S. merchants. As of today, 36 percent of sellers accept the mobile payment service, an increase of 20 points from last year. This proportion is expected to grow, as 22 percent of retailers say they have plans to accept Apple Pay within the next year, while another 11 percent will aim to do so within the next one to three years. Also popular is PayPal, which enjoys a 34-percent acceptance rate in the U.S. Coming in a surprising third-place finish (given how little we tend to hear about it), is Mastercard PayPass, which is accepted by a quarter of merchants. Android Pay certainly has its work cut out in terms of catching up to Apple Pay, with 24-percent acceptance, whereas the slightly newer Samsung Pay has 18-percent acceptance. These percentages, however, are also expected to grow, as 18 percent of surveyed retailers had plans to add Android Pay within the next 12 months, with 11 percent planning to accept Samsung Pay in the same time period. More: Apple accuses Australian banks of seeking a free ride in Apple Pay battle “There are a multitude of mobile wallets and payment apps on the market today, and the arena keeps changing,” BRP said of its research. “In the past year, we have seen the demise of the merchant-backed CurrentC and rise of Walmart Pay. PayPal has been bumped out of its top spot in this year’s survey, with Apple Pay now being accepted at 36 percent of the retailers participating in the survey.” And as the arena changes, so too are retailers’ plans. Only 11 percent say they are steadfastly refusing to accept mobile payments within their stores, whereas nearly a quarter of respondents say that they’ve already added the technology and that it is “working well.” “One of the critical factors for any mobile payment success going forward is education. We have found repeatedly that not only are consumers unsure of how and when mobile payments can be used but, even more telling, associates are unsure,” BRP added. “For mobile payments or mobile wallets to succeed, there must be further education at the point of sale to ensure that a transaction using a mobile device is not longer or more complicated than traditional payments methods for either the customer or associate.”

By Scott Matteson | February 7, 2017, 10:22 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/solarseven As mobile apps continue to evolve, the capability for them to operate in a reactive fashion becomes critical for ensuring engaging mobile user experiences. What does the term "reactive" signify? It refers to an app with a set of standard behaviors that respond to the user's needs and actions. Examples include instantly reflecting changes in the user interface, synchronizing information across devices based upon user engagement (such as scheduling, notification, ongoing data updates, etc.) and pushing app updates from servers to devices to ensure the latest features are available for the user. More about Mobility Apple iPhone 7 is being hardened to handle military-grade secrets Why mobile app developers may soon be looking for a new job Download: Remote access policy Subscribe to our Mobile Enterprise newsletter Let's look at some best practices for building reactive apps in today's demanding mobile environment. Note that certain elements such as security (the use of encryption to store or transmit private data for instance) should always be baked into any quality app, but since these elements don't apply within the context of reactive apps, I'll relegate them to the "you should be doing this by default" bin. 1. Ensure you have the right programming infrastructure A reactive mobile app depends on the latest and greatest in programming advances. Make sure you've selected the best tool for the job. One such example you should consider learning and using is Apple's Swift programming language. Dzone.com touts Swift as "the programming language of the future... built on a modern compiler infrastructure that provides developers with the ability to write more reliable code right from the start from Apple." It's open source (users are encouraged to contribute to the public source code) and can produce fast and robust applications. While it's presented as an app builder for iOS, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch, Apple states: "We're providing binaries for OS X and Linux that can compile code for iOS, OS X, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux." SEE: Apple's Swift programming language: The smart person's guide 2. Build a layout of the app to plan functions Map out everything the app should do before you get started writing code; functions, features, errors, and all aspects of user interaction. Create a flowchart, which should serve as a table of contents to define successful app operation, and refer to this when building out the code and testing the results. 3. Ensure the app experience is seamless across all platforms where applicable Not every app is intended to be run on an array of operating systems and devices. Some simple iOS or Android apps are merely intended for that platform. More elaborate and ambitious apps intended for a larger audience should be designed for all operating systems and devices, factoring in differences in hardware such as CPU/memory and whether users user a touch screen or keys to interact with the app. Apps which exist for desktops and mobile devices may not have all the same features since smaller screen sizes can be a limiting factor, so these disparities should be mapped out and defined, then documented for the user. 4. Leave out the kitchen sink The most powerful and popular apps are the ones that serve a very specific function and stay entirely within those boundaries. Apps which attempt to perform numerous functions (some of which may be unnecessary or unwanted) often become too convoluted, confusing and cumbersome. An app shouldn't be all things for all people; such a concept is a recipe for failure. Focus on your intended user base to keep the app functions relevant to their objectives. 5. Plan for offline capabilities Any mobile app which requires constant network connectivity is doomed. If a user needs your app to do their work but it requires a network signal they'll end up frustrated and dissatisfied — whether they're off the grid, on a plane, traveling or in an area with poor connectivity. Using a local NoSQL database as I wrote about last year, or some other form of a local data store can help ensure offline functionality remains robust and reliable. One example is the help file. A help file in an app which simply links to articles on a website is only as good as the network signal the device possesses. It's tempting to centralize information in this way to create a single repository for data, but a better option is to build replication of this data to the mobile app so it will be available offline, and changes can be synchronized automatically when the device is online. 6. User feedback is key Make sure your app allows user feedback, whether through reviews via an app store, by contacting an email address or social media account, or within the program itself. Monitor what users have to say about your app and respond accordingly to ensure you can support their needs and the app is best suited for their objectives as you develop updates or new features. Remember the concept "all feedback is good feedback" - whether positive or negative. I spoke with Paul Kopacki, chief marketing officer at Realm, a mobile database that powers over one billion mobile applications and enables faster development of apps. He provided some further tips for developing reactive mobile apps. 7. Focus on the immediate UI components The user interface should be as clean and clutter-free as possible. Ideal interfaces have one standard menu or toolbar for accessing all necessary functions to avoid having to backtrack or shift through multiple screens. Reduce the number of clicks or taps a user must engage in to navigate through the app. Provide shortcuts or easy access where available, especially to commonly-used functions. 8. Enable device-synchronization capabilities Users may operate the app across numerous devices they own, so synchronizing data and app functions among these devices can be an enormous boon. The app should be able to track changes and handle conflicts (such as simultaneous edits of the same data), and replicate the changes in a bidirectional (or multidirectional) fashion. Avoid asynchronous networking (data being sent at different speeds) as that may result in lags or delays. 9. Use data bindings for a better flow of information management Data bindings are another way to ensure the data is represented accurately. As Microsoft states, "data binding is the process that establishes a connection between the application UI and business logic. If the binding has the correct settings and the data provides the proper notifications, then, when the data changes its value, the elements that are bound to the data reflect changes automatically. Data binding can also mean that if an outer representation of the data in an element changes, then the underlying data can be automatically updated to reflect the change. For example, if the user edits the value in a TextBox element, the underlying data value is automatically updated to reflect that change. A typical use of data binding is to place server or local configuration data into forms or other UI controls." 10. Build server-push features to communicate with the mobile app Event-based push notifications from servers to mobile devices can be handy for sending alerts, details, status updates and other information beneficial to the user. Align the context accordingly. For instance, a maintenance notice sent a month early will likely be forgotten by the time comes. It's better to let users know the same week that the service will be down from midnight to two a.m. on Friday. Conclusion Using these tips can ensure your users (or customers) get the best possible results from your mobile apps. In my next article I'll talk about how best to build a workflow for updating mobile apps and focus on Apple's Swift programming language for a closer view.

The latest report from research firm Canalys today puts estimates of Apple Watch sales at around 6 million units and $2.6 billion in revenue. This would mean the company took almost 80% of total revenue for the smartwatch market last quarter, according to the report’s estimates. It would also represent around 12% year-over-year growth for Apple Watch sales: Apple set a new quarterly shipment record in Q4 2016, contributing to total smartwatch shipments exceeding 9 million units. This global market figure was largely driven by Apple’s 6 million shipments, representing year-on-year growth of 12%. It was the Apple Watch’s best quarter despite being significantly handicapped by supply constraints, even though Apple simultaneously expanded its supply chain. According to Canalys estimates, the Apple Watch generated more than US$2.6 billion in revenue for Apple in Q4 2016, making up nearly 80% of total smartwatch revenue. The report adds that Apple Watch’s lower entry-level price point with Series 1 and an increased focus on fitness features helped drive demand during 2016. For last year as a whole, Canalys estimates Apple had around 50% global smartwatch market share with approximately 11.9 million units shipped. Apple is followed by Fitbit with 17% of the market last year, Samsung with 15%, and the Others category with the remaining 19%. Canalys notes that Apple, however, wasn’t the only company to enjoy record numbers for wearable sales during the quarter. Xiaomi, for example, also achieved a record quarter for its Mi Band wearable with 5.5 million units shipped, although considered a basic band as opposed to a full-fledged smartwatch. Apple Watch will also have to contend with new Android Wear wearables in the coming weeks and months as the delayed Android Wear 2.0 release finally becomes available on new products. During the company’s Q1 earnings call at the end of last month, CEO Tim Cook added that demand for Apple Watch during the quarter was so strong that the company couldn’t make enough, hinting that its record numbers could have been even higher if it wasn’t experiencing demand/supply constraints.

As a smart smoke and carbon monoxide alarm, Onelink sends you alerts when triggered while you’re away and HomeKit support turns Onelink into a trigger for automation. Check out our hands-on review below: Replacing an old smoke detector with Onelink only takes a few steps. Flip the breaker to the power, twist off and unplug the old alarm, unscrew the old alarm’s bracket, screw on the new bracket, choose from one of three Onelink cable adapters, twist the new alarm in place, and switch the breaker back on. Setup in First Alert’s iPhone or iPad app is simple too. Onelink connects to your Wi-Fi network and the app lets you assign each alarm a location in your house. Onelink later uses this room location to send an audio warning from the alert that smoke or carbon monoxide has been detected in a specific room. HomeKit aside, Onelink is smarter than traditional smoke alarms because it can be silenced from your iPhone or iPad after smoke is removed. Onelink can also send you alerts to your iPhone when you’re not home and smoke or carbon monoxide has been detected. With HomeKit support, Onelink becomes even more useful. Onelink appears in Apple’s Home app on iOS 10 which can also send alerts when the alarm has been triggered. HomeKit support is most useful when using Onelink as a trigger for a scene or automation in Apple’s Home app. The companion app for Onelink makes it easy to regularly test power, sensors, speakers, and general functionality with the press of a button. You can even see when the last test occurred as well as when the alarm was triggered. Testing smoke alarms every month — not just when there’s actually a fire — is a good idea. Onelink makes it easy to remember and test. In my testing, the wired version of Onelink even communicated to the traditional smoke detectors in other rooms of my house both when triggered and when tested from the companion app. HomeKit support means you can ask Siri if smoke is detected at home, although the alarm should alert you first so I don’t think anyone will ever benefit from this specifically. You’re also supposed to be able to control Onelink’s night light with Siri, but it doesn’t appear as a light in Apple’s Home app and Siri can’t find it in my testing. Onelink is actually useful as a HomeKit sensor, however, especially if you have HomeKit-compatible lights. You can use Onelink as a HomeKit trigger in Apple’s Home app if you have a fourth-gen Apple TV or always-on iPad with iOS 10 on the same network. For example, I created an automation using Onelink that automatically turns on every ceiling light if smoke is detected, but only after sunset. A separate automation does the same thing with ceiling lights when carbon monoxide is detected. The idea is that if there’s a fire in the home, you’ll want to be fully able to collect everyone and evacuate if needed without looking for a light switch in the dark. (I actually got to this test automation out on Sunday night when cooking dinner…)   Design-wise, Onelink is generally neutral as it doesn’t look too gadgety, but still looks modern. It features a big button that you can press to dismiss alarms (although the iPhone app is probably more accessible), a loud speaker that tells you where smoke has been detected, and an adjustable LED status indicator that also acts as a night light.   You can adjust the night light brightness for each unit in the companion app. A slider lets you pick between near 0% to 100% brightness. My unit is visible from my bedroom and I prefer to sleep in total darkness, but this feature could be used to help light a dark area at night or be used in a child’s room as a night light. In my testing, Onelink’s night light does not appear separately in the Home app, although other HomeKit accessories like plugs can pull it off. Overall, Onelink isn’t the most exciting way to demonstrate what HomeKit can do, but it’s a smarter smoke alarm than most and its ability to be a HomeKit trigger can have real world benefits. Even without HomeKit support, Onelink is useful thanks to remote alerts, easy monthly testing, and dismissing alarms from the mobile app. I’ve seen a few reports of false alarms and alerts that can’t be dismissed online, but in testing I have not experienced these issues. Check out our hands-on below: First Alert’s Onelink Smoke + Carbon Monoxide Alarm comes in two configurations: battery-powered for up to 10 years for $109.99, and hardwired as tested here for $119.99. Amazon currently offers the hardwired model for $106.75 Prime shipped.

Shares of Apple, IBM, Boeing and Visa accounted for 98 percent of the Dow's gains year to date. Apple's stock alone accounted for nearly a third of the index's gains. "With Apple and IBM, you have to figure they got too cheap," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. "When you have a market this expensive, people go out looking for bargains." The Dow outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite in 2016, lifted by a massive post-U.S. election rally. Shares of Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth Group, IBM and 3M provided the largest points contributions on the Dow last year. They accounted for 46 percent of the Dow's 2016 gains. The Dow is up around 1.6 percent in 2017, having hit a record high earlier in the session. — CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report.

For Apple, it's about doubling down on the services business to position itself for a time when the smartphone becomes redundant as a computing platform. With augmented reality, virtual reality and the internet of things becoming more than buzzwords, Apple's future relies on recurring revenue from these shifts -- and that means services. Most of the Apple innovation debate centers around hardware -- the next great iPhone; an iWatch that does it all; Apple car; or perhaps a so-far un-thought of gadget. While that may still be a focus area for the company's research department, Tim Cook is now focused on doubling the services business over the next four years. For Facebook, ﻿"It's more than just the big blue app," says Eric Sheridan, UBS tech analyst. The company is a portfolio of brands -- including Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus, and the like -- and that's the way to value it. And a big value driver of that value is video. "I see video as a megatrend on the same order as mobile. That's why we're going to keep putting video first across our family of apps and making it easier for people to capture and share video in new ways." - Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO on the Q4 2016 earnings call. BTIG's Rich Greenfield raises an important question: does this mean allowing users to upload and share more video or does this mean offering video entertainment to Facebook users? The latter idea is made more interesting by the fact that Reed Hastings, Netflix CEO, sits on Facebook's board. Each path is a distinct strategy would take the company in different directions. Meanwhile, the company's ad service business continues growing from strength to strength. Strategic buys including Instagram and Whatsapp helped diversify Facebook's geographical and demographical bets. As for monetization, Facebook has many untouched levers, including using bots enabled commerce within Messenger and Whatsapp. And of course, virtual reality: "We're going to keep making big investments in VR content, and I'm excited about what's coming in 2017, from new games to more immersive educational experiences." - Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO on the Q4 2016 earnings call David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook Inc., demonstrates an Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset and Oculus Touch controllers as the gives a demonstration during the Oculus Connect 3 event in San Jose, California. For Microsoft, the pivot to the cloud,continues. Its commercial cloud business, which include cloud products -- Office 365 and Azure – grew by 95% year-over-year in the most recent quarter. CEO Satya Nadella's strategic bets are paying off. Since Nadella's Feb 2014 arrival the stock's rallied 67%. Nadella's LinkedIn acquisition, further proof of his cloud-based services focus, continues integrating with the parent company with the announcement of Kevin Scott, former SVP of infrastructure at LinkedIn as its new CTO. Another nod to Nadella's sound management and stewardship of the 41-year-old American icon is his recent appointment to Starbucks' board of directors at a time when founder and CEO Howard Schultz is stepping away. For Amazon: The Amazon story has not changed: CEO Jeff Bezos continues building scale into the business through aggressive investments in Video, Fulfilment, Fresh, Alexa & India expansion. In the short term this implies quarterly earnings misses while the long-term continues to brim with hope and possibility. With exposure to over a third of the world's digital customers, you'd be hard pressed to find a company with bigger ambitions. For Alphabet: Google's parent company is betting its future on the power of artificial intelligence. Google looks at AI to drive its search, ad and computing capabilities. This is going to have an effect on the Google experience for users: "Over time, the 10 blue search links will likely go away. That could cause a bump in the Google story in a few years, just like the shift from desktop to mobile had a near term negative impact," says Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a leading tech analyst. "Computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning. 2016 was the year that this became central to who we are as a company and the products that we built. We had more than .350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like search, maps, messaging and Google Play."

Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the iOS 10.3 beta update over-the-air after installing the proper certificate on their iOS device. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas are not stable and include many bugs, so they should be installed on a secondary device. As a major 10.x update, iOS 10.3 introduces a new "Find My AirPods" option to help users locate a lost AirPod. Located in the "Find My Friends" app, the Find My AirPods feature keeps track of the last known location where AirPods were connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth, and it allows the AirPods to play a sound to make finding them nearby easier. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Along with a Find My AirPods feature, the update also includes a shift to Apple File System (APFS). First introduced in 2016, APFS is optimized for Flash/SSD storage and includes strong encryption and other important features. Apple recommends all users make an iCloud backup before installing iOS 10.3, as the update will cause the iPhone's file system to switch over to Apple File System. iOS 10.3 also introduces a tweaked app animation, a new Apple ID profile in the Settings app, a better breakdown on how iCloud storage is being used, SiriKit improvements, new iCloud analytics options, and more.

Rating: 1 Votes nutmac 4 days ago at 12:27 pm Can anyone confirm if all the 32bit apps have been officially dead? Still using a few and have yet to replace them. The error message is the same as beta 1, which is "This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve compatibility." iOS has two major updates, major fall update (.0 release) and spring update (typically .2 or .3 that coincides with new iPad model). 10.3 is the major spring update so there's no reason to expect 32-bit support to drop before 11.0.

Apple may be pushing ahead with its iPhone 6s UAE recall. Local media reports suggest that the company has written a letter to the UAE Ministry of Economy to inform them that it’s going to recall 88,700 iPhone 6s units manufactured in China between September and October 2015. Director of the Consumer Protection Department at the UAE Ministry of Economy Dr. Hashim Al Nuaimi confirmed that Apple has informed the ministry about the defective batteries in specific iPhone 6s models that were manufactured in China during the aforementioned time period. The statement added that these smartphones are now going to be recalled. Apple has set up a support page on its website through which owners can check if their unit qualifies for the recall. Apple also mentions that this isn’t a safety issue and that the recall is only limited to a serial number range. The company is going to take back all of these units, replace the batteries, and then send them out to customers again. It does point out on the page that only the batteries will be replaced, not the entire handset. It’s expected that this entire exercise in the United Arab Emirates is going to cost Apple Dh25.6 million which converts to around $7 million. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iPhone 6s.

Most Popular Pin Giphy By Catriona Harvey-Jenner 7 February 2017 Share Tweet Share E-mail Apologies to anyone who doesn't like change, because you're not going to like this news. Word on the tech street is that Apple probably won't ever make an iPhone 8, and if it's true, it's the end of a bloody era. Apple tends to release the new models of its phones every September, and given its last release - the iPhone 7 - came out in September 2016, you'd expect the updated version of that model, the iPhone 7s, to land this coming September. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below But the thing is, there's also the small matter of 2017 being the 10 year anniversary of the first ever iPhone being brought into existence, and it wouldn't be like Apple not to mark such a significant anniversary in a big way. Which is what leads those-in-the-know (er, Tech Radar) to believe that there won't be an iPhone 7s, or even an iPhone 8. In its place, apparently, will be *drum roll*... the iPhone X. Edgy. Pin Youtube/ConceptsiPhone Most Popular Scrapping the previous pattern they've adhered to with chronological numbering, it seems Apple might be considering using the Roman numeral for 10, 'X', instead. And it's got quite a ring to it. But apparently it wouldn't just be the phone's name that's not in keeping with the tech giant's previous models. According to the report which hints at the whole 'X' thing, written by analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company, the new phone will boast a 5.8-inch wraparound screen, with the fingerprint detector, earpiece and front camera all built into it. So there'll be no physical home button, which is new. While the rumours sound exciting, at the moment they seem to be just informed speculation with no actual proof. So we might have to wait another eight months for the big reveal. That should be enough time to get used to the 'X' though, just in case. Follow Cat on Twitter. Like this?

BeatsX By Dre Wireless Earphones Confirmed to Arrive on February 10 GO Available for $150 via Apple online and retail stores Feb 7, 2017 18:40 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Beats has just announced that its wireless earphones unveiled back in September will finally make their debut on the market later this week, on February 10. The upcoming BeatsX earphones were expected to go on sale last year, but Apple announced in December they would not be available until February 2017. Luckily, the earphones haven't been further delayed, as Beats has confirmed that starting February 10 customers will be able to purchase them via Apple's online and retail stores, as well as through authorized sellers.They are available in two color options: black and white. Two additional colors, blue and gray, will be launched soon. The new BeatsX earphones come with a Flex Form neckband that allows users to wear them without fear of dropping and losing them. It's a completely different design as compared to Apple's AirPods, and they even cost less. Thanks to the unique Flex-Form cable, users are offered a flexible fit, while the wide range of eartip options provide personalized comfort. Also, when you aren't wearing them, the magnetic ear buds keep the earphones tangle-free and they easily coil up for compact portability. Play Video The earphones have been designed with the help of Apple's engineers, so it's no surprise they pack Apple's W1 chip that's supposed to make them more power efficient. Speaking of which, Beats claims its new earphones feature an 8-hour battery power, which should allow users to enjoy wireless listening throughout a full day. On top of that, the Fast Fuel technology will provide users with up to 2 hours of playback time after a 5-minute charge. The BeatsX wireless earphones allow users to take calls, as well as control music and activate Siri with RemoteTalk. Aside from the BeatsX earphones, the retail package also contains a pocket-sized carrying case and a lightning to USB-A charging cable. #BeatsX earphones#Beats by Dr. Dre#Apple earphones#Air Pods#BeatsX by Dre subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple AirPods Can Survive Drops and Full Washing Machine Cycles Apple Delays iPhone 7 AirPods Launch, Fanboys Think Tim Cook Likely Lost Them Apple Launches the Water-Resistant iPhone 7 Apple Trademark Hints at Future iPhone Model with Iris Scanning Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One Microsoft Teases New Windows 10 Security Announcements Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux    BeatsX by Dre New Mac Apps Sip: A status bar menu application for the Mac OS X that enables you to quickly sample and encode colors that are visible on your Mac's screen.

Despite the fact that there are many contenders trying to make their place in this market, the smartwatch game is dominated by a couple of manufacturers, with Apple leading the pack. According to a new report, the Apple Watch accounted for half of all smartwatch sales and over three-quarters of all revenues in Q4 2016. Market research firm Canalys estimates that Apple shipped six million Apple Watch units in the final quarter of last year thus accounting for more than half of the nine million units shipped by all players in the smartwatch market. The Apple Watch is estimated to have generated $2.6 billion in revenue for the company and if this figure is accurate, it represents 80 percent of all smartwatch revenues in Q4 2016. Jason Low, an analyst at Canalys, suggests that the Apple Watch performed well against its rivals because the company streamlined marketing and re-aligned pricing for its wearable device by offering the Series 1 for less than it was originally sold after the Apple Watch Series 2 was released. Apple is believed to have shipped 11.9 million smartwatches in 2016 thus accounting for almost 50 percent of the global smartwatch market share. Filed in Apple >Gadgets.

The new plug—which is actually kind of old—is called Ultra Accessory Connector, or UAC, and will work along side Lightning and USB-C instead of replacing them. UAC is a port you’ve probably seen, but assumed it was just another little USB port. It’s found on some Nikon cameras as an audio/video out port. UAC (left) compared with USB A (right) UAC’s benefit for Apple is its compact size. It’s a little thinner than USB-C and about half as wide, and it needs less space inside devices. Considering space is at a premium in smaller devices like headphones and earbuds, that’s a pretty big deal. Apple plans to let accessory makers build USB-C to UAC, Lightning to UAC, and 3.5 mm headphone jack to UAC cables, and UAC ports on headphones. In other words, get ready to add another cable to your bag. The Case for UAC UAC isn’t replacing Lightning or USB-C, the Verge confirmed, but instead is a supplement. Why do we need another connector in our already convoluted collection of cables and adapters? It’s all about standards—or in this case, the lack of standards. The 3.5 mm headphone jack is going away because Apple and other smartphone makers decided to remove it from their devices. It isn’t, however, going away quickly so we’re seeing a mix of devices and accessories that are sometimes 3.5 mm-compatible, and sometimes aren’t. Lightning and USB-C may look similar, but they aren’t interchangeable. USB-C headphones, for example, only work with USB-C devices. Lightning connectors are the same, which means after decades of a standard audio plug we’re facing a future where our smartphone accessories are essentially locked to specific devices. The solution, at least as far as Apple is concerned, is a connector that makes our headphones and other accessories compatible with both USB-C and Lightning. That’s where UAC comes in. Headphone makers include a UAC port and users plug in the cable that’s compatible with their smartphone; USB-C or Lightning. This isn’t exactly an elegant fix for the self-inflicted problem Apple and other smartphone makers are creating by eliminating the 3.5 mm headphone jack, but it is a fix. Regardless of whether or not you agree with the decision to deprecate the traditional headphone jack on smartphones, it’s happening and it’s something users and manufacturers have to deal with. UAC Versus Bluetooth Bluetooth headphones are easy to find, plus they work with most smartphones. Why not go wireless across the board and forget about UAC? While Bluetooth is convenient, it has some drawbacks. First, Bluetooth headphones require their own battery. When the battery is drained, your headphones are worthless until they’re charged again. True, some Bluetooth headphones include a cabled option, but those primarily rely on the 3.5 mm jack that’s disappearing from more phones. Bluetooth also suffers from latency issues. For some uses, like listening to music, that’s not a problem. For others, like watching movies, that means your audio and video may be out of sync. Audio quality can suffer, too, and sound flatter compared to wired headphones. UAC Beyond Headphones Apple is starting with headphones for UAC, but it could be used for other accessories, too. That means device makers can build a single product that works with USB-C and Lightning instead of devices that are iPhone- or Android-specific. Beyond headphones, that could be speakers, extra storage, microphones, and more. It’s almost as if Apple understands the need for universal connectors, but thinks they should be on the accessories we use and not on our smartphones.

Registered Mac developers can install the new software via the Updates tab in the Mac App Store or through Apple’s dev portal. Today’s beta comes 1 day after the second betas for iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2, and two weeks after the original macOS 10.12.4 beta was released. It includes Night Shift mode and other improvements. You can access Night Shift in System Preferences, Notification Center or via Siri, and it gradually shifts your Mac’s display from blue to yellow. This cuts down on exposure to blue light, which is believed to cause sleeping problems. Apple has also seeded iOS 10.3 beta 2 to public testers. Folks in Apple’s public beta program can access the release via Settings > General > Software Update. We’re installing the betas now, and will update this post with any changes.

Image: Bob Al-Greene/Mashable By Damon Beres2017-02-07 17:54:02 UTC Finally, an iPhone that doesn't require a dongle. When Apple opens its new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., employees will enjoy squatting over toilets that take a cue from the company's iconic smartphones, Reuters reported Tuesday morning.  SEE ALSO: Apple wants to make this one product in the U.S., but you won't be able to buy it Here's the relevant excerpt—emphasis ours: Apple's novel approach to the building took many forms. Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products. The elevator buttons struck some workers as resembling the iPhone's home button; one former manager even likened the toilet's sleek design to the device. But [architect German] de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. Ah yes, the Platonic ideal of form and dimension—the perfect vessel to contain all manner of Chipotle aftermath. When reached for comment, a representative for Apple tactfully ignored our probing about the iThrone and provided a number of renderings of the new campus, which has repeatedly been compared to a spaceship since its announcement in 2011: Image: Apple Image: Apple The campus' construction cost $5 billion according to Reuters. And iPhone-toilets don't even place among the facility's wildest features—Apple reportedly insisted that none of the doorways contained thresholds, as engineers "risked distraction from their work" if they had to "adjust their gait while entering the building." And apparently, 15 meetings were held with the Santa Clara County Fire Department to reach an agreement on "sleek, minimalist" signage. The 2.8 million-square-foot building is expected to open this spring. Apple employees, please keep Mashable in mind when sending out your first reports of the campus's new toilets—we are deeply interested in the full loo-down.

Image: raymond wong/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-02-07 17:56:31 UTC Chances are, if you're serious about iPhone photography, you know all about Moment and its high-quality miniature lenses that attach to the camera. Three years after its original Kickstarter success, the company's returning to the crowdfunding site to launch three new products: a slim battery case with a dedicated shutter button and integrated lens-mount system, a barebones wooden case with an integrated lens-mount, and a new wide-angle lens designed from the ground up for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus' larger camera aperture. SEE ALSO: 7 can't-miss apps: Color by Disney, 'Time Turner' and more "These are the best products we have ever made," says Marc Barros, co-founder of Moment. "Designed for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, our new battery case, photo case and wide lens are the first products in the market to match the quality that Apple delivers. If you love shooting on your phone, these products are for you." The Battery Photo Case for iPhone 7 has a 2,500 mAh battery and a 3,500 mAh battery for the iPhone 7 Plus version. Image: raymond wong/mashable Barros came by the Mashable office last week to show me prototypes of the three products. Like all of Moment's existing lineup of lenses and cases, the new gear looks and feels well-made — not at all shoddy.  My favorite of the trio is the Battery Photo Case for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which will sell for $99.99 ($79.99 for the Early Bird Special). It looks sort like a mix between a Mophie and an Apple Smart Battery Case — but better in every way.  It looks sort like a mix between a Mophie and an Apple Smart Battery Case — but better in every way.  Besides being easy to put on and remove (the top half peels back like on the Smart Battery Case), it has a 2,500 mAh battery — which is enough to recharge it fully and then some — a shutter button that works like a real camera (half-press to autofocus and full press to shoot) in conjunction with the Moment camera app, and a lens-mount for attaching Moment lenses. But whereas Apple only makes a Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 7 and not the iPhone 7 Plus, Moment sells a version for the larger iPhone with a 3,500 mAh battery. Moreover, you can mount lenses to both the regular wide-angle camera and the tele camera. It's nice and slim, but packs a punch. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE As with most popular battery cases, the Photo Battery Case also redirects sound from the side of the iPhone's bottom speaker upwards at you.  Another nice touch is the ability to turn the battery on and off. On Mophie's, there's a physical switch that you can press to turn charging on/off. Apple's Smart Battery Case offers no such control — once it's on, it's always charging your iPhone, which sucks if you want to save the power for later use. A switch is convenient, but Barros says they decided not to include one because people could accidentally hit it. Instead, the Photo Battery Case splits the difference with a software toggle within the Moment app: Image: raymond wong/mashable The battery case is easy to remove. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE One clean Lightning pass-through port on the bottom of the case for charging. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE Lenses clip into the case with a simple twist. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE For those who don't need a built-in battery or might not want the extra bulk of the Photo Battery Case, Moment's also selling a new Photo Case for $29.99, available in "American Dark Walnut" or "Black Coated Canvas".  The Photo Case doesn't have any shutter button like the company's existing lens cases — they're just good-looking cases that support Moment lenses and have a loop for attaching a lanyard. Moment's $30 Photo Case. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE Works with all your Moment lenses. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE The Photo Case is available for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in two types of finishes. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE The Battery Photo Case ($99.99) sandwiched by the Photo Cases ($29.99). Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE Cases are cool, but what about lenses? Moment's got one new lens: A newly designed aspherical wide-angle lens with a larger lens diameter to better accommodate the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus' larger apertures. For existing Moment lens owners, Moment will offer a small adapter that'll convert the smaller diameter mount to the larger ones. Old lens diameter (left) vs. new lens diameter (right).

The upcoming version of macOS Sierra is the first to bring Night Shift to the Mac. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta is currently only available to developers and public beta testers. Public beta versions usually come a few days after developer versions if not the same day. macOS 10.12.4 beta also includes changes to Siri, Dictation, and Apple’s PDF API: Night Shift now available on the Mac. Dictation support for Shanghainese. Ask Siri about cricket scores, schedules and player rosters. Siri knows about statistics and data from the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. Updated PDFKit APIs for better displaying of PDFs in apps that use the framework. This is how Apple describes its Night Shift feature: Night Shift adjusts the color of your display after sunset. Many studies show that exposure to bright-blue light in the evening can affect your circadian rhythms and make it harder to fall asleep. After sunset, Night Shift will shift your display colors to the warmer end of the spectrum, making the display easier on your eyes. In the morning, your display returns to its regular settings.

But does that mean the new phone will wind up in your hands sooner than usual? Credit: Handy AbovergleichMore Credit: Handy AbovergleichWord of the new production schedule comes from analysts at BlueFin Research Partners, who told investors in a research note that Apple will likely begin manufacturing its next smartphone in June. That's sooner than iPhone production has ramped up in the past. BlueFin's note, obtained by Barron's, says the move probably won't impact the iPhone 8's release date. Typically, Apple introduces new phones in the fall. MORE: The Most Amazing iPhone 8 Concepts "The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that [Apple] is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms, although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8/X," the analysts wrote. The iPhone X has been floated as another possible name for Apple's upcoming smartphone. Apple's apparent decision to ramp up production sooner than expected might be understandable. The company is reportedly working on a big update to the iPhone this year. The new device could be the first from Apple to offer a curved, OLED display, according to reports. Apple might also be planning to remove the physical home button sensor and bake its Touch ID functionality directly into the smartphone's screen. I addition, Apple's iPhone 8 could offer an all-glass enclosure and since the home button may disappear, the phone's entire face might be covered in the display. According to reports, the iPhone 8 will sit alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus this year, which will feature more modest upgrades over their predecessors. Since the iPhone 8 is expected to be a big departure from iPhones of old, Apple might need a little more time to get it ready for customers. The move to start production sooner might also be a way to address supply issues that Apple typically encounters when it launches a new iPhone. In its quarterly earnings call last month, for example, Apple said it took until January for the supply of iPhone 7 Plus models to meet demand for the phone that it unveiled in September 2016.

And it might expand to the Pixel and the Galaxy S7, if you ask nicely. Mobile Accessories by Lori Grunin February 7, 2017 9:00 AM PST @LoriGrunin Phones, cameras and batteries go together like the legs of a tripod. So Moment's going back to Kickstarter for funding its revised case and lenses to support the dual-lens iPhones, including capability to add a lens in front of the phone's telephoto camera. But this time the company's floating an option for a battery case that adds its lens mount and shutter button in addition to the new camera-only case design and an updated wide-angle lens. The battery case incorporates a 3,500mAh (iPhone 7 Plus) or 2,500mAh (iPhone 7) power supply, which Moment claims boosts the charge by at least 100 percent. It has a Lightning pass-through connector to let you recharge both the case and the phone's battery, and the updated app will let you control when the phone uses the auxillary battery. The Moment battery case with the redesigned wide-angle lens. Moment It's slated to cost the same as Apple's own Smart Battery case, $99 (Apple's case is £99 in the UK and AU$165 in Australia; Moment's price converts to about £80 or AU$130). It has more capacity than Apple's and I think it's a lot more attractive. I saw a late prototype of it, and it's pretty slim and comfortable. The battery case and the thinner photo-only version ($30; directly converted £25 or AU$40) also change the way the shutter button works. The current version, like many add-ons that provide a physical shutter, uses Bluetooth. Moment's modified it to use the Lightning connector, which allows it to create a two-stage shutter -- like a camera's half press for focusing, full press for shooting. The new button lies flush with the case as well. Both also offer two strap slots. Note that you don't have to use Moment's lenses to take advantage of the physical shutter operation, though you do have to use Moment's camera app for it. If you do choose to use its lenses, the wide-angle is first to get a version 2 treatment ($100, directly converted about £80 or AU$130), though the new mount has been retrofitted to all its existing lenses. According to Moment, it's optimized the new wide-angle lens for cameras with larger apertures, like the iPhone 7/7 Plus' f1.8. Moment's telephoto lens can increase the magnification on the iPhone 7 Plus' 56mm lens. The slimmer photo case will come in two-tone Walnut or Black canvas. Moment The wide lens offers a new optical formula, incorporating an aspherical element; aspherical elements help lenses improve focus while remaining compact. The company claims it delivers better edge-to-edge sharpness with no vignetting (dark corners). Like all Moment's lenses, it's made of glass and metal, making it heavier than cheaper designs. If you already invested in a Moment lens but want one of the revamped cases, never fear: Moment will offer a lens adapter to fit on the old mount. Otherwise, its old metal mounting plate -- which I didn't really like anyway -- is going away. The new mounting interface is a little easier to manipulate, too. The updated lenses stand ready to work on other popular phone cameras, notably those of the Google Pixel and Galaxy S7. However, those currently aren't in the Kickstarter. Moment will consider development of those cases based on feedback it will solicit via the campaign. If funded, the company plans to ship the photo case and lens in late May or early June; the battery case in late June or early July.

 A startup that was born out of the pain of building Apple's network has raised $25 million Julie Bort Feb. 7, 2017, 12:45 PM 3,583 facebook linkedin twitter email print SnapRoute CEO Jason Forrester SnapRoute SnapRoute, the startup created from Apple's former data center networking team, has raised a healthy series A round of financing of $25 million, led by Rama Sekhar Norwest Venture Partners. SnapRoute seemed to come from nowhere last year to take the computer network world by storm, launching a software product that is doing well with Facebook's growing family of Open Compute Project computer switches. It created so much buzz that it actually knocked Hewlett Packard Enterprise out from leading HPE's own open source "OpenSwitch" project when the would-be customers of OpenSwitch voted to ditch HPE's software and replace it with SnapRoute's. Raising money wasn't a problem. VCs were throwing themselves at the 35-person startup, whose cofounders consist of the startup's CEO Jason Forrester, director of engineering Adam Casella and director of customer experience Glenn Sullivan. "We had seven Tier 1 VCs wanting to lead the investment," Forrester said, admitting he was slow to call them all back. "One of them wanted in so badly, they tracked down my landlord to broker the meeting." In the end, he got them all in a bidding war and wound up with terms and a valuation that appealed to him. (He wouldn't disclose, but we'll update this post with the details when we find out.)  "In my opinion the VCs are flush with cash right now. A lot of major funds are raising huge amounts, but deal flow is mediocre at best. So if you’re a startup right now, and you have signs of life and paying customers, you can walk in and call your own terms," he says. The pain of building Apple's demanding network But the allure also has to do with this particular startup. Before founding SnapRoute in 2015, the founders worked at Apple building the company's data center network, the one that supports huge internet services like iTunes, iCloud, Siri and the App Store. Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Getty It was the pain of building an enormous-yet-reliable network that drove them to develop this product, Forrester tells us. "Apple is a great place to work. We met a lot of talented people, really amazing folks changing the world every day there," he said. But "we left because every day we were called into principal's office because of some bug with the incumbents products. When you pour your heart and soul into the infrastructure, and do everything you can to make it useful and then it crumbles and is brittle, just the sheer getting beat-up everyday gave us the strong desire to finally change things in the network space." There's another aspect to their history, which we've previously reported. Word among the network industry is that this team all quit the same week in large part because Apple's culture of secrecy forbade them from openly collaborating with other network engineers outside of Apple. (Forrester wouldn't dish about that.) SnapRoute offers a network operating system. That's software that runs on what's known as commodity or "white box" switches. These are inexpensive network switches built with off-the-shelf, easily replaceable parts, as opposed to the highly integrated, custom chips and boards that Cisco and Juniper use in their products. White box hardware is what Facebook's OCP is working on, but low-end switches are also available from other sources, like Chinese manufacturers.  SnapRoute's claim to fame is that it's highly customizable. A company can install just the individual features it needs. SnapRoute promises to fix bugs within 24 hours, "which is unheard of in the network space," he says.  Competition heating up SnapRoute isn't the only the startup out there taking on Cisco by offering a network operating system that works with less expensive hardware (although its choose-a-feature bit is unique). A startup called  Cumulus Networks, founded by a former Cisco engineer JR Rivers, is a direct competitor, been around for longer and has over 500 customers, Rivers tells us. Arista And then there's Arista Networks, the public company founded by a host of ex-Cisco stars and billionaires Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton. Cisco filed a bunch of lawsuits against Arista over patent infringement claims, but that hasn't seemed to stop Arista from winning lots of business. VMware is also a huge competitor, and just announced it's network software, NSX, is on track to do $1 billion in the next year. And there are a handful of other startups like Pluribus Networks, led by another former Cisco star engineer, Kumar Srikantan and backed by Yahoo founder Jerry Yang.  Including SnapRoute's, $4.5 million seed round led by Lightspeed, the 35-person startup has now raised $29.5 million. In addition to Norwest, other investors in this round include Lightspeed, AT&T and Microsoft Ventures.

We’re hearing similar reports about the iPhone 8 as well but according to a new report, Apple is likely to schedule the iPhone 8 release in September this year as many expect. Multiple analysts are of the view that Apple is going to start manufacturing the iPhone 8 earlier than it usually starts making new iPhones. They believe this means that the iPhone 8 release is going to be moved up from the company’s traditional fall release timeframe for new iPhones. Apple obviously hasn’t said or hinted anything to suggest that it’s going to release the new iPhone earlier than it normally does. The company is not one to drop hints about new iPhones so we can expect it to remain mum leading right up to the iPhone 8 release. There are a lot of expectations from the company’s new flagship smartphone this year primarily because 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of this iconic product from Apple. The company is expected to launch a revolutionary new iPhone later this year. As it stands, we may very well have to wait until September this year to be really sure of what the iPhone 8 brings to the table. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 8.

But before his death in 2011, the Apple boss knew his last product would never be for sale to his gadget-hungry fans. Months before succumbing to pancreatic cancer , Jobs unveiled his plans for a new futuristic headquarters built with his signature attention to detail while reflecting the Californian landscapes from his childhood. Referred to as the ‘flying spaceship’ by Silicon Valley and now months away from completion it has been designed by British firm Foster+Partners. The huge circular HQ is broken up by cafes, lobbies and entrances (Photo: Reuters) The Apple Campus 2 is seen under construction in Cupertino (Photo: Reuters) Have your say on this storyComment Below From the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of hidden pipes, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny. Insiders working on the $5billion campus say weeks are spent on every minute detail with even the design for the door handles being repeatedly sent back before bosses would sign them off. “As with Apple’s products, Jobs wanted no seam, gap or paintbrush stroke showing,” an insider said. “Every wall, floor and even ceiling is to be polished to a supernatural smoothness. “All of the interior wood was to be harvested from a specific species of maple, and only fine quality ‘heartwood’ at the centre of the trees would be used.” Apple’s British chief design officer Sir Jony Ive is reported to have designed elements of the new campus, including desks and chairs in tune with the company’s style.

Placed end-to-end they would roughly be the length of 26 football pitches. Since laying the foundations in November 2013, more than 13,000 full time construction workers have been employed to complete Jobs’s dream.

Already the world’s largest piece of curved glass has been installed. Anyone wanting to walk around the building, formally known as Apple Campus 2, will have to stroll more than a mile from start to finish. In an interview with Architectural Record, Foster+Partners founder Norman Foster explained his design for the building was inspired by the idea of a London square, where houses surround a park. It eventually evolved into the present design with more than 7,000 trees being planted around the campus.

So the idea of one building with a great park was really borne out of a very intensive process,” he said. Lord Foster explained that, when planning the layout of the building, the architects had to consider the different departments that would need to work together. “Of course, you have got an enormous range of skills in this building, from software programmers to designers, marketing, retail,” he said. “But you can move vertically in the building as well as horizontally. The proximity, the adjacencies are very, very carefully considered.” The building’s colossal size forced him to break the design up with cafes, lobbies and entrances. One of the main features to ensure employees are kept happy is the restaurant which opens to the huge gardens inside the doughnut shaped building. Apple has hired a leading arborist from Stanford University to help landscape the area and restore some of the natural plant life, including apricot orchards. Steve Jobs planned the new HQ before his death (Photo: Getty) The grounds have been intended to make the site look very park-like and includes jogging paths as well as walking and cycling trails around the building. More than 1,000 bikes will be kept on the site and available to staff to get around the campus. Although Apple has refused to comment on the building insiders say more than $1billion has spent on the interior of the main building alone. It includes a $75million ‘wellness centre’ to cater for the needs of the entire Apple community in Silicon Valley, which is around 20,000 people. The original site at nearby One Infinite Loop will remain open. The new headquarters has also been designed with a new 1,000-seat underground auditorium which will allow Apple to hold its presentations in the same building, instead of having to go to San Francisco every time a new product is launched. Two large buildings 300,000 square feet on the southern edge of the campus have been constructed, isolated from prying eyes for the company’s secretive research and development teams. Apple's old headquarters (Photo: Reuters) Underneath the headquarters, designers have built a vast 14,200 space car park to ensure there are no rows of parked cars to spoil the view from ground level or above. Jobs wanted to ensure the environmental impact of the building was minimal while making it as self-sufficient as possible. Most of the power for the facilities come from an “on-site low carbon Central Plant”. On its roof, thousands of solar panels have been installed as Apple intends to use alternative energy as part of its pledge to use 100 percent renewable energy. Apple Vice President of Environmental Initiatives Lisa Jackson has stated that 80 percent of the site will be so-called “green space” while the main building will go without air conditioning or heating for three-quarters of the year due to natural ventilation. The new campus will reportedly use recycled water and will use 13,300 feet of pipeline to share the supply between it and the Californian city of Cupertino, where it is situated. After several redesigns to the original plan, Apple also completed the build without having to remove any dirt from the area. Many of the designs are now set to benefit Apple’s London HQ which is set to open in 2021 at London’s iconic Battersea Power Station for its 1,400 UK staff. The building is 500,000-square-foot and considered one of the biggest office locations in the capital.

Image: christina ascani/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-02-07 16:46:19 UTC Relax, Apple's not dumping the Lightning plug for its iOS devices (yet). A report from 9to5Mac stoked fears that Apple might once again switch to a new smaller, 8-pin "Ultra Accessory Port" (UAC) for iPhones and iPads after the company gave a preview of the new plug to accessory manufacturers. SEE ALSO: Why your iPhone battery meter sometimes goes haywire The plug, which has been confirmed by The Verge to be the same 8-pin port used in Nikon cameras, is non-symmetrical and will be a part of Apple's "Made For iPhone" (MFi) program. But make no mistake: The UAC is not a port/plug Apple will force on users or accessory makers. Apple only added the 8-pin connector to the MFi program at the request accessory makers, ArsTechnica reports. Do not — I repeat — do not throw your Lightning cables away in a fit of rage. So what's all the fuss about this new port, which isn't, in fact, even new? It has to do with wired headphones. If you look at the smartphone landscape right now, you'll see it's an ugly mess for music listeners. Here are your wired headphone options: Lightning (iPhone 7/7 Plus (and presumably all future iOS devices) USB-C (Moto Z, HTC U Ultra, and many new Android phones) 3.5mm (Pretty much every phone) The problem is your wired Lightning headphones won't work with USB-C phones (and vice versa) and headphones with the trusty ol' 3.5mm jack won't work with either. Sure, you could get a dongle, like the one Apple includes with the iPhone 7, to convert headphones with a 3.5mm jack to Lightning, but that still doesn't solve the problem of all the different aforementioned conversions, of which there aren't any dongles for.  With UAC, headphone makers would get a solution that (sort of) fixes the problem. Instead of making headphones specifically for each type of port, companies would be able to make headphones with a female UAC port on the earcup. With UAC, a company like Bose or Beats can sell the same wired headphone model to all customers, simply subbing out the cable to make it compatible with a specific kind of device. It'll be up to individual manufacturers which cable to offer — a male UAC-to-Lightning, UAC-to-USB-C, or UAC-to-3.5mm headphone jack — or simply offer all three, so users can switch devices easily. That would be especially useful to users who often switch between a phone and laptop or PC, which still tend to offer 3.5mm jack connectors for audio. But what about earbuds? UAC probably won't work so well for those, due to obvious size constraints, though earbuds also tend to be cheaper and used mostly with one device. For those reasons, manufacturers will likely continue to offer earbuds that work with only one type of connector.  Of course, you could bypass all of this wired cables/port nonsense with wireless headphones — but don't tell that to audiophiles or they'll have a field day explaining to you the advantages of wired over wireless.

It has made customers wait more than five months for these earbuds and the company has finally confirmed when they will be available for purchase. Apple was originally supposed to release the Beats X wireless earbuds in the fall last year. The company has announced today that it’s going to release Beats X on February 10th. We did see a report several days back which suggested that Apple may soon confirm the release date for these wireless earbuds. It was reported yesterday that select Apple retail stores across the United States had started to receive stock of the Beats X. The earbuds feature Apple’s W1 chip which enables them to easily pair with Mac and iOS devices. They are also compatible with non-Apple devices so you can use them with your Android smartphone as well should you so desire. Bear in mind that these earbuds have to be charged through a Lightning connector. Apple says that the battery life is good for 8 hours so users can get two hours of listening time even if they just charge the Beats X for five minutes. The Beats X wireless earbuds from Apple will be available for purchase starting February 10th for $149.95. Filed in Gadgets..

Have you seen this young bride's stolen wedding dress? In the fiscal year 2016, Apple sold 212 million iPhones – down 8% – which makes it all the more likely this year’s expected iPhone 8 will be a complete makeover. The new phone is expected to launch in September at a special event, as is traditional from Apple – but analysts are expecting something very big. Multiple reports from respected analysts and industry sources have suggested this year’s iPhone 8 – expected in September, as is traditional from Apple – will be a near-complete overhaul. MORE: Sorry everyone, Apple says it won’t replace dodgy batteries in iPhone 6 Curves Respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo – who has a long track record of accurate predictions of upcoming iPhone models – said that Apple is going to shake things up with a new ‘curved’ look in 2017. The prediction has been echoed with rumours from within Apple’s supply chain. Speaking to Nikkei Asian review earlier this year, source predicted that the next phone would be ‘equipped with a screen bent on the two sides’. No home button As well as a larger screen dominating the front of the device, Apple may well ditch the Home button entirely – echoing rival Google, whose Pixel phone has no physical buttons on the front. Manufacturing documents from Apple’s Asian supply chain suggest it’ll have a new ‘invisible’ home button, according to leaked documents seen by Apple Insider. Glass back Citing sources in Apple’s supply chain, Japanese business publication NIkkei said the new phone will come in three models – and all will have glass backs. All three phones will have glass backs supplied by Biel Crystal Manufactory and Lens Technology in China. ‘Apple has tentatively decided that all the 5.5-inch, 5-inch and 4.7-inch models will have glass backs, departing from metal casings adopted by current iPhones, and Biel and Lens are likely to be providing all the glass backs for the new iPhones next year,’ the source said. Wireless charging Other smartphone brands such as Samsung already offer wireless charging – and Apple uses it in Apple Watch – so analysts believe the new iPhone will charge wirelessly. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities predicted wireless charging in at least one of the models on sale this year. Instead of plugging phones into a cable, users will sit them on a dedicated charging pad to power them up. The ‘Ferrari’ phone? Next year’s crop of iPhones could contain a mysterious high-powered new model – codenamed ‘Ferrari’ – according to leaked documents from Chinese manufacturers. Apple Insider says that the leaked document hints at three handsets – titled D20, D21 and D22 – and that D20 and D21 will be the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. The third handset will be, ‘A completely redesigned high-end variant,’ according to the site.

Plans On Doubling Services Revenue Over 4 Years Services could be the hidden growth driver that investors are looking for. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Feb 7, 2017 at 10:30AM If you've been paying close attention, you'll notice that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been very conscientiously trying to shift investor focus away from things like iPhone unit sales in favor of recurring revenue sources like services. That's why the iPhone maker even introduced a non-GAAP metric for installed base-related purchases in early 2016, only to stop reporting it just a few quarters later (likely due to the SEC cracking down on companies abusing non-GAAP metrics). The iPhone sold rather well over the holiday quarter, setting a fresh quarterly record, but Apple is still very much wanting investors to better appreciate its services business. iCloud. Image source: Apple. For 2016, Apple's services revenue hit a new milestone, crossing $25 billion in revenue for the first time. Services should even be large enough to be a stand-alone Fortune 100 company in 2017. Not one to rest on its laurels, Apple is ambitiously hoping to double services revenue over the next four years. 150 million subscriptions and counting On the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted that Apple now bills over 150 million paid subscriptions through the various content platforms that it operates. That includes both Apple's own services as well as third-party subscriptions. This is a new metric that Apple has not disclosed previously, and it will be important to see this number grow (if Apple continues providing updates, that is). There was no update on how many Apple Music subscribers the company now has, but the most recent update from December was 20 million. Apple Music. Image source: Apple. More color surrounding these subscriptions would go a long way toward analyzing the services business. I have no shortage of questions. Are those 150 million subscriptions all discrete users, or are there multiple subscriptions per user? What's the average monthly recurring amount? What categories (such as video, audio, or other) are seeing the most interest? Has there been any uplift from the reduced 15% cut on long-term (longer than one year) subscriptions? Many enterprise-oriented apps utilize subscription models; how much is the enterprise contributing to subscriptions? When asked how Apple will get to its goal, CFO Luca Maestri did add some additional detail: And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double digits, and we're also seeing that the [average revenue per user] per paying customer is increasing double digits, right? So it's a combination of the two, obviously the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. Interestingly, Maestri also noted that iCloud storage and AppleCare are growing "very well" and are at all-time highs as well. Apple last cut iCloud storage prices in late 2015, making the service more competitive with rivals (iCloud storage used to be overpriced). Meanwhile, services like iCloud Photo Library increase the need for cloud storage. On the AppleCare front, more customers tend to buy Apple's extended warranty when newly designed products come out due to the higher initial repair costs, and those new MacBook Pros with Touch Bars are both new and pricey. Take what you can get Here's another way to look at it: Product sales are unlikely to be major growth drivers at this point since the businesses are already so large. The only new product that could theoretically start taking off is Apple Watch, but we know the smartwatch market is in the dumps and Apple still aggregates its wearable in the "Other Products" segment. It's unlikely that Apple Watch will suddenly become a $25 billion business within the next couple of years (the entire Other Products segment is under $11 billion). If total revenue remains relatively flat, but services can add another $25 billion in sales over the next few years, that would represent over 10% growth. I'll take that.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 7, 2017 at 11:00AM For a while there, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac business was really struggling. Not only was it a victim of a generally weak personal-computer market, but a stale product line in the face of aggressive moves from competing computer vendors also led the company to underperform the broader market. Apple MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple. That, by the way, is a nice way of saying the company lost market share. Last October, though, Apple finally launched new MacBook Pro machines. It updated both its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro lines, and because of all the new features it packed into these updated systems, the company charged higher prices for them than it did for the prior-generation models. Now that Apple's first-quarter financial results are out -- the first quarter in which the company would recognize revenue for the new systems -- investors can get an idea of how well customers have received the new systems. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, things are looking good. Putting Mac back on a growth path Apple reported shipping 5.37 million Macs in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2017, netting $7.24 billion in revenue from those sales. Mac unit shipments were up from the 5.31 million Apple shipped in the prior-year period, amounting to 1.1% growth. That's not a huge amount of growth, but considering the 10% unit decline that Apple's Mac business suffered last year, that's an improvement. Though unit growth was positive but anemic, the revenue growth story was completely different. Apple's Mac revenue in its most recent quarter was up 7% year over year, implying a solid increase in Mac average selling prices. "The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever," Apple CEO Tim Cook proclaimed on the company's first-quarter earnings call. It's still early in the current MacBook Pro product cycle, but it seems customers were willing to pay extra for the added features and technologies Apple added to its latest MacBook Pro machines. Apple knows what it must do I'd hazard a guess that it won't take any miracles or game-changing innovations to allow Apple's Mac product line to continue to at least perform in line with the personal-computer market. Apple simply needs to make sure it provides regular updates to its Mac products so the lineup doesn't get stale. These regular updates can be as simple as adopting the latest processors and adding other technological improvements, though obviously the bigger and more interesting the changes -- think the Touch Bar, the Force Touch trackpad, and so on -- the better. The Mac doesn't make up a huge portion of Apple's annual revenue. Mac sales made up less than 10% of Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue, though this percentage is bound to increase as Apple moves past the peak iPhone quarter. And when taken in conjunction with Apple's other non-iPhone products, it's still a reasonable contributor to revenue. Further, much has been said about the strength of Apple's ecosystem and the company's ability to build products that work well together. If the company can sell more Macs, then that might also translate into customers who will switch to -- or stick with -- Apple's iPhone. Apple should do its very best to make sure all of the elements of its ecosystem are strong, to maximize the potential value it can extract from said ecosystem.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Beats by Dr. Dre BeatsX are finally shipping this month Chris Davies - Feb 7, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The new Beats by Dr. Dre BeatsX headphones, delayed from last year, will finally be hitting store shelves this month it’s been confirmed today. Announced back in September 2016, the wireless headphones were meant to land in the fall, but were postponed for unexplained reasons. Now, Apple-owned Beats has confirmed exactly when we’ll be able to buy them, and the good news is that there’s not long to wait. In fact, the BeatsX should be on sale February 10. They’ll be priced at $149.95, and offer up to eight hours of use on a single charge. A five-minute recharge, Apple and Beats say, will be sufficient for a further two hours of use; Beats calls it Fast Fuel. What makes the BeatsX particularly special is what’s inside them, however. Just like Apple’s AirPods, the new Beats earbuds use Apple’s W1, the homegrown wireless chipset that promises – and, as we discovered, delivers – easier pairing, connection and re-connection, and management of Bluetooth headphones. They’ll also automatically connect across any device signed into the same Apple ID, such as your Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Unlike AirPods, of course, BeatsX still have a cable. That tethers the two earbuds together, and includes an in-line microphone block with a button to control playback together with answer and end calls, plus volume buttons. While that’s slightly less ergonomic than AirPods buttonless-design, it does mean you won’t have to rely on Siri all the time; however, you can still activate the virtual assistant from the physical controls. There are some neat design elements, too. The BeatsX earbuds themselves are magnetic, for instance, so they cling together as they hang around your neck when not in use. That should help with avoiding losing them. Unlike AirPods, there are multiple earbud tip designs for fitting differently-shaped ear canals. BeatsX will work with both iOS and Android devices, though of course you won’t get the same OS-level integration with the latter as you do on an iPhone. iOS users will be able to monitor battery levels from a pop-up on their device, as well as connect and disconnect more readily from the iOS control panel.

Scroll down for video  Apple might be ramping up production of the iPhone 8 earlier 'than historical norms', reveals a new report. It is believed that there will be a 300 percent increase in iPhone 8 (pictured is artist impression) builds in June, as the firm anticipates record-breaking smartphone sales The latest report comes from BlueFin Research via Barron's, which noted there is 'some indication' from the supply chain that Apple is gearing up for the high demand of the 'presumably' iPhone 8 earlier than expected. However, the consultanting firm also noted that just because Apple may start production a month early, it usually starts in July, does not mean iOS users will have the smartphone before than the traditional September launch.

Share this article Share 38 shares 'Builds have been pulled in a few months while aggregate next generation forecasts have increased 10% from last month to 122M,' BlueFin Research shared in the report. 'Interestingly, our present reads suggest a 300% increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9M,' IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound, OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area.' - A new 'pure white' model  - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition 'As a result, overall June quarter builds have increased from 45M to 48M, with the sharp increase in iPhone 8 offset somewhat by modest declines in legacy models.' 'Without citing specific sources, the authors say they're seeing indications of the iPhone 8 in the supply chain plans for June, earlier than usual'. If true, this move will give Apple more time to improve yield rates and smooth out any issues found during the manufacturing process - which was partially to blame for Samsung's Note 7 fiasco.  But most importantly, it will ensure more of its customer will be able to purchase the 10th anniversary handset. The report also notes that Apple has 'adjusted iPhone 7 (pictured), 7 Plus, and SE production downward in preparation for the next generation launch'.  It is believed the iPhone 8 will have a wraparound OLED screen, with the Touch ID finger print sensor under the glass Rumors surrounding the iPhone 8 began sweeping the web just a few months after Apple released the iPhone 7 line. And although the iPhone 7 sold out in a week, many saw it as nothing more than a refreshed iPhone 6 – which has put some pressure on Apple to impress its users. However, the rumors suggest that the Cupertino company is pulling out all the stops for the iPhone 8 family. It is believed that the handsets will have a wraparound OLED screen, with the Touch ID finger print sensor under the glass and in the active display area. And Apple could keep with its theme of cutting cables and designed the handsets with a mid-range wireless charging transmitter which could work over distances up to 15 feet (4.5 meters).

Justin Joffe for Observer Joe Steinhardt is not special, he tells me in The Knitting Factory’s green room on a cold February Friday. And the label he’s built up to shine a light on his hometown scene in New Brunswick, N.J., Don Giovanni Records is not special either. But to the 60-plus artists who’ve released records through Don Giovanni that span punk, hip-hop and comedy, this label is changing the game. Since founding Don Giovanni in 2003 with his best friend, Zach Gajewski, Steinhardt has transformed the label into a full-time commitment, all while managing to get his doctorate in Communication along the way. Of greatest interest to Steinhardt are the narratives surrounding the music he loves—what story is this artist telling, and what life circumstances inform their work? As such, Don Giovanni’s roster is refreshingly diverse, inclusive, and tough to codify, standing wholly outside the culture industry at large. Steinhardt first hit me up last fall and invited me to Don Giovanni’s New Alternative Music Festival in Asbury Park. Refreshingly devoid of sponsors, “branded experiences” and all the other dreck that music fans are used to dealing with at these things, the festival put DIY values into action. It even had a mission statement: There is an alternative to music released and distributed by three multi-national corporations. There is an alternative to music festivals as branded experience for millennial males. There is an alternative to music steeped in sexism, racism and homophobia. There is an alternative to corporately managed bands. There is an alternative to music as a commodity. There is an alternative to corporately run music festivals. Now we’re meeting at The Knit as bands file in for the second night of Don Giovanni’s latest showcase. During the prior night’s performances, it fast became clear that Steinhardt didn’t need to be there to tell anyone’s stories for them. Nerdcore rapper Sammus told the crowd about growing up upstate as one of the only black kids in her school, and some shitty classmate who didn’t even try to understand her feelings of otherness. In refreshingly transparent banter, Mal Blum told the crowd of their struggles with anxiety, exacerbated through relating to someone who tries to control you. “What’s the first thing that fascist regimes actually do? They start censoring culture.”—Joe Steinhardt Steinhardt and I discussed why you can’t dismantle a system from the inside, why being truly independent means more than being on a smaller imprint of a major label, and why putting Don Giovanni’s artists onstage is a form of resistance no charitable donation can match. We talked about the week’s announcement that one of Don Giovanni’s biggest acts, Downtown Boys, had signed with indie giant Sub Pop Records. And we arrived at the conclusion that artists need to own their own stories again, their own work, their own art. “When some future human or alien race digs this up, what are they really gonna find?” Steinhardt asked. “Our art, our culture. They’re not gonna find out how much money Goldman Sachs made in a year, they’re not gonna care about anything besides what we create.” Joe Steinhardt: I appreciate you doing [this]. I think they all can’t make enough money. Publications are closing, getting bought. The best music writers I know are writing about food, or something where there’s more jobs. There’s a lot more collusion in music journalism, and arts journalism in general, because it’s entertainment—more branded content, more photo ops. I’m sure this is something you’ve at least brushed up against. Oh yeah. Do you consider yourself a curator of your hometown scene? No, I think of myself more as a documentarian than a curator, if that makes sense? A curator has taste, and is selecting things that fit that taste. I’m more shining a flashlight, or a spotlight and a camera, documenting what’s happening in a scene rather than trying to form a scene. So I think he’s doing a great job trying to form a scene, if that’s his goal. My goal is to let things happen and think of it more as documenting. I hate the word “curate.” It’s so bougie. It’s not the bouginess of it. Someone was telling me they were curating a festival, and to me, here’s the problem with curation—it’s the antithesis of what punk and DIY is about, which is that anyone can do it, that anyone can do anything. So anyone can do what I do, anyone can grab a camera and take a picture, anyone can write an article. And curation implies that there’s some expertise that you have over other people. I remember when that word first came about, maybe six or seven years ago— —Outside of galleries you mean? Outside of art galleries, “this show was curated by” takes away the fact that a show can be booked by anyone. Now you need a curator. “Anyone can do anything, and not just that, everyone can do everything. No one’s fucking special.” My trouble with the word notwithstanding, I’m starting to put together shows, just as a fan, and I’m trying a way to codify what I’m doing. You book shows! [Laughs] I book shows, I booked the show tonight. I don’t think I really curated it; the show curated itself. You know what I’m saying? Anyone can make a fanzine, anyone…the point about what what I do is that anyone can do what I do, there’s nothing special about me or Don Giovanni, it’s just that I’m doing it tonight and you’ll be doing it tomorrow. That’s just where I came out of in New Jersey, at some point that vanished from punk and I think that’s a really important notion. Anyone can do anything, and not just that, everyone can do everything. No one’s fucking special. Well that’s a stigma about creative people—when people ask you what you do at a party, it’s never plural. And it’s hard for people to wrap their heads around someone who exists in multiple contexts. That’s the trouble with longform too. It’s hard to present complex connections to people. And that’s why I like longform. I think it’s your best shot at presenting something deeper than just “here’s what’s out there tonight.” And so I do everything, everyone I know does everything. You’re a doctor of communication? Yeah, the stuff I study is pretty esoteric. I look at risk and health communication. And that’s why you’ve said there’s no tangible through, that you separate the two worlds? Yeah, there’s not a good thread. Izzy True @ Don Giovanni’s showcase on 2/2/17. Justin Joffe for Observer Something that’s been coming up a lot in my conversations lately is this idea of accelerationism and hypernormalization, as they relate to media consumption and the 24-hour news cycle. Do you think there are conscious efforts afoot by capitalist, monied interests, be they conservative or liberal, to facilitate that? Yeah, because you’ve gotta make money for somebody else now. We’re seeing a tightening. The top’s always been tight—people were complaining in the ‘80s, the ‘70s that the media was too consolidated. But we’re seeing even more consolidation at the top, that’s maybe switched from media companies to tech companies. That’s the shift we’re seeing now, from the big three media companies to the big three tech companies that have even more dominance—Google, Apple. They’re compiling media now, too. AT&T bought Time Warner, right? Yep, and it’s all merging. As a result of the ownerships, the media is just slurry to them, and they’re just throwing it out there. They don’t care if I’m consuming a piece that you’ve spent a week researching and writing or if I’m consuming a photo of a topless celebrity on the beach. They don’t care because they own both that topless photo and you. And they own everything in the middle. I’m thinking about writing a book over the next few years, and that’s something I’m going to have to grapple with as a freelancer. If I want to pull from any of these great conversations I’ve had over the last few years— Who owns them? Not I! That’s the point, and that’s what you’re seeing. But that’s why independent labels are more important than ever, and that’s why independent values are worth fighting for. To be honest, I have a bleak view of the future for independent music. I’m not sure if it’ll be a thing in five, 10 years. Without the resources to do the ratfuckery that they do, sending out press materials and orchestrating campaigns, you have to step up your game in turn. It’s not even that. I can compete on a physical level. It’s the digital shit. And they’ve always controlled certain infrastructures—they control radio, they control end caps at big retail stores, they controlled pricing at Walmart when that was a real thing that mattered. An independent song’s never made it to top 40 radio. Maybe it’s on an independent label that’s then partnered with Sony to get it on radio and Sony gets a bit of that. That’s what distribution means, when we hear that a major label is helping distribute? Yeah, to radio or to stores. We have a distributor that’s independent of Sony, but Sony has an independent arm that’s Orwellian—an independent arm owned by a major label. They think that’s real. By their definition of independent music, artists like Taylor Swift are quite literally independent, because she sits on this label called Big Machine, which is all this work with major labels. “Who owns those models? Who owns these new ideas? I don’t want any multinational corporations controlling the entire culture industry.”  It’s a semantic co-opting of the word and the ideals and the ethics. And at the level of Taylor Swift it’s just good business. She gets a better deal with the Big Machine. So there’s reasons for it, but that idea of independent has nothing to do with Dischord or Lookout! or us. That’s why I rush to the word curator I guess. Because you’re someone who’s brought a lot of emerging bands to that next step, to that next audience waiting to hear them. And you’ve done so gratefully without any of the classic drama we’d see on VH1 of the old manager suing for royalties or any of that shit. I think there’s a selflessness involved here that operates wholly outside of that infrastructure, and then the challenge just becomes, how do you not stay cynical. You don’t stay cynical because there’s still a real fight to be had. And we’ll lose that fight—independent film kind of had that fight in the ‘80s and lost. There’s really no such thing as independent film anymore. They tried to have films distributed outside of the major motion picture companies and they lost that fight. Music’s kind of wrestling with that right now. [But] there’s still a chance, and that’s why I’m not cynical. Well we’re seeing these new models for distribution emerge now I guess. Yeah, but who owns those models? Who owns these new ideas? All you’re really doing is shifting sometimes from Sony to Apple. There’s no difference to me between Sony and Apple. Major labels’ powers are minimized, but now we’ve maximized Apple and Google and Amazon’s powers. I don’t want any multinational corporations controlling the entire culture industry. We’ve seen some of these new models just shift the power from music companies to tech companies. [Laughs] They haven’t figured out how to solve some of the things that true independent or DIY infrastructures do really well. The grassroots label throwing a secret show, the reality of playing a last-minute secret show at a small venue when the band is in town. There are some things that you have to be present with people or just frequent a space or live in a neighborhood to get. Right, and on that level, that is why these “independent” labels that are basically majors have a role, because they can react to things faster, deal with less higher ups. And if I’m a pop artist, yeah, I don’t want to deal with those people either, I want a middleman. But I’m trying to fight all of that shit with what I’m doing. Let’s come back to this idea of you seeing yourself as a documentarian, because it’s a really interesting frame for looking at  the music you release. Had I never met you before, and only based my assumptions of the wizard behind the curtain on the bands that he books, I’d take you for some pockmarked California liberal waving a wooden picket signs. You know my point. You take a lot of risks, well not risks, because it’s all great music, but you go out of your way to include people who are perhaps aesthetically or culturally outside your own demographic and your own history. And that’s the benefits of an all-ages space, too, I guess. It’s for the queer kids, the kids who might not be old enough to get into a real venue where they can vanish into the dark and dance for a few hours. If I never got into this before I was 18, I never would’ve gotten into this. That’s an important point. You were at this event at Rutgers a while back and it made me wonder, what’s the pulse like between the label and the college community? They recently opened a music archive, archiving the New Brunswick scene, maybe that’s what you’re talking about? Yes. Marissa Paternoster of Screaming Females at 4 Knots Fest ’15. Justin Joffe for Observer Well it actually opened this year, but two years ago they were announcing that, and that’s when they had me and Marissa [from Screaming Females] and Jim and Ronin come and do a panel. Jim’s been doing this Jersey zine called Jersey Beat my whole life, maybe doing it for 30 years, and Ronin wrote a book about New Brunswick and was in a very political band I used to listen to a lot in high school. Jersey Beat broke shit like The Feelies and Yo La Tengo. Do the hallowed Jersey indie bands have any notable contemporaries from New Brunswick? Well the big New Brunswick band was The Smithereens, but I never really got into them. New Brunswick’s always kind of had its own thing. It’s definitely got a college-town feel, but you could be in the bigger city and not see any signs of college there. What passions inflamed during this talk? I heard Marissa said something about how Rutgers didn’t support art. Oh yeah, well that was the thing—we were at Rutgers doing this panel on the New Brunswick music scene, and Marissa and I wanted to make it clear that one of the biggest threats to the scene was Rutgers. We brought that up on the panel. Just as an expansive business and landmass, eating resources and properties? Yeah, but to a bigger extent there’s an arts community in New Brunswick that the school could be fostering or putting money into. Who has the most space in New Brunswick for legal performances? Rutgers has a million fucking rooms. And they’re not taking advantage of them. Not only not taking advantage of them, going out of their way to not let that kind of stuff happen. So that’s what we brought up. There are all these spaces that we could be booking shows in. Maybe you just need a student committee to advocate for it. No, we’ve had that happen. That’s the thing—the school could have this and make this a thing that keeps happening, but they make it very difficult to book anyone. “So when a band leaves, on the outside it looks like a success, but on the inside, I ask myself, where’s the failure? It’s good for business, but I’m not talking about business. I want to know, what happened?” Politics? Probably. That’s one of the reasons I’ve been getting more involved with the city there. We’ve been doing these outdoor shows working with the city, trying to win some minor little influence with the city and say “you should put more resources into this.” They’ll give us a bit of money, but it’s not real money, and we’re seeing how that goes. We’re trying to build a better relationship with the city to show that the arts community is really important there, and maybe they’ll nurture it. We do a free show every summer, [Chris] Gethard hosts it, Screaming Females plays, Downtown Boys, and it’s big—we get hundreds of people there. Congratulations to Downtown Boys, by the way. They had a big week. Yup…I wish they were still doing it with us, but you can’t fault them there or anything. You’re like a mother whose kids are constantly going off to college. Are you wistful about it? It’s not so much wistful, and it’s not a success or a failure. It’s more that I have to look at it like, “Am I not able to provide enough without the label infrastructure of Sub Pop, and if not, why can’t I provide that?” So you have to look at that critically every time [this] happens, and figure it out. As a label you make more money passing off your bands, because now somebody else is spending the money to promote them instead of me. But that’s never been the goal of the label. The goal has always been to keep the bands here. So when a band leaves, on the outside it looks like a success, but on the inside, I ask myself, where’s the failure? It’s good for business, but I’m not talking about business. I want to know, what happened? I forced myself to grow over the years to serve my bands, and I do a lot of things I really don’t wanna do. When it seems like they’re really violating my personal ethics and values about music I won’t do ‘em, but some things are things I’ll do that I just happen to think are stupid. Like we go to SXSW now and do a showcase there, and I think that’s fuckin’ stupid. But when we go there, it’s on our terms. There’s no sponsors, it’s all ages, etc. And I deal with Spotify now. They’re one of the most vile companies, but our bands want to be on there. I’ve offered, “Do you want to get off Spotify?” “No.” “Then I’ll schmooze with them and try to get you on these dumb fuckin’ playlists.” I’m here to serve the bands because if I don’t, then they have no choice but to leave for labels like Sub Pop. So I’m proud that at least with Downtown Boys, they had a choice—us or Sub Pop. It’s not like they had no choice. And I don’t think I failed with them. Because I can’t fault them for trying out something different, but I’m proud to be able to say, “You can do all this stuff with or without Sub Pop.” We’ve had bands play Coachella, we’ve had bands that were on MTV and license songs to video games and films. You can do that stuff with us, or you can do that stuff without us, but I don’t want bands to be able to say, “I can’t do that stuff on Don Giovanni Records.” Those are very tangible benchmarks of ascension, but I think on a very simple and basic human level, too, you’re there for them. What was that band last night after Big Eyes? Mal Blum and The Blums. You got the singer a beer! That’s what it comes down to. And this is obviously someone who’s very talented and can totally fucking rip, who’s very transparent about the shit they’re working on in their own life with that banter. Fostering a sense of community that intimate for someone with so much talent who’s finding out how to be themselves in a creative ecosystem is important. Well I was kind of drunk last night and saying, “this is important, this is power.” Why am I doing this when I don’t take money from this? I think culture is the most important thing, that’s why I studied communications. What’s the first thing that fascist regimes actually do? They start censoring culture. They don’t build prison camps first, they start censoring books. Why did they burn Helen Keller’s book in Nazi Germany? Because if you see that someone like that can write a work that beautiful, all of a sudden you can’t put them in a camp. Mal Blum & the Blums shreds @ Don Giovanni’s showcase on 2/2/17. Justin Joffe for Observer Why is Trump fighting with SNL? Because culture’s important, arts are important. That’s why Rex Tillerson got on Twitter a week or two ago and said that he actually supports the National Endowment of the Arts. We’re America’s greatest export. Oh yeah, and that’s why this stuff is so important. You’re giving this person a platform to say this kind of stuff, that’s a big deal. People usually don’t get platforms to say this kind of stuff. They’re usually sitting in the audience or at home. And that’s also why this control of keeping it outside the establishment is important. How can we let our artists have this voice without having them join Sony? Or be someone like Beyoncé, who is protesting through the establishment? The establishment’s controlling that, they’re getting all the money from it. With every dollar she spends protesting, they might get three dollars against it. That’s what the trippy BBC doc Hypernormalisation suggests. That even these channels of art and culture we think we’re absorbing from a countercultural lens or a subversive means have this monied interest driving them and putting the work out there, that the things we think are feeding our own heads are really part of someone else’s narrative. And you can make your own narrative when you completely withdraw from it, can’t you? We’ve seen how narrative has been hijacked over the last several months. And that’s what I was getting into at school, I studied the importance of narratives. I think about narratives a lot, how we tell stories and how that influences reality and politics. That’s why it’s important to keep cultural narratives in the hands of the purveyors, not the corporations. A lot of really important art comes out of major corporations, but what have they done with that power? They’ve worked to destroy artists. I imagine you don’t care much for the word “content” either. I never thought about it, but I don’t write. You know what I mean, though. That’s what happens when you take the story away from the storyteller and turn it into something ubiquitous. I really enjoy having these conversations. I do too, and that’s what I’m saying—that’s why I go out of my way, much to my own detriment, to not take money from the label to really separate finance and the label. The label has a lot of money, but by being able to put it back into the label and have it so I could just spend it all on records I’m never gonna sell again if I want to, I knew that freedom to truly be able to separate the cultural interests from the financial interests. And that’s the thing that people usually find totally insane, but people have been telling me I’m insane about this for 15 years. So maybe I’m insane, but it’s working. “Operating outside the mainstream though, right now and always—under Obama, under Bush, under Clinton—that’s the most important act of resistance for a business in a capitalist system. Putting the artists that we do onstage instead of ones that might sell more and represent less is resistance.” Well when everything is inherently political these days, when things are politically stigmatized that weren’t six months ago, you could argue that blending the culture and the finances is the best weapon against that. It’s so cliche, but I think money is the root of all evil. I’m thinking about The SCUM Manifesto, when Valerie Solanas was talking about destroying all the banks and destroying money. She goes into destroying men, too, and I’m O.K. with that in the context of her thing. But a lot of it’s about destroying money, and I’m older now [to] where I believe in that in a more mature way than I used to. Like throwing shit through windows. This is the thing—I still think it’s worth throwing shit through windows. The Black Bloc, dude, they punched Richard Spencer in the face. But there’s also something to be said for working inside an infrastructure that you don’t respect to slowly dismantle it from within, or reform it. It’s funny, I had this discussion with a friend of mine who works at Sony just two days ago, she was there last night and she’s probably gonna come tonight. I was actually arguing the opposite—I don’t know if you’re ever gonna dismantle stuff from within. I don’t know if it’s ever happened before. Everyone’s got this plan, “I’m gonna get into mainstream politics, run for Senate, change everything. I’m gonna become a lawyer and restructure it.” No, no. If you wanna destroy law, you have to operate outside the law, make it work, and then show a new model that works outside the law. That’s what Kafka said. And Bob Dylan. Well Bob Dylan’s a genius, but he definitely operates inside the system. Although they did find him walking around on his own looking at random houses. I remember that, that made me really happy when that happened. That was in Jersey, too, wasn’t it? I think I really get him. Big Eyes @ Don Giovanni’s showcase on 2/2/17. Justin Joffe Are there any conscious attempts to use your adjunct infrastructure and grassroots channels to feed the resistance around the current administration’s policies and practices? Oh yeah. The resistance is primarily through perseverance and continuing to do what we’re doing though. Of course at some base level we’ll be doing some fundraising, but I think that’s the smallest thing. What’s the least you can do? The least you can do is give money to important causes. Operating outside the mainstream though, right now and always—under Obama, under Bush, under Clinton—that’s the most important act of resistance for a business in a capitalist system. Putting the artists that we do onstage instead of ones that might sell more and represent less is resistance. [We talk for a bit about the editing process, and Joe explains how his academic life has trained him to be great at turning things around quickly and his writer brain scrutinizes his own words to tell him how something he said could be explained better.] So in many ways, with regard to the self-discipline of routine and mitigating schedules, the academic tract has really served your label operations. They’re also similar in this broad sense. It fits my personality in that being a research professor, I can produce whatever I want to produce as long as it’s enough to keep afloat in this weird way. I get to pick my own research problems and find out how to pay for them, just like with the label. If only we could get grants for musicians. I don’t even think we’ll be able to get any grants for science foundation research in the future. I remember when that second Think About Life record came out with a little scrawl on the back saying “This record was created with the assistance of the Canadian government” or something similar. Yeah, Canada does a lot of that, which is great. The government should be supporting the arts 100 percent. It doesn’t necessarily mean it should be supporting our arts, but the government should be supporting all artists’ lifestyles. Education, healthcare…there are things the government can do to make it so you have artists, because you need artists. That’s all it is man. When some future human or alien race digs this up, what are they really gonna find? Our art, our culture. They’re not gonna find out how much money Goldman Sachs made in a year, they’re not gonna care about anything besides what we create. What do the next six months look like for you? First we do the La Neve tape, Joey from Downtown Boys, so we still work together on stuff. That’s 2/24. 3/24 is Kissing Is a Crime’s debut album. 4/4 is Aye Nako’s new album. And this could change because of art issues, but it’s supposed to be 6/1 and it might be 6/15 or later, Lee Bains’ new record. How do you keep yourself open to new sounds outside of your comfort zone? I’ve never thought about it. You like who you like. Yeah, and that’s what I’m saying about narratives in culture—I’m really drawn to that stuff. If you look at the records at my house, you might not be able to tell what I like to listen to until I talk to you about them. Some of its free jazz and improvisation, I have a lot of that stuff. I have a lot of outsider private press stuff, a lot of mainstream music too, and punk, indie, whatever—but there are threads that go through all of it related to the people making it, the time and place. Outsiders are always big to me—does it come from inside a system or outside of a system? So you’re really interested in all the context that informs the work. You like to look at through different lenses. Yeah, narrative’s what it is. Why is that Shaggs record so good? The story around it. And why do some people say it’s so bad? Yeah. I listen to a lot of early blues, folk, and jazz, when people were making their own instruments and making up their own rules. I listen to a lot of field recordings, just people trying to express themselves literally however they could. But I also listen to a lot of polished stuff too. Singer-songwriter type stuff. Like Iris DeMent, one of my favorite singer-songwriters. But she still operates pretty outside of the system at this point. She runs her own record label and puts out music on a timescale that has to do with culture, not marketing. Bill Fay always struck me as someone like that, he’s on his own trip. Bill Fay’s great, yeah. So stuff like that. Gillian Welch is amazing—her and Dave Rawlings control, release and master all their own shit. And so there are these sort of narratives that draw me to music more than sound I guess. Is this the future of how we reclaim our own work? If there’s this consistent pattern across the media industry of the creative class being at the bottom this totem pole, the expandable bottom, is this what we’re gonna have to do to curb that? Only if there’s not people fighting to operate outside that system. People need options. And whether it’s someone like Gillian Welch, the type of stuff we do, or your local hardcore scene, there need to be people fighting for who owns the culture and not just what it sounds like. Who controls the narratives. Who profits. To me that’s what matters, that’s what’s important. I don’t think there’s such a thing as a record that sounds better than another, objectively or scientifically. Why do you really like the records you like? Either it’s been marketed to you with a narrative, or you made up your own.

Google’s Android team had been hard at work building a boring BlackBerry clone, but Google did something that other platform makers failed at miserably. Google took one look at the iPhone Apple unveiled in early 2007 and it instantly knew it was cloning the wrong mobile experience. Meanwhile, big cell phone companies like Nokia, BlackBerry and Microsoft kept chugging along without adapting at all. Google’s reworked Android platform would launch commercially in late 2008 on the HTC Dream/G1, and it wisely resembled Apple’s iPhone far more than it resembled a BlackBerry phone. In the years that followed, Apple and Google would go on to overtake the global cell phone market as other platforms floundered and failed. It’s clear that iOS and Android took inspiration from each other every step of the way, but in this post we’ll look at five ways in particular that Android took Apple’s ideas from the iPhone and made them even better in Android. Don't Miss: The one way Android will never, ever be able to compete with the iPhone High-resolution displays Just like the touchscreen itself, high-resolution displays have become ubiquitous and as a result, it can be difficult to remember a time before smartphone displays became as sophisticated as they are right now. But it all began in 2010, when Apple started a pixel war with the Retina display on the iPhone 4. Today, nearly seven years later, Apple smartphones have the lowest resolution among all flagship devices. Now, it’s important to note that while Apple had been lagging far behind market leaders like Samsung for years when it comes to display quality, the screens on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have narrowed the gap substantially. Although resolution hasn’t improved on either device, other improvements and support for a wider color gamut have brought Apple’s iPhones closer in display quality to AMOLED panels from the likes of Samsung. App Store No, Android doesn’t have better apps than iOS. In fact, the gap in user experience and overall app quality between the two platforms is just as wide now as it has been for years. While Android affords developers far more flexibility, iOS apps are alway smoother and they offer a much more consistent experience. Where app stores are concerned, iOS and Android each have their pros and cons where app distribution is concerned — the Play Store is cluttered and confusing at times, while search is still awful in the iOS App Store — but there’s one area where Android just leapt ahead of Apple by a huge margin: Instant Apps. The new Instant Apps feature google unveiled last year during its annual I/O developer conference is a stroke of genius. In a nutshell, it allows developers to turn a portion of their apps into web apps that can be accessed instantly without any need to purchase or even download an application. So for example, a person can begin using a portion of a paid app instantly without making any purchase. Then, a purchase can be made if the person wants to keep using the app beyond a certain point. Quick Settings Android has always had some settings available in the pull-down “shade” menu, but it wasn’t until Apple’s Control Panel came around that Google stepped things up and created the versatile quick settings panel users enjoy today. Different vendors have made a wide range of tweaks to the Quick Settings menu in their various Android builds, but the endgame is the same: Users have easy access to a customizable menu that allows them to tweak more than a dozen settings from any screen. One of the most frustrating things about the Control Panel in iOS is that it is not customizable. So, if there are settings you access constantly that aren’t included in the Control Panel, you’re just out of luck. Android, meanwhile, has a much wider range of settings that are accessible on the Quick Settings menu. What’s more, the menu is customizable so you can remove settings you don’t often use, add settings you want to be able to configure, and rearrange items in any order of your choosing. Keyboards Apple’s virtual keyboard on the iPhone was a complete game changer, but there’s little question that Apple has been lapped at this point. First and foremost, third-party keyboard support in iOS is still horrendous. Apple’s keyboard offers a terrific typing experience thanks to a great design and class-leading touch response on iPhones and iPads, but people often want more than that. For example, swipe-style typing is hugely popular and Apple’s keyboard doesn’t support it. There are also third-party keyboard with better emoji functionality and dozens of other features that are nowhere to be found on the built-in iOS keyboard. But third-party options are severely constrained, keyboard support is buggy at best. Android, meanwhile, has a terrific built-in keyboard but it also gives third-party developers the freedom to access all of the OS features and functions they want. The result is a keyboard experience that feels and functions like a fully integrated OEM keyboard. Software Updates Software updates? Really?! Apple still gets updates out faster since it releases updates directly to end users rather than to vendor partners, but Android Nougat’s new update mechanism is brilliant. Instead of having to stop everything you’re doing to update your smartphone running Android 7.0 or later, software updates are downloaded in the background over Wi-Fi while you use the phone. Once the download is complete, everything still happens in the background because the new Android build installs to a special separate partition. Then, the next time the phone is rebooted, the new software version boots and the update it done — that’s it.

Image: christina ascani/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-02-07 16:46:19 UTC Relax, Apple's not dumping the Lightning plug for its iOS devices (yet). A report from 9to5Mac stoked fears that Apple might once again switch to a new smaller, 8-pin "Ultra Accessory Port" (UAC) for iPhones and iPads after the company gave a preview of the new plug to accessory manufacturers. SEE ALSO: Why your iPhone battery meter sometimes goes haywire The plug, which has been confirmed by The Verge to be the same 8-pin port used in Nikon cameras, is non-symmetrical and will be a part of Apple's "Made For iPhone" (MFi) program. But make no mistake: The UAC is not a port/plug Apple will force on users or accessory makers. Apple only added the 8-pin connector to the MFi program at the request accessory makers, ArsTechnica reports. Do not — I repeat — do not throw your Lightning cables away in a fit of rage. So what's all the fuss about this new port, which isn't, in fact, even new? It has to do with wired headphones. If you look at the smartphone landscape right now, you'll see it's an ugly mess for music listeners. Here are your wired headphone options: Lightning (iPhone 7/7 Plus (and presumably all future iOS devices) USB-C (Moto Z, HTC U Ultra, and many new Android phones) 3.5mm (Pretty much every phone) The problem is your wired Lightning headphones won't work with USB-C phones (and vice versa) and headphones with the trusty ol' 3.5mm jack won't work with either. Sure, you could get a dongle, like the one Apple includes with the iPhone 7, to convert headphones with a 3.5mm jack to Lightning, but that still doesn't solve the problem of all the different aforementioned conversions, of which there aren't any dongles for.  With UAC, headphone makers would get a solution that (sort of) fixes the problem. Instead of making headphones specifically for each type of port, companies would be able to make headphones with a female UAC port on the earcup. With UAC, a company like Bose or Beats can sell the same wired headphone model to all customers, simply subbing out the cable to make it compatible with a specific kind of device. It'll be up to individual manufacturers which cable to offer — a male UAC-to-Lightning, UAC-to-USB-C, or UAC-to-3.5mm headphone jack — or simply offer all three, so users can switch devices easily. That would be especially useful to users who often switch between a phone and laptop or PC, which still tend to offer 3.5mm jack connectors for audio. But what about earbuds? UAC probably won't work so well for those, due to obvious size constraints, though earbuds also tend to be cheaper and used mostly with one device. For those reasons, manufacturers will likely continue to offer earbuds that work with only one type of connector.  Of course, you could bypass all of this wired cables/port nonsense with wireless headphones — but don't tell that to audiophiles or they'll have a field day explaining to you the advantages of wired over wireless.

In October, Caldwell Cassady & Curry won again before a separate Eastern District jury, which issued a $302 million verdict in favor of VirnetX after finding that Apple infringed patented technology covering secure mobile communications. The verdict ranked as the third-largest in Texas and the nation’s seventh-largest last year. Less than three weeks before winning the second VirnetX trial, Caldwell Cassady & Curry also won a $22 million verdict for Cellular Communications Equipment, LLC, in another Eastern District trial against Apple for infringing a network technology patent. Caldwell Cassady & Curry also helped an individual inventor resolve a long-running dispute with a group of business partners who had wrongly shut him out of a multibillion-dollar company he helped create. After the firm won a key summary judgment ruling in favor of the inventor and secured a trial setting, the parties reached a significant confidential agreement that resolved the litigation. The firm recently was named to the national 2017 Best Law Firms list published by The Best Lawyers in America and U.S. News & World Report. Name principals Brad Caldwell, Jason Cassady and Austin Curry are consistently recognized among the country’s top courtroom lawyers, including rankings the annual Texas Super Lawyers and Texas Rising Stars lists.

Where app stores are concerned, iOS and Android each have their pros and cons where app distribution is concerned — the Play Store is cluttered and confusing at times, while search is still awful in the iOS App Store — but there’s one area where Android just leapt ahead of Apple by a huge margin: Instant Apps. The new Instant Apps feature google unveiled last year during its annual I/O developer conference is a stroke of genius. In a nutshell, it allows developers to turn a portion of their apps into web apps that can be accessed instantly without any need to purchase or even download an application. So for example, a person can begin using a portion of a paid app instantly without making any purchase. Then, a purchase can be made if the person wants to keep using the app beyond a certain point. Quick Settings Android has always had some settings available in the pull-down “shade” menu, but it wasn’t until Apple’s Control Panel came around that Google stepped things up and created the versatile quick settings panel users enjoy today. Different vendors have made a wide range of tweaks to the Quick Settings menu in their various Android builds, but the endgame is the same: Users have easy access to a customizable menu that allows them to tweak more than a dozen settings from any screen. One of the most frustrating things about the Control Panel in iOS is that it is not customizable. So, if there are settings you access constantly that aren’t included in the Control Panel, you’re just out of luck. Android, meanwhile, has a much wider range of settings that are accessible on the Quick Settings menu. What’s more, the menu is customizable so you can remove settings you don’t often use, add settings you want to be able to configure, and rearrange items in any order of your choosing. Read More Keyboards Apple’s virtual keyboard on the iPhone was a complete game changer, but there’s little question that Apple has been lapped at this point. First and foremost, third-party keyboard support in iOS is still horrendous. Apple’s keyboard offers a terrific typing experience thanks to a great design and class-leading touch response on iPhones and iPads, but people often want more than that. For example, swipe-style typing is hugely popular and Apple’s keyboard doesn’t support it. There are also third-party keyboard with better emoji functionality and dozens of other features that are nowhere to be found on the built-in iOS keyboard. But third-party options are severely constrained, keyboard support is buggy at best. Android, meanwhile, has a terrific built-in keyboard but it also gives third-party developers the freedom to access all of the OS features and functions they want. The result is a keyboard experience that feels and functions like a fully integrated OEM keyboard. Software Updates Software updates? Really?! Apple still gets updates out faster since it releases updates directly to end users rather than to vendor partners, but Android Nougat’s new update mechanism is brilliant. Instead of having to stop everything you’re doing to update your smartphone running Android 7.0 or later, software updates are downloaded in the background over Wi-Fi while you use the phone. Once the download is complete, everything still happens in the background because the new Android build installs to a special separate partition. Then, the next time the phone is rebooted, the new software version boots and the update it done — that’s it.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple’s Beats X wireless earbuds will launch later this week Chris Mills BGR NewsFebruary 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple’s been having a bad time with its world-changing headphones lately. When the iPhone 7 was announced without a headphone jack, Apple tried to ease everyone’s concerns by announcing a full lineup of wireless headphones. Unfortunately, problems with the technology caused the flagship Airpods to be delayed by months, and the cheaper Beats X did even worse. But according to Apple, the wait is over, and the Beats X will be globally available starting this Friday, February 10th. Don't Miss: Report claims Apple’s next revolutionary product might be released later this year The headphones cost $149.95, and come in white, black, grey and blue. The Beats X are likely to be a popular middle ground between cumbersome over-ear wireless headphones, and the Airpods that are just a little too easy to lose. The Beats X share significant technology with the Airpods, including Apple’s proprietary W1 wireless chip that enables easy pairing to iOS or Mac devices. They are also compatible (but less fun to use) with Android devices. Other than the Apple chip, the Beats X look similar to other wireless earbuds already on the market. There’s a cable linking both buds, with an in-line remote and battery that should give around 8 hours of runtime. Charging is provided via a Lightning cable rather than the more usual micro-USB, which will probably be the death knell for any Android users who were thinking about picking up a pair.

Initially projected to be finished by 2015, the new Apple headquarters has seen its completion date slowly get pushed further back. One of the reasons is Apple's crazy attention to detail. Sources say Apple is treating the campus project like the design of one of its products with numerous guidelines and requirements that construction workers aren't accustomed to. For example, no vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. There are 30 pages of guidelines for special wood used throughout the building. Often tolerances demanded were far less than 1/8 of an inch, even on hidden surfaces, which sometimes conflicted with construction realities. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone’s audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. One frustrating feature for construction workers was the doorways. Apple wanted them perfectly flat with no threshold. The logic was that if engineers had to adjust their gait while entering the building, they risked distraction from their work. “We spent months trying not to do that because that’s time, money and stuff that’s never been done before,” a former construction manager said. Apple is expected to complete their new campus this spring. Check out the construction progress in the video below!

The scandal has shaped around David not receiving a knighthood  While she is famous for her steely pout, Victoria has naturally remained straight-faced and stony since the scandal has surfaced.   David made his first public appearance since the scandal on Monday, when he appeared in casual sports garb while heading out for a juice yet kept a low profile. While mum and dad have been flitting around the big cities, their eldest son Brooklyn, 17, took an edgy snap posted to Instagram on Tuesday, as he posed in front of street art while wearing mismatched trainers.  Victoria's appearance comes days after she was being rushed through London's Heathrow airport on Saturday following reports that David was a victim of a £1million blackmail plot over hacked emails. It comes as MPs hit out against a potential 'bend it for Beckham' rule for the rich and famous amid claims the former footballer was advised on how to fit the Knighthood criteria.

The fashion trailblazer sported a tight thumb ring Walking strong: The famed designer was on her way out as she got to work in the Big Apple  Hitting back: It comes as MPs hit out against a potential 'bend it for Beckham' rule for the rich and famous amid claims the former footballer was advised by Whitehall on how to fit the Knighthood criteria The politicians said today that celebrities should be treated no differently to ordinary members of the public when it comes to taxes and the honours systems. The comments come amid reports that Beckham was on the verge of becoming Sir David in 2014 until a last-minute 'red flag' intervention from HMRC due to his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme. Insiders confirmed there was effectively then horse-trading between a Whitehall committee and the superstar's advisers to 'sort out' the issues raised by HMRC. Rosena Allin-Khan, Labour’s shadow culture minister, said it was 'incredibly wrong' while Lib Dem MP John Pugh, a member of the influential Public Accounts Committee, said the same rules should apply for everyone. Wowzers trousers: Victoria kept her look muted and chic  Rushed on: Her appearance comes two days after she was being rushed through London's Heathrow airport on Saturday following reports that her husband David was a victim of a £1million blackmail plot over hacked emails Beckham and his PR machine have been left reeling after Friday's release of 18.6million emails and documents hacked by the Football Leaks website from the servers of Doyen Global, the firm run by the ex-footballer's PR chief Simon Oliveira. According to the revelations, the Honours Committee had already agreed that Beckham's nomination – almost certainly proposed by his PR advisers – was well 'merited' before a routine check of his tax affairs. The leaked emails also include a number of bombshells and series of sweary-rants and may even have been used as part of a £1million blackmail plot. Straight faced: Victoria looked downcast and serious  Serious stuff: The comments come amid reports that Beckham was on the verge of becoming Sir David in 2014 until a last-minute 'red flag' intervention from HMRC due to his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme In one message the ex-England captain allegedly claims singer Katherine Jenkins, 36, got an OBE for ‘singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F*****g joke’. She was given an OBE in the 2014 New Year Honours for her services to music and charity. Her manager, Professor Jonathan Shalit, told Dan Wootton at The Sun that she deserved her award for her charity work and music career. Serious stuff: Victoria looked sombre as she walked the NYC streets Waiting car: The star was treated by a chivalrous gentleman who opened her car door   A spokesman for Beckham said: 'This story is based on outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third party server and gives a deliberately inaccurate picture.' He allegedly wrote the private message after he missed out on a knighthood, while other emails are said to show him call the honours committee 'unappreciative c****. But it now seems the former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder could have been a victim of a targeted blackmail plot. Glamorous as ever: Beckham and his PR machine have been left reeling after Friday's release of 18.6million emails and documents hacked by the Football Leaks website from the servers of Doyen Global, the firm run by the ex-footballer's PR chief Simon Oliveira Remaining stoic: Victoria has remained quiet since the scandal  The emails were passed to the Football Leaks website after the firm run by his advisers refused to pay the hackers, reports Tom Bryant at the Daily Mirror.  A source told the newspaper that Beckham - who earned 115 caps playing for England - was simply 'caught in the crossfire'. The messages were reportedly accessed after criminals - thought to be using Russian servers - hacked documents from the sports agency run by Mr Oliveria. They demanded one million euros - almost £900,000 - or they would pass on the material they had acquired, according to the Mirror.  On her way out: While she is famous for her steely pout, Victoria has naturally remained straight-faced and stony since the scandal has surfaced Share or comment on this article e-mail 234 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

Some 22% of retailers are planning to accept Apple Pay in the next 12 months and 11% plan to do so within the next one to three years, while 31% are adopting a “wait and see” approach. PayPal falls in second place with a 34% acceptance rate, followed by Mastercard PayPass (25%), Android Pay (24%), Visa Checkout (20%), Samsung Pay (18%), Chase Pay (11%) and private label mobile wallets with 4%, the 18th annual edition of the POS/Customer Engagement Survey shows. 18% of more than 500 top North American retailers surveyed are planning to accept Android Pay within the next 12 months, with 13% planning to accept it within the next one to three years, while 11% are planning to accept Samsung Pay in the next 12 months, with 7% planning to accept it within the next one to three years. Only 11% of the retailers have “no plans to implement” mobile payment acceptance within the store environment, while 24% of overall respondents have already done so and say the system is “working well.” 9% are offering mobile coupons, specials and promotions, while 7% are offering mobile loyalty programs. Changing arena “There are a multitude of mobile wallets and payment apps on the market today, and the arena keeps changing,” says BRP. “In the past year, we have seen the demise of the merchant-backed CurrentC and rise of Walmart Pay. “PayPal has been bumped out of its top spot in this year’s survey, with Apple Pay now being accepted at 36% of the retailers participating in the survey. This is up significantly from 16% last year, and signals a growing acceptance by retailers and customers.” “This year, fewer retailers are adopting a wait and see approach for Apple Pay and PayPal — likely because of the growing support from the payment software ecosystem and the acceptance for these mobile payments by the public.” “One of the critical factors for any mobile payment success going forward is education. We have found repeatedly that not only are consumers unsure of how and when mobile payments can be used but, even more telling, associates are unsure,” BRP adds. “For mobile payments or mobile wallets to succeed, there must be further education at the point of sale to ensure that a transaction using a mobile device is not longer or more complicated than traditional payments methods for either the customer or associate.” LEARN MORE — Topics: Android Pay, Apple Pay, Chase Pay, Coupons, CurrentC, Loyalty, Mobile payments, Mobile wallet, Offers, PayPass, POS, POS/Customer Engagement Survey, Promotions, Research, Retail, Samsung Pay, Visa Checkout, Walmart Pay Trials and live services: USA tweet  111  share  134  share  74  share  7  print  Featured partner: Get NFC World's email newsletter The top industry headlines by email, every Wednesday.

First off, SamsungPay supports ‘magstripe emulation’ mode which doesn’t require permissions from the bank and works with any magstripe terminal which is.. all of them. So it has a 100% share of terminals. Also, since Android Pay uses the same protocols as Apple (what – you thought Apple invented a protocol and the entire banking industry just jumped on the bandwagon?) any terminal that can take Apple Pay should be able to take Android Pay as well. The actual difference isn’t the terminals, it’s the number of banks supporting it, and the availability of NFC to make it work. A LOT of Android phones don’t include NFC. Interestingly, the new generation of Android Wear watches are starting to include it. Willam Hugh Murray, CISSP I agree. Most merchants are hardly aware of Samsung Pay. It just works. That it just works probably hides some acceptance and use of mobile. On the other hand, while Samsung works on most POS devices, it is not on as many phones as Apple Pay. melci >”A LOT of Android phones don’t include NFC” And even less support ‘magstripe emulation’. The problem for Samsung Pay is that premium S6 and S7 phones with the mag stripe transmitter only make up a small percentage of their phone sales, so perhaps that is why the article appears to concentrate on NFC solutions. I have a feeling this article is more about which retailers specifically say (or know) what they support. Apple Pay for example works wherever there is an NFC reader (which here in Australia is virtually everywhere), so the percentage of supporting retailers is probably higher for Apple Pay as well. Remember when CVS had to shut down their NFC readers completely when they wanted to block Apple Pay in order to push their awful CurrentC competitor on their customers? 🙂 Clinton Gallagher It is incorrect to claim there are A LOT of Android phones that do not suppoprt NFC. Some yes but the number is more like A FEW. Check the list Willam Hugh Murray, CISSP Double in one year!? Where are all those critics that said mobile, and Apple Pay in particular, could not possibly succeed? Clinton Gallagher BLE for payments is now emerging. Apple Pay that requires NFC can become passé. Tim Cook won’t dare cripple the iPhone to disallow BLE the way he has crippled NFC to disallow the iPhone to function with NFC tags. More headlines...

With tvOS 10.0.1, first released back in October as a minor bug fix and security improvement, Apple quietly included support for a handful of new features to improve accessories. The features, which include App Launch, new accessibility features and more, aren’t documented publicly, but specs were recently made available to accessory makers in Apple’s Made-for-iPhone/iPad/Apple TV licensing program. Many of the new features for Apple TV accessories bring tvOS in line with previous versions of iOS so the Apple TV can behave more like iPhones and iPads. tvOS 10.0.1 introduced support for App Launch, the ability for accessories to prompt users to launch or install companion apps just like on iOS. For example, MFi gaming controllers usually have companion apps that catalog compatible software and handle upgrading controller firmware. When initially pairing an MFi gaming controller to Apple TV, tvOS could prompt the user to launch or install the companion app automatically. Apps or games that work with dedicated hardware could also benefit from App Launch without the user having to manually find the correct companion app. Wi-Fi Accessory Configuration is also supported as of tvOS 10.0.1. This feature lets users share existing Wi-Fi settings with wireless accessories without having to manually select the right network and enter credentials. Some wireless accessories like smart thermostats and smoke detectors already take advantage of this feature on iOS. tvOS 10 brought developers the ability to support app notifications and icon badging like on iOS, and accessory makers can also now use alerts with tvOS. In 10.0.1, Device Notifications can relay device state changes to tvOS— including device name, current language, time/date— to a connected accessory like on iOS. There is also support for new accessibility features on tvOS with 10.0.1 including VoiceOver and Assistive Touch. VoiceOver support, for example, means Apple TV accessories can work with Apple’s built-in audio interface when users can’t see what’s visually presented on screen. This can be used for switch-type input accessories paired used to control Apple’s accessibility features. While quietly supported with 10.0.1 that rolled out to users back in October, these new features have recently been documented in Apple’s MFi documentation that companies follow to have products approved by Apple and guarantee compatibility. It could take time for accessory makers to implement support for the features and have them approved through the MFi process before you start seeing products that take advantage of the new 10.0.1 features. Overall, the changes documented for Apple TV accessories should create a better user experience for customers when companies adopt the features in MFi hardware and potentially expand the ecosystem of supported hardware. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Is this proof that iPhone 8 will be Apple’s biggest launch ever? by Jamie Hinks 07 February 2017 0 shares Read Comments Apple is ready to let loose more iPhones than ever before when the device’s 10th anniversary comes round unveiled, apparently. A report from BlueFin Research, spotted by Barron’s, strongly suggests that those working on the Apple iPhone 8 supply chain will be burning the midnight oil earlier than usual, with production ramping up as soon as June. “Interestingly, our present reads suggest a 300% increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9 million. As a result, overall June quarter builds have increased from 45m to 48m, with the sharp increase in iPhone 8 offset somewhat by modest declines in legacy models. In the past, builds of upcoming releases began in earnest early in the September quarter, so this is a departure from AAPL’s normal build cadence,” read the report. Related: MWC 2017 The report also alludes to the fact that we shouldn’t expect to see the device hatch any earlier than previous years; the traditional late September launch is expected to continue as usual. As we’re a mere seven months away from the a possible iPhone 8 release, there’s no shortage of rumours out there. Some of the new features being mooted include an all-glass design, wireless charging, an OLED/AMOLED display, 5.8-inch screen, A11 chip, Intel 7360 LTE modem, iOS 11 software, no Home button and that’s just for starters. This year also marks the 10th birthday of the iPhone as a device family. To celebrate, there is a suggestion that Apple will opt to release not two but three variation of the iPhone 8, a premium edition sitting alongside the standard and plus variants Cranking the supply chain into action this early would fit with the three variation theory and one thing is for sure: we will see a new Apple iPhone come September.

REUTERS/Noah Berger 4/5 left right The Apple Campus 2 is seen under construction in Cupertino, California in this aerial photo taken January 13, 2017. REUTERS/Noah Berger 5/5 By Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO Inside the original Macintosh computer, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs inscribed the signatures of his team, revealing his deep concern for even the hidden features of his products. His last work – Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) sprawling new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. - will be a fitting tribute: a futuristic campus built with astonishing attention to detail. From the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of a hidden pipe, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny. But constructing a building as flawless as a hand-held device is no easy feat, according to interviews with nearly two dozen current and former workers on the project, most of whom would not be named because they signed non-disclosure agreements. Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded: Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project. A lengthy approval process with the city contributed to the delay. Apple has not revealed the total price tag, but former project managers estimate it at about $5 billion - a figure CEO Tim Cook did not dispute in a 2015 TV interview. More than $1 billion was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. For all the time and money sunk into the project, some in the architecture community question whether Apple has focused on the right ends. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at U.C. Berkeley. Its central office building – a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship – could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. "It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company," she said. “They are creating an icon.” An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. Infographic ID: '2klHgfM'   WORLD'S LARGEST PIECE OF CURVED GLASS Tech companies have long favored generic office parks, which allow them to lease and shed space through booms and busts. Jobs’ unveiling of what's formally known as Apple Campus 2, months before his death, marked a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. When completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees, according to the 2013 project description. The main building – which boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass – will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees. Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact as the land passed from tech giant to tech giant. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics. Apple's in-house construction team enforced many rules: No vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. Guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages. Tolerances, the distance materials may deviate from desired measurements, were a particular focus. On many projects, the standard is 1/8 of an inch at best; Apple often demanded far less, even for hidden surfaces. The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said. "With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances," he said. "You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam." The project, which generated about 13,000 full-time construction jobs, took a toll on contractors. The original general contractors, Skanska USA and DPR Construction, left after work began, which construction experts called a rare development for a project of such scale. The reasons for the departures are unclear, and neither Apple nor the firms would comment. FAITHFUL TO DESIGN PRINCIPLES Apple's novel approach to the building took many forms. Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products. The elevator buttons struck some workers as resembling the iPhone's home button; one former manager even likened the toilet's sleek design to the device. But de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. "They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles," de la Torre said. Fanatical attention to detail is a key tenet. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone’s audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. Thus, each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. "The things you can’t see, they all mattered to Apple,” the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm. The rationale? If engineers had to adjust their gait while entering the building, they risked distraction from their work, according to a former construction manager. “We spent months trying not to do that because that’s time, money and stuff that’s never been done before,” the former construction manager said. Time and time again, Apple managers spent months perfecting minute features, creating a domino effect that set back other parts of the project, former construction managers say. Signage required a delicate balancing act: Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency. Dirk Mattern, a retired deputy fire chief who is representing the Santa Clara County Fire Department on the project, estimated he attended 15 meetings that touched on the topic. "I’ve never spent so much time on signage," he said.   LIKE A PAINTING When Apple tapped general contractors Holder Construction and Rudolph & Sletten to finish the main building in 2015, one of the first orders of business was finalizing a door handle for conference rooms and offices. After months of back and forth, construction workers presented their work to a manager from Apple’s in-house team, who turned the sample over and over in his hands. Finally, he said he felt a faint bump. The construction team double-checked the measurements, unable to find any imperfections – down to the nanometer. Still, Apple insisted on another version. The construction manager who was so intimately involved in the door handle did not see its completion. Down to his last day, Apple was still fiddling with the design - after a year and a half of debate. When construction wraps, the only fingerprints on the site will be Jobs'. Workers often had to wear gloves to avoid marring the delicate materials, said Brett Davis, regional director of the District Council 16 union for painters and related crafts. "It's like a painting that you don't want to touch," he said. "It's definitely going to be something to see, if they let you in."

According to Scoble, Apple has forged a partnership with Carl Zeiss, a company that manufactures camera lenses and medical technology and makes the Zeiss VR One Plus headset, notes Apple Insider. Last week, the site unearthed two patents that hint at how Apple will implement its AR technology.

Snap's cheaper Spectacles have been more successful, but those shades mostly focus on recording video for easy sharing. CEO Tim Cook has said that Apple is nvesting heavily in augmented reality, but as usual, we've heard little about the company's plans, much less an official timeline of an AR headset release.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Awrel Releases Dentistry’s Newest HIPAA-Compliant Texting Application with Powerful Environment for Collaborative Workflow Awrel Releases Dentistry’s Newest HIPAA-Compliant Texting Application with Powerful Environment for Collaborative Workflow Posted on February 7, 2017 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Dental professionals can reduce risk of federal offenses associated with texting private patient information via native Apple and Android messaging environments Boston, MA (PRWEB) February 07, 2017 Awrel, a Boston-based dental solution provider, today announced an enhanced user interface and new features to improve communication and collaboration in its HIPAA-compliant texting application. A first-of-its-kind tool created for the dental industry, the Awrel solution speeds information exchange among dentists, labs, academic institutions and dental supply companies while also providing powerful tools to streamline clinical and business workflow. “We set out to provide incomparable simplicity for dentists who are now violating HIPAA law when texting within Apple and Android texting environments,” said Arnold Rosen, DDS, Awrel founder and CEO. “We’ve had phenomenal response from early adopters who report increased productivity, reduced frustration and true opportunity to improve outcomes. We’re very pleased to unveil a radically new user interface and added functionality for improved communication and collaboration.” According to Rosen, email is today’s standard for exchanging information. Yet research shows that across all industries, email has an open rate of just 20 percent compared to a rate of 98 percent with text. “We founded Awrel on the premise of bolstering productivity while ensuring privacy by equipping dental professionals with an easy-to-use, always-on, secure texting environment provided at a low monthly fee,” he said. Unlike today’s commonly used email systems which frustrate many dentists, Awrel provides quick message, image and document exchange, intuitive workflow, and secure cloud storage in HIPAA-compliant mobile and desktop work environments, Rosen stated. Among new additions are: Easier-to-use interface: Awrel’s fully revamped interface replicates the look and feel of today’s most widely used and familiar texting apps, easing use and accelerating productivity Extended reach: Awrel subscribers can invite unlimited non-subscribers and patients to participate in two-way HIPAA-compliant text messaging at no added cost subscribers or invitees File structure enhancements: Users have improved capabilities to create topics and specify multiple topics, providing quick and easy access to archived messages and files Message ownership improvements: Only message owners can add new members to a message thread, ensuring information sharing is limited to intended individuals Improved file management: New desktop administrative functionality to manage sharing and storage of large files (i.e. images, radiographs, DICOM files, CT scans) Improved archiving: Awrel provides ready access to information at any time without security risks; because Awrel is not a transient texting app, files are never deleted, but instead stored securely in the cloud Rosen, a practicing prosthodontist and respected consultant and lecturer in the dental industry, explained that the Awrel app is built on a 100% HIPAA-compliant business platform. This can streamline integration with practice management systems, EHRs, and third-party systems, and can also provide “near-limitless opportunity to embrace the future of digital dentistry,” he said. About Awrel Awrel offers dentistry’s first low-cost, easy-to-use application for 100% HIPAA-compliant texting with message, image and document exchange, individual and group messaging, collaborative workflow, and cloud-based data archiving. The solution ensures HIPAA compliance when texting — for dentists and dental labs sharing digital information, solution providers integrating chat for dentists and patients, device reps working with dentists and dental labs, and academic environments seeking solutions for private, secure texting. Built on a transactional business platform, Awrel provides a powerful environment to cost-effectively move into the future of digital dentistry and connected health. http://www.awrel.com # # # For the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/02/prweb14047908.htm Latest News Mazzitti & Sullivan Counseling Services Launches New Website Introducing the First Guitar Stand ​That Fits in the Palm of Your Hand Cablefax is Now Accepting Entries for The FAXIES Awards; Entry Deadline March 3 A’ Photography Awards 2017 is Looking for Photographers with Outstanding Works who are Aiming at Getting Global Fame and Recognition Paso Robles Plumber Quality 1st Plumbing Announces Special Discount For Local Veterans Pixel Film Studios Announces TransFocus Layers for Final Cut Pro X Vernon Computer Source Offering $2,000 Scholarship National Debt Relief Explains When Debt Consolidation Is A Good And Bad Idea Uncorked Wine Tours Releases “Top Paso Robles Wine Tour Stops” List for 2017 Credit2B Announces Addition of Chief Product Officer © 2015 SSUChronicle.

Depending on the app, the Touch Bar changes context and shows relevant buttons for what you are doing. You can also take this one step further and change what the Touch Bar offers yourself: Apple has made it pretty customizable. You can add new buttons for a particular app, take others away, as well as adjust the persistent Control Strip items on the right side of the Touch Bar. For example, you can remove the Siri button from the Touch Bar. Here’s how to do that and a lot more … Apple debuted the Touch Bar with the 2016 MacBook Pro in October. Eventually, we expect Apple to bring the Touch Bar to more of its lineup like the Retina MacBook and maybe even desktop Macs with a keyboard accessory. For now, though, this Touch Bar how-to is relevant to owners of the 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. By default, macOS sets up the Touch Bar with a three section layout. There is a persistent virtual esc key on the left, a Control Strip region on the right containing system controls and a middle section dedicated to the app that is frontmost. The escape key can’t be changed but you can customize both the center app region and the Control Strip … Add buttons to the Touch Bar within apps Not all apps support the Touch Bar (although more are adding integration all the time) but those that do can allow users to customize the visible controls. This means that in addition to the default set of buttons, sliders and interface widgets, you can tweak the Touch Bar to suit your workflow. Unfortunately, not all Touch Bar apps support Touch Bar customization. You can find out if the app supports customization by launching an app that works with the Touch Bar, opening the View menu in the menu bar and looking for the ‘Customize Touch Bar…’ option. If present, click it to open the editing view. This reveals a drawer of options for the current context — in this example, I’m using Safari Touch Bar customization. Choose an item to add to the Touch Bar by clicking on it with the mouse and dragging it down. Drag it down past the bottom of the screen into the Touch Bar. Use the trackpad to position the item and release to place. Remove buttons from the Touch Bar within apps Enter the customize view again by going to the View menu in a compatible app, and select ‘Customize Touch Bar…’. If you look closely, the buttons in the Touch Bar shake slightly to indicate they can be edited (just like jiggle mode on the iPhone home screen). To remove an item, you can move your cursor down the screen and into the bar, hold down and pull it upwards to delete it. You can also use the touch input directly — just drag an item on the Touch Bar screen to the trash icon on the left side of the screen. If you customize an app’s Touch Bar setup and later regret it, you can always return to the default configuration. Enter the Customize Touch Bar mode and find the ‘Default Set’ item in the tray. Drag this into the Touch Bar to replace everything with the default options for that app. Add buttons to the Touch Bar Control Strip The Control Strip is situated on the right-hand side of the Touch Bar, featuring system shortcuts that do not change on a per-application basis. The Control Strip includes an expand button — the small disclosure triangle — to reveal even more system controls for media playback, brightness, volume and more. Similar to the Touch Bar app region, the Control Strip can be fully customized. To add a new item to the Control Strip, open the editing mode like so: Launch System Preferences. Navigate to Keyboard and press the ‘Customize Control Strip…’ button. You can add buttons for brightness, Spotlight, Mission Control, Play/Pause, Screenshot, Do Not Disturb, Dictation and much more. To add a button, drag it down from the screen into the Control Strip on the Touch Bar using your mouse. The compact Control Strip contains up to four items. You can modify the Touch Bar’s expanded Control Strip too. Whilst in the editing view, press the disclosure arrow to reveal the expanded Control Strip in the Touch Bar. You can now edit the items in this mode too — independently of the items in compact Control Strip. Remove Siri and other buttons from the Touch Bar Control Strip By default, the Touch Bar compact Control Strip includes four buttons: a volume slider, mute, a brightness slider, and Siri. Personally, I find the multicolored Siri icon very distracting on the Touch Bar as every other system icon is rendered in monochrome. I also don’t use Siri on Mac that often so it feels unnecessary to have it take up valuable Touch Bar real estate. Luckily, you can remove items from the Control Strip as well — you don’t have to have four. To remove the Siri button, open the Control Strip editing mode (System Preferences → Keyboard → Customize Control Strip…) and move your mouse into the Touch Bar screen. Move your trackpad until the Siri button is highlighted (or whatever icon you want to remove), click to select and pull it upwards out of the Touch Bar to remove it. You can remove items in the expanded view too — just press the expand arrow whilst in editing mode to change context. If you want to, you can remove the colorful Siri icon from both parts of the Control Strip. Hide the Control Strip completely, maximizing Touch Bar app region If you don’t like the persistent Control Strip, you can actually turn it off completely to dedicate the entire Touch Bar to controls for the frontmost application. This reclaims about a fifth of the display’s real estate, although not all Touch Bar apps take advantage of the additional canvas area. To disable the Control Strip, open System Preferences. Select Keyboard and open the drop down labelled ‘Touch Bar shows.’ The default is ‘App Controls with Control Strip.’ Select ‘App Controls’ to remove the Control Strip entirely. You can also opt to only display the Expanded Control Strip and never show dynamic app buttons and sliders. This is not recommended as it means you lose out on much of the Touch Bar’s potential as a contextually relevant, rich UI. If you want to make the Expanded Control Strip more prominent, try the next tip. Hold down the FN key to show Expanded Control Strip, not function keys Apple knew that removing the traditional physical row of keys with the dynamic Touch Bar was going to be controversial, so they added a fallback to the old behavior. Simply press the ‘fn’ key in the bottom-left corner to instantly show a row of F-keys on the Touch Bar. This is fine but a little too dull. To embrace the rich world of the Touch Bar, you can change this behavior to instead show something more dynamic. In System Preferences, you can change what happens when you hold down the ‘fn’ key. You can make it instantly show the Expanded Control Strip, which you customized above, instead. In the Keyboard preference pane, select ‘Expand Control Strip’ from the drop down as shown above. It’s a lot nicer than fiddling with the disclosure arrow on the mini Control Strip, just hit the fn key with your left hand and simultaneously tap a button with your right hand. Boom. It’s a lot more useful than static function keys for most people and I found it made me use the Expanded Control Strip more frequently. Other transient Touch Bar customizations, hide QuickType typing suggestions As well as changing the arrangement of buttons, there are some on-the-fly customizations you can do with the Touch Bar. Typing suggestions are a common feature for the center segment when the cursor is focused in a text field, but they may not be desired all the time. I find the animated motion distracting. To hide word and emoji suggestions, tap the little arrow next to the three-pane-bar and QuickType shrinks down for that session. In some apps, this will make space for alternative buttons and controls. When playing music in the background, a new ‘Now Playing’ Control Strip item will appear for compatible apps; the icon looks like a mini volume EQ. For example. start playing a song in iTunes and then tab away to another app. Tap on this to see a scrubber for the currently playing track, play/pause and back/forward transport buttons to control the active playlist. What’s special about the Now Playing screen is that it is persistent; if you change apps, the music controls will continue to be presented on Touch Bar for as long as the app is playing audio. Press the close button (hit the ‘x’ on the left) at any time to return to the usual contextual controls. FaceTime also supports this kind of persistent bar. Whilst on a call, a green ‘call’ button will appear on the Control Strip. When pressed, it shows the FaceTime call status and quick actions to end the call or mute. Whilst expanded, this view continues to display regardless of what app you are in. Tap the ‘x’ to return to normal Touch Bar functionality. What is your experience with the Touch Bar? The Touch Bar is very customizable with a lot of flexibility, albeit a little hidden. The Touch Bar is all about adding convenience and the ability to mix and match exactly what controls you use certainly helps to push that further. Do you use the Touch Bar on your new MacBook Pro?

This comes a day after select Apple retail stores around the United States began receiving early stock of the Beats-branded neckbuds, which feature Apple’s W1 chip for quick, easy pairing with iOS devices and Macs. Beats X cost $149.95, and aside from the white and black color options that Apple already announced, today the company unveiled two other choices: gray and blue. Beats X earbuds are also fully compatible with non-Apple hardware like Android smartphones. Apple says battery life can extend up to 8 hours, and you can get up to two hours of listening time by just plugging them in for 5 minutes. They charge via a Lightning connector, which is a departure from the microUSB plug ordinarily used by other Beats headphones. Apple says the “Flex-Form” cable is designed to make Beats X rest comfortably (and tangle-free) around your neck, and the earbuds can attach to one another magnetically when not in use. In the box you also get a carrying case and removable wingtips for when you need a more secure fit. Note however that Beats X are not sweat-proof like the brand’s Powerbeats line.

Talks iPhone Upgrade Rate Apple's CFO provides insight into how the company's most recent iPhone 7 series of smartphones is being received by current iPhone owners. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 7, 2017 at 9:46AM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6s product line, launched in September 2015, ultimately underperformed the company's wildly successful iPhone 6 product line in terms of sales. A key reason for this, Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors at the time, was the company's seeing fewer customers opting to upgrade their iPhones during the iPhone 6s cycle than it did during the iPhone 6 cycle. Cook explained back on the company's April 2016 earnings call: From an upgrade perspective, during the first half of [fiscal 2016], the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that we saw with iPhone 6. Apple iPhones. Image source: Apple. On Apple's most recent earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri provided some insight into what the upgrade rate is looking like for the current iPhone 7 product cycle -- let's take a closer look. More of the same, but that's not bad Maestri explained that the percentage of Apple's iPhone installed base that has upgraded to the company's latest iPhone 7-series smartphones "has been very similar to" what the company saw with the prior-generation iPhone 6s-series smartphones. Although last year's iPhone 6s cycle proved to be a bit disappointing, this news is much better delivered this time around than it was last year for several reasons. First, Apple's iPhone installed base has likely grown year over year, so a constant upgrade rate applied to a larger installed base should mean that more phones get sold -- clearly a positive for Apple. Next, investors often focus on year-over-year trends. Last year, the upgrade rate that Apple saw with the iPhone 6s relative to the iPhone 6 negatively affected the company's financial results year over year. This year, a flat upgrade rate relative to the prior generation means that the year-over-year financial result comparisons won't be as tough. And, finally, while the percentage of the iPhone installed base that migrates to the latest iPhones might be flat generation over generation, Apple seems to be getting a boost by selling a richer product mix. As I noted here, Cook told investors that the company is selling more iPhone 7 Plus phones as a percentage of total iPhone 7-series (i.e., "new product") sales than it did of its prior-generation iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 6s Plus. The Plus models are more expensive than their non-Plus counterparts, so this is a positive for Apple's iPhone product mix and, ultimately, revenue. Can Apple accelerate that rate in the future? Maestri offered some additional insight into the factors that impact the upgrade rates of Apple's new iPhones. "The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us," Maestri began. He then went on to suggest that if the company weren't forced to raise iPhone pricing in certain countries because of foreign exchange movements, the company could potentially "sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint." Beyond the foreign exchange situation, Maestri also pointed out that "the more [Apple is] able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate." The rumors swirling about Apple's next-generation iPhone models suggest that the improvements could be much more significant generation-over-generation than what the company delivered with the iPhone 7-series. Time will tell if they are enough to catalyze the iPhone upgrade rate that Apple sees.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Falcone 1:53 Close Drag Over the last several months, I've received dozens of messages from CNET readers asking me when Beats by Dr. Dre's delayed BeatsX headphone ($150, £130, AU$200) would be available. I have a definitive answer now: Feb. 10, 2017. Yes, the highly anticipated neckband-style wireless headphone will be in Apple's retail stores globally, from Apple.com and in authorized resellers, in white and black. Beats also announced the addition of two new colors, gray and blue, which are coming soon. Enlarge Image The BeatsX will initially ship in white and black but two new colors are coming: gray and blue. Beats by Dr. Dre Beats had updated its on-ear Beats Solo3 Wireless and Beats Powersbeats3 wireless sports headphones with Apple's new custom Bluetooth chip, the W1, which is more energy-efficient and boosts battery life significantly. The $150 BeatsX, however, is a totally new model that was designed with the help of Apple engineers (reminder: Beats is owned by Apple). CNET is one of the few publications to have gotten an early look -- and listen -- to the BeatsX. I was impressed with the new headphone and thought it could be a slightly cheaper, better alternative to Apple's AirPods. It does sound better, with substantially more bass response.

Updated: Feb 07, 2017, 04.53 PM IST READ MORE ON » microbrewery | brewery | bira | beer | bars In a relatively short space of 10 years, over 100 brewpubs have come up across India, with more opening in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Chandigarh and Goa. Related Beer-loving Bengaluru is taking the bond between food & drink to a new level Those who buy a pint of beer for Rs 100 should 'upgrade' to White Rhino, says founder Ishaan Puri In 1999, Philippe Delerm wrote a book, "We could almost eat outside: an appreciation of life's small pleasures", and one pleasure he talked about, is that "first sip of beer". And what could give even more pleasure if the beer were fresh and flavourful? 15 years before Philippe, Apple released an iconic ad in which the protagonist rebels against Big Brother (standing in here for the Windows PC), with the ad ending with the line, "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984". For Indians replace 1984 with 2006 for the year when we finally began to break the yoke that mass-produced strong lager beer had on us. And the lead role in this was played very much by brewpubs, a term given to a pub which brews (and serves) fresh beer on site. Prateek and Suketu were two of India's unlikely revolutionaries. On a 2006 on a visit to Pune, I met Prateek, one of the founding trio of Doolally (he has since exited the partnership). Tired of shepherding the fortunes of Tide and Crest in Singapore, and inspired by Brewerkz, Singapore's evergreen brewpub, they decided to return to India to quite literally, ferment a revolution here. To cut a long story short, what they did, helped change the excise laws in Maharashtra, but Doolally was beaten to the punch by Howzzat and Rockman's in Gurgaon. In a relatively short space of 10 years, we have 100 brewpubs across India, with the newer ones coming up in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Chandigarh and Goa. Gurgaon and Bangalore are where the bulk of them are concentrated, fuelled no doubt by the young urban professionals in both locations. Now brewing: Mumbaikars raise a toast to craft beers. (Image: BCCL) Navin Mittal of Gateway Brewing in Mumbai defines craft beer as beer brewed with a focus on taste, and with passion. Brewers such as Gateway, whose beer is produced, kegged and sold to bars, have also emerged side by side with the brewpubs along with craft brewers who bottle their beer like Bira 91 and White Rhino, both of whom brew in India and who are getting rave reviews from beer critics and consumers. "Small is beautiful", and definitely so, with a pub-based microbrewery, as the relatively limited capacities of these breweries allow them to make small batches of beer, and more importantly, allows them to keep varying the style and recipe. Think of these very much as beer kitchens. A steady progression in state laws has also enabled growth of this sector. Maharashtra again took the lead, with enabling beer brewed in one brewpub to be sold to other bars or as Doolally has chosen, a practice known as kegging, a model wherein with their mother ship in Pune, they have set up a chain of tap rooms where their beer is served up, whilst also supplying other bars like Woodside Inn, whose newest outlet in Mumbai's Phoenix Mills boasts 20 beers on tap. Next in line in terms of laws is likely to be allowing you to buy draught beer in a Growler (a large glass jar) from a brewpub and taking it home. What's still unfortunate however especially given the flexibility allowed by a brew pub to experiment with styles is the tendency of several brewpubs, especially in Gurgaon, to brew as Doolally's co-founder and head brew master Oliver Schauf puts it, "different shades of lager". They all seem to be prospering though, with no reports of any closures. One of the outliers in Gurgaon however is Quaff, where brewmaster Ishan Grover recently brewed up a beer called Ekta, a collaborative brew between Haryana and Karnataka, a Belgian Saison with Indian spices and hibiscus flowers. Ekta is the perfect example of the versatility, which a microbrewery can bring to beer recipes, whilst also showcasing the use of Indian ingredients in the recipe. Ekta is not an isolated example of such a trend, and there are other quaint ones like Mango Ale at Mumbai's White Owl and the Tamarind Blanche (Belgian style witbier infused with tamarind) at the Effingut Brewekerz Pune. What can one expect going forward? Many brewpubs in more states, with some going also having national ambitions, and possibly some states also allowing brewpubs to bottle and sell their beer. Grover is optimistic and claims that in 10 years, India will have a bigger craft beer revolution than the USA or Europe. Whether this comes true or not, it's clear that brewpubs are not a passing trend and are very much here to stay. Meanwhile, what I am most looking forward to is brewpubs in my home state of Delhi, a state which still is a wasteland for them!

Apple’s new 'Made for iPhone' accessory and port explained What is UAC? Apple’s new 'Made for iPhone' accessory and port explained by Sean Keach 07 February 2017 0 shares Read Comments Apple is planning to launch a brand new ‘Made for iPhone’ accessory that will introduce another connector for you to wrap your head around. So what is UAC, and why should you care? What is UAC? UAC is an acronym (which stands for Ultra Accessory Connector), and is an upcoming accessory in the ‘Made for iPhone’ range. The goal is to make it easier for headphone users to connect their audio gear to different devices. There are two key aspects to the UAC; there’s the (1) actual accessory you’ll be able to buy, and (2) and new connection standard that Apple is handing over to headphone makers. How does UAC work? Let’s say you have a pair of headphones with a Lightning connector. That’ll plug into your iPhone 7 just fine, but it won’t plug into the USB-C port on your new MacBook Pro. Alternatively, you’ll face the same problem in reverse if you have a pair of headphones with a USB-C connector. What the UAC accessory will do is function as a middle-man. So future headphones will feature a UAC-style connector that will plug into the UAC accessory. Then, from the accessory, you’ll be able to feed out to a USB-C port, or a Lightning port, or a headphone jack, with the firmware switching on the fly for the relevant connection. Apple will allow accessory manufacturers to make: Lightning to UAC USB-A to UAC 3.5mm jack to UAC The UAC accessory will also allow headphone makers to save space inside a pair of headphones, versus having to use Apple Lightning port or USB-C. Related: iPhone 7S What does UAC look like? It’s an 8-pin connection that measures 2.05mm by 4.85mm, and is “slightly less thick than USB-C”. This small size is intended to help device makers save space in their headphones. It’s similar in shape to the already-existing Ultra Mini USB connectors, which you’ll be familiar with if you use a Nikon camera. Check it out: Apple's UAC port will look a bit like the Ultra Mini USB (on the right) Will UAC be on iPhones? This is important: UAC is not going to end up as a port on your iPhone. People “familiar with Apple’s plans” told the Verge that Apple wouldn’t be replacing Lightning, or installing a new 8-in port on iPhones or iPads. This is simply a middle-man connection that helps headphone manufacturers connect their devices to multiple ports. UAC Release Date and Price: When does it come out, and how much is it? Unfortunately, we have no idea when the UAC accessory will launch – or how much it will cost. According to 9to5mac, Made for iPhone program licensees have had access to the new standard for a couple of months. So we’ll probably have to wait for these accessory makers to actually be ready to launch some UAC-friendly headphones before the accessory will arrive too. And how much will it cost? Probably too much, if we know Apple. Why is this better than a headphone jack? In the sense of being able to connect your headphones to different devices, it’s not. This is Apple admitting that it’s ruddy difficult to choose a pair of headphones when there are so many different ways to connect headphones to a device. Back when headphone jacks reigned supreme, this was a complete non-issue. But USB-C and Lightning connectors are far more versatile than the outdated 3.5mm audio jack of yore, so it’s arguably better for future audio innovation to support these new standards, over the prolific (but less versatile) headphone jack. Plus, the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack, so 3.5mm jacks totally aren't cool any more, right? Right? Related: iPhone 8 Watch: Apple AirPods review What do you think of UAC?

Dula is an Apple supplier partner which Apple uses to make and assemble furniture and fittings for its Apple retail stores. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been on somewhat of a European tour this week, visiting various people and publicizing his appearances on Twitter. Cook met with a fashion designer that uses an iPad Pro to draw his designs, praised young developers at an Apple Store workshop, and made a surprise appearance at an Apple Store in France where he met customers and staff (video here). He also spoke to the French press, with an interview discussing the state of the company, iPhone sales trajectory, and more. At some point in the next 24 hours, Cook will be traveling to the United Kingdom as he is scheduled to appear at the University of Glasgow tomorrow evening where he will receive an honorary degree.

A warning found in the beta-testing version of iOS 10.3 may mean the end of the road for some of the oldest and best-loved software available for the smartphone. Apps and games from indie developers, like Ocarina and Great Lightsaber, are likely to be hardest hit by the move.  Scroll down for video  Updates planned for the Apple's operating system could soon render some of your favourite apps obsolete  BONFIRE OF THE APPS  In October 2016 Apple removed more than 47,000 apps, which had not received an update in the past two years or more, from the App Store. That's an increase of 238 per cent, according to Tech Crunch. Apps and games from indie developers are likely to be hardest hit by the removal of support for 32-bit apps.  Apps affected are likely to include: Ocarina Great Lightsaber Ridiculous Fishing Peggle Classic Canabalt  Hundreds Aquaria Tens of thousands of apps could be affected. The introduction of increasingly powerful 64-bit processors has meant that programmers have to update older apps to be fully compatible.  Apple has been encouraging developers to make the adjustments necessary, but has maintained support for the older 32-bit software until now. The previous version of the iPhone operating system warned 32-bit apps 'may slow down your iPhone'. But a new warning in the iOS 10.3 beta reads: 'This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatability.'  The 64-bit infrastructure was brought in with the launch of iPhone 5s in September 2013. Developers have been able to launch 64-bit apps since February 2015 and update existing apps since June 2015.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Lost your AirPods?

Share this article Share 83 shares But Apple appears to be forcing the hands of software engineers who are yet to update their coding. The finished version of iOS 10.3 is expected be released to the public in March or April 2017.  While the changes rolled out are unlikely to remove 32-bit support immediately, it seems likely it will be removed for the launch of iOS 11 at the latest.   App developer Peter Steinberger was one of the first to flag concerns that 32-bit support for iOS may be removed in the future. Twitter users are worried changes to iOS could lead to the App Store becoming 'a graveyard' One Twitter user has even predicted that 'the App Store soon will be the greatest apps graveyard.' In October 2016 Apple removed more than 47,000 apps, which had not received an update in the past two years or more, from the App Store. That's an increase of 238 per cent, according to Tech Crunch. Apple has not previously rolled out new operating systems to its older devices so these are unlikely to be affected. But consumers using compatible handsets and tablets will need to update their apps once they have installed iOS 11. It is unclear when iOS 11 will be coming out.    iOS 10.3 FEATURES iOS 10.3 is set to include a number of changes, many of which have been discovered since the launch of the beta-test version. Among these is an eagerly anticipated 'Theater Mode'. This feature is designed to disable sound, haptic feedback, block incoming calls and messages, and reduce initial screen brightness during a movie, according to Appleinsider.  The new function could be similar to the iPhones 'Do Not Disturb' feature that mutes alerts when turned on.  The Find My iPhone app is also due to receive an update that will let users locate their AirPods, if they are in Bluetooth range of any iOS devices. If the AirPods are within range of any iOS devices signed into iCloud and available, that device's location will be used to show the user where to start looking for the lost earphones. The app will also be able to play a sound on either or both AirPods to help users track down their location.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Inside the original Macintosh computer, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs inscribed the signatures of his team, revealing his deep concern for even the hidden features of his products. His last work - Apple Inc.'s sprawling new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. - will be a fitting tribute: a futuristic campus built with astonishing attention to detail. From the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of a hidden pipe, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny. But constructing a building as flawless as a hand-held device is no easy feat, according interviews with nearly two dozen current and former workers on the project, most of whom would not be named because they signed non-disclosure agreements. Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded: Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project. A lengthy approval process with the city contributed to the delay. Apple has not revealed the total price tag, but former project managers estimate it at about $5 billion - a figure CEO Tim Cook did not dispute in a 2015 TV interview. More than $1 billion was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. For all the time and money sunk into the project, some in the architecture community question whether Apple has focused on the right ends. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at U.C. Berkeley. Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. "It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company," she said. "They are creating an icon." An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. WORLD'S LARGEST PIECE OF CURVED GLASS Tech companies have long favored generic office parks, which allow them to lease and shed space through booms and busts. Jobs' unveiling of what's formally known as Apple Campus 2, months before his death, marked a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. When completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees, according to the 2013 project description. The main building - which boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass - will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees. Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact as the land passed from tech giant to tech giant. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics. Apple's in-house construction team enforced many rules: No vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. Guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages. Tolerances, the distance materials may deviate from desired measurements, were a particular focus. On many projects, the standard is 1/8 of an inch at best; Apple often demanded far less, even for hidden surfaces. The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said. "With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances," he said. "You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam." The project, which generated about 13,000 full-time construction jobs, took a toll on contractors. The original general contractors, Skanska USA and DPR Construction, left after work began, which construction experts called a rare development for a project of such scale. The reasons for the departures are unclear, and neither Apple nor the firms would comment.   FAITHFUL TO DESIGN PRINCIPLES Apple's novel approach to the building took many forms. Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products. The elevator buttons struck some workers as resembling the iPhone's home button; one former manager even likened the toilet's sleek design to the device. But de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. "They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles," de la Torre said. Fanatical attention to detail is a key tenet. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. Thus, each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. "The things you can't see, they all mattered to Apple," the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm. The rationale? If engineers had to adjust their gait while entering the building, they risked distraction from their work, according to a former construction manager. "We spent months trying not to do that because that's time, money and stuff that's never been done before," the former construction manager said. Time and time again, Apple managers spent months perfecting minute features, creating a domino effect that set back other parts of the project, former construction managers say. Signage required a delicate balancing act: Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist esthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency. Dirk Mattern, a retired deputy fire chief who is representing the Santa Clara County Fire Department on the project, estimated he attended 15 meetings that touched on the topic. "I've never spent so much time on signage," he said.   LIKE A PAINTING When Apple tapped general contractors Holder Construction and Rudolph & Sletten to finish the main building in 2015, one of the first orders of business was finalizing a door handle for conference rooms and offices. After months of back and forth, construction workers presented their work to a manager from Apple's in-house team, who turned the sample over and over in his hands. Finally, he said he felt a faint bump. The construction team double-checked the measurements, unable to find any imperfections - down to the nanometer. Still, Apple insisted on another version. The construction manager who was so intimately involved in the door handle did not see its completion. Down to his last day, Apple was still fiddling with the design - after a year and a half of debate. When construction wraps, the only fingerprints on the site will be Jobs'. Workers often had to wear gloves to avoid marring the delicate materials, said Brett Davis, regional director of the District Council 16 union for painters and related crafts. "It's like a painting that you don't want to touch," he said. "It's definitely going to be something to see, if they let you in." © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

Photo: Getty James Ried Reporter @JamesRied9 Share Tweet Share Reddit Pin EmailComment Apple users have been warned that a number of popular iOS apps are vulnerable to being hacked. Sudo Security Group CEO Will Strafach has revealed 76 Apple Store apps, including Snapchat, are failing to encrypt private information correctly. Mr Strafach confirmed on Tuesday that iPhones with these particular applications are exposed to “silent interception” of protected data, as misconfigured code allows an invalid Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate to be accepted. Snapchat was named as one of the vulnerable iOS apps. Photo: Getty TLS is used to secure an app’s communication over an internet connection, but faulty binary code opens users up to a considerable security risk. He explained it as a “man-in-the-middle attack”, where a hacker can eavesdrop over a network and spy on the data the app sends – such as login information. And all that’s needed is a Wi-Fi connection to intercept your data. “The truth of the matter is, this sort of attack can be conducted by any party within Wi-Fi range of your device while it is in use,” Mr Strafach wrote. “This can be anywhere in public, or even within your home if an attacker can get within close range.” Which applications are at the greatest risk? Mr Strafach declared that 43 of the apps were a high or medium risk of vulnerability, with authentication and login information exposed. Related Coverage Samsung Galaxy S8: this is what we know so far Apple reports record iPhone sales over holiday period These apps included “banks, medical providers, and other developers of sensitive applications”, however he would not disclose their names to give developers time to fix the problem. The remaining 33 apps were deemed low risks because they revealed only partially sensitive data, such as email addresses. This includes Snapchat, messaging service ooVoo, VICE news, and a number of lesser-known streaming services. Using app market tracker Apptopia, there have been more than 18 million downloads of apps from the Apple store which have been affected by the vulnerability. The apps’ weaknesses were discovered when scanned through security service verify.ly, which flagged “hundreds of applications” with a high likelihood of data interception. Mr Strafach did so by running them on an iPhone using iOS 10 and a proxy to insert an invalid TLS certificate into the connection. How to protect yourself The best defence against hacks is not to use Wi-Fi in public places, like airports or shopping centres. Photo: Getty According to the research, the vulnerability is very likely to only be exploited if your connection is flowing over Wi-Fi. Therefore, the best protection users of affected apps have is to turn off Wi-Fi when in a public location, and use a cellular connection. “While on a cellular connection the vulnerability does still exist, cellular interception is more difficult, requires expensive hardware, is far more noticeable,” Mr Strafach said. However for the most part, the only way to reduce the likelihood of attacks is for developers to patch the problem and change a few lines of code. Mr Strafach provided a warning for developers. “Be extremely careful when inserting network-related code and changing application behaviours,” he said. “Many issues like this arise from an application developer not fully understanding the code they’ve borrowed from the web.” Comments View Comments Watch The News in 90 Seconds View Full Video Get The New Daily free every morning and evening.

She was tipped as a rising star, the next big thing and showered with honours and awards that recognised her as a young talent to watch. With Britney one of the most successful musicians of all time, Jamie Lynn certainly had a lot to live up to and she seemed to be doing it brilliantly, making a name for herself away from her sister’s shadow. But at the end of 2007, it seemed like Jamie Lynn’s hard work would crash down around her: she discovered she was pregnant, at the age of 16.

Overnight, she was thrust into the global tabloid spotlight, accused of glamourising teen pregnancy and called a disappointment to the young girls who looked up to her. Critics predicted the end of her career as a wholesome, Southern schoolgirl star, while Jamie herself retreated from the limelight. But she refused to be remembered as the girl with a teenage pregnancy and, after raising Maddie away from the spotlight, burst back onto the showbiz scene again, reinventing herself a a serious country singer. And throughout, Maddie, has been her top priority in life. Read More Jamie Lynn Spears' strength for injured daughter Maddie revealed after teen pregnancy scandal that rocked the world A rising star in Hollywood Having Britney Spears as an older sister meant Jamie Lynn was exposed to the bright lights of Hollywood from an early age. She won a role playing Britney’s younger sister in the movie Crossroads in 2002, before nabbing a part in Nickelodeon sketch show, All That.

She also recorded the theme song, Follow Me, which was written by Britney. Zoey 101 was a huge ratings success and firmly cemented Jamie Lynn’s place as a rising Hollywood starlet. She was nominated for a string of big awards and won titles including Favourite TV Actress at the 2006 Kids’ Choice Awards and two Young Artist Awards. The teen pregnancy shock Jamie Lynn had returned home after wrapping Zoey 101 in Los Angeles when she began to feel sick, prompting a friend to suggest she took a pregnancy test. She took the test in a local petrol station bathroom.

So I got the news in the ladies’ room at the BP. Sums it all up.” Telling her parents Jamie Lynn was too scared to tell her parents about her pregnancy to their face, so wrote her mother a note which she left in another room while she waited nearby.

I felt extremely guilty because I’d lived my life trying to be this perfect girl all the time and I was about to let everybody down.” Her parents admitted to being stunned by the news, but stood behind her. “For me, I think the world stopped for a couple of seconds,” said dad Jamie, while mum Lynne said: “I was afraid for her.” And telling the world... The next thing to tackle was telling the world and it was decided Jamie Lynn would give an interview to OK magazine, so she could tell her story in her own words. “I knew I needed to give an explanation to my fans, and I wanted it to be in my words first. I had to make a decision that I could sleep with every night,” she told Glamour in 2012. Jamie gave an exclusive interview to OK magazine about her pregnancy (Photo: OK!

I apologise for that. But I wasn't trying to glamorize teen pregnancy. I hated when [the tabloids] said that. Everybody is dealt a hand of cards. It was my choice to play them the way I played them. “I was already upset about having to tell my parents and Casey's parents. To have the world come down on a situation that was already affecting my family hugely was hard. But this was my situation, and I did the best I could.” The reaction from Nickelodeon Everybody wanted to know what would happen to Zoey 101 following Jamie Lynn’s pregnancy; could the show continue when the show’s role model star was expecting? Jamie has made it clear she was never pregnant on the set of Zoey 101 - it happened after filming had wrapped.

"We respect Jamie Lynn's decision to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation. We know this is a very difficult time for her and her family, and our primary concern right now is for Jamie Lynn's well being." Leaving Hollywood - and her career Jamie Lynn chose to retreat from the spotlight after her pregnancy bombshell, saying she wanted to focus on her unborn baby and the future. “It was about taking time to reflect on what kind of future I wanted to create, because I was bringing another life into this world. I needed to really grow up myself so I could be the woman that my daughter deserves. And not everything needs to be seen or heard,” she told Cosmopolitan . Jamie Lynn raised Maddie away from the spotlight Pictured with Maddie in an Instagram photo (Photo: jamielynnspears/Instagram) She said career wasn’t even on her mind and she wasn’t thinking about what she was walking away from; only that she did the right thing for her and her unborn child. "I really wasn't thinking about career. It was more like, I'm about to have a child, I've got to set up a home. I've got to remove myself, so I can figure out how to grow to be the mother that this child deserves. Career was on the back-burner." A new life in Mississippi After the pregnancy shock, Jamie's then-boyfriend Casey proposed to her and she accepted. They began a new life together in Mississippi, far away from the spotlight of Los Angeles - although the tabloids still found her.

"I knew my story was going to be something people wanted to know about, of course, [it's] tabloid gold. ... The hardest part for me was trying to figure out why these grown men were following this young girl around who is already going through so much in the middle of nowhere. I was so scared already, I didn't want that added pressure." Becoming a mum Maddie Briannn Aldridge was born on 19 June, 2008. Jamie Lynn had a natural delivery - despite reports of a C-section at the time. Family including sister Britney were at the birth.

I was scared, and then she started screaming. It is the best feeling in the world." Missing out on normal teenage life Falling pregnant at 16 meant that inevitably Jamie Lynn missed out on some of the normal activities of a teenager. "I would be lying if I said if I didn't miss out on what normal teenagers do, of course," she told ET Online last year. "But I don't need pity for that. It's a situation that I put myself in and it's called being responsible. You have to be an adult, there is no sitting around and feeling sorry for yourself." Jamie has said she wouldn't change her teenage years for anything (Photo: TLC) Splitting from Casey Jamie Lynn's romance with her childhood sweetheart Casey didn't last and they split in 2010. “Maddie’s father was the only boyfriend I’d ever had, so for me it was, this little girl deserves a family; a mother and a father," she said in her TLC show. "He tried to do the right thing and he asked me to marry him. We were engaged for a while but I think I realised rushing into something that wasn’t right would ultimately be worse.” Jamie Lynn attending the CMT Music Awards in 2015 (Photo: Jason Merritt/Getty) Read More Jamie Lynn Spears admits she found out she was pregnant at 16 in a petrol station toilet Getting back to work behind the scenes When Maddie was around one year old, Jamie Lynn decided to move to Nashville to pursue a country music career in order to provide the best for her daughter. “Even though I was out of the spotlight, I was working very hard on creating a great song catalogue and setting some real cemented foundation for a future for us,” she said. “Every day was guitar lessons, voice lessons, bettering myself at my craft so I could be the best version of myself for this.” Finding love again Jamie began dating businessman Jamie Watson in 2010, after her split from Casey, and following an on-off relationship, they finally sealed the deal with an engagement in 2013 and a marriage the following year. Maddie was guest of honour.

It’s all official now, and it just all feels really good," she told Taste of Country . The comeback Best known for being a teen comedy actress, when Jamie Lynn returned to the spotlight it was in a very different guise: that of a serious country artist. After spending several years working away behind the scenes in Nashville, she released debut album The Country on her own record label, Sweet Jamie Music, and has gone on to perform at the Grand Ole Opry and open for Alabama. Her debut single, How Could I Want More, entered the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 Country Songs. https://www.instagram.com/p/BQBuGvxF2lE/embed Always putting Maddie first She's now a country music artist who has successfully stepped out of Britney's shadow, but no matter how much fame comes her way, she will always make Maddie her number one priority. "My daughter keeps me motivated," she told Popsugar last year, adding her goal is to "provide" for Maddie and "set up a future that creates a better life for her." "I put being a mother first, and everyone who works with me knows this and knows I will have to have a schedule that works around that," she added to Tinseltown Mom . https://www.instagram.com/p/BMKXJG_gv5i/embed https://www.instagram.com/p/BDzMmy6kAtm/embed More children in the future? Now happily married to husband Jamie, the singer has said she would like to expand their family in the future, but the timing isn't quite right yet. "My husband would like to have kids, like, yesterday. But for me, I think that having children is about timing, as well," she told ET Online . "I know that they always say, 'There is no right time to have a child, you know. Just have babies.' But I think right now that it's maybe a little selfish for me to have a child. Maddie is Jamie Lynn's number one priority (Photo: TLC) "I am getting busy. I want to be able to do the same as what I have done with Maddie -- really just be a mom for a little bit and have that time to focus on my next child. But, yeah, we want more babies, of course." "She’s got such a sweet little heart. I feel like I’ve raised her with a lot of honesty, but I’ve also raised her with a lot of love," she added to People . "She’s a very happy, content little girl, and there’s nothing more a parent could ask for. That’s my most proud accomplishment out of anything and always will be."

Furthermore, 9to5Toys shared an Apple Watch deal today that pushed the price of a Series 1 model down to $199.99. With Apple Watch prices continuing to fall and Jawbone exiting the consumer hardware market, is there still a market for dedicated sport bands like the Fitbit? The big selling point of dedicated fitness trackers like the Jawbone and Fitbit has been price. And while you can still get a Fitbit for as low as $80, the price difference between that and an Apple Watch is at an all-time low. This brings up the question of if it’s worth it to purchase a dedicated fitness tracker when you can get a far more capable Apple Watch for just a tad more money. The Apple Watch has been referred to as the top fitness tracker on the market several times and of course offers a variety of additional features. That’s not to say that devices like the Fitbit don’t have selling points of their own. Only focusing on fitness tracking means the Fitbit is smaller and less obtrusive on the wrist than Apple Watch, which is a huge selling point for wearing while working out. Fitbit, however, has dabbled in the smartwatch market. In addition to the most basic Fitbit Flex, the company offers the Blaze smart fitness that is slightly more akin to the Apple Watch and comes in at $149. With all of this in mind, is there still a market for dedicated sport fitness trackers? With even Fitbit trying to push into the smartwatch market, it seems that fitness trackers are less of a market than ever. Smartwatches are also generally more profitable for companies, offering higher margins than low-price fitness trackers. Razor-thin margins are reportedly something that plagued Jawbone and contributed to the decision to switch to high-margin direct-to-business health equipment and services. What do you think? Is there still a market for fitness trackers or is the market as a whole shifting towards the Apple Watch? Take the poll below and offer your thoughts in the comments.

The company tried asking for this before but was shot down by government officials in the country. Apple is planning to manufacture new iPhones in India as soon as April but is again negotiating to sell refurbished devices as well, assumedly at lower prices than the brand new models. The request makes up one of the concessions Apple has submitted to the Indian government as incentives to start iPhone local manufacturing. The company wants various startup benefits including a fifteen-year tax holiday. Apple’s request for a license to sell used iPhones in the country was first rejected in May 2016. India does not want its country to be used as a dumping ground for the world’s unwanted electronics and fears it would undermine its ‘Make in India’ program to boost local manufacturing. Apple’s second attempt at asking for permission to sell refurbished devices includes promises that the device will meet certain standards of quality. Apple be ‘open to third-party audits and checks’ to verify the condition of resold items. Apple wants to take iPhones that are traded in around the world, perform some refurbishment, and then sell them to the price-conscious India market at significantly lower prices than what it charges for new products. If Apple’s wishes are granted, it would become the first company that is allowed to import used devices into India. Currently, Apple is a small player in the Indian smartphone market — held back by the premium iPhone prices. With local manufacturing, the company should be able to bring the prices down.

In the interview, Cook discussed a wide-range of topics, including Apple’s interest in building on Champs-Elysees, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and taxes. As noted by MacGeneration, when asked about Apple’s rumored interest in building a new retail location on Champs-Elysees, Cook didn’t all-out confirm the company’s plans, but did note that it had an interest. “As for the space on Champs-Elysees you mentioned, we are still working to find out what we do with it.” Cook also touched on his love for France altogether: France has always had a special place for Apple. This is the best place to discover and chat with all musicians, graphic designers, designers or photographers who use our products. There is such creative energy.” Cook’s statement seems to imply that while the company secured the property, it hasn’t decided whether it wants to build a retail location or offices. Earlier reports suggested that the company wanted to do both, and a retail store does make the most sense given the commercial nature of that area. The interview then shifted to the production of Apple’s products amid pressure for the company to move some of it to the United States. Cook explained, however, that one thing often lost in the discussion about the location of factories is where the parts originate from: “In these debates on the location of factories, there is too much tendency to focus on the place where the product is assembled. When you open the product and look at the different components, you will see that the whole world is represented. We have 4600 suppliers in Europe, and we have already spent $ 11 billion on the continent.” Cook also touched on Apple’s ongoing tax battle in Ireland, again stating that Apple pays “more tax than any other company in the world.” “We pay more tax than any company in the world. We do not evade taxes. In our view, the law is clear. We have to pay taxes where we create value.” Last but not least, Cook touched on augmented reality and artificial intelligence, two areas he has praised multiple times in other interviews. Cook first notes that artificial intelligence technology such as Siri “makes the iPhone even better.” Concerning the falling sales of the iPhone, Cook pointed to the PC as an example of an industry that declined and later rebounded as technology advanced, and predicted the same for smartphones. “Look at what happened with the PC. If you come back in the 1990s and early 2000s, you’ll see that sales have gone down a bit, before you start again. The smartphone will take the same route. Innovative products always make a difference.” While in France, Tim Cook made surprise appearances at several Apple retail locations. More on that here. Today, Cook met with designer Julien Fournie, VizEat co-founders Camilla and Jean-Michel, visited the Apple Marché Saint-Germain location, and met with artist JR. Cook also sat down for lunch with media company Konbini. Video of that can be seen below: Thrilled to spend some time with the incredibly talented @JulienFournie, whose exquisite new collection was created with iPad Pro. pic.twitter.com/CTSI3Q96CK — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) February 6, 2017 Déjeuner with @VizEat co-founders Camilla & Jean-Michel.

(File photo |Reuters) BEIJING: Apple has finally halted the dream run of Xiaomi in China, the largest smartphone market in the world, edging the Chinese phone giant from the fourth slot by shipping nearly 45 million iPhones to the Communist nation, a report by market research firm IDC said. OPPO, Huawei, and Vivo lead other smartphone brands in China in 2016, latest International Data Corporation (IDC) Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker report said. "Xiaomi was China's hottest phone brand in 2014 and 2015, but it couldn't maintain the momentum in 2016," tech news portal CNET quoted IDC data as saying. Shipping 41.5 million smartphones, Xiaomi once known as 'the Apple of China', was the No. 5 brand in China last year. Apple, which took the fourth slot shipped 44.9 million iPhones to China (vs.58.4 million in 2015), the world's largest phone market, it said. "The big winner was Oppo, which shipped 78.4 million phones — more than double the 35.4 million it shipped in 2015. Huawei came in at second, shipping 76 million phones, while Vivo managed to almost double its shipments, going from 35 million in 2015 to 69 million last year," it said. "2016 was the first time ever that Apple saw a YoY decline in the Chinese market. Even though the new black coloured iPhones caught the attention of consumers, overall, the new launches did not create as much of a frenzy compared to the past," the IDC report said. "Despite the decline, IDC does not believe Chinese vendors have actually eaten away Apple's market share. Most Apple users are expected to be holding out for the new iPhone that will be launched this year, and that will help the brand to see a growth in 2017." "Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone will also likely attract some of the high-end Android users in China to convert to an iPhone," it said. Chinese market grew by 9 per cent last year. "Most brands are now using a combination of channels to increase their shipments. Xiaomi, previously focused on online channels, has opened more Mi Home stores to drive offline growth. Apple has also been aggressive in increasing its offline retail presence," it said. The top three Chinese brands grabbed a total of 48 per cent of the Chinese market last year. Jin Di, a research manager with IDC China, said another reason behind the success of Chinese brands was their willingness to share profits with distribution partners. Apple dropped from third in 2015 to fourth in 2016, as shipments to China plunged 23.2 per cent to 44.9 million units. Xiaomi was top in 2015, but fell to the bottom of the top-five vendors, with a 36 per cent plunge in sales in China. Total smartphone shipment volume in China rose 8.7 per cent to 467.3 million handsets last year. The IDC forecast that the volume in 2017 will continue to grow as consumers replace old phones, but that the growth will be slower than 2016. Worldwide, the top five smartphone vendors in terms of shipments last year were Samsung, Apple, Huawei, OPPO and Vivo.

The move came as a surprise to many as Apple hadn’t made it explicitly clear that the AirPods were capable of receiving firmware updates. Nevertheless, read on for how to check the firmware of your AirPods and update it… The process of checking and updating your AirPods is relatively straightforward once you realize it’s even a possibility, but Apple doesn’t make it very obvious as to how to start the process. To start off, you’ll want to head into the Settings app on your iPhone and tap the ‘About’ menu. You may think that you need to tap the ‘Software Update’ menu, but that’s not the case for AirPods, for whatever reason. Step 1 – Go to Settings > About From there, you need to have your AirPods nearby and open the case. The normal status/connectivity window will pop up, but you can swipe that away and look at the ‘About’ screen and scroll all the way the way down. Step 2 – Open the AirPods case and have them near your phone Once you scroll all the way down on the ‘About’ menu, you should see a new ‘AirPods’ option. From there, you can tap that menu and view more details about AirPods. Step 3 – Tap the new ‘AirPods’ section in the About menu From there, you’ll be able to see detailed information about your AirPods, including the model number, serial number, and hardware version. If you have the AirPods, your info should be as follows: Manufacturer: Apple Inc. Model Number: A1523 Firmaware Version: 3.5.1 Hardware Version: 1.0.0 Apple released version 3.5.1 to AirPods users last week, bringing performance improvements and bug fixes. It appears at this point that Apple will automatically update AirPods firmware when they are paired to an iPhone with internet connectivity. If for some reason the firmware doesn’t update automatically, you should be able to do so from this menu though. Check out a full video walk through of how to update and check AirPods firmware down below. What do you think of AirPods now that they’ve been available for a while?

Image: AP By Sohini Mitter2017-02-07 14:05:12 UTC India is one of Apple Music's 110 markets where it launched about two years ago. But only now is it getting serious about the culture-and-content-rich country.  SEE ALSO: Now you can listen to Apple Music, watch Sony LIV movies in your next Ola cab ride After late last year's roll-out of its student membership program that allows students to shop from Apple Music at less than a dollar, and a tie-up with India's leading taxi aggregator Ola to expand its reach and visibility, Apple is now spreading its wings in the country's vibrant artist community.  It has roped in a host of local musicians and content creators across indie and alternative music as well as mainstream Bollywood, and intends to be the platform that launches India's homegrown talent to the world.  Says Kavya Trehan, one of the collaborators, "As a new artist, to get amazing reach with Apple Music as it is a global platform, making it accessible for people as far off as Kenya or Egypt to experience my music is awesome!" Image: apple india Apple has also put in place teams that are curating localized playlists in India's regional languages.  The company believes that India is its natural home where customers are highly engaged and even the artists' community is very close to the audience. Its 'Connect' feature even enables musicians to directly reach out to their audiences.  While Apple doesn't give away country-specific numbers, globally, its music-streaming service touched 20 million paying customers at the end of 2016 — half that of rival Spotify. Incidentally, Apple is not the first music-streaming service to tap into the musician base. India's home-grown Apple Music rival, Saavn, runs an artist-in-residence program along with original content partnerships with diverse talent from movies and music.  Apple Music, however, has added another interesting dimension by reaching out to renowned Indian fashion designers, including Manish Malhotra and Masaba Gupta, who are curating their favorite playlists on the platform. The company believes that fashion and music go hand-in-hand and a designer's personal tastes tend to influence his/her designs.  Going forward there's a lot of work to be done on the payments front though. Apple Music presently allows only card transactions, something that does not go down well with mobile-wallets-and-cashback-crazy India, especially the student population that is largely without a credit or debit card.  Moreover, Apple's local rival, Gaana, allows seamless mobile wallet payments that are a hit with the youth. India is a unique music market and Apple is acutely aware of that. But right now its core strategy is hinged on localized content, that seems to be the order of the day for US entertainment players in India, Amazon and Netflix being the others.

Though Apple’s biggest rival already had an intelligent personal assistant, called S Voice, for a number of premium devices it launched in the past, the company decided to develop a more advanced voice assistant that would be a direct competitor to Apple’s Siri and Google’s Google Assistant. The move isn’t surprising at all, for Samsung bought AI and assistant system firm Viv late last year.  Viv is a company by people responsible for the creation and success of Apple’s Siri. Hence, many reports are putting emphasis on the idea that Bixby will be a strong rival against Apple’s famous voice assistant. Interestingly, it was found out recently that the new AI will be nowhere near the prowess of the established assistant in terms of the languages they support. According to ETNews, Samsung’s assistant will support seven to eight languages at launch. The range does not come close to the 20 supported languages of Siri.  Even though Bixby is no match to Siri in the language department, it is till going to impress several markets at launch because it supports more languages than Google’s Google Assistant, which was introduced along with the Pixel handsets. Google Assistant only supports five languages, namely: English, German, Brazilian, Portuguese and Hindi. As for Bixby, it is reportedly supporting all five languages plus Korean and Chinese the moment it is introduced at Samsung's big event, as per Phone Arena.  Related Stories Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumored To Source Batteries From Japanese Firm Edge-To-Edge Smartphone Displays — Explained Recent Samsung Galaxy S8 Leaks And Renders Rundown Bixby will have an integral role in the success of the Galaxy S8 on the market. The new AI assistant is seen as one of the selling points of the device, alongside the major redesign and new features that Samsung is stuffing into the phone. Making the most out of its virtual assistant, Samsung intends to incorporate the voice-activated feature to the S8 interface, individual apps and the Internet of Things to make it ubiquitous.  Meanwhile, Forbes pointed out the big differences consumers should expect from the Galaxy S8 when compared with its predecessor. The first and perhaps the most conspicuous difference is found on the design of the device. Independent leaks have since claimed that Samsung Galaxy S8 will sport an edge-to-edge display. The next difference lies on the processing power of the handsets. The new phone will house Qualcomm's most powerful processor to date, the Snapdragon 835. Finally, the larger battery is without a doubt another aspect that distinguishes the S8 from the S7. Are you excited for Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and its Bixby voice assistant?

Last year was a busy year for Apple, but it saw no major improvement on the previously reigning lightweight laptop. An upgrade is long overdue – and the tech giant might be intending to keep it that way. According to speculations and rumors abound the internet, a MacBook Air 2017 is not coming at all. There was no MacBook Air 2016 and there will not be a 2018 version either. Why? Because the Air brand no longer differentiates itself from other thin and lightweight Apple products such as the MacBook 2016 and the iPad Pro. The MacBook Air’s discontinuation has been the subject of talks in the industry for a long time now, but Apple has neither confirmed nor debunked any. However, hints of the brand’s impending demise keep on coming. Fans have enough reason to believe that it will not be getting a successor ever. from $760 – #Apple ###MacBook Mmgl2ll/a 12-inch Laptop Retina Display Rose Gold 256gb New 2016 https://t.co/W6vT7TRJ41 pic.twitter.com/4Vt1Du8r6b — Apple Freak (@ToshApple) January 28, 2017 Last year, the MacBook was updated with new internal specs and a Rose Gold color as announced at Apple’s Spring Event. During which, it was also revealed that the Air lineup’s minimum RAM will be bumped up to 8GB. It was no significant upgrade, but nevertheless, fans hoped that a new iteration with new hardware will be introduced at the Worldwide Development Conference in June 2016 or at the October Keynote Event. Both are already over and neither held a MacBook Air 2016 announcement, leaving fans dejected but still hoping for a successor. Now comes 2017 and rumors of the laptop’s downfall are stronger than ever. Apple has already stopped upgrading the iPad Air in favor of a smaller iPad Pro. Will it resign the MacBook to this fate as well? The MacBook has effectively kicked off the MacBook Air from the throne with its lighter and smaller build. Those who don’t need the power of the Pro and want convenience above all, now prefer the more compact and much more chic laptop instead of the perfectly okay Air variant. The MacBook Pro is also now a part of the competition as sleeker and lighter iterations are being released each year. Although much more expensive, the 2016 variant can pass off as a compact laptop – one that is powerful at the same time. [Image by Stephen Lam/Stringer/Getty Images] Then there’s also the iPad Pro, a phablet that’s being marketed as a laptop replacement. It’s undoubtedly handier than the MacBook Air, which begs the question, is there no place at all for a new Air in Apple’s lineup? There’s one reason – and only one – that may make the Air stay a little longer. It’s currently the least expensive among the aforementioned options. Serving as an entry-level Apple laptop, a new MacBook Air 2017 could target students and those taking the first step into the world of OS X. With the astronomical prices of the MacBook Pro, or even the iPad Pro, not everyone can afford to buy one. Keeping a cheaper alternative will allow the Cupertino-based company to reach out to more customers and to retain business with people looking to upgrade their laptops. With that said, there’s still a chance that a MacBook Air 2017 with higher specs and a few other changes could be announced at one of Apple’s upcoming events. There’s no telling, though, just how much of the current specs will be upgraded. Should Apple decide to release a new MacBook Air this year, or ever, at least the 13.3-inch variant is expected to be launched. It will most likely ditch the traditional USB port as what the MacBook Pro 2016 did, and refresh its processor. However, to keep it different from the MacBook 2016 and more affordable, a Retina display will probably not arrive in the Air at all.

Eric Jhonsa Feb 6, 2017 3:30 PM EST This article originally appeared on Real Money on Feb. 3, 2017. Rumors that Apple (AAPL) will eventually stop using Intel (INTC) CPUs within its Mac lineup in favor of internally developed, ARM-based chips have been around for several years. Though a recent Bloomberg report does provide a little grist for the mill, it's important to keep in mind what it does and doesn't say. Bloomberg sources state Apple is working on a new chip for future MacBooks that would handle their Power Nap feature, which allows current Apple laptops to do things like receive e-mails, sync calendar and contact data and update a system's location while in sleep mode. If plugged into an outlet, Power Nap can also download software updates and perform data backups. The move would follow Apple's integration of its ARM-based T1 chip in new MacBook Pro models. The T1 powers the Touch Bar, an OLED touch strip which provides different controls and functions from one app to another, found on the two most powerful Pro models. But those notebooks still rely on Intel's Core CPUs as their main processors, and the new chip responsible for Power Nap will also reportedly complement an Intel part. As Apple is undoubtedly aware, abandoning Intel would bring with it some big challenges. The company's macOS would have to be re-written to run on ARM processors. And developers would have to do the same for their macOS apps, at least unless they were run on emulation software that would result in a performance hit.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple could start production of iPhone 8 earlier than expected Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, February 7th, 2017, 05:42 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Processors, Rumor Apple could start production of its next-gen iPhone earlier than expected. Per BlueFin Research Partners, there’s “some indication” from the supply chain that Apple will ramp up production of the iPhone 8 starting in June, but that doesn’t necessarily point towards an earlier non-September release date. The report offers the following quote: The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms, although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8/X.[…] Interestingly, our present reads suggest a 300% increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9M. As a result, overall June quarter builds have increased from 45M to 48M, with the sharp increase in iPhone 8 offset somewhat by modest declines in legacy models. Given the radical design changes expected in the iPhone 8, it is unsurprising that the company may be planning to ramp up production earlier than normal, if the information BlueFin Research has shared is accurate. An earlier production date will give Apple time to improve yield rates and work out manufacturing issues, and could potentially lead to better supply when the iPhone 8 launches in September. The current rumors have it that the iPhone 8 will feature an edge-to-edge OLED display, possible curved angles for the display, as well as a glass backing that deviates from the aluminum body used since the iPhone 4s. It’s also thought that the handset will feature a Touch ID Home button built directly into the display. Other rumored features include some form of wireless charging,a faster, more efficient A11 processor, advanced biometrics like facial recognition or iris scanning, a new Taptic engine and 3D Touch advancements, and camera improvements. BlueFin Research also says Apple has adjusted iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone SE production downward as it begins preparing for the launch of the iPhone 8. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

(Pixabay - Image Courtesy) Shares74 Tue, 7 Feb 2017-07:22pm , Beijing , PTI The Chinese smartphone market grew by 9 percent last year. Apple has finally halted the dream run of Xiaomi in China, the largest smartphone market in the world, edging the Chinese phone giant from the fourth slot by shipping nearly 45 million iPhones to the Communist nation, a report by market research firm IDC said. OPPO, Huawei, and Vivo lead other smartphone brands in China in 2016, latest International Data Corporation (IDC) Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker report said. "Xiaomi was China's hottest phone brand in 2014 and 2015, but it couldn't maintain the momentum in 2016," tech news portal CNET quoted IDC data as saying. Shipping 41.5 million smartphones, Xiaomi once known as 'the Apple of China' was the No. 5 brand in China last year. Apple, which took the fourth slot shipped 44.9 million iPhones to China (vs.58.4 million in 2015), the world's largest phone market, it said. "The big winner was Oppo, which shipped 78.4 million phones more than double the 35.4 million it shipped in 2015. Huawei came in at second, shipping 76 million phones, while Vivo managed to almost double its shipments, going from 35 million in 2015 to 69 million last year," it said. "2016 was the first time ever that Apple saw a YoY decline in the Chinese market. Even though the new black coloured iPhones caught the attention of consumers, overall, the new launches did not create as much of a frenzy compared to the past," the IDC report said. "Despite the decline, IDC does not believe Chinese vendors have actually eaten away Apple's market share. Most Apple users are expected to be holding out for the new iPhone that will be launched this year, and that will help the brand to see a growth in 2017." "Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone will also likely attract some of the high-end Android users in China to convert to an iPhone," it said. Chinese market grew by 9 per cent last year. "Most brands are now using a combination of channels to increase their shipments. Xiaomi, previously focused on online channels, has opened more Mi Home stores to drive offline growth. Apple has also been aggressive in increasing its offline retail presence," it said. The top three Chinese brands grabbed a total of 48 per cent of the Chinese market last year. Jin Di, a research manager with IDC China, said another reason behind the success of Chinese brands was their willingness to share profits with distribution partners. Apple dropped from third in 2015 to fourth in 2016, as shipments to China plunged 23.2 per cent to 44.9 million units. Xiaomi was top in 2015, but fell to the bottom of the top-five vendors, with a 36 per cent plunge in sales in China. Total smartphone shipment volume in China rose 8.7 per cent to 467.3 million handsets last year. The IDC forecast that the volume in 2017 will continue to grow as consumers replace old phones, but that the growth will be slower than 2016. Worldwide, the top five smartphone vendors in terms of shipments last year were Samsung, Apple, Huawei, OPPO and Vivo.

Apple is already a strong proponent of USB-C, having moved to it aggressively with the new MacBook Pros in October, but the company also maintains Lightning for its iPhones and iPads — which creates a lot of headaches for people desiring universal accessories that work with everything inside the Cupertino ecosystem. Alas, after yesterday’s revelation of a new Ultra Accessory Connector (UAC), which is intended to ameliorate some of the pain of having both USB-C and Lightning devices, it looks like the dream of a USB-C iPhone will forever remain just that. The UAC connector is going to be used as an intermediary in headphone wires, splitting them in half so that the top part can be universal, and the bottom can be either a Lightning, USB-C, USB-A, or a regular old 3.5mm analog plug. The intent is to restore some of the universality of wired headphones — which, until not too long ago, all terminated in a 3.5mm connector (or 6.35mm on non-portable hi-fi models designed for at-home listening). With UAC, a headphone manufacturer can issue multiple cable terminations very cheaply, making both the headphones and any integrated electronics, like a digital-to-analog converter or built-in microphone, compatible across devices with different ports. Why this matters with regard to the iPhone’s sole remaining port is simple: if Apple was planning to switch its mobile devices to USB-C, it wouldn’t have bothered with creating a Made for iPhone standard for UAC. It would have just made the port change. The thing to replace Lightning won’t be another cable, it’ll be wireless charging and communication Now, even before today, there were a number of valid reasons for Apple to carry on with Lightning. You might not care about the fact that Apple makes money from licensing the technology, but Apple does, and Lightning remains a straightforward way to capitalize on the thriving iPhone accessory ecosystem. The Lightning connector is also a tiny bit smaller than the USB-C one, which might help with keeping device designs as thin and efficient as possible. And most important of all, Apple can exercise tight quality control over Lightning implementations, whereas USB-C is kind of a crapshoot. There’s a lot of invisible incompatibility among USB-C devices, which can be downright lethal for your laptop. On a related note, some readers have asked why headphone makers don’t just build USB-C cables and throw in Lightning adapter. Well, as much as we may all agree on USB-C being the primary future standard for wired connections, the fact is that USB-C devices are still quite rare. That’s especially true compared to Apple’s more than 900 million Lightning devices already out on the market. As an accessory maker, you want to sell to the market that already exists first, not the one that is to come. For Apple, moving to a USB-C iPhone would mean a great deal of upheaval for little payoff. The Cupertino company has its eyes set on total wireless freedom, and everything — Lightning, USB-C, UAC — that it’s working with today is just a temporary compromise en route to that goal. So no, a USB-C iPhone was probably never going to happen. But now that we have UAC to ease the switching between Lightning and USB-C music sources, even daydreaming about it seems silly. Instead, I might recommend grabbing a Google Pixel, which can be charged from the same USB-C charger that the MacBook Pro uses.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 08:41, Wed, Feb 8, 2017 | UPDATED: 12:39, Wed, Feb 8, 2017 GETTYApple is working on a revolutionary upgrade ahead of the iPhone 8 release date Apple is expected to pull-out all the stops for the next generation phone, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the iconic smartphone when it launches in mid-September 2017. The Apple iPhone 8, which some sources believe will be marketed as iPhone X, is rumoured to arrive with a dual-curved OLED display, new all-glass design, improved dual-camera set-up, and no physical Home Button – a first for the device. Earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at the scale of the blockbuster upgrade coming to the iPhone range later this year. And now another prominent rumour around Apple's upcoming smartphone plans has resurfaced. It's the rumour that refuses to go away, and now there is even more evidence Apple is actively investigating the possibility of making a flexible iPhone in the not-too-distant future. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 15 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button Flexible displays and pliable hardware are widely-tipped to be the future of smartphones, and it's clear that Apple does not want to be left behind when these devices become the mainstream. Backing up these reports, an official US patent application filed by Apple has emerged online. According to the document from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Apple is hard at work on "a flexing display that is moveable between a folded position and an unfolded position". This would allow the next-generation iPhone to ship with a large iPad-like display, which folds away into a footprint small enough to pocket. In its patent, Apple details how the unannounced iPhone would play host to "a sensor that detects whether the flexible display is in the folded position or the unfolded position." US PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE • PATENTLY APPLEThe US patent shows how the technology would work in a flexible smartphone design Using this, it adds it will benefit from "processing circuitry that automatically turns on the flexible display when the flexible display moves from the folded position to the unfolded position." Working in reverse, this technology will also turn-off the display when it’s re-folded. Showing just how far the technology needs to come, Apple’s latest patent filing stipulates that as well as a flexible display panel, the future phone will have to feature a flexible circuit board and a flexible battery with flexible battery cells.

The patent has also revealed that instead of metal, glass or even plastic, this phone’s body will be crated from fabric to make it more pliable. It states that the phone will feature “a fabric housing member that supports the flexible display, adding “the fabric-based housing structure comprises a layer of fabric on a rigid support structure.” Although Apple is known to be working on flexible phones, it’s believed that the iPhone 8 will come too early for the innovative technology. And while there may not be a flexible form on the cards, rumours suggest the iPhone 8 will include a dual-curved display that wraps around the edge of the device, like the award-winning Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8. HANDY ABOVERGLEICHThis concept artwork imagines the display curving around the device, like the Apple Watch HANDY ABOVERGLEICHApple iPhone 8 is expected to launch an entirely-new design To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, Apple will purportedly introduce a new all-glass design with a curved OLED display, facial recognition, and wireless charging. The Cupertino company is also expected to drop the physical Home Button from the front of the device. According to renown analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, the death of this iconic button will allow Apple to use an uninterrupted, single sheet of glass for the front of the device. Apple is purportedly looking to incorporate the Touch ID fingerprint sensor from the physical Home Button beneath the glass display. According to Kuo, the current system Apple uses for its fingerprint recognition will not work through an all-glass design. REDDIT • FLOCKMANN • CONCEPTSiPHONEConcept images reflect Apple's rumoured decision to drop the iconic Home Button Instead, Mr Kuo claims, the new fingerprint sensor will require optical sensors to read the print resting on the display. The complicated new display set-up, which presumably will still need to incorporate the pressure-sensitivity debuted with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, will require a number of new, custom solutions from the panel manufacturers. However the KGI Securities research report states that Apple has enough clout within the industry to get the system built ready for the new iPhone. Alongside the new fingerprint recognition technology, the iPhone 8 could also see Apple introduce facial tracking sensors into its flagship smartphone, Mr Kuo has claimed. These could be used to scan users' faces to help verify identification.

Play slideshow APPLE 1 of 24 One Night Campaign shot on iPhone Mr Kuo believes the fingerprint recognition system will "ultimately be replaced by a facial recognition system" in an effort to make the iPhone even more secure. "However, if the technical challenges cannot be overcome, we believe a combination of fingerprint and facial recognition is another possible solution," he writes. Elsewhere, Apple is reportedly looking to distance itself from the curved aluminium design language it has used for the past three generations of iPhone, first introduced with iPhone 6. With the Home Button gone, Apple can extended the display to the bottom of the phone – reducing the chunky bezels around the screen, and shrinking the overall footprint of the device. The new 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone is also expected to be modelled with an all-glass design, similar to the iPhone 4 and 4S. Apple is expected to debut its new industrial design language early next year with a refresh of its iPad range.

By Jordan Robertson. Added by Agency Staff on 7 February 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Chuck Robbins, Cisco, Facebook, Gartner, Google, Naresh Singh, SnapRoute Tweet Of all the lasting effects of Edward Snowden’s leaks, there’s one photo that leaves a particularly strong mark. In it, US federal government employees in t-shirts and blue jeans are seen intercepting network equipment from Cisco at a shipping facility. The feds in the photo, their faces obscured, were reprogramming the machines to spy on people’s activities. The image captured a deeply held paranoia within Silicon Valley’s biggest Internet companies: in an era of increasingly sophisticated nation-state hacking, how can we trust that network infrastructure isn’t compromised before it’s dropped off at the company loading docks? This fear has created a sense of urgency for Apple, Google, Facebook and other technology giants that have been devising their own alternatives to Cisco, which controls more than half of the market for network equipment. After the photo was published, Cisco filed a public complaint with the White House, arguing that spying by the National Security Agency was hurting US companies. Cisco said it doesn’t work with governments on back doors for its products and maintains tight checks on its processes and supply chain to assure customers of their security. While Cisco’s dominance isn’t in danger of slipping any time soon, the industry’s creeping concerns over cybersecurity have created an opening for new businesses and equipment-design skunkworks inside large companies. In the three years since the Snowden leaks, networking software and equipment startups raised US$6,4bn, a 47% increase over the prior three years, according to researcher CB Insights. “We’ve lost confidence in the vendors in the wake of the Snowden revelations, and that is a weakness and an opportunity,” said John Kindervag, a vice president at market analysis firm Forrester Research. One company that’s benefiting is SnapRoute, which was founded by a former manager of Apple’s global data centre network. The start-up makes a cheaper, simpler network switch than the ones Cisco sells. And unlike most switches, it’s open-source, allowing customers to look for bugs, performance glitches or back doors that might allow a government to peek inside. SnapRoute plans to announce a $25m round of funding on Tuesday from AT&T, Microsoft, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Norwest Venture Partners. The start-up counts Facebook among its customers. Facebook is also a founding member of the Open Compute Project, which develops and shares open-source data centre designs. It launched the project in 2011 after revealing details about a data centre it built in Prineville, Oregon using only Facebook-designed servers, power supplies and backup systems. Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft are now members. So is Cisco. It’s playing along with a potential competitor because Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins has said the company needs to be “part of every technology discussion that our customers want to have”. The high cost of traditional networking products was the main reason for Amazon.com’s investment into creating its own equipment. “It was cost that caused us to head down our own path,” James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished hardware engineer for Amazon Web Services, said at a conference in November. “Networking gear is really expensive.” Besides looking to save a lot of money on premium equipment, companies are placing a higher value on transparency. Cisco guards its code and designs, making them difficult to repair when things break. Bloomberg Businessweek reported in September that a Web hosting company filed for bankruptcy protection after a series of Cisco switches failed and a major customer left, while Cisco worked for months on a fix. Cisco has declined to comment on that case, saying only that it tries to fix problems quickly. By 2020, spending on open-source and self-built switches and other network technologies will account for at least 20% of the global data centre market, up from less than 2% last year, according to researcher Gartner. Big Switch Networks, Cumulus Networks, Pluribus Networks and SnapRoute are among the companies cultivating a niche that’s putting pressure on leaders Cisco and Juniper Networks and their proprietary code, said Naresh Singh, an analyst at Gartner. The giants are already under pressure from software-based networking alternatives like SnapRoute’s, and the adoption of open-source tools from mega users, such as Facebook and Goldman Sachs, poses an even bigger threat to their businesses, Singh said. Cisco said some companies baulk at using open-source network equipment, citing maintenance “complexity and hidden costs”. SnapRoute founder Jason Forrester said the idea for his start-up came from a key discovery he and his colleagues at Apple made when they began designing their own networking software and switches. Forrester (no relation to the market research firm) left Apple in 2015 but declined to talk in detail about his work there. “Switching wasn’t as hard as Cisco and others led customers to believe,” he said at SnapRoute’s offices in an industrial part of Palo Alto, California, located 16km from Apple’s campus. Switches from SnapRoute are $30 000 to $40 000 cheaper than comparable brand-name models, Forrester said. And whereas switches from Cisco and other big suppliers can have tens of millions of lines of code, SnapRoute’s has just 22 000, he said. This means fewer features, so SnapRoute may not be an attractive option for some companies. But the simpler code makes it easier for customers to sift through in search of hidden spying devices.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Reported with assistance from Ian King Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 22‘Please call me’ man hits back at Vodacom 8Set-top box dispute goes to arbitration 5ICT white paper a big risk to SA [podcast] 4Watch: Chaos erupts in parliament 3Uber CEO quits Trump advisory council Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

With the iPhone 8’s release date all but set for September 2016, analysts and Apple fans alike are closely monitoring any new leaks and speculations surrounding the upcoming flagship’s specs and features. From what could be determined so far, Apple’s iPhone 8 would truly be its best smartphone in years. Speculations about the specs and features of the iPhone 8 have long been emerging in the rumor mill, with numerous leaks and patents pointing to a revolutionary device unlike any smartphone that Apple has released so far. A Trusted Reviews report has summarized many of the iPhone 8’s rumored features, including an A11 Chip, a borderless OLED display, a laser sensor for gesture recognition, and an innovative 15-foot wireless charging feature. While Apple has yet to confirm any of these rumors, the consistency of the emerging speculations is quite noteworthy. Amidst these rumors and leaks, however, two particularly interesting specs and features of the iPhone 8 have managed to attract the attention of numerous Apple fans and mobile tech analysts alike. According to recent speculations, the iPhone 8 might end up being equipped with Qualcomm’s sixth-generation Snapdragon X16 LTE unit, since the chipmaker would most likely be Apple’s partner in the production of the iPhone 8’s modem. [Image by Jirapong Manustrong/Shutterstock] If the iPhone 8 really does come with a Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, the upcoming Apple flagship might very well be the king of mobile devices this year in terms of cellular connectivity. This is because Qualcomm has designed the Snapdragon X16 using a 14nm manufacturing process, which enables the modem to support fiber-like speeds through LTE Cat. 16. The X16 is a big step forward from the X12 modem utilized by the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5, which could only support Cat.6 LTE. Cat. 16 LTE in a smartphone would be no less than revolutionary. If the iPhone does end up being equipped with the Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, it would, at least in theory, be capable of downloading a full 4K movie (about 100GB in size) in just around 13 minutes. Blu-ray films, which average around 25GB per file, could be downloaded by the iPhone 8 in just around three to four minutes. Of course, the device’s actual download speeds would be dependent on the user’s cellular provider, but the premise of the iPhone 8 being a mobile data monster is a very compelling thought nonetheless. This is not all, however, as new rumors about the device have also emerged about the possibility of one of Apple’s newest innovations making its way to the iPhone 8, as reported by PC Advisor. [Image by Tsvetelin Dobrev/Shutterstock] New rumors about the iPhone 8 have suggested that the embedding of the Home button in the screen of the device would open up a lot of new possibilities for the upcoming flagship. With this in mind, there is a chance that the iPhone 8 might be equipped with a miniature version of the MacBook Pro 2016’s killer feature — Apple’s highly-acclaimed Touch Bar. This particular feature actually makes sense for the iPhone 8, since the rumored all-screen design of the device would be the perfect platform to implement the unique technology. A Touch Bar-totting iPhone 8 would definitely be a hit among dedicated Apple fans and everyday mobile users alike. After all, no device in the current market has implemented a similar feature for their flagships so far. Considering that Apple has every resource and technology to place a Touch Bar on the iPhone 8, there is a good chance that the upcoming smartphone would truly stand out from its competitors this year. The iPhone 8’s release date has not been confirmed by Apple, though speculations are high that the device would be unveiled at pretty much the same time its predecessors were released over the last few years. Thus, while unconfirmed, a September 2017 release date seems very likely. With the iPhone 8’s rumored specs and features in mind, however, September could not come any sooner.

Then came iOS 10, where Apple attempted to make the feature more ‘useful’ for apps that didn’t utilize 3D Touch in creative ways by adding the “Share This App” menu option to those apps. Because a lot of people don’t need or want to share their apps, and because it feels like unnecessary clutter to even have this menu option there in the first place, a new free jailbreak tweak called NoSharePlz by Olxios&Nico is now available in Cydia to remove it once and for all. Whether you’re using a device like the iPhone 6s/6s Plus or the iPhone 7/7 Plus and are using 3D Touch legitimately, or you’re using a tweak like Peek-A-Boo to enable 3D Touch menus on unsupported devices like the iPhone 6/6 Plus and earlier, these “Share This App” options are going to come up when you reveal the 3D Touch menu. After you install NoSharePlz, the option will be gone from all of  your 3D Touch menus on the Home screen. The tweak leaves you with only the menu options that are going to matter the most to you. Of course, if there would be no other options for a particular app, then you won’t see a menu at all anymore. The tweak will work on all iOS 10 devices that support 3D touch out of the box, as well as devices that are simulating the Home screen 3D Touch menu experience. If you’re interested in downloading NoSharePlz on your jailbroken iOS 10 device, you can do so today from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. There are no options to configure, so after installing the tweak, you’re ready to rock. Are you happy to see finally see a tweak that removes the “Share This App” option from the Home screen’s 3D Touch menus? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

There's an interesting theory that smartwatches are to the smartphone what wristwatches were to the pocket watch. Picture the way the average gentlemen used to have to rummage through his pocket for his watch prior to the 20th century - now skip forward 100+ years and the average smartphone user still has to dive into his/her pocket to check their phone. Read: The best smartphones: The best phone you can buy in 2017. The kicker now is that your smartphone holds far more information than a pocket watch ever did, yet all of which is still locked into your pocket. The theory behind smartwatches is not for you to make calls with and speak into, although some can do this, but instead they mainly provide a quick and easy way to check what notifications are on your smartphone, so you can decide whether it's worth delving into your pocket or searching around your bag to fetch your smartphone or not. Best smartwatch 2017 UK: What smartwatch do I need? There are two type of smartwatch around at the moment: Those with a colourful touchscreen like would find on your phone, and those which combine a regular analogue watch with smart features - we call them 'semi-smartwatches'. The latter we class as a semi-smart device and normally gives you information via a small LCD screen, LEDs or even smaller hands on the watch face. While a fully-fledged smartwatch can do a lot more, the juice guzzling screen results in a short battery life. Semi-smart watches benefit from longer battery life with some even having separate cells for the watch and smart features. If you're an Android user then an Android Wear smartwatch is the obvious choice but it's not necessarily the best for everyone. Google's OS tweaked for wearables also plays nicely with iOS but with cut down functionality so iPhone owners will get more from the Apple Watch. Others have an entirely different system such as Pebble's range of devices and some even work with Windows Phone like the Vector Watch. Samsung is sticking with its own Tizen, too, so there's something for everyone here. Also see: Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear will make all kinds of wearable devices better. Best smartwatch 2017 UK: What makes a good smartwatch? So when testing for what is the best smartwatch, the important factors to consider are how much of your smartphone's functionalities can it perform, and how well does it handle each task, the final attribute is obviously style - it's still bling after all. You'll also want to make sure it's compatible with your smartphone - some are only for iPhone or Android while others support most phones. Note that Android Wear now has iOS support but the experience is cut down in comparison. Some smartwatches use different software such as the Gear S3 which runs Tizen, Samsung's own OS - it's a legitimate alternative to Android Wear. See also: Android Wear 2.0 release date and new features. As is stands, you'll need to pick a watch with more limited functionality if you want long battery life while ones which can do all sorts will typically last a couple of days. Fitness fans will want to look for a device with a heart rate monitor and built-in GPS, although the heart rate monitors are often poor. We consider the important factors of a smartwatch to be level of notification detail, battery life, style, water resistance, compatibility with a range of devices/smartphones, plus additional features such as microphones and Wi-Fi support so you don't have to connect to a phone for full functionality. With very similar, if not identical, hardware on offer with many of the Android Wear smartwatches, a large part of the decision will come down to design and price. Best smartwatch 2017 UK: Smartwatch security warning According to a new report titled Friend or Foe? Your Wearable Devices Reveal Your Personal PIN, it isn't at all difficult for a hacker to figure out your PIN or password utilising motion sensor data from your wearable, with researchers getting it right around 80 percent of the time.  Their advice is for us to create a certain kind of noise data, or to input our PINs and passwords using the other hand. But we have to say, we do that anyway... at least those of us who are righthanded. We fix our watch strap to our left arm using our right hand, and enter our PINs and passwords using our right hand. Do you enter your password or PIN using your watch hand? Let us know in the poll below, and scroll down for our list of the 20 best smartwatches. Best smartwatch 2017 UK 1. Huawei Watch Rating: Reviewed on: 4 November 15 RRP: £289 inc VAT Although it's pricy, the Huawei Watch is best Android Wear smartwatch on the market with its absolutely stunning design and exquisite build quality. There's still work to be done though as the watch lacks GPS, the heart rate monitor doesn't work very well and the charger is bit fiddly. Read our Huawei Watch review. 2. Apple Watch Series 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 28 September 16 RRP: £369 inc VAT Buy from Currys The new Apple Watch Series 2 takes the main complaints about the original - slow operation, lack of GPS, lack of official waterproofing, short battery life - and solves or at least improves them systematically. If you're into fitness tracking with a sprinkling of notifications and superb integration with the iPhone, this is an almost perfect wearable for you... although, being greedy, we'd still like an even better battery life, and the price remains pretty steep. We thought long and hard about whether to give the Apple Watch Series 2 five out of five, and it was a close-run thing. But those two issues are still, just, keeping it from a perfect score. Great wearable, though, and the only one we've seen that feels like it has any chance at all of taking wearables into the mainstream. Read our Apple Watch Series 2 review. 3. Motorola Moto 360 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 21 December 15 RRP: From £229 inc VAT Buy from Motorola The new 2nd-generation Moto 360 is a decent smartwatch offering excellent build quality and hardware. The value is good if you avoid the extras on the Moto Maker but they are hard to resist. Battery life is fairly good and performance too apart from the odd moment. All of this is leading to a whole hearted recommendation, if only Motorola had made the one change we wanted – removing that flat tyre from the display. As much as we like the Moto 360, it's hard to look past this, as small as it may seem. Read our Motorola Moto 360 2 review. 4. Samsung Gear S2 Rating: Reviewed on: 21 January 16 RRP: £249 Based on our time with the Samsung Gear S2, we think it's a sleek smartwatch with an attractive design. It offers fairly standard smartwatch features like fitness tracking, but also includes some rather interesting features including a rotating bezel used for navigating the UI and enhanced app capabilities. At £249, it sits itself alongside the likes of the Moto 360 2, and we think the Gear S2 is a great, if not better option for Android users – especially with a custom, intuitive UI. Read our Samsung Gear S2 review. 5. Fossil Q Founder Rating: Reviewed on: 10 March 16 RRP: £259 Buy from Fossil There's no doubt that the Fossil Q Founder is a well-made and good looking Android Wear smartwatch which is also a competitive price. The hardware on offer is good, although some may miss the heart rate monitor and GPS. As much as we love it, the flat tyre effect of the screen is a big drawback stopping it being really great. Read our Fossil Q Founder review. 6. Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £349 Buy from Samsung The Gear S2 arrived on a deserved wave of hype, but for some reason we aren’t overly excited about this new Gear S3 Frontier. The only thing it actually adds is GPS, and at a £100 cost it’ll definitely put some people off. The reduced functionality when not using a Samsung phone is also a turn-off, despite the software being easier and more intuitive than Android Wear. The problem isn’t entirely the S3’s fault, it’s in the inherent limitations of smartwatches. You’ll always need a smartphone to finish the majority of tasks, and added to the fact that this is practically a repackaged Gear S2 means not much new ground has been broken. If you want a smartwatch and can afford to spend £349, this is the one to get. It just isn’t essential. Read our Samsung Gear S3 Frontier review. 7. LG Watch R Rating: Reviewed on: 7 November 14 RRP: £225 inc VAT Quite rightly, LG has decided to launch a round screen version of its first Android Wear device in the form of the G Watch R. It adds much needed style and class to the smartwatch and has an excellent round screen which doesn't have a section missing. It's a shame that it's more expensive than the Moto 360 but if you're going to spend £200, £25 isn't much extra. As long as you like the design of it over the Moto 360 which is down to personal taste. Read our LG Watch R review. 8. Asus ZenWatch 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 7 March 16 RRP: From £149 The Asus ZenWatch 2 is a great smartwatch, and is definitely a worthy upgrade from its predecessor. Under the hood, the spec boost definitely makes the difference when interacting with the watch, providing a snappy experience and should compete with watches £100-200 more expensive. Visually, its a huge improvement over its predecessor, with more ‘flavours’ of the smartwatch available with a number of specifically designed accessories. The Asus-branded software brings something different to the smartwatch, especially the FaceDesigner app that lets you create your own custom watch face from scratch. Read our Asus ZenWatch 2 review. 9. Motorola Moto 360 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 November 14 RRP: £199 inc VAT The Moto 360 is a fantastic smartwatch with excellent build quality, luxurious design and an affordable price tag. However, it's not flawless with one day battery life, a lower resolution screen which is tainted by the black section at the bottom. It will also be too big for some users. Despite the flaws, it's the best smartwatch we've reviewed to date but watch out for the LG G Watch R, Asus ZenWatch and Apple Watch. Read our Motorola Moto 360 review. 10. LG Watch Urbane Rating: Reviewed on: 17 July 15 RRP: £259 inc VAT There's a lot to like about the LG Watch Urbane with it's handy Wi-Fi connectivity and the welcome new version of Android Wear. Since it's essentially the same device as the G Watch R in terms of hardware, your purchase really hinges on the design. It is expensive and bulky so we can't see it appearing to the masses so the G Watch R is still our recommended choice. Read our LG Watch Urbane review. 11. Sony SmartWatch 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 January 15 RRP: £189 inc VAT The SmartWatch 3's biggest strength is its built-in GPS, but you'll still need a smartphone for driving directions. It's also great to see a standard USB charging port. The transflective screen is a good idea, but in practice battery life is no better than other smartwatches with better-looking screens. Ultimately, unless you're on a fixed budget, the G Watch R is the better choice. If you can't afford that, wait a few months: the price is bound to drop. Read our Sony SmartWatch 3 review. 12. Motorola Moto 360 Sport Rating: Reviewed on: 4 August 16 RRP: £186 inc VAT Available for under £200, the Motorola Moto 360 Sport is one of the best smartwatches for fitness. You get the some of the regular 360 style in a design which is practical for activities like running. The GPS tracking is accurate but it's shame the same can't be said of the heart rate monitor and we still find the 'flat tyre' on the screen an eyesore. A solid effort but hard-core fitness fans might need something which is more in-depth. Read our Motorola Moto 360 Sport review. 13. Withings Steel HR Rating: Reviewed on: 2 February 17 RRP: £179 inc VAT Buy from Withings If you’re not fussed about a full on touchscreen smartwatch, the Withings Steel HR is stylish, well-made and offers excellent battery life. We’re glad to see the addition of the heart rate monitor and the screen for smart features, even if they are basic. A great semi-smartwatch for the price. Read our Withings Steel HR review. 14. Microsoft Band 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 October 16 RRP: £199 inc. VAT It is very difficult to score the Band 2, because it is such a specific product with a unique feature set. But let's unpack it: it is definitely good value, as the combination of sensors and features is much greater than any comparable product at this price. And it is well made if not the last word in elegance, nor with perfect battery life. If you are looking for a GPS runner's or cyclist's watch it is a good one at a good price, and it also offers the productivity and sleep tracking. And if you want a smartwatch you will like what the Band 2 does, but you may hanker after the ability to compose and send messages. Simply, I don't. I like to wear my dumb watch, and I like for my phone to stay in my pocket rather than on my wrist. So for me the Band 2 is a winner. Microsoft has now discontinued its Band 2, though you might be able to find a bargain online. Read our Microsoft Band 2 review. 15. Apple Watch Rating: Reviewed on: 8 September 16 RRP: £269 Buy from Apple We can't help but think that Apple has tried to do too much with this first generation Apple Watch. There are so many ways of interacting with it and so many different features and elements to get used to that the learning curve is surprisingly steep. It takes a lot of getting used to, and at times it feels counter-intuitive, something we're not use to with Apple devices. That's why we'd struggle to recommend spending the £299 or more it'll cost you to buy this smartwatch. As is often the case, waiting for the second generation of the Apple Watch is likely to be a wise move, because Apple is going to learn a lot from this first generation smartwatch and from the customers and fans that are using it. Read our Apple Watch review. 16. Asus ZenWatch Rating: Reviewed on: 7 April 15 RRP: £199 The Asus ZenWatch isn’t the most impressive smartwatch we’ve ever used, but it’s not the worst either. It’s a very good-looking, stylish smartwatch – something that’s a rarity in the smartwatch industry. The lack of buttons is definitely an issue, especially with the touchscreen input being as frustrating as it currently is. It does however boast a decent battery life and enough sensors for you to shake a stick at. Ultimately though, when you put this up against similarly priced smartwatches like the Moto 360, it can’t compete. The Moto 360 has a button disguised as a crown which is used to turn the display on and off, as well an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts screen brightness dependent on your lighting conditions. Ambient light sensors are a feature that smartwatches need, but very few have. It also has an optical heart rate monitor that periodically checks your pulse in the background without being prompted to, and without a need to physically interact with the watch. With an almost identical RRP, we’d rather go for the Moto 360. Read our Asus ZenWatch review. 17. Pebble Steel Rating: Reviewed on: 23 October 14 RRP: £179 inc VAT The Pebble Steel may not have a high-res and colourful screen and the square design may not be for everyone, but we think it's stylish and the display has a retro charm which also provides excellent battery life. A good alternative to Android Wear if that's not your cup of tea. Read our Pebble Steel review. 18. Fossil Q Grant Rating: Reviewed on: 3 August 16 RRP: £165 inc VAT Buy from Fossil The Fossil Q Grant is easily the best looking and well made 'semi-smartwatch' we've reviewed. It's both stunning and affordable although the plastic back which shows is a shame. Smart features including customised notifications and activity tracking work well but are fairly basic and limited. Our main issue is the connectivity issues with Android. Read our Fossil Q Grant review. 19. Vector Watch Luna Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 15 RRP: £299 inc VAT It's good to see a company approaching the smartwatch differently and we like the design and style of the Vector Watch Luna. A month-long battery life is a real standout point but you'll have to be happy with the retro low-res display as a sacrifice. This is all acceptable but the device falls down when it comes to functionality with poor apps, fitness tracking and notification system. Things are improving over time with software updates but that's not really good enough at this price point. Read our Vector Watch Luna review. 20. Guess Connect Rating: Reviewed on: 16 August 16 RRP: £289 (41mm), £299 (45mm) Looks-wise we're not at all keen on the huge, chunky and ostentatious Guess Connect: the Fossil Q Grant has a far subtler and more elegant design, and is less likely to bruise your child's face when you're having a cuddle. But you may disagree, and if you can put up with - or are even charmed by - the Connect's brutal look, there's a strong feature set here to get your teeth into: it feels only a step or two down from a fully fledged smartwatch. With voice commands and the ability to pick up phone calls or have texts read to you, it's head and shoulders above the Fossil for sheer smartness. For features, this is probably the strongest semi-smartwatch we've seen: activity tracking is the only significant chink in its armour. If that's a priority for you, plump for the Fossil Q Grant - which you may want to do anyway because it's also a lot cheaper and (in our view) more attractive. Read our Guess Connect review.

Apple to replace 88,770 iPhone 6S faulty batteries in UAE Apple is helping users to check if their iPhone 6Ses are eligible to get a battery replacement. However, no other issues such as blasts or explosions have been reported yet.tech Updated: Feb 08, 2017 15:25 IST HT Correspondent Hindustan Times Apple is helping users to check if their iPhone 6Ses are eligible to get a battery replacement. However, no other issues such as blasts or explosions have been reported yet. Apple is somewhat facing what Samsung faced with the Galaxy Note 7 recenty around the world. Yes, it is facing issues with batteries of iPhone 6S sold in UAE or United Arab Emirates. According to reports, the iPhone-maker is now replacing a humongous 88,770 faulty iPhone 6S batteries that was causing the particular iPhones to shut down unexpectedly. The good news is that that there has been no reported incident of blasts or explosions. Read: Channeling Steve Jobs, Apple seeks design perfection at new “spaceship” campus A Gulf News reported quoted the UAE ministry of economy saying that Apple in a letter to the ministry had claimed that only specific phones that contained the defective battery manufactured between September and October 2015 in China will be recalled. Apple had announced its battery replacement program globally on November 30. UAE has also released an advisory via its consumer protection department which asks consumers to visit an apple website section (https://www.apple.com/ae/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) to help them determine if their phones’ battery needs to be replaced. The report also states that some users have experienced a sudden shutdown when the battery drops to between 50 and 60% and, sometimes, battery drains after attending each call. “If you have experienced this issue, please use the serial number checker below to see if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge,” Apple said. Read: The batteries are lithium-ion batteries, which have faced a growing number of problems over the past year. Apple previously replaced the batteries in the iPhone 5 in 2013, and Samsung was forced to issue massive globally recall of its Galaxy Note 7 in October of last year. tags Apple Apple iPhones Apple iPhone 6S iPhone 6S Samsung more from tech Your OnePlus 3 and 3T to have improved camera, smart Wi-Fi switcher and more Feb 10, 2017 21:08 IST GST Council will have to decide on Apple’s make in India demands, says govt Feb 10, 2017 20:51 IST Recommended for you Presenting sponsor co-sponsor partner India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Apple has continued its legendary ‘Shot on iPhone’ advertising campaign with a new commercial that focuses on the iPhone 7. Specifically, the video features a compilation of images and short clips captured in low-light settings. You can check it out here: We gave the iPhone 7 a 3.5/5 score in our review, praising its great screen, incredible performance, water resistance and, particularly, the excellent camera. Apple made a number of improvements with the iPhone 7 camera; for instance, a new six-optic lens was added, as well as optical image stabilisation for reducing blur (previously a ‘Plus’ model exclusive). There’s also a wider f/1.8 aperture, which helps with low-light performance: “If you’re taking photos in dingy restaurants or bars, or out and about at night, you’ll really appreciate it,” our reviewer wrote. And regarding the addition of OIS, we wrote: “This reduces the minor shakes and judders your hands make when holding a phone, which means there’s less chance of blurry shots in poor light – as long as your subject isn’t moving around, of course.” Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus was even more impressive, featuring a dual-camera configuration on the back of the phone, which included a telephoto lens and a wide-angle lens. Perhaps we’ll see the same configuration on the standard iPhone 8 (or iPhone 7S?) later this year.
