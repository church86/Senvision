Apple confirmed the acquisition exclusively to Fortune via telephone on Saturday, and provided the following statement via email: “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” There isn’t much information publicly available about Lattice, but according to the company’s CrunchBase profile, the startup was born out a Stanford research project called DeepDive. The company’s technology appears to use machine learning to parse through databases or the web to answer queries. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Lattice was co-founded by Chris Re, a professor of computer science at Stanford, and Michael Cafarella, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan. Cafarella was the co-creator of Hadoop, a widely used big data processing technology. Cafarella was also previously an engineer at telecommunications company TellMe Networks, which was bought by in 2007 for $800 million. According to this 2015 profile on Re, the professor’s Deep Dive program is able to understand “dark data,” which provides information within images or illustrations. The company’s technology is also similar to Google’s Knowledge Graph , which is the search giant’s technology that understands relationships between people, places, and things, and it provide answers to questions like “What’s the capital of California?” One source familiar with the matter said the acquisition price was between $175 million and $200 million. Lattice had raised an undisclosed amount of funding from Madrona Venture Group and GV, the venture arm of Google-parent Alphabet.

By: AP | Harrodsburg | Published:May 14, 2017 10:18 am Apple and Corning first teamed up 10 years ago when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered the plastic screen on the company’s first iPhone to be replaced with a scratch-resistant glass just a few months before the product was to launch. (Source: AP) Apple says it will invest $200 million in a rural Kentucky facility that it credits with rescuing the company’s signature smartphone from a design flaw that would have led to scratched screens. The California-based company announced it would give the money to Corning Inc. to use at its facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Apple and Corning first teamed up 10 years ago when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered the plastic screen on the company’s first iPhone to be replaced with a scratch-resistant glass just a few months before the product was to launch. Since then, Corning says it has made 552 million square feet (51 million square meters) of its Gorilla Glass product for iPhones and iPads, or roughly enough glass to cover 10,000 football fields. “All of that work happened right here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams told workers at Corning’s Harrodsburg facility on Friday. Williams said the money is the first of $1 billion the company plans to spend on US-based companies from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. “It’s only fitting that the first commitment from that fund be for Corning and specifically for Harrodsburg, where so much of our history is,” Williams said. Williams was joined by US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. Officials from both companies did not say if the money would bring more jobs to Kentucky, or if the state offered any tax incentives for the investment. Corning officials said the money would be used “to sustain” the 400 employees who work in Harrodsburg. Officials said the partnership between Apple and Corning has produced 1,000 jobs in the United States. It was the fourth major business investment in Kentucky this year. In January, Amazon announced it would spend $1.4 billion to build a worldwide cargo hub in northern Kentucky. Toyota has said it will spend $1.3 billion in its Georgetown plant that produces its flagship Camry sedan. And last month, Braidy Industries announced it would spend $1.3 billion to build an aluminum plant in eastern Kentucky. State taxpayers could pay nearly $100 million in tax incentives to those companies over the next 10 years if they meet projected goals with spending and job creation.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 14 May 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM In Silicon Valley, even mobile homes are getting too pricey for longtime residents by tracey lien Pavlick outside her mobile home in the Plaza del Rey park. She is leading a rent control campaign in Sunnyvale, California. — Los Angeles Times/TNS SUNNYVALE, California: During the last week of March, Apple reached a record market value of US$754bil (RM3.27tril), Google tweaked a policy to protect its US$22bil (RM95.60bil)-a-quarter advertising business and Yahoo inched toward closing a US$4.83bil (RM20.98bil) sale.  Meanwhile, Judy Pavlick drove around her Sunnyvale, California, mobile home park collecting plastic bottles and empty drink cans to save her future.  At a recycling rate of five to 10 cents a bottle, the 70-year-old's attempt to raise US$10,000 (RM43,455) to campaign for a rent control measure seemed like a long shot. But living in the heart of Silicon Valley – where rents keep soaring, outside interests are encroaching and protections for renters are scant – what else was she going to do?  "People are looking for somebody to save them, and they're not looking to themselves," said Pavlick, a retiree who has lived in the Plaza del Rey mobile home park since 1989.  The mobile home park sits on more than 65 acres of some of California's hottest real estate. Its 800 tidy modular homes are less than 2 miles from the campuses of Apple, Google, Yahoo and LinkedIn. One of the world's largest private equity firms, the Carlyle Group, bought the land two years ago for US$151.1mil (RM656.60mil). And in its first year owning the park, it increased space rents (the amount that homeowners pay to lease land) by 7.5% – the largest in Plaza del Rey's 47-year history.  Pavlick knows how this goes. She's not going to wait to be priced out. She's rallying her neighbours: Plastics. Cans. Put 'em out, now.  To live in the Bay Area is to face skyrocketing rents, threats of displacement and evictions. It's to hear about techies moving in, to hear about even techies being priced out. It's to watch glistening tech campuses go up as the gulf between those who make the tech and those who just happen to be here widens.  "When people think Silicon Valley, they think 'pot of gold,'" said Dorothy Niblock, 90, a Plaza del Rey resident who lives alone in the two-bedroom mobile home she designed with her late husband 44 years ago. "That doesn't really apply to us."  Most of Sunnyvale's dozen or so mobile home parks started as retirement communities, and nearly half remain that way. Plaza del Rey is now a family park, but its retirement roots linger: Seniors make up the bulk of its population.  Its monthly newsletter includes a calendar of activities such as Mahjong Tuesdays, Bridge Club Wednesdays and exercise groups four days a week. On Valentine's Day, there was a spaghetti dinner in the main clubhouse. On St Patrick's Day, it was corned beef and cabbage. "Please bring your own plates and utensils," the flier read. "We will be serving water, but feel free to BYOB!"  Many longtime residents have never thought of themselves as part of the Silicon Valley story. But sometimes, you don't get to choose.  The most recent tech boom created staggering job growth in the region, with real estate brokers estimating that firms such as Google and Apple now occupy around nine times the amount of land they did in 2005. The expansion of companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Microsoft – along with the tens of thousands of employees they attract – has also significantly increased demand for real estate in the area.  One-bedroom homes in the Sunnyvale area have gone from a median selling price of US$205,000 (RM890,827) in 2012 to more than US$445,000 (RM1.93mil) in 2017. Apartments have over the last four years seen double-digit rent increases. Teachers have been priced out of the school districts where they teach. Even lawyers have left the region in a huff. And as investors still keen to park their money in Silicon Valley look for ways to squeeze value out of what's already there, no property is getting a free pass – not even mobile home parks.  On her first day driving around the park, Pavlick collected 10 bags of bottles and cans. Total Value: US$40.  "Next Thursday, how about 20 donations?" she wrote to Plaza del Rey's Nextdoor community forum.  It costs only US$200 (RM869) to file the initial paperwork to get a measure on the ballot in Sunnyvale. But getting a ballot measure passed is more expensive and difficult, said Juliet Brodie, an attorney who represented the Mountain View Tenants Coalition in its successful push for rent control last year.  Proponents have to publish a notice of intent in local newspapers, get the ballot measure written, gather signatures of at least 10% of the city's eligible voters and win a majority of votes. Printing costs alone can push costs into the thousands of dollars.  "You can't just take a notepad and get signatures," Brodie said.  When Pavlick bought her home in 1989, she paid US$65,000 (RM282,457) plus US$356 (RM1,547) in monthly space rent, which also included water, garbage, sewage and cable. She was a business systems analyst, working for companies such as Memorex and Genentech. The park was close to her job, and its affordability meant that she could get a two-bedroom, allowing her to care for her late mother, who had Alzheimer's disease.  The original owners kept Plaza del Rey in the family for more than four decades until granddaughter Shereen Caswell sold it to Carlyle in 2015 (Caswell could not be reached for comment).  Today, Pavlick pays US$1,004 (RM4,362) for space rent, the result of incremental rent increases over nearly 30 years. Residents now cover the cost of all utilities, in addition to personal property taxes and the cost of maintaining their homes, patios and yards. On top of doubling the space rent increase in 2016 from previous years (residents have long paid increases of 3% to 4% a year, comparable to neighbouring parks), Carlyle raised the space rents for new residents to US$1,600 (RM6,952), nearly 40% more than the park average.  Earlier this year the firm offered residents a five-year lease that would cap rent increases at 4% a year, but only if they also agreed to sign a contract that would give Carlyle the right to make the first bid if a homeowner decided to sell. Carlyle declined to comment on the rent increases or its plans for the park after the five-year period is up. As of May, around 70% of residents have signed the lease. Those who have not signed might see rents increase to market value – Carlyle declined to define what this would be.  Mobile home owners face a "double whammy," according to housing lawyers, because unlike traditional homeowners, they don't own the land beneath their houses. That means they can't expect a windfall when they sell. Newer, larger mobile homes can go for as much as US$400,000 (RM1.73mil), according to local Realtors, but older homes in the park can sell for as little as US$120,000 (RM521,460). Recent space rent increases have hurt homeowners looking to sell because Realtors estimate that for every US$100 (RM434) increase in space rent, a home loses US$10,000 (RM43,455) in value.  And unlike renters, who can easily up and leave, mobile home owners are saddled with a house that is, despite the name, difficult to move. Some homes exceed 1,800 square feet, with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms. Many are brought into the park in pieces and built on site. Taking apart and transporting a mobile home can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Putting one back together can cost even more. And once a home has been uprooted, homeowners have to find a new space for it.  "Just move, just move," said Pavlick, mimicking those who believe that the solution to her problem is to leave. "Move where?"  Mobile home parks have traditionally been mom-and-pop operations. But as the value of land in Silicon Valley soars, a growing number of institutional investors have been eyeing its undervalued lots.  That includes private equity firms. Private equity investors typically snatch up struggling or undervalued businesses and find ways to increase their value – either by investing resources to beef up the business or cutting costs to improve the bottom line – then reselling them at a profit.  Carlyle spokesman Randall Whitestone told the Los Angeles Times that the publicly traded Washington, D.C., firm, which has US$162bil (RM703.97bil) in assets under management across industries such as health care, aerospace, real estate and financial services, has been buying up mobile home parks because they're "less volatile than many other asset classes."  "We like to buy in locations where there are good supply-demand fundamentals and economic strength," Whitestone said.  Because of zoning rules, there is little chance that Plaza del Rey will one day become a tech campus. But there are other ways to raise the value of the park.  Investors can upgrade a park before they sell it. Although Carlyle declined to comment on its long-term plans for the park, Whitestone said it has "made significant capital investments to materially improve the property for residents."  Another way is to increase the rent.  Plaza del Rey is, to the dismay of many longtime residents, an ideal investment for Carlyle. In a place like Silicon Valley, where tech salaries are among the highest in the country and the housing market is among the most competitive, it won't be hard to find someone willing to pay US$1,600 (RM6,952) or more for space rent. And according to private equity experts, it doesn't matter to Carlyle who that someone might be.  "They won't care if it's seniors or young people," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "Their challenge is to turn something they bought for US$100mil (RM434.55mil) into something that's worth US$300mil (RM1.30bil). That's the end game for a private equity fund."  This gives Carlyle reason to fear rent control. Any caps to rent increases would not only limit the park's near-term profitability but also potentially reduce its future resale value, which is where private equity firms make most of their profit.  And that's why Carlyle sent its managing director of US real restate, Dave Kingery, to a Sunnyvale City Council meeting in January to argue against rent control.  "We do not believe it furthers the objectives of the city, the residents or the owners in the long term," Kingery said at the meeting.  The firm's annual earnings reports spelled it out more plainly: Under the "risks" heading, which details all the things that could hurt Carlyle's business, the tenth bullet point reads "changes in government regulations (such as rent control)."  Depending on who you talk to, rent control either always works or it never works. It's the answer to the housing affordability crisis. It's the reason that homes are so expensive. It will deter developers from creating more housing stock. It will keep people in their homes. It has never solved a city's problems. It's the answer to residents' prayers.  Although Silicon Valley communities have either resisted or been slow to develop new housing to accommodate the influx of workers the region has attracted over the years, Sunnyvale has one of the strongest track records in California when it comes to building affordable housing. About 10% of the units in its development pipeline are affordable housing units.  But it's also one of the few cities in Silicon Valley that doesn't have rent control, either citywide or specifically for mobile home parks, and its City Council has shown a reluctance to entertain the thorny issue.  "The problem I have is there are a lot of loopholes in rent control, and we're going to have a lot of lawsuits the moment it goes through," council member Michael Goldman said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.  The neighbouring city of Mountain View, which passed a voter-approved measure in November, was slapped with a lawsuit from the California Apartment Association seeking to block the measure from being enforced immediately after the election. A Santa Clara County judge in April denied the request for an injunction, clearing the way for the city to go ahead with its rent control rollout.  "This is a free country and anybody with a filing fee can file a lawsuit," said Brodie, the attorney who helped Mountain View get rent control. "If we allow that to prevent us from making good policy, that's just not reasonable."  For housing advocates, rent control is good policy. For opponents, it's a Band-Aid solution. Rents are high, they argue, not just because landlords can charge whatever they want, but because Silicon Valley became a global tech mecca faster than its cities could handle it. How do you solve that?  "There are no bad guys in all this," Goldman said of Carlyle and Plaza del Rey. "When I see people saying 'It's really expensive for me,' I say if you're not working in high tech, which requires you to be here, why are you here? If you're here, you're making a decision every minute you're here that the cost of being here is worth it."  There are tech industry workers who live in Plaza del Rey – employees of Apple, Google, Oracle and local startups. They're increasingly feeling the squeeze too.  Despite making a six-figure salary working in information technology, a traditional home was out of reach for Bay Area native Ron Van Scherpe, 45. Having a young family, he didn't want to rent anymore. So he and his wife did what they thought was the next best thing: They bought a three-bedroom home in Plaza del Rey.  When they moved in 12 years ago, their combined mortgage and space rent was only US$2,150 (RM9,342). Today, it's US$2,600 (RM11,298), which is still more affordable than the rent on a one-bedroom Sunnyvale apartment. But if the space rent keeps climbing, at some point they'll be no different from renters.  "The tech industry is displacing the middle class," said Van Scherpe, who has signed up to help Pavlick in her rent control effort. "We're going to give it two years with this rent control issue, and if it doesn't look promising, we're going to have to relocate by the end of five years."  He and his wife are considering Austin, Texas. He worries that it will be hard on his kids, though. Their grandparents live here.  On a recent Thursday morning, Pavlick drove around Plaza del Rey with her neighbours Patrick and Karen Garcia picking up heavy glass bottles of Perrier and empty cans of Coca-Cola.  "Someone must have had a party," Karen Garcia said.  At the recycling facility, they traded the goods for US$46.55 (RM202.28).  Pavlick frowned. "I thought we'd get more from those heavy bottles," she said. "But it's more than last week."  "Enough to pay for a third of an hour with an attorney!" Garcia joked.  Pavlick did the math in her head. If Plaza del Rey averaged US$40 (RM173) in recycling a week, and the dozen or so mobile home parks in Sunnyvale also got involved and raised US$40 (RM173) a week, they could collectively raise everything they needed in less than six months.  She currently has around 115 people from Plaza del Rey and neighbouring parks working with her. In the coming weeks she hopes that more people will put out their recycling, knock on doors and, eventually, campaign for rent control.  It's a long shot: a few dozen mobile home park residents trying to stop a private equity firm from upending their lives. But Pavlick likes to say aloud: "Carlyle has the money, but we have the people."  Now she just needs those people to knock on doors, push for rent control and fight for their future – one plastic bottle at a time. — Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Airlines fret about laptop ban from Europe during peak season Can technology make your kid fat, dumb, and mean?

The announcement comes a week after Tim Cook told CNBC about the $1 billion fund to spur jobs.More Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) said Friday that Corning (NYSE: GLW) will receive $200 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to promote technology-driven manufacturing jobs in the United States. The announcement came a week after Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer in an exclusive interview about the $1 billion fund to spur jobs. ( Read the full interview here .) Corning is the first recipient of the fund. The fund is the tech giant's latest effort to show how it is creating jobs as President Donald Trump pressures American companies to hire U.S. workers. Apple said the investment will support Corning's research and development, capital equipment needs and glass processing. Corning has manufactured touchscreens for Apple's iPhones. "Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple's long-standing suppliers," Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said in a statement. "This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America," he said. "We're extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices."

The company’s worldwide developers conference which takes place every June and is usually focused on announcements of products and services targeted at developers, has, in the past, also been home to the introductions of some of Apple’s more notable ‘commercial,’ consumer offerings … … and according to KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, this year will not only see the Californian firm introduce a new 10.5-inch iPad, but a smart speaker powered by the company’s ever-so-sassy assistant – Siri. “In our April 28 Insight report (“Apple’s first home AI product to see cyclical shipments of over 10mn units; main competitor is Amazon Echo”), we offered estimates for the new home AI/ Siri speaker line,” Kuo said, as the analyst explained that the research firm also believes this new product will “come with a touch panel.” Apple has long been rumoured to be working on a new Siri-powered product, as its once dominate virtual assistant begins to lose ground to the likes of Alexa, Cortana and Google Now … and the addition of a touch interface on the rumored new offering -whilst arguably not needed in a voice-driven environment- could ultimately work to win over already familiar iPhone owners, as iPad sales continue to decline … WWDC17 will take place at San Jose’s McEnery Convention Center from June 5-9. / Image Credit: Source Continue Reading You may also like... iBooks Offers Up Fiction for £1.99 Or Less, (incl. #Rotherweird + More) UK’s National Health Service Hit By Cyber Attack Here’s What You May Have Missed [9/5-11/5] Apple Begins Countdown To ‘Alien: Covenant,’ Drops Previous Titles To £3.99 HD Related Topics:Alexa, Apple, Cortana, Dev, Developers, featured top, Google, Google Now, iOS, iPad, iPhone, June, Ming Chi Kuo, Report, Rumour, Siri, Smart, Software, Speaker, Speculation, SW, Worldwide Developers Conference, WWDC, WWDC17 Arron Hirst In an attempt to merge the worlds of music, design and journalism, Arron is perhaps best known for founding online news brand: RazorianFly; a hobby which grew to attract a monthly audience of 120K.

Ingrid Lunden, reporting for TechCrunch: Apple has picked up Lattice Data, a company that applies an AI enabled inference engine to take unstructured, "dark" data and turn it into structured (and more usable) information. We've heard from a single source that Apple has paid a price of around $200 million. The deal was closed a couple of weeks ago, the source said, and about 20 engineers have joined the larger company. A lot of data analysis in general, and "big data" in specific, has to do with the analysis of structured data: nice, orderly tables all stacked up in neat rows and columns. Unstructured data is everything else. So, almost like sifting for gold once all the easy-to-pluck nuggets have been harvested, extracting value from "dark data" has traditionally been much harder. But now we have artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI and ML have become huge buzzwords in the tech industry since last year, when several prominent companies took to their keynote stages to act like they'd just invented the terms. Apple's been using ML and AI for years in everything from Siri to battery life management. What the company does with "dark data" will be interesting to see. Any guesses?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Reports Second Quarter Results CUPERTINO, California — May 2, 2017 — Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended April 1, 2017. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $52.9 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.10. These results compare to revenue of $50.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 65 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum of our Services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter. Looking ahead, we are excited to welcome attendees from around the world to our annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month in San Jose.” Apple also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the Company’s program to return capital to shareholders and is extending the program timeframe by four quarters.  Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion by the end of March 2019. “We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.5 billion and returned over $10 billion to our investors in the March quarter,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Given the strength of our business and our confidence in our future, we are happy to announce another $50 billion increase to our capital return program today.” As part of the latest update to the program, the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced a year ago. The Company also expects to continue to net-share-settle vesting restricted stock units. The Board has approved a 10.5% increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, and has declared a dividend of $0.63 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017. From the inception of its capital return program in August 2012 through March 2017, Apple has returned over $211 billion to shareholders, including $151 billion in share repurchases. The Company plans to continue to access the domestic and international debt markets to assist in funding the program. The management team and the Board will continue to review each element of the capital return program regularly and plan to provide an update on the program on an annual basis. Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 third quarter:   revenue between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent operating expenses between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion other income/(expense) of $450 million tax rate of 25.5 percent Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2017 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on May 2, 2017 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The speakers who came on stage during keynotes had stylish hair. "Do they have dressers backstage?" an attendee asked a group of us when it was all over. Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Build exists to get developers excited. The biggest devs blow upwards of $US2000 ($2709) for a three-day pass to the event, where they have unlimited drinks, plentiful meals and access to Microsoft's best and brightest. Part of Microsoft's wooing process involves appearing "hip" to a group of developers who resemble the cast of Silicon Valley in all the worst ways. Hence the light show and Microsoft EVP Terry Myerson's questionable hoodie and leather vest combo. It wants these devs so amped that they will rush back to their MacBook Airs and Surface Books to crank out brilliant software, hopefully for Microsoft's Windows Store, which has just one third of the apps of much cooler stores from Google and Apple. With the arrival of Windows 10 S, which can only use apps from the Windows Store, the app marketplace has never been more important than today. Yet time after time over the course of the event, Microsoft dropped the ball on its pitch to developers in favour of niche distractions. Apple's a monolith of money and users, and thanks to Android and Chrome OS, Google is right there with it. Both have OS platforms with heavily used app stores. They have built customer bases of hungry fans that enthusiastically embrace their hardware and software products, and consequently, developers want to build apps that work with Apple and Google platforms. Microsoft, on the other hand, can't seem to ditch the buttoned-up association it's developed for making the work computer you don't want to use. Its reputation is seemingly forever cemented by those old Mac vs PC commercials. Attempts to rewrite the script have been met with mixed success. On the hardware side, Microsoft has become a genuine player in the field of coveted kit. The Surface Pro and Studio are ambitious devices that are legitimately exciting. The Surface Laptop announced earlier this month is one of the most interesting products announced so far this year. But Microsoft's software landscape is still dorktown and one of the big ways Microsoft's attempting to undorkify things is by leaning into the Windows Store. There's a problem though. Microsoft's app store in uncommonly small compared to the other guys. According to Microsoft, in 2015 there were just 669,000 apps available. (The company hasn't officially updated that number since.) According to Statista Apple and Google both have more than three times that number of apps available in their stores. The number of available apps alone doesn't necessarily dictate the quality of someone's computing experience, but it remains a common metric for success, and if Microsoft wants to look cooler in the software space, it needs a big awesome app store full of big awesome apps. Microsoft stunned the audience of Build when it announced iTunes was coming to the store just a week after announcing Spotify's arrival. Those are two hugely important apps, and you could feel the energy in the keynote after the announcement. Developers and press looked at one another, baffled and delighted. An Apple app would appear in the Windows Store! Then Microsoft immediately squandered that excitement. The rest of the focus both on stage and later in the "Hub," the primary showroom for the conference, wasn't on the cool apps traditional users might want, but on the deeply nerdy niche stuff. During the keynote itself, Microsoft glossed over the lifestyle apps to focus on Autodesk and Linux. Autodesk was up on stage to announce that Autodesk Stingray was headed to the store. Stingray is an engine used to build things in 3D and is almost exclusively used by 3D artists and engineers. After that announcement, Microsoft followed up with the news that Linux was coming to the store. If you're excited about the Linux distributions Ubuntu, Suse and Fedora arriving to the Windows Store, know you're uncommon. It's big news for developers, but meaningless to people who would normally seek out apps on an app store in the first place. Site of the Build keynote. There are lots of blue lights and...fog? Given Microsoft's enthusiasm for the store, it was weird that the company's newly announced operating system, Windows 10 S, which can only get apps through the store, was mostly absent from the conference, apart from a few mentions during the keynote. You couldn't find it anywhere on the show floor, where developers mingle with Microsoft personnel. Nerd city. The Store booth had a lone TV screen with a rep standing in front of it — and that rep had not been briefed on Windows 10 S. In fact, it seemed no one had. Every Microsoft rep I asked seemed bewildered by Windows 10 S questions. They could say it was "exciting" but they had no spiel ready for why it was exciting, nor why the Store was crucial to its success. And no one could explain what, fundamentally, might have changed about the Windows Store to make it an appealing avenue for app launches after a five years of sluggish adoption. Even app developers that were bullish about the platform were frustratingly vague about what was different now compared to when the Store launched in 2012, and why Windows 10 S would not go the way of its failed store-focused predecessors Windows RT and Windows 8.1 with Bing. Christoph Teschner and Michael Simmons were positively giddy about Windows 10 S when I sat down with them in a high-rise hotel near the conference. Both men are employees of Algoriddim, and were in Seattle because their app, DJay Pro, had just received the App Creator of the Year award. "I think that's the future," Simmons said of the Windows App store. Teschner pointed to his own youth, growing up with Apple's app stores for Mac and iOS and how it had prepared him for the Windows Store. "People are used to app stores now," he said. "It felt sort of natural to me when I first got my Windows Store." Though they were reluctant to give exact numbers or concrete evidence of a successful Windows Store launch, Simmons said "Windows fulfilled our expectations." He praised the development process in particular. "Seeing developer tools ten years ago, it's a total leap today. It's an evolution and we're in the middle of it." Neither man could give a concrete reason for why they felt Windows 10 S had a chance to succeed when its predecessors failed so badly, but sitting in a room and soaking up their optimism it was hard not to be swayed a little. And it's that kind of optimism for app developers that Microsoft will need if it hopes to actually fill the Store with cool apps. If those men had been on the show floor, showing off their app and talking up their own experiences with developing for the store, Build might have actually projected the image Microsoft desperately needs. But Microsoft is still figuring it out. It has ditched the pocket protector, but it's still not cool. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments soldant @soldant May 14, 2017, 11:48am Honestly I think MS allowing you to upgrade out of Windows 10 S for free is an admission that it isn't going to do well. Almost nobody wants Windows Store apps - most of them are served by better quality desktop apps or by a browser tab. The Windows Store can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be an answer to iOS/Android apps (and that market clearly has no room for a third competitor) or a replacement for desktop apps (where it routinely fails). Basically, it's just an alternative to options that frankly work better. The cynic in me sees it as an MS attempt at ultimately pushing towards a closed platform in the consumer market - but that didn't work for Apple with MacOS and it's got no hope in hell of working here. Reply 2 lee978 @978lee May 14, 2017, 4:40pm Microsoft are looking enviously at Apple & Android App Stores. The control this gives them, as well as the data and the revenue is serving them well. However much of Microsoft appeal is the fact you don't have to use their App store. The privacy this gives users, the flexibility, user control and potential cost savings is part of Windows appeal. Take this away and they will lose customers. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion! Cancel Reply Log In / Sign Up Name Email You are starting a new discussion.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Apple Apple may introduce new Siri speaker and edgeless 10.5-inch iPad Pro at WWDC Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 13th, 2017 at 5:35 PM Share Tweet With rumors regarding some new Apple hardware swirling overhead, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo put out a new research note reaffirming his belief that Apple will introduce a new piece of Siri-based hardware next month at WWDC. As for the design, Kuo maintains that the device will offer a premium auditory experience and will include a “touch panel”, a design tidbit that Apple executive Phil Schiller seemingly suggested was in the works during an interview last week. It remains unclear, though, if said “touch panel” will be a full-fledged display a’la the Amazon Echo Show or if it will be more minimalistic. Price wise, Kuo anticipates that Apple’s upcoming Siri speaker will be more expensive than the Amazon Echo Show’s $229 price tag. Don't Miss: Apple’s iPhone 8 will be the most expensive iPhone the world has ever seen Kuo’s note, originally spotted by AppleInsider, adds that a new Siri speaker may not be the only new piece of hardware Apple rolls out at WWDC, which is slated to kick off on June 5 in San Jose. Specifically, Kuo says that there’s an even greater chance that Apple in a few weeks will introduce a newly designed 10.5-inch iPad Pro with extremely thin bezels surrounding the display. Per the rumor mill, Apple’s new iPad Pro will feature a larger display but will have a form factor similar to Apple’s 9.7-inch iPad, a design made possible by shrinking the bezels. And while it’s perhaps too soon to say, it’s entirely plausible that the long-rumored 10.5-inch iPad Pro will give us a firmer grasp on what the mythical iPhone 8 design is going to look like. Spec wise, previous rumors regarding Apple’s 10.5-inch iPad Pro have intimated that the device will be powered by a A10x processor. There have also been scattered reports claiming that Apple’s new iPad Pro will sport a stationary home button a’la the iPhone 7. While we wouldn’t go so far as to say that the rumored iPad Pro referenced above needs to be a mega-hit, there’s no denying that iPad sales have been in a free-fall for years on end. During Apple’s March quarter, for example, iPad sales fell 13% year over year. That aside, Tim Cook remains enthusiastic about the future of the iPad. “We’ve got some exciting things coming on iPad,” Cook said this past February, “and I’m optimistic about where things are headed.” Perhaps a brand new twist on the iPad design will be just the tweak Apple needs to see growth return to its beleaguered iPad lineup.

Apple says it will invest $200 million in a rural Kentucky facility that it credits with rescuing the company's signature smartphone from a design flaw that would have led to scratched screens. The California-based company announced it would give the money to Corning Inc. to use at its facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Apple and Corning first teamed up 10 years ago when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered the plastic screen on the company's first iPhone to be replaced with a scratch-resistant glass just a few months before the product was to launch. Since then, Corning says it has made 552 million square feet (51 million square meters) of its Gorilla Glass product for iPhones and iPads, or roughly enough glass to cover 10,000 football fields. "All of that work happened right here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you," Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams told workers at Corning's Harrodsburg facility on Friday. Williams said the money is the first of $1 billion the company plans to spend on US-based companies from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. "It's only fitting that the first commitment from that fund be for Corning and specifically for Harrodsburg, where so much of our history is," Williams said. Williams was joined by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. Officials from both companies did not say if the money would bring more jobs to Kentucky, or if the state offered any tax incentives for the investment. Corning officials said the money would be used "to sustain" the 400 employees who work in Harrodsburg. Officials said the partnership between Apple and Corning has produced 1,000 jobs in the United States. It was the fourth major business investment in Kentucky this year. In January, Amazon announced it would spend $1.4 billion to build a worldwide cargo hub in northern Kentucky. Toyota has said it will spend $1.3 billion in its Georgetown plant that produces its flagship Camry sedan. And last month, Braidy Industries announced it would spend $1.3 billion to build an aluminum plant in eastern Kentucky. State taxpayers could pay nearly $100 million in tax incentives to those companies over the next 10 years if they meet projected goals with spending and job creation. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website five  ×   =  forty five Over the past five years, the Apple dividend yield has quietly become one of the best reasons to own the stock. However, the Apple dividend yield hasn't gotten much attention because it has never gone much higher than 2% since Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) brought it back in 2012. And with Apple stock trading near all-time highs at $156.42, the current AAPL dividend yield is just 1.62% despite last week's 10.5% boost. It's still short of the Standard & Poor's 500 average yield of 1.94%. But, as with many things Apple, appearances can be deceiving. For example, the annual Apple stock dividend payout of $13.22 billion is now the highest in the world, surpassing the $12.77 billion of Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM). And while Apple has raised its dividend every year since 2012, the Apple stock price has simply outpaced the rate hikes. Yield decreases as a stock price rises, and AAPL stock is up nearly 90% over the past five years. The modest Apple dividend yield has disguised just how much value the Apple dividend has added for those who hold AAPL stock. While the stock alone is up just over 100% over the past five years, the total return – which includes the dividend payments – is nearly 170%. As impressive as that is, it merely foreshadows what Apple investors can expect in the future. That's because even though it's the biggest on the planet by dollar value, Apple's dividend has tons of headroom… Why the Apple Dividend Yield Has a Lot of Room to Grow The 10.5% Apple stock dividend increase brings it to $0.63 a share per quarter, or $2.52 per share annually. But because Apple is such a cash machine, that payout is far below what Apple can afford. The company's earnings per share are expected to be close to $9 for fiscal 2017 (which closes Sept. 30 for Apple). Don't Miss: You Can Profit from the Same Trend That Drove U.S. Stocks Up 1,262% in the 80s and 90s That means Apple's payout ratio – the proportion of earnings paid out in dividends – is only 28.1%. If you look at the table below of the 10 companies in the S&P 500 with the highest annual dividend payouts, you'll see that Apple stands apart from its peers in both categories. Company (Ticker) Payout Ratio Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) 28.1% 1.65% $13.22 billion Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) 78% 3.73% $12.77 billion Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) 51.7% 2.27% $12.06 billion AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) 67.1% 5.09% $12.04 billion Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) 60.9% 4.95% $9.41 billion Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) 47.4% 2.73% $9.12 billion General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) 58.9% 3.31% $8.38 billion Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) 95.4% 4.06% $8.18 billion Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) 50% 3.82% $7.62 billion JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) 30% 2.30% $7.14 billion The 10 Largest Annual Dividends in the S&P 500 Most of the other top dividend-paying companies have payout ratios in the 50% to 60% range, almost twice Apple's. In other words, the Apple stock dividend could double and still leave the company plenty of room for future increases. Since 2012, Apple has raised its dividend each year. But more importantly, the company has promised to continue doing so – most recently in Apple's Q2 earnings conference call last week. Income investors love stocks that consistently raise dividends every year, which will broaden Apple's appeal even further. And given what we know about Apple's business and commitment to returning cash to shareholders, the only questions about future Apple stock dividends are how large they'll be and how much they'll amplify total returns. In addition to the low payout ratio, here are three reasons growth of the Apple stock dividend will accelerate in the years ahead… What to Expect from the Apple Stock Dividend Join the conversation.

Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Apple investing $200 million in “Gorilla Glass” maker Corning Apple investing $200 million in “Gorilla Glass” maker Corning May 13, 2017, 9:05 PM BST | Written by Joseph Nordqvist | Apple has announced its first Advanced Manufacturing Fund investment. The iPhone maker is investing $200 million in one of its main suppliers, Corning Incorporated, a New York-based manufacturer of glass, ceramics. The investment will support Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing, Apple said. Since 2007, Corning’s facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, has helped create the cover glass found on iOS devices. The 65-year-old Harrodsburg facility will be the focus of Apple’s investment. Corning developed Gorilla Glass, a brand of specialized toughened glass, first used in the iPhone, designed to be thin, light and damage-resistant. According to Apple, since the inception of Gorilla Glass in 2007, the partnership between the two companies has “created and sustained nearly 1,000 US jobs across Corning’s R&D, manufacturing and commercial functions.” “Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices.” “Corning’s longstanding relationship with Apple has not only led to significant glass innovations that have enabled new capabilities for consumers, it has also helped create nearly 1,000 American jobs and allowed us to continue growing and expanding in the US,” said Wendell P. Weeks, Corning’s chairman, chief executive officer and president. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology.” Share this article: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Print No part of this website or any of its contents may be reproduced, copied, or modified, without prior consent, unless otherwise indicated for stand-alone materials.

Kuo has been predicting that Apple will release a trio of new iPads (a 12.9 inch iPad Pro 2, a new 10.5 iPad Pro and a low-cost 9.7 iPad) in 2017 since August. According to a report on MacRumors, Kuo thinks that a reveal at this year’s conference is likely because of the timing of a production ramp up at the end of this quarter. The iPad in question will be similar to the 9.7 inch iPad, but could have smaller bezels thanks to a larger screen. Kuo reiterated his belief that there is a 50 percent chance that Apple will use this year’s conference to launch its rumored Siri Speaker. In this latest report, he says that the device will come with a touch panel display, a feature that’s been rumored after recent comments from Phil Schiller. Apple employees have reportedly been testing the device for several months, which is designed to compete with Amazon’s Echo. While Amazon has released several versions of its own device, it revealed its first touchscreen model earlier this week. This year’s conference is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 5th.

What Made Apple iPhone 7 The World’s Best Selling Smartphone. May 13, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) During the first quarter of the year, the Apple iPhone 7 was the world’s best-selling smartphone. According to the data estimation done by a research firm, Strategy Analytics, Cupertino based company has sold around 21.5 million units in Q1 2017. According to the data, the sales figure results in a total 6 percent of the total sales recorded in the entire smartphone market. Apple is already ruling the smartphone market despite being competed by Google’s Android smartphones. Here’s what made iPhone 7 the world’s best-selling smartphone. Industry analysts have given some factors responsible for the success of Apple’s iPhone 7 sales. Here’s what made people choose iPhone 7 over its rivals. 1. Design The Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are water resistant and it makes a lot of difference. Although the phones are not fully waterproof, but you can keep them submerged for more than 30 minutes in a meter of water. On the back side, the antenna lines are tweaked, and the blend of colors appear to be a great refinement. The utilitarian design and strategically planned camera bump prove that Apple iPhones are getting better in terms of their overall looks. Undoubtedly, the company is making beautiful, user-friendly smartphones. 2. Software Apple’s new operating system iOS 10 is wonderful. It is the best software update released by the company. The operating system clearly brings the expected sense of UI design. In terms of both operations and visual appearance, iOS 10 appears to be a highly appealing and functional mobile operating system. A new version of iMessage with some surprising features and an improved version of AI assistant Siri make both the variants of the smartphone a great choice. The ability to extend Siri features with third-party applications is pretty amazing and allows users to connect it with different smart home devices. A much-improved Music app, feature-rich Control Center and News apps come with a wide array of new features. 3. Camera Apple’s Phil Schiller said that iPhone camera is likely the best in the market. Since the company’s iPhone 4S model, Apple has managed to remain on top in delivering the best cameras in smartphones. When the company introduced the iPhone 7, Schiller again said the same and Apple proved it. The revolutionary changes mobile cameras have brought lead many people to check camera quality as one of the main factors that actually alters their buying decision. Excellent quality of iPhone 7 camera is also a strong reason why Apple iPhone 7 became the world’s best-selling smartphone in the Q1 2017. The iPhone 7 is far better than the iPhone 6S in terms of the lens. In the Apple’s iPhone 7, there’s a faster f/1.8 lens. Additionally, the photography experience is enhanced with better optical image stabilization and the flash also comes in four-color True Tone which is highly suitable for wider color capturing. 4. Availability Apple’s wide reach is also responsible for its growth over the years. From Asia to Europe and Australian markets, Apple iPhone 7 is available worldwide. The global reach of the brand has made its phones first choice of many people across the US. In its report, Strategy Analytics mentioned that the growth Apple has seen in sales during the first quarter of the year is a result of the company’s reach. Apple has established its numerous stores offline and online and buying its products is now easy. Be it marketing or sales, Apple is ruling the smartphone industry in many regions on the planet. Bottom Line Many smartphone manufacturers claim to deliver the best smartphones in the world, but Apple has proved it with its skyrocketing sales figures. There’s not much to hate about iPhone 7 because the need of more features and better configuration will always be there in every single phone available in the market. But as far as being world’s best-selling smartphone is concerned, Apple iPhone 7 deserves it without a doubt. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News?

Apple MacBook Pro vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop: What Apple Needs For Future Models. May 13, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 2 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Cupertino based tech giant has not revealed the new Apple MacBook Pro release details and it seems that the company won’t bring it anytime soon. The last year’s MacBook Pro brings so much for the users, most importantly the Touch Bar version. On the other hand, Microsoft announced its Surface Laptop which is said to give nightmares to Apple. The Microsoft Surface Laptop is highly customizable and has a lot more to offer to its specified target audience, here’s a comparative analysis to find out what Apple needs for its MacBook Pro product line. Check out this Apple MacBook Pro vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop battle to see what Apple lacks and what it should do to remain at the top. In terms of design, the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro when compared with the Microsoft Surface Laptop is found to be 5 percent shorter. The MacBook Pro feels lighter, but against its rival Surface Laptop, it is heavier. Microsoft has strategically delivered 13.5-inch display because it is undoubtedly bigger than what 13-inch Pro offers. Rivals have so much to make Apple nervous. Despite being so lightweight and bigger in size, Microsoft Surface Laptop also comes in the same aluminum body as Apple’s MacBook Pro. When it comes to color options, Surface again beats MacBook Pro with its four unique color options. Both the Apple’s MacBook Pro models (Touch Bar and non-Touch Bar) are powered by 6th-generation Intel core i5 processors, where the Touch Bar model is faster than the latter. Apple also allows users to upgrade to an i7 6th-generation processor. On the other hand, the Surface Laptop comes with 7th-gen i5 and i7 processors. Apple undoubtedly needs to bring a bit more powerful product in its MacBook Pro line. Apple delivers its MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM and it can be configured up to 16GB, while the Surface Laptop is set to give you 3 options to choose from (4GB, 8GB and 16GB RAM). You can see that Microsoft has introduced more options for different buyer categories. Even though the company aims to focus on students only, it still manages to bring multiple options. Battery life is one of the major concerns with today’s laptops. Microsoft promises 14.5 hour battery life. However the company hasn’t shared specific details about the battery it is using, but if the claim turns out to be true, Apple will be facing a strong competition. In Apple’s realm, the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro features a larger battery than the Pro’s Touch Bar edition. But for both of them, Apple promises 10-hour battery life. The Apple’s MacBook Pro comes with TouchID fingerprint sensor that allows users to login easily. The same feature can’t be expected from the Surface Laptop, but there’s one thing you would want to see in MacBooks is the face recognition feature. For easy logins, Microsoft is giving a Windows Hello face recognition feature. Other than the soothing colors, Microsoft has given Alcantara fabric-covered keyboard in Surface Laptop which is absent in Apple’s MacBook Pro. The synthetic microfiber not only gives the keyboard a clean and elegant look, but it also makes the keyboard soft and surprisingly changes the key press sound. This is not something all the Apple MacBook Pro fans would want, since the wear and tear issues with this approach remain to be discovered. With Apple products, price has always been a subject of discussions. One of the reasons behind Apple’s success is its different pricing strategy, but it is also a reason why a large number of people are still choosing other brands over Apple. If you look at the Microsoft Surface Laptop’s price tag, it will tell you a clear story that the laptop is made for those who prefer functionality within budget. On the other hand, Apple MacBook Pro is available at almost US$500 higher price tag. Apple is undoubtedly doing well, but tech enthusiasts have high expectations and hopes. This time when Microsoft has jumped into the laptop market, it would be interesting to see what Apple does to hold the ground and its position. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News?

Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Apple is believed to have paid somewhere around the price of $200 million for the company, but other specific information about its plans remain unclear. While Apple hasn’t specifically commented on Lattice Data, the company did issue its standard statement when asked about the acquisition: “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” Essentially, what Lattice Data does is take “dark data,” or data that is unstructured such as text and images, and turn it into structured data. The company says that it does so with “human-caliber quality and machine caliber scale.” Between 70 percent and 80 percent of data is unstructured, dark data. Therefore, that data is unusable for processing and analytics. Where Lattice Data comes in, however, is taking that unstructured data and turning it into data that’s usable for processing and analytics, all by using machine learning. Lattice Data was founded in 2015 by Christopher Ré, Michael Cafarella, Raphael Hoffmann, and Feng Niu based on research out of Stanford. The company had raised somewhere around $20 million in funding from GV, Madrona and InQTel. According to today’s report, Lattice Data had been “talking to other tech companies about enhancing their AI assistants” before the Apple acquisition, suggesting that Apple plans to use Lattice Data to enhance its artificial intelligence efforts, likely related to Siri. Apple has made other machine learning and artificial intelligence acquisitions. The company last year acquired the Seattle-based company Turi, while simultaneously expanding its Seattle offices to put a bigger focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Following the Turi acquisition, Apple transformed the company into a dedicated machine learning division to build future product features. As for what we’ll see out of the Lattice Data acquisition remains to be seem. Nevertheless, Apple clearly has a deeply vested interest in furthering its AI and machine learning initiatives.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: iPhone Sales: Future Rumors, Incremental Upgrades Combine to Hurt Unit Sales Join us for our favorite show of the quarter, where we discuss all things Apple earnings. Motley Fool Staff May 13, 2017 at 2:11PM iPhone sales fell slightly shy of expectations when Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported earnings earlier this month. In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior tech specialist Evan Niu, CFA, discuss how Apple's most important product performed last quarter. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 5, 2017. Dylan Lewis: Apple reported what looks like a pretty decent quarter. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter totaled $52.9 billion. EPS came in at $2.10 a share. The company sold 50.8 million iPhones. You look at what estimates were and what people were expecting, just under expectations with revenue, they actually beat on EPS and missed a little bit on iPhone unit sales. What did you make of this quarter? Evan Niu: I think, as far as those headline numbers, it was pretty much in line with expectations. Plus or minus a little bit on some of the metrics, but no big surprises one way or the other. In terms of iPhone sales, I don't think investors were too shocked one way or the other. Of course, anytime you hear iPhone sales less than expected, the stock sells off automatically because people always freak out about the iPhone. But, Apple is so big at this point that it's really hard to put up a big earnings beat anymore these days. Lewis: We touched on units there. Thankfully the iPhone ASPs were up -- average selling price. They hit $655, which is up from $642 a year ago. It seemed like that was really thanks to a stronger mix, people buying at the higher price points for the different form factors they offer. You have that going on, which helps them make up the revenue for that segment. Do you have anything on why they might have missed on the unit side, anything related to future products releases or something like that? Niu: [CEO] Tim Cook talk to little bit of that, there does seem to be an impact on all the rumors. Of course, iPhone rumors are always there every day. But, I think this year's cycle, the expectations are so high and there's so many rumors that it's a particularly intense cycle, the speculation that's going on -- people are waiting. Plus, if you think about it, this is the first time they've ever used the same iPhone design for the third year in a row, so the design is getting a little long in the tooth. This original design was unveiled in 2014. Of course, people like new things. I think those two factors are probably hurting unit sales a little bit, because people are waiting. Even for me personally, I didn't buy the iPhone 7 because I didn't think it was that great, which is the first time I hadn't upgraded in eight years. If even me, who's one of the biggest Apple fans out there, doesn't buy it, you have to wonder who else isn't buying it. So, people are really waiting for the next one. Of course, I'm very excited to get the next one, whatever it is. But yeah, I think there are a couple things that are holding back. Like you mentioned, ASPs were up, which was nice. The 7 Plus was finally in supply demand balance. Last quarter, they misgauged how much to produce and where demand would be focused. It turns out it's really heavily skewed toward the 7 Plus, and they didn't really plan very well, and they admitted that. It was up year over year, but down a little bit sequential. Last quarter, ASPs for iPhone was $695, almost $700, so a little bit of a sequential down tick there, but nothing too concerning, because the point being, people are still loving that big 7 Plus, and that thing is super expensive, so that's helping drive their selling prices overall. Lewis: And also to get into the mind of consumers here a little bit, you talked about how the form factor didn't really change all that much year to year. They made one major overhaul, which was the change to the headphone jack. So, you're asking people to make a major change in how they consume content, or maybe switch over and do use the adapter there, and a lot of people might have said, "The updates to the phone itself aren't compelling enough for me to make that change." Niu: Right. I didn't think there were any big headline features last year. Even the prior year, with the success, the big feature was 3D Touch, which, I think over time was underwhelming. In the past few years I've actually used it, it's not a feature you use every day. It's kind of nice, but it's not a game-changing interface thing, and I think it's kind of underwhelming. So, last year, there wasn't any big feature that was like, "I have to have this phone." I think the dual-camera system was probably the biggest selling point, but that's only on the 7 Plus. For people like, for example, myself, I don't like gigantic phones, and the 5.5 inch screen I think it's just too big. I would like to have that dual camera system, but I'm not willing to go up to the bigger phone that also costs more just to get that camera. As far as the regular 7 goes, there wasn't any huge upgrade that made people go out and say, "I need to get this phone right now," whereas hopefully the next one -- of course, there's a million rumors right now -- it sounds like the next one will be a pretty big upgrade. It'll be the 10th-generation phone, it'll be a pretty big milestone and you can bet that Apple will make a pretty big deal about it, both in terms of marketing and also all the features they're going to try to stuff in there.

Specifically, Apple has picked up Lattice Data, a company that applies an AI enabled inference engine to take unstructured, “dark” data and turn it into structured (and more usable) information. We’ve heard from a single source that Apple has paid a price of around $200 million. The deal was closed a couple of weeks ago, the source said, and about 20 engineers have joined the larger company. A source first alerted us to this, and we’ve received the standard Apple confirmation. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch. Lattice quietly raised at least $20 million funding from GV, Madrona and InQTel before exiting from stealth last year. Lattice was founded in 2015 and has largely remained under the radar, but it has a notable pedigree. The company was co-founded by Christopher Ré, Michael Cafarella, Raphael Hoffmann, and Feng Niu as the commercialisation of DeepDive, a system created at Stanford to “extract value from dark data.” Re, a professor at Stanford, won a MacArthur Genius Grant for his work on DeepDive and is now chief scientist at Lattice. Cafarella, who started as Lattice’s CEO but is now the CTO, is a professor at the University of Michigan known as one of the co-creators of Hadoop. Niu is Lattice’s chief engineering officer. Carafella and Hoffmann (who has since moved to Google, according to his LinkedIn) also worked on developing DeepDive. The CEO of Lattice is Andy Jacques, a seasoned enterprise executive who joined last year. What exactly is dark data? Our connected, digital world is producing data at an accelerated pace: there was 4.4 zettabytes of data in 2013 and that’s projected to grow to 44 zettabytes by 2020, and IBM estimates that 90 percent of the data in existence today was produced in the last two years. But between 70 percent and 80 percent of that data is unstructured — that is, “dark” — and therefore largely unusable when it comes to processing and analytics. Lattice uses machine learning to essentially put that data into order and to make it more usable. Think of it in terms of a jumble of data without labels, categorization or a sense of context — but with a certain latent value that could be unlocked with proper organization. The applications of the system are manifold: they can be used in international policing and crime solving, such as this work in trying to uncover human trafficking; in medical research; and to help organise and parse paleontological research. It could also be used to help train AI systems by creating more useful data feeds. It’s unclear who Lattice has been working with, or how Apple would intend to use the technology. Our guess is that there is an AI play here: Our source said that Lattice had been “talking to other tech companies about enhancing their AI assistants,” including Amazon’s Alexa and Samsung’s Bixby, and had recently spent time in South Korea. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Waymo v.

When you’re innocently browsing the web, it’s deeply unpleasant to think that faceless technology corporations are monitoring and recording your every move. While such data collection is legal, that doesn’t mean it’s all right. There are plenty of things you might prefer to keep to yourself, such as your income, your sexuality, your political views or your membership of the Yoko Ono fanclub. For an indication of what can be inferred from your online habits, take a look at the Apply Magic Sauce tool produced by Cambridge Psychometrics Centre, which produces a profile of your personality based on Facebook and Twitter data. And while you might console yourself with the knowledge that all of this information is mostly used for targeting ads, that might not be the case for much longer. The internet giants are building up ever more detailed user profiles – and finding new ways to exploit that information. In the Observer, Carole Cadwalladr’s ongoing investigation has highlighted how analytic techniques were used in the recent EU referendum to target and craft messages to groups of persuadable voters based on psychological insights gleaned from online data. Even if you are relaxed about analytics companies gaming the political process, you may be more bothered about the effect on your wallet: researchers at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have already found evidence that some online retailers use profiling to discriminate against certain customers. If you’re identified as a high-value shopper, you’re likely to be steered towards more expensive products, or even charged more than other visitors for the same item. And that’s just the start of it. Experts warn that, in the future, your online activity could be taken into consideration when you apply for a loan – or for a job. That’s troubling, not least because profiling involves a large element of assumption and inference. Something as innocent as searching for a medical condition – even out of mere curiosity – could cause your insurance premiums to rocket, and you’ll never know why. Even if you’ve nothing to hide, therefore, it may be wise to minimise your exposure to online tracking. Here’s how some of the biggest names on the web spy on you – and how to protect your privacy. Amazon Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pressing the mute button on top of Amazon’s Echo voice assistant will temporarily stop it from recording audio. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Amazon has a disconcerting habit of following you around the web. Spend a few minutes browsing its catalogue for a new crepe pan, and you might find that the next site you visit is mysteriously festooned with ads for cookware. Thankfully, Amazon gives you an easy way to opt out of being tracked in this way. Simply click on “Your Account” from the Amazon homepage, then scroll down to “Advertising Preferences”: here you’ll see the option to disable personalised ads. Note that since this feature relies on cookies, it will only take effect in the browser you’re currently using. Under “Advertising Preferences”, you’ll also see the option to view and manage your browsing history; from here you can disable tracking altogether, or remove individual items from your Amazon history. That could be useful if you’re shopping for a gift, or if you’ve been browsing unfashionable items you’d rather not be reminded of. What about Amazon’s voice assistant devices? If you’ve got an Amazon Echo in your home, you might be concerned about it listening in on private conversations. Rest assured, the Echo doesn’t record anything it hears until you address it with the appropriate “wake word” (normally “Alexa”). Whatever you say next is relayed to Amazon, where it’s processed and stored, but you can wipe this data at any time – you’ll find the option to do so in Amazon’s “Manage Your Content and Devices” settings. To ensure that Alexa can’t be woken up even by accident, you can also press the mute button on the top of the Echo to temporarily disable the microphone; just press it again to turn it back on. It’s worth noting, however, that the Echo’s software updates automatically, so its behaviour could change at any time. We’ll be keeping a sharp eye out for any updates that could compromise your privacy. Apple Facebook Twitter Pinterest The macOS operating system passes your search terms on to Apple. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian iPhones and iPads collect a lot of data about you, and it’s accessible not just to Apple but to third-party apps too. The “Privacy” section in the iOS Settings app gives you an overview of what’s being collected, and lets you disable various data-sharing features. One particular thing to note is that if you’re carrying an iPhone around in your pocket, it will be constantly keeping track of your location, and potentially sharing it. You can easily tell it not to, though: in the Settings app, tap on “Privacy” > “Location Services” and select which apps should have access to your GPS data. You can also disable system services such as “Frequent Locations”, or disable location services altogether – though this means that apps like Apple Maps won’t work. It’s a similar situation for Mac users. The macOS system uses network connections to work out where in the world your computer is located, and this information can be shared with applications and websites. You can manage this from “System Preferences” > “Security & Privacy”. Another privacy concern for macOS users is the fact that every time you search for something in Spotlight, your search terms are passed on to Apple, so the company’s servers can provide suggested links to online sources. You can disable this feature by opening “System Preferences” > “Spotlight” and unticking the box for “Spotlight Suggestions”. Finally, keep an eye on your webcam, as malware can allow hackers to literally spy on you via your Mac’s built-in camera. If the light comes on unexpectedly, that means someone’s watching you; for complete peace of mind, you can always cover the camera with opaque tape. Consider also going to “System Preferences” > “Sound” and disabling the internal microphone, to ensure no one’s eavesdropping on your conversations. Facebook Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook: you might decide the safest option is not to have an account. Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images You’ve probably handed plenty of personal information to Facebook yourself – but the social network also tracks your visits to other websites to build up a scarily detailed profile of your lifestyle and interests. This information is mostly used for targeting ads, but it could be turned to other purposes in the future. Facebook is quite open about the information it collects. When you see an ad on your timeline, you can always click the drop-down menu at its top right and select “Why am I seeing this?” to discover why Facebook chose to show you an ad for a smartphone, rather than one for scented soap. For a fuller explanation of what Facebook knows about you, go to the “Settings” page and click “Adverts” to inspect your advertising profile. If there are any mistakes here, or advertisers you don’t want to hear from, they can be removed or blocked with a click. The creepy part is that, by default, Facebook’s targeted ads don’t appear only in Facebook itself. Facebook uses cookies to follow your profile on to other websites and, like Amazon, ensure that you see the ads it wants you to. You can disable this behaviour from the advert preferences page: under “Advert settings” you’ll see a rather awkwardly phrased setting for “Ads on apps and websites off of the Facebook Companies”. Set this to “No” and you should regain a degree of online anonymity. Of course, this doesn’t mean that Facebook isn’t still profiling you: there’s sadly no easy way to stop it collecting information. Your best bet is to turn to the measures described in “The internet”, below, such as enabling “Do Not Track” in your browser, specifically opting out or installing an anti-tracking browser extension. Or, of course, you may decide it’s safest just to delete your Facebook account. Google Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google’s My Activity page allows you to view your entire browsing history. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Most of us use Google services every day, and as a result the web giant knows a huge amount about our movements and interests. You can find out everything it’s learned about you at myaccount.google.com. Your data is all set out in an impressively forthright way; the only problem is, there’s so much information to work through that it can be bewildering to navigate. One section that’s worth your attention is “Manage your Google activity”. Here you’ll find Google’s activity controls, which let you disable various types of data collection. For example, you can tell Google not to log your Chrome browsing history and activity, to stop tracking your location and to desist from keeping records of any voice commands you might issue. Turning these features off can make Google services less smart, but you might consider that a price worth paying. For a closer look at the information Google’s been collecting on you lately, click on “My activity”. This brings up a timeline showing all of your searches, webpage visits, Android app activity and so forth. Seeing your digital life laid bare like this can be pretty unnerving: if there’s something you’d prefer Google to forget, simply click on the menu icon to its right and delete. If you want to thoroughly inspect everything Google knows about you, you can even download a comprehensive archive of personal information by clicking on “Control your content” > “Download your data”. Be warned, though, this archive can be huge: the default settings include all the emails in your Gmail account, and any videos you may have uploaded to YouTube. If you want to limit the information you share with Google in the future, the easiest way is simply to use it less. For example, try the privacy-focused search engine at duckduckgo.com, and use an alternative browser such as Firefox. Microsoft Windows 10’s “telemetry” features automatically capture all sorts of information about what you’re doing on your PC, and send it back to Microsoft. The company insists that this information is only used to improve Windows, but it can still feel like a violation. The recent “Creators Update” to Windows 10 prompts you to review your privacy settings as part of the update process, but you can check and change your settings at any time: simply open the Windows 10 Settings app and click on “Privacy”. You’ll find no fewer than 18 pages of configuration options, covering everything from personalised advertising to location services. There are a few settings you might particularly want to check. One feature of Windows 10 that may be cause for concern is the way it tracks everything you type – yes, everything – and shares it with Microsoft. This is supposed to help the operating system learn the way you work, but if the idea makes you shudder, you can disable it under “Speech, inking and typing”. Under “Feedback & diagnostics”, meanwhile, you can choose how much diagnostic information gets periodically sent back to Microsoft. A full report includes details of which applications you’ve been using and which websites you’ve been visiting, so you might prefer to switch to the more limited basic setting. You can also manage the information that Microsoft already knows about you by visiting the Privacy Dashboard at account.microsoft.com/privacy. While not strictly a privacy issue, another controversial aspect of Windows 10 is the inclusion of ads in the user interface. To remove unwanted ads from the Start menu, go to “Settings” > “Personalisation” > “Start” and disable “Occasionally show suggestions in Start”. To stop Microsoft advertising its OneDrive cloud storage service, open File Explorer, then select “View” > “Options” > “Change folder and search options”, click on the “View” tab, and untick “Show sync provider notifications”. The internet Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Chrome, like most major browsers, has options to disable tracking. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian All right, it’s an exaggeration to say that the internet as a whole is spying on you. But there are a hell of a lot of companies out there keeping tabs on your online activity. The motivation normally comes down to filthy lucre – tracking your interests helps them push relevant ads your way, and to be fair you might prefer those to irrelevant ones. If you’d rather not be tracked, one step you can immediately take is to enable the “do not track” feature in your browser. Yes, it’s that simple: every major web browser has the capability to tell websites that you don’t want to be followed – you can find more details at donottrack.us. The only problem with this system is that compliance is completely optional, so websites that want to follow you still can. Another thing you can do is visit youradchoices.com, a site that checks your browser for “tracking cookies” from more than 100 companies. You can disable individual cookies, or turn off all behavioural advertising with a single click. After this, you’ll still see ads, but they won’t be customised to your interests any more. A more drastic solution is to configure your browser to reject third-party cookies – that is, cookies that connect to a site other than the one you’re currently browsing. However, this can cause problems if, for example, a site uses embedded content from elsewhere on the web. A safer option is to use a tool such as Ghostery ; this free browser extension can block tracking cookies from more than 4,500 companies, while letting you selectively enable cross-site content. It’s a pain that this should be necessary, but if you don’t want your personal information to be shared around online, it’s a precaution worth taking.

Apple confirmed the acquisition exclusively to Fortune via telephone on Saturday, and provided the following statement via email: "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." There isn't much information publicly available about Lattice, but according to the company's CrunchBase profile, the startup was born out a Stanford research project called DeepDive. The company's technology appears to use machine learning to parse through databases or the web to answer queries. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Lattice was co-founded by Chris Re, a professor of computer science at Stanford, and Michael Cafarella, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan. Cafarella was the co-creator of Hadoop, a widely used big data processing technology. Cafarella was also previously an engineer at telecommunications company TellMe Networks, which was bought by Microsoft in 2007 for $800 million. According to this 2015 profile on Re, the professor's Deep Dive program is able to understand "dark data," which provides information within images or illustrations. The company's technology is also similar to Google's Knowledge Graph (“goog”), which is the search giant's technology that understands relationships between people, places, and things, and it provide answers to questions like "What's the capital of California?" One source familiar with the matter said the acquisition price was between $175 million and $200 million. Lattice had raised an undisclosed amount of funding from Madrona Venture Group and GV, the venture arm of Google-parent Alphabet.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Microsoft's Apps Problem Has Never Been More Dire Alex CranzYesterday 12:57pm Filed to: Microsoft Build 2017 Build Microsoft Windows 10 Windows Store Windows 10 S 105 4 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo At Microsoft’s Build conference, the dorkiest of companies put on a big show, complete with fog machines and fancy lights, in order to show it’s a cool competitor to Apple and Google. The speakers who came on stage during keynotes had stylish hair. “Do they have dressers backstage?” an attendee asked a group of us when it was all over. Advertisement Build exists to get developers excited. The biggest devs blow upwards of $2000 for a three-day pass to the event, where they have unlimited drinks, plentiful meals, and access to Microsoft’s best and brightest. Part of Microsoft’s wooing process involves appearing “hip” to a group of developers who resemble the cast of Silicon Valley in all the worst ways. Hence the light show and Microsoft EVP Terry Myerson’s questionable hoodie and leather vest combo. It wants these devs so amped that they’ll rush back to their MacBook Airs and Surface Books to crank out brilliant software, hopefully for Microsoft’s Windows Store, which has just one third of the apps of much cooler stores from Google and Apple. With the arrival of Windows 10 S, which can only use apps from the Windows Store, the app marketplace has never been more important than today. Yet time after time over the course of the event, Microsoft dropped the ball on its pitch to developers in favor of niche distractions. Apple’s a monolith of money and users, and thanks to Android and Chrome OS, Google is right there with it. Both have OS platforms with heavily used app stores. They’ve built customer bases of hungry fans that enthusiastically embrace their hardware and software products, and consequently, developers want to build apps that work with Apple and Google platforms. Microsoft, on the other hand, can’t seem to ditch the buttoned-up association it’s developed for making the work computer you don’t want to use. Its reputation is seemingly forever cemented by those old Mac vs PC commercials. Attempts to rewrite the script have been met with mixed success. On the hardware side, Microsoft has become a genuine player in the field of coveted kit. The Surface Pro and Studio are ambitious devices that are legitimately exciting. The Surface Laptop announced earlier this month is one of the most interesting products announced so far this year. But Microsoft’s software landscape is still dorktown and one of the big ways Microsoft’s attempting to undorkify things is by leaning into the Windows Store. There’s a problem though. Microsoft’s app store in uncommonly small compared to the other guys. According to Microsoft, in 2015 there were just 669,000 apps available. (The company hasn’t officially updated that number since.) According to Statista Apple and Google both have more than three times that number of apps available in their stores. Advertisement Advertisement The number of available apps alone doesn’t necessarily dictate the quality of someone’s computing experience, but it remains a common metric for success, and if Microsoft wants to look cooler in the software space, it needs a big awesome app store full of big awesome apps. Microsoft stunned the audience of Build when it announced iTunes was coming to the store just a week after announcing Spotify’s arrival. Those are two hugely important apps, and you could feel the energy in the keynote after the announcement. Developers and press looked at one another, baffled and delighted. An Apple app would appear in the Windows Store! Then Microsoft immediately squandered that excitement. The rest of the focus both on stage and later in the “Hub,” the primary showroom for the conference, wasn’t on the cool apps traditional users might want, but on the deeply nerdy niche stuff. Sponsored During the keynote itself, Microsoft glossed over the lifestyle apps to focus on Autodesk and Linux. Autodesk was up on stage to announce that Autodesk Stingray was headed to the store. Stingray is an engine used to build things in 3D and is almost exclusively used by 3D artists and engineers. After that announcement, Microsoft followed up with the news that Linux was coming to the store. If you’re excited about the Linux distributions Ubuntu, Suse, and Fedora arriving to the Windows Store, know you’re uncommon. It’s big news for developers, but meaningless to people who would normally seek out apps on an app store in the first place. Site of the Build keynote. There are lots of blue lights and...fog? Given Microsoft’s enthusiasm for the store, it was weird that the company’s newly announced operating system, Windows 10 S, which can only get apps through the store, was mostly absent from the conference, apart from a few mentions during the keynote. You couldn’t find it anywhere on the show floor, where developers mingle with Microsoft personnel. Nerd city. The Store booth had a lone TV screen with a rep standing in front of it—and that rep had not been briefed on Windows 10 S. In fact, it seemed no one had. Every Microsoft rep I asked seemed bewildered by Windows 10 S questions. They could say it was “exciting” but they had no spiel ready for why it was exciting, nor why the Store was crucial to its success. Advertisement And no one could explain what, fundamentally, might have changed about the Windows Store to make it an appealing avenue for app launches after a five years of sluggish adoption. Even app developers that were bullish about the platform were frustratingly vague about what was different now compared to when the Store launched in 2012, and why Windows 10 S would not go the way of its failed store-focused predecessors Windows RT and Windows 8.1 with Bing. Christoph Teschner and Michael Simmons were positively giddy about Windows 10 S when I sat down with them in a high-rise hotel near the conference. Both men are employees of Algoriddim, and were in Seattle because their app, DJay Pro, had just received the App Creator of the Year award. “I think that’s the future,” Simmons said of the Windows App store. Advertisement Teschner pointed to his own youth, growing up with Apple’s app stores for Mac and iOS and how it had prepared him for the Windows Store. “People are used to app stores now,” he said. “It felt sort of natural to me when I first got my Windows Store.” Though they were reluctant to give exact numbers or concrete evidence of a successful Windows Store launch, Simmons said “Windows fulfilled our expectations.” He praised the development process in particular. “Seeing developer tools ten years ago, it’s a total leap today. It’s an evolution and we’re in the middle of it.” Neither man could give a concrete reason for why they felt Windows 10 S had a chance to succeed when its predecessors failed so badly, but sitting in a room and soaking up their optimism it was hard not to be swayed a little. Advertisement Advertisement And it’s that kind of optimism for app developers that Microsoft will need if it hopes to actually fill the Store with cool apps. If those men had been on the show floor, showing off their app and talking up their own experiences with developing for the store, Build might have actually projected the image Microsoft desperately needs. But Microsoft is still figuring it out. It has ditched the pocket protector, but it’s still not cool. Recommended Stories What Is Microsoft's Grand Plan for Phones?

The company also acknowledged that pre-orders had exhausted inventory, and that not all who placed an order will receive their new phones by Friday, September 19. "Demand for the new iPhones exceeds the initial pre-order supply and while a significant amount will be delivered to customers beginning on Friday and throughout September, many iPhone pre-orders are scheduled to be delivered in October," Apple said in a statement. Not surprisingly, Apple did not mention the bungled pre-ordering of September 12, when the Apple Store was not available until hours after the 3am ET kick-off (midnight PT). Other customers have reported problems ordering from carriers that included missing confirmation emails, changed arrival dates and upgrade eligibility snafus. In the statement CEO, Tim Cook, said pre-orders for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus had set a record. According to Apple's online store, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will now ship 7 to 10 business days after ordering. The larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, which went into delayed shipping almost immediately last Friday, showed "3-4 weeks" early Monday. The last time that Apple allowed pre-orders of its flagship iPhone was in September 2012, when the company boasted it had sold two million iPhone 5 smartphones in the first 24 hours. (In 2013, Apple took pre-orders only for the iPhone 5C; it took the unusual step of not opening the more expensive iPhone 5S to pre-ordering.) The four million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones sold equaled the total in 2011 over the first three days of sales of the iPhone 4S. iPhone shortages are nothing new: When the iPhone 5S went on sale opening weekend a year ago, the company drained stocks almost instantly. In 2012, pre-sale inventory vanished inside an hour. It typically takes months for Apple to reach a supply and demand balance. Last week, however, financial analyst Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald was optimistic that the firm would meet demand as quickly as a month from now. Most experts believe that this year's upgrade cycle will be the largest in Apple's history, fueled by the larger-sized screens and a massive pool of customers with smartphones two years old or older. In 2013, Apple sold 9 million iPhones in the first weekend of retail sales, a number that included pre-sales of the iPhone 5C. It appears inevitable that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will top last year's three-day record: At the pace of pre-sales in 2012, which were 40 per cent of the opening weekend, a weekend total this year would be 10 million. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will go on sale Friday at 8am. local time in Apple's retail stores, as well as those of its carrier partners. "Customers are encouraged to arrive early," Apple said of Friday. Apple will sell the new smartphones in 10 markets this year, up one from last year: the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK. Another 20 markets will start sales September 26, including Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Spain and Taiwan. China, which was on the early list last year, has been noticeably absent from this year's. Reports from the People's Republic of China (PRC) have claimed that the iPhone has not received regulatory approval from the government there.

While the Federal Trade Commission had originally stated that Qualcomm had monopolistic like qualities, the trade group this week has yet again slammed the chip maker… Samsung U28E590D 28-Inch 4K Monitor In a filing with the US District Court in San Jose, California, the FTC accused Qualcomm of being a monopoly and preventing key customers, like Apple, from doing business with other companies. The FTC ultimately says that the case should proceed (via CNET): “Qualcomm uses its monopoly power to make [handset manufacturers] pay a royalty overcharge — a tax — when buying modem chips from its competitors,” the FTC filing reads. “Qualcomm further hampers those competitors by denying them the licenses it promised would be available on FRAND terms during standard- setting. And Qualcomm foreclosed its competitors from selling to a uniquely important customer, Apple, for half a decade using exclusive contracts.” Furthermore, several other companies have filed amicus briefs in support of the FTC. Most notably, Samsung on Friday expressed its support for the FTC’s statement, saying that the case should proceed and that it has also suffered from and been harmed by Qualcomm’s practices. Samsung accuses Qualcomm of refusing to “license its patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms.” Samsung goes on to explain that these actions prohibit it from making and selling its own licensed chipsets: “Because Qualcomm does not license [chipset] competitors, handset manufacturers have no choice but to accept Qualcomm’s onerous terms,” Samsung said. “Qualcomm directly excludes competitors and harms competition.” Additionally, Intel has also filed an amicus brief in support of the FTC, saying that Qualcomm has “driven nearly all of its competitors out of the premium LTE chipset market.” Earlier this month, it was reported that Qualcomm was seeking an iPhone import ban in the United States as Apple and its suppliers withhold some $1 billion in royalty payments.

WTF, NYT? 45 Security Comey was loathed by the left, reviled by the right – must have been doing something right Three years of the US's top cop in action 13 May 2017 at 15:03, Iain Thomson Analysis The firing of FBI Director James Comey came as a shock to almost everyone, not least to the man himself. Comey was addressing FBI students in Los Angeles when the television behind him flashed up the news of President Trump's decision to give him his marching papers. Comey reportedly saw this and laughed, congratulating his audience on pulling off a clever prank, before his staff broke the bad news. The move has ignited a political firestorm on both the left and the right, and Comey has found some very unlikely supporters on both sides of the fence. Most surprising of all was the statement from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "We have deep concerns about President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. We disagreed with the director on many issues, including his consistent push for backdoors into our electronic communications and devices and a general weakening of encryption, which is crucial to protecting Americans' privacy and security," said Dave Green, the EFF's director of civil liberties. "But we are deeply troubled about Director Comey's termination and what it says about the independence of the office and its ability to conduct fair investigations, including into threats to our digital security and the integrity of our elections." Green's being polite; Comey's name was largely dirt at the EFF. The former director's continuing efforts to institute backdoor encryption systems (or front door them as he liked to call it) infuriated those people who know a thing or six about encryption. It wasn't always that way. When Comey assumed office, he tried to reassure the technology community, saying that "security has promoted liberty, there's not a tradeoff." However, that soon went out the window. The worm turns Within months, Comey had begun his crusade against encryption, blaming Apple for introducing full-disk encryption and using his long-repeated line that the police were stymied by criminals' communications "going dark" for the Feds. What spurred this move towards full-disk encryption was the government's own actions. After Edward Snowden's revelations about the extent of government surveillance, people got a lot more demanding about encryption. Apple's decision was both an excellent marketing move and was born of Cupertino's concerns on the topic. Ironically enough, Comey actually tried to oppose the NSA's bulk surveillance practices when he was Deputy Attorney General during the GW Bush administration. While some Republican appointees – notably the torture-supporting White House counsel Alberto Gonzales – supported mass surveillance, Comey actively fought against it, according to people at the time. However when he got to the FBI and saw how tough encryption was making things for his staff, Comey began to play hardball. This culminated in the legal case against Apple over the encryption on the San Bernardino terrorist's remaining iPhone. The shooter destroyed all of his computers and all but one of his mobile phones, leaving his work phone untouched. The FBI took Apple to court to make them build a version of their operating system that could be cracked by the cops, after the FBI bungled the original examination of the device. Apple won that one and Comey appeared to back down for a while. He declared a moratorium, saying he'd wait until after the election and then have an "adult conversation," about the matter – a phrase that riled up Reg writers. Hackers harshing his buzz Another of Comey's preoccupations was the need to recruit more talent to the FBI's computing teams. The director was frustrated with the lack of qualified applicants looking to join the side of law and order, and constantly moaned that people weren't willing to serve in the agency. A Department of Justice report in 2015 found that staffing levels in the cybercrime division were 38 per cent down on what they should be. Comey repeatedly whined that they couldn't find hackers who had the skills, physical fitness, and drug-free status that the FBI needs for its agents. To illustrate this, he made frequent allusions to people turning up to interviews stoned. In fact, the reason the FBI has trouble hiring cyber-Sherlocks is its employment practices. In order to join the Fed's hacking squad, recruits have to go through the full FBI agent training in firearms, operational practices, physical fitness and case law. Only then can they get to work. That's not an attractive option for a computer security specialist, particularly with high-paying jobs aplenty in private industry where your boss wouldn't care too much if you had long hair or piercings, and wouldn't have an overly rigid view about people getting into work at 0800 sharp, so long as the work gets done. And yes, many hackers enjoy a doobie once in a while (although LSD microdosing is apparently this year's thing). But Comey's constant harping on the topic pissed off a fair few people. At last year's DEF CON, several hackers resented the insinuation that computer jocks are automatically druggies, which didn't help Comey's cause. Email ineptitude The FBI was originally the hero of the Republicans when it began a protracted investigation into Hillary Clinton's infamous home web server. There was a steady drip of information from the investigation that was a constant thorn in Clinton's side, much to Donald Trump's delight. It was also Comey's undoing. His announcement on July 5, 2016 that he wasn't going to recommend prosecution caused an immediate flip-flop by Trump. The director was reviled for his lack of action and it was this decision that was ultimately named as the reason for his dismissal on Tuesday. He was back in favor in October when he reopened the investigation into Hillary's emails, just 11 days before voters were due to go to the polls. The reason was an FBI investigation into disgraced ex-politician Anthony Weiner, who was married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The aptly-named Weiner had lost his political career over sexting pictures of himself to women other than his wife, which cost him his seat in the House of Representatives, his bid to become mayor of New York, and ultimately his marriage. He was also accused of similar habits with a 15 year-old girl, and the FBI was concerned that his laptop contained Clinton emails forwarded by his wife. With the announcement that the investigation was restarting, Republicans were ecstatic. Trump said the decision showed "guts," while Democrats were driven to spittle-flecked rage at what was seen as a politically motivated announcement. Comey had been a registered Republican – he cancelled that affiliation when he got the top job at the FBI. As it turned out, there were only a handful of emails that were forwarded through to Weiner's laptop, although it took the FBI far too long to sort that out. Clinton was once again in the clear, but she had taken a hit in the polls that some Democrats blamed for her losing the election – although running one of the most unlikeable and flawed candidates in the party's history coupled with pathetic campaigning in key states surely had more to do with it. After the election Comey looked golden, and appeared to enjoy a good relationship with Donald Trump. Democrats still cried foul, however with Trump getting his feet under the table in the White House, there was little that could be done.

For instance, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who regularly covers Corning, explained that the move away from metal to glass is a must for wireless charging technologies. Of course, it’s essentially common knowledge at this point that the iPhone 8 will switch to a glass design, but Uerkwitz believes that the Corning investment paves the way for wireless charging: “Metal can interfere with wireless charging technology,” he told CNBC. “That means you need glass on the back of the phone, but glass that won’t break. Or you need to use ceramics. Corning has a long history of investing in both glass and ceramics.” Furthermore, Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights explains that the investment in Corning by Apple is more of a partnership. Moorhead explains that Apple and Corning can work together to create glass that “properly magnifies” the 180-degree augmented reality experience. It’s been reported multiple times in the past that Apple is working on a pair of augmented realty glasses, thus needing a supplier for the glass for this initiative. “You need specialized glass in the headset, glass that properly magnifies the 180-degree experience of AR. Also, that glass has to be really light. Corning could develop that for Apple.” Moorhead also notes that with the investment, Apple would be in a position to obtain exclusive rights to the augmented reality-focused glass from Corning. When announcing the Corning investment, Apple explained that the $200 million would go to “support Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs, and state-of-the-art glass processing.” Apple and Corning have been partners for 10 years and as Apple looks to grow United States manufacturing, the investment makes sense. But as always, maybe there’s more to the story than what Apple initially led on. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

But this time the latest prediction is about the expected pricing of the smartphone, and how Apple’s most high-end iPhone to date will push prices to $1,000 and above in the US market. In a new research report from Goldman Sachs, analyst Simona Jankowski writes that she expects the iPhone 8 to be offered in storage capacities of 128GB and 256GB, with US prices to start at approximately $999, and $1,099, respectively. Unfortunately for potential customers on a smaller budget, the analyst believes Apple will not offer a 64GB or 32GB option. These are merely predictions, of course, so take the pricing info with a grain of salt. However, we’ve long been hearing about how Apple is very likely to release the iPhone 8 alongside a more modestly revamped “iPhone 7S” this fall, with the former being presented as a “high-end, premium” model. To go with that premium billing, Apple will of course include the best specs and newest features, which will in turn justify the high pricing. While we may need to wait a bit longer before we find out the official prices, it’s a safe bet this will be the most expensive iPhone model Apple releases to date.

Fortune Insiders Search Search Best CompaniesThe Starbucks App Might Be Easier to Hack Than You Think Most Powerful WomenFacebook Pulls Abortion Group Page for ‘Encouragement of Drug Use’—Then Reverses BitcoinWhy Bitcoin’s Price Has Been Surging and Where It Could Go From Here PointCloudApple Just Acquired This Little-Known Artificial Intelligence Startup Commentary Tesla Why Tesla Could Become the Next Apple Mohanbir Sawhney May 13, 2017 Tesla (tsla) CEO Elon Musk's bold prediction that his $53 billion company could one day be as valuable as Apple (aapl), the most valuable company in the world with an $800 billion market cap, is based on his logic that Tesla will disrupt manufacturing with automation by going after the “machine that makes the machine.” While it may seem just pie in the sky, there is a case for Tesla to become the next Apple. Tesla is betting that it can create a fully automated manufacturing process that will be as revolutionary as Henry Ford’s continuous assembly line. Ford revolutionized manufacturing in 1913 by creating a process that broke the assembly of the Ford Model T into 84 distinct steps as the car moved down the line on a conveyer belt. The process revolutionized production and dropped the assembly time for a single vehicle from 12 hours to 90 minutes. Ford was able to reduce the cost of the Model T from $850 to $30 and produce a car every 24 seconds. Ford ended up selling 15 million Model T cars by 1927, and the continuous assembly line remains the foundation of automobile manufacturing to this day. Although automation with robots has dramatically improved the efficiency of automotive manufacturing, the final assembly is still a manual process. Tesla aims to combine its capabilities in advanced software and artificial intelligence (AI) with advanced automated manufacturing capabilities it acquired in November 2016 by buying Grohmann Automation to create a factory that will produce very high volumes at much lower costs than today’s auto factories. A fascinating insight from Tesla’s blog: The “factory becomes more of a product than the product itself.” Tesla believes that it can usher in the next manufacturing revolution by dramatically increasing production volumes and reducing labor costs in manufacturing. See also: Elon Musk Says Robots Will Help Tesla Catch Up to Apple in Value So why won’t other auto manufacturers follow suit and overtake Tesla? First, their products, as well as their factories, are bogged down by legacy. Tesla’s electric cars are significantly easier to manufacture than internal combustion (IC) vehicles. Tesla’s Model S has fewer than 20 moving parts, compared with almost 1,500 moving parts in an IC-engine car. This means that there are fewer steps in the assembly process, fewer suppliers to deal with, and lower inventory of components and parts. Further, Tesla doesn’t have to deal with a unionized workforce, a complex supply chain, or a legacy dealer network. Free from this legacy, Tesla can embrace disruptive innovation without worrying about the backlash from workers, suppliers, and dealers. To become as big as Apple one day, Tesla will need more than the “Henry Ford” approach to manufacturing. It will also need the “Steve Jobs” approach to marketing by creating a vast global appetite for its products. The Apple iPhone is a global product that can be sold from New York to Mumbai to Beijing with very little incremental investment. However, Tesla’s cars require the creation of infrastructure for charging and a distribution network from scratch—a very expensive and time-consuming process. Tesla will need to build out its charging network and distribution reach, country by country. China is an important overseas market for Tesla, as is Scandinavia; it also has a rollout plan for India with its Model 3. There are many bumps in the road in Tesla’s ambitious journey. Skeptics point out that Tesla may run out of cash in the pursuit of its lofty ambitions: The investments that Tesla will need to make in manufacturing, battery production, charging infrastructure, and distribution networks will be too large and will take too long to pay off for Tesla to reach the scale that it needs. Tesla’s acquisition of Grohmann also hit a bump when the founder and former CEO Klaus Grohmann exited the company last month after a disagreement with Musk. Tesla isn’t without competitors, either, beyond the traditional automakers. Technology companies such as Google (goog), Uber, and Baidu of China are all involved in autonomous driving technology. However, these competitors can potentially also become customers for Tesla, as they’re more interested in technology and services than automotive manufacturing. While only time will tell if Tesla can reach the global scale and profitability of Apple, there are three reasons to be optimistic. First, Tesla’s advanced automated manufacturing may allow it to reduce costs to the point that its mass-market models, such as the Model 3, can be highly profitable—a combination of high demand and high profits that was the formula for the Apple iPhone. Second, Tesla has the purity of purpose and a charismatic founder intent on global domination—just as Jeff Bezos has done at Amazon (amzn) and Steve Jobs did at Apple. In a race between entrepreneurs and managers, entrepreneurs usually win. Finally, history suggests that disruption rarely comes from incumbents. Tesla is disrupting the product as well as the factory that makes the product—something that incumbent automakers will find very difficult to do. If Tesla can reinvent the car and also reinvent the car factory, it stands a good chance of becoming the next Apple.

But the release of recent data from comScore shows Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't falling behind to the S8. ComScore released on Tuesday a ranking of market share for the three-month period ending March 2017 among total U.S. smartphone subscribers aged 13-plus. Apple's iPhone ranked top with a 44.5 percent market share, followed by Samsung at 28.3 percent, LG at 9.8 percent, Motorola at 4.2 percent and HTC at 2.2 percent. However, Apple's iOS platform held on to a 44.5 percent market share which fell short of the 53.4 percent market share held by all Android devices combined. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)'s operating system held a 1.6 percent market share while BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY)'s share stood at just 0.5 percent. Apple's Share Could Be Even Bigger? Heading into Apple's fiscal second-quarter report, some analysts suggested iPhone sales would come in below expectations based on the fact many consumers are waiting patiently for the release of the iPhone 8. As Warren Buffett explained, many would-be iPhone users are patiently waiting to buy the new iPhone expected to be released by the end of the year. While hard to conclude, if these would-be buyers purchased a new iPhone in the past three months then Apple would see boosted sales and a greater market share. "It's very hard to figure out how much people delay their buying of iPhones because of the launch of the new one in six months," Buffett explained.

Samsung Pay will be available in South Korea on August 20 followed by the US on Sepember 28. The system will eventually be rolled out in the UK, Spain and China, Samsung said, although it didn't offer a time frame for this expansion. Samsung's original rollout plans, announced in March at Mobile World Congress, called for Samsung Pay to appear first in the U.S. this summer. Unlike rival contactless payment systems like Apple Pay and Android Wallet, Samsung Pay doesn't exclusively use NFC technology to communicate with credit card terminals. Instead, it relies on a technology called Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) to pass along the information in a card's magnetic strip to terminals already used by retailers. This means a phone using MST can be used to purchase items at nearly any payment terminal. The expense of installing NFC-compatible terminals has prevented many retailers from adopting the technology, hindering the use of mobile wallets. Samsung CEO J.K. Shin noted these concerns during an event in New York where he also announced the company's newest smartphones. Shin said merchants can accept Samsung Pay without added costs while people can use the system at almost every store that takes credit cards. Even though Samsung talked up MST, its payment system will also work with NFC. Samsung acquired MST technology in February after purchasing mobile payment company LoopPay. At that time, LoopPay claimed MST works in approximately 90 percent of the point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. A Samsung spokeswoman added that less than 10 percent of U.S. retailers used NFC. Samsung Pay will come installed on the company's latest smartphones, the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+. Starting in the middle of August, a software upgrade will let Galaxy S6 and S6 edge owners in the US and South Korea install Samsung Pay. Instead of exchanging credit card details with a terminal, Samsung Pay uses tokenization to pass along a temporary code, a system found in other contactless payment systems. Customers use their fingerprint to confirm a purchase. Samsung is working with South Korea's major credit card companies on incorporating Samsung Pay into payment networks. In the U.S, Samsung will work with credit card issuers like American Express, Visa and MasterCard as well as large banks, including Chase and Bank of America. At least one U.S. credit card company has already said it's supporting Samsung Pay: Discover customers will be able to use Samsung Pay at some still undetermined point in 2016. Tech companies aren't the only ones developing contactless payment systems. Merchants including CVS and Walmart are part of a retail group building its own mobile wallet called CurrentC.

In the first six months of the year, more than 43 per cent of Intel's hires in the US were women and minorities, up from 32 per cent at the end of 2014, the company reported in its first mid-year diversity report. At 43 percent, Intel said it was surpassing the 40 per cent diversity hiring goal it set for itself for the full year. Apple, meanwhile, boosted its hiring of women by 65 per cent globally over the past year, to 11,000, the company said in its second annual report. Apple made gains particularly in the US, where nearly half of its hires since January were women, African-American, Hispanic, or Native American, the company said. The lack of women and minorities in Silicon Valley has become a hot-button issue in the male-dominated technology industry. A sex discrimination lawsuit brought by former Reddit CEO, Ellen Pao, against her former employer has also brought attention to how women are treated in Silicon Valley. Over the past year, other companies including Google and Facebook have started to share numbers around their hiring of women and minorities. Companies have pledged to add more diversity to their ranks and expand their recruiting efforts. By 2020, Intel wants the diversity of its workforce to mirror the availability of workers by demographic. The numbers released by Apple and Intel, however, show that the overall representation of minorities at the companies has not dramatically changed. Between 2014 and 2015, Apple only grew its number of female workers from 30 per cent to 31 per cent. "We are proud of the progress we've made, and our commitment to diversity is unwavering," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in the company's report. But, he said, "we know there is a lot more work to be done." Zach Miners covers social networking, search and general technology news for IDG News Service. Follow Zach on Twitter at @zachminers.

After Samsung had whittled the original damages in the case down from $930 million, the South Korean company had asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for a rehearing to reduce the award by another $399 million. But on Thursday the appeals court, without comment, denied Samsung's request for a rehearing. The case stems from a 2011 patent infringement lawsuit brought by Apple, alleging Samsung infringed on several iPhone patents related to the design and packaging of the smartphone. Fellow tech giants Google, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Facebook backed Samsung's appeal of the damages. Earlier this year, Google and other tech companies filed a friend of the court brief arguing that the award "will have significant detrimental consequences for the continued development of useful modern technologies." Samsung said it was disappointed with the appeals court's decision. "For decades, we have invested heavily in developing revolutionary innovations in the mobile industry and beyond," a spokeswoman said by email. "We are confident that our products do not infringe on Apple's design patents, and we will continue to take appropriate measures to protect our products and our intellectual property."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 2 External Influences That Could Have a Big Impact on Apple's $257 Billion in Cash Apple might be able to bring a lot of cash back on shore sometime soon, and it might have some attractive places to put it. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) May 13, 2017 at 8:18AM Next to Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, there's probably not a single event that draws broader attention from investors and Wall Street than Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) quarterly earnings results. After the closing bell on Tuesday, May 2, the tech giant delivered another typical Apple quarter: It made Wall Street's profit expectations look silly, and its forecast for the upcoming quarter remained as conservative as ever with the release of its next-generation iPhone expected in a few months. Image source: Apple. Apple's second quarter, by the numbers For the quarter, Apple posted $52.9 billion in revenue, which was nearly a 5% improvement from the previous year. Though iPhone sales fell a tad to 50.8 million units from 51.2 million year over year (likely a result of consumers waiting for the iPhone 8 to hit the market), growth in Mac computer sales helped fill the gap (4.2 million units compared to 4 million in Q2 2016). Apple's sales were more or less in line with what the Street was expecting. As for its bottom line, Apple announced earnings of $2.10 per share, a clean $0.08 per share better than expected. Of course, the real showstopper was Apple's cash hoard, which grew by more than $10 billion from the sequential first quarter to a record $256.8 billion. That's more than Chile or Finland produced in GDP in 2015! Of course, it's important to realize that 93% of its cash is held in overseas markets, which somewhat constrains what the company can do.  Image source: Getty Images. For instance, Apple has been rerouting capital back to shareholders in the form of a bigger dividend and heftier share buybacks. Apple's board upped its share repurchase program from $175 billion to $210 billion, and the company anticipates returning an aggregate of $300 billion via repurchases and dividends to investors by March 2019 (since it began in 2012). But, Apple has been financing a good portion of its capital return program with debt instead of its cash hoard, because it can't access its overseas capital without getting hit with a big tax bill. However, this could soon change.  Two big influences -- a potential tax holiday and the possibility of interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve -- could dramatically impact what Apple chooses to do with its quarter of a trillion dollars in cash.  The Trump effect Recently, Donald Trump outlined a plan that proposes a one-time tax on repatriated income at 10%. The reason Trump has pushed for a tax repatriation holiday is simple: He wants to bring the more than $2.6 trillion in cash being held overseas back to the U.S., which he believes can be used to create jobs and be reinvested back into businesses. Apple ended the second quarter with $239.6 billion in foreign cash and $17 billion in domestic cash. This $239.6 billion represents the most any company has overseas by a mile.  Image source: Donald J. Trump official Facebook page. Photo by Shealea Craighead. The variables that have to be considered here are whether or not Trump's tax proposal will gain footing in Congress, and if so, what if anything would Apple do with its overseas cash at that point.  A number of proposals within Trump's tax plan have faced significant scrutiny, including his push for a 15% corporate tax rate, which some pundits have deemed too low or not feasible. In other words, there are real questions about the feasibility of Trump's tax plan, which would include the repatriation tax. There are even questions as to whether the tax could be a one-time thing as proposed, or if it could be a recurring tax on overseas cash that's repatriated back to the U.S. Then there's the question of what Apple will do with its overseas cash if Trump's tax plan (as proposed) becomes law. No one really knows how much Apple could choose to bring back, if anything. Fed Policy could play a big role, too After nearly seven years of record-low lending rates, the Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in December 2015, in light of improving U.S. economic indicators. The central bank does this by increasing its federal funds target rate, which governs the rate at which financial institutions can lend to one another overnight. An increase in the federal funds rate has the effect of boosting the yields associated with interest-bearing assets, including U.S. Treasury bonds. In other words, as the Fed increases its fed funds target, bond prices would be expected to fall, and bond yields rise. As yields rise, investing in safe Treasury bonds becomes more attractive. Image source: Pixabay. Why does this matter? Apple has historically been very conservative with its cash, and it already has $53 billion invested in Treasury notes as of the end of its fiscal second quarter, albeit we as investors can't tell what sort of maturity date these bonds have. Chances are they're short-term in nature, which would allow Apple to collect interest income and still have the flexibility to deploy its cash on an as-needed basis. If the Fed were to continue tightening monetary policy, which is the trajectory it's on now, Apple should be able to roll over its matured bonds, or reinvest more of its cash, into higher-yielding Treasury notes. That could mean even more money in the king of tech's pockets. In order for the Fed to continue tightening, the U.S. economy will need to show signs of GDP growth and low unemployment. These obviously aren't guarantees, but for the time being it's the trajectory we're on.  Needless to say, Apple's cash possibilities are seemingly endless at this point.   Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Matt Kapko (ARN) 11 March, 2017 07:00 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Comments Tim Cook - CEO, Apple and Bill McDermott - CEO, SAP The head of SAP’s developer initiative with Apple has high aspirations for the partnership and the impact it will have on enterprise mobility. “I believe what’s going to happen with the release of the SDK, and the continued innovation and investment, is that we’re going to create a new enterprise iOS developer,” said Rick Knowles, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Apple partnership at SAP. “It’s a rare developer that exists, but now we’re going to formalize this role and I believe we’re going to grow a new development community around iOS specifically in the enterprise." Apple goes straight to developers via SAP SAP represents the first of Apple’s enterprise partnerships that bring tools directly to developers. Both companies want to simplify the process for developers to integrate their apps with SAP’s massive backend systems of transactional data. The goal, through the release of an SDK and API library, is to transform the amount of information developers can use and call upon in their apps. SAP is pervasive in the enterprise, but the company is committed to becoming more open by making its services more readily available to businesses that don’t deal directly with SAP, according to Knowles. “This is not just for an SAP customer and SAP systems, it is also to be open to allow for connectivity and integration to non-SAP systems,” he added. Instead of coding for SAP integrations, developers can rely on a feature-rich API library that already ties into backend SAP systems.

The giant in ERP is committed to release updates to the SDK every four months. SAP also wants to accelerate development cycles for iOS apps and is pinning its success on a three-month turnaround. “If these cycles are not three months or less to do app development, then I believe we will not be serving the enterprise market correctly,” Knowles added. “We have to speed up the usability and flexibility of microservices for applications just like the consumer world.” Read more How Datacom transformed Santos' data through Cisco Knowles expects the SAP-Apple partnership to foster a new community of iOS enterprise developers and a growing ecosystem of partners who may not have a long history or interest in business applications. “I see a whole bunch of new names that we don’t normally think of as partners coming in to work with iOS specifically in the enterprise.” SAP’s efforts are “all designed to serve a growing community that we believe has to be built to change the usability and user experience in the enterprise,” Knowles added. The SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS is scheduled for release on March 30. “It’s real now, it’s not just a partnership of words.

Will it be Apple? Samsung? Or Microsoft? Or it will be all of the above. [ Fade to Black(Berry): 8 Years Covering the Rise and Fall of RIM ] "The entire landscape has shifted in a very short time," says Ojas Rege, vice president of strategy at mobile device management (MDM) vendor MobileIron, "and the key lesson is that it will continue to shift. When consumers call the shots, technologies can come and go rapidly." It wasn't so long ago when CIOs looked to BlackBerry, then called RIM, as a safe bet to build their mobile strategy. BlackBerry-only shops sprouted up across the country. Then came the iPhone, and the start of BlackBerry's troubles. A steady stream of companies has been leaving BlackBerry for a while now -- but lately there's been a rush. "Many companies who weren't sure of BlackBerry's future were willing to kick the can down the road," says CEO John Marshall at AirWatch, an MDM vendor. "That changed with BlackBerry's announcement to steeply reduce its workforce, and [it] really became the nail in the coffin that forced IT decision makers to shift to other platforms." All of AirWatch's customers are making the move away from BlackBerry, and Marshall says he's received an "overwhelming" number of requests from prospective customers looking to get off BlackBerry. Migration From BlackBerry: Opportunity for Vendors and Savings for IT This mass migration is a big opportunity for MDM, because MDM products tend to manage multiple devices and provide companies with flexibility. Both AirWatch and MobileIron are coming out with service offerings for migrating off BlackBerry and onto multi-platform support. It's this flexibility that will serve CIOs in the long run, MDM vendors say, as the days of supporting a single platform come to an end. For CIOs, there is a silver lining: Multi-platform support sans BlackBerry might be cheaper. "BlackBerry doesn't receive APIs from OEMs to provide more comprehensive levels of security," Marshall says. "From a cost perspective, most MDM providers charge less than BlackBerry for services, so, in many cases, companies will save money by migrating from BlackBerry, and they will no longer need to pay for both an MDM provider and the BES." BlackBerry aside, each mobile platform has its share of upsides and downsides for the enterprise. Apple Now Recognizes the Enterprise Let's start with Apple, which has shown signs of having a new appreciation for the enterprise. Apple recently released iOS 7, which is jam-packed with enterprise-class features, such as per-app-VPN, "Open in" management and enhanced data protection. Apple is also expected to release a critical "supervised device" service. For more on this, check out What Does iOS 7 Bring to the BYOD Party? Apple iPhone 5S Despite dwindling market share due to rival Android phones, particularly those from Samsung, iPhones are still a favorite in BYOD circles. CIOs won't have the power to choose to support iOS, rather the decision will be thrust upon them. In other words, they must support Apple devices. This isn't good news for CIOs who have been spurned by Apple in the past. Apple has traditionally made life difficult for IT by not providing product roadmaps and early looks at products before they're released to the general public. For instance, Apple hasn't released a date for its "supervised device" service, which has left iOS customers such as the Los Angeles Unified School District in a lurch. Samsung Goes on Enterprise Offensive Apple's recent overtures to businesses might also merely be a defensive move to take some of the sting out of rival Samsung's professed love for the enterprise, says Andrew Borg, research director at Aberdeen Group. Samsung hopes to counter Apple's consumer-friendly marketing message with an enterprise one. Samsung's enterprise courtship is expressed in two ways: SAFE, which stands for "Samsung for enterprise," and KNOX, as in, Fort Knox. According to AirWatch, SAFE devices are enterprise ready with enhanced device-level security and management capabilities, while KNOX devices offer enhanced security and management capabilities at a container level. "I think it's been a little confusing for the market," Aberdeen's Borg says. "They make great hardware. Their innovation around software user experience design is somewhat limited in part because they don't own the operating system." Announced in February, KNOX put Samsung ahead of Apple in the enterprise security and compliance game. The enterprise market has been lucrative for Samsung, with high margins, large volumes and economies of scale, Borg says. "Apple had to competitively respond." The downside to Samsung, of course, is that the company's phones are only a part (albeit, a big part) of the Android universe. Android in the enterprise has been flogged for its many flavors, security concerns and incompatibilities. KNOX, for instance, runs only on Samsung phones. Microsoft Completes the Big 3 of Enterprise Mobile Then there's Microsoft, which always seems to be hanging around the mobile market leaders despite so many missteps. "Microsoft will fill the gap left by BlackBerry in enterprise mobility, and they will increasingly compete in the mobile market alongside Samsung and Apple," says Bob Janssen, co-founder and CTO of RES Software. The fall of BlackBerry has forced CIOs to re-think their mobile strategy. It also ushers in a new era of mobility: There will be no single platform going forward. MobileIron's Reges says IT department need to build teams and processes around the idea of "constant mobile migration, whether from OS to OS, device to device, or app to app." "Your environment will always be multi-OS, and agility will be the key competence of the CIO of the future," he says, adding, "Not every CIO will survive this storm, but all have the opportunity to build disruption into a sustaining model for how to thrive in a world of constant change."

In January, changes made to the presentation and categorisation of Apple's revenue report revealed that the company is making more from its iTunes, software and services than it is from iPod sales, making it Apple's fourth largest business. In a new report, Asymco analyst Horace Dediu has highlighted that Apple's iTunes and accessories business is bringing in more revenue than every other phone vendor except Samsung is making from its mobile phone sales. Dediu's chart, as shown below, illustrates that Apple's iTunes and accessories business overtook Nokia's mobile phone revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012, and also brings in more revenue for Apple than Motorola, Sony, LG, RIM and HTC's mobile phone sales. Apple announced its best ever financial results during its earnings call for the first fiscal quarter of 2013 in January. The company posted a record revenue of $54.5bn (£34.8bn) for the quarter. The company sold 4.87 million iPhones in the quarter, compared to 37 million in the same quarter a year ago. Apple also sold a record 22.9 million iPads during the quarter compared to 15.4 million in the same quarter in 2012. Analyst projections ranged from 16.9 million to 32 million. Fewer Macs were sold: 4.1 million compared to 5.2 million last year. Should Mac sales continue to decline, Apple's iTunes, software and services revenues could soon overtake Mac revenues to become the Apple's third largest money maker.

Sign up now Menu ARN How BlackBerry recreated the mobile user experience with Z10 How BlackBerry recreated the mobile user experience with Z10 The jury is still out, but even most of the critical early reviews of the Z10 recognise the distinctiveness of the new UI John Cox (Network World) 15 February, 2013 17:13 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Exclusive Networks Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Samsung Communications Sektor Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments With the release of the BlackBerry Z10 smartphone, the company once known as Research in Motion has staked its future on an ambitious bet: that it could craft a new "mobile user experience" that would, by itself, prove a strong attraction for buyers. In practice, that means designing a new user interface that can smoothly exploit both the hardware and software features of not just the new smartphones, the all-touch Z10 and the qwerty-keyboard Q10, but also other types of mobile devices, from tablets to automotive systems to exotic embedded systems. To any number of critics, even thinking about doing so was delusional. RIM, now called BlackBerry, had leveraged the success of its corporate, wireless email devices into smartphone products that grew rapidly in popularity during the mid-2000s. Then Apple introduced the iPhone in mid-2007 and changed the end user expectations about what a mobile device should be like. BlackBerry users were still growing fast, from 8 million in 2007 to 70 million in 2011. [ FIRST LOOK: BlackBerry 10 smartphones ] But it couldn't keep pace with the growth of Android and Apple. And its own growth slowed dramatically in 2011, accompanied by a plunge in the stock price, and a widely held view that BlackBerry was finished. The jury is still out, but even most of the critical early reviews of the Z10 recognize the distinctiveness of the new UI. The BlackBerry Hub, a kind of integrated inbox for communications, alerts, and messaging and email, replaces the characteristic grid of apps that is the typical starting point for iOS and Android users today. The grid is still there, but you reach it with one of a new set of fluid gestures, which users have to invest some time in learning and practicing. The idea is that the Hub becomes both your focal and reference points, and from there you can bring up apps -- by a touch or a swipe -- in context with the tasks you want to perform. The Canadian company was depending on a relative newcomer, Don Lindsay, vice president of user experience design, to coordinate the effort to redefine not just the "BlackBerry experience," but the core "mobile experience" for users. Lindsay speaks quietly, unassertively, methodically and readily: He's given these issues a lot of thought. He was recruited from Microsoft, where he worked for about five years, where he was design director at Microsoft Live Labs. Before that, he spent 10 years in design at Apple, where he was design director for the Mac OS X User Experience Group. He also played a key role in BlackBerry's 2010 acquisition of The Astonishing Tribe (TAT), a relatively small but highly regarded design group in Malmo, Sweden, which already counted Samsung, Motorola and Google Android as mobile design clients. That was the same year that BlackBerry bought QNX Software, maker of a proven real-time operating system, which became the foundation on which the new BlackBerry user experience would be built. In a December 2012 story in The Wall Street Journal, Lindsay was quoted as saying that TAT has "been the single largest contributor to the design of the experience" for the BlackBerry 10 operating system. "They are driving all of this." But Lindsay credits RIM co-founder and longtime co-CEO Mihalis "Mike" Lazaridis with the initial vision displayed when he recruited Lindsay. "He recognized that [post-iPhone] there were expectations about how a consumer device should look like and behave," Lindsay says. Lazaridis has already brought in another relative newcomer, Senior Vice President Todd Wood, to reset the company's industrial design discipline for hardware. "[Lazaridis] wanted us to bring all this to bear at RIM," says Lindsay. "He saw this was not an area of strength for the company. His idea was to 'help us understand and create an experience that appeals to a larger audience. And help us bring it to market.'" Lindsay began doing so first with the legacy BlackBerry OS, versions 6 and 7. "We made good advances, but the older Blackberry platform put a lot of constraints on what we could actually change," he says. "It was only with BlackBerry 10 that we fully envisioned what BlackBerry needed to have to achieve that wider appeal." That process was guided by a number of basic principles and "core beliefs." One was "be true to BlackBerry," Lindsay says. That is, be true to what was dubbed the "BlackBerry DNA." "There was the real, recognized brand value of BlackBerry: productivity, efficiency, empowering the user," Lindsay says. "We had slogan: 'a tool, not a toy.' It was about providing an experience that would help users be productive, capture their ideas, express themselves, and engage with their communities. This was not new for BlackBerry." But the design group saw this "DNA" as an opportunity because rival platforms were, Lindsay says, "consumption and entertainment focused." "We wanted a broad base of the market to be contributors, not just consumers," he says. Another principle was purposeful design. "One-handed use [of the smartphone] is one example," Lindsay says. "If you have a mobile handset operated with one hand [specifically one thumb], then that influences decisions like the size of the targets on the touch screen, the position of elements, and so on." But the designers carried this farther, by realizing that they could combine one-handed and two-handed operations. "It can be very useable with one hand but more useable with two, using two thumbs," Lindsay says. For example, using both while you're triaging email in your inbox. You can touch a message with one thumb, see the contextual [task] menu come up, and hit the 'delete' key [or 'reply'] with your other thumb. You can develop a rhythm of interaction." One of the most influential principles was what the designers term "cinematic experience." Lindsay says that some outsiders think this refers only to the phone's ability to play high-definition video and its HDMI port. "But for us it translates into 'a large screen, entirely filled by the [user] experience,'" he says. "We're giving application developers control over every pixel on the screen, not reserving some of them for things like [showing] battery life or signal strength or a virtual home button. It creates a more immersive user experience. And it also gives more room to a sweeping panorama and gestures. It was this that led us to consider using gestures instead of buttons." One result: simple, sensuous and unfailingly consistent gestures for navigating the phone and improving the experience of working with it. "We called it 'stroking not poking,'" Lindsay says. Working through the implications of this eventually led designers to BlackBerry Peek, pressing on a screen and sliding it to the side to see something else "underneath" it, such as battery life or other system indicators. Eventually, Lindsay says, the designers realized they could use the gesture to peek into more and more areas, such as the Hub and then into email and text messages, without abandoning the initial or "top" app. Lindsay says he's read a few reviews of the Z10 and BB10, by reviewers he respects. "The general sentiment, I think, is that they think it is innovative and [that] we have a clear value proposition," he says. "We are attempting to innovate. And with innovation comes new challenges, especially in how to train and educate customers to use the new UI." To do that, the Z10 comes with a simple fold-out pamphlet that illustrates the gestures, and the phone itself offers a quick tutorial that new users can't avoid. "The common sentiment [among reviewers] is that there is a very short learning period at the beginning," Lindsay says. "But the reward of having learned that is [that] it becomes very intuitive and very natural." Lindsay would only talk generally about the design team's current priorities. But he started by emphasizing that "BB10 is a mobile computing platform." "The Z10 and Q10 are just the first two devices," he says. "The challenge is, can we define a platform experience that scales across a wide array of possible device implementations? How do we define a platform that scales appropriately for that? Can we ensure the platform 'holds together' as we move from one device to another?"

Is Android in the business world to stay? Why has Android's dominance taken such a long time to translate into broader uptake in the business world? Jon Gold (Network World) 02 April, 2013 11:16 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Exclusive Networks Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Sektor Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments It's official, and it's been official for a while -- Android is far and away the most popular smartphone OS in America. Ever since January 2011, when the platform surpassed RIM to take the top spot for the first time in comScore's monthly market share rankings, Google's operating system has continued to grow its user base, which accounts for 52% of the market as of this January. This growth has been created on the back of substantial software upgrades, in the form of Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean (Android 4.0 and 4.1, respectively), as well as increasingly impressive hardware from OEMs like Samsung, HTC, Sony, Motorola and LG. Last year's Samsung Galaxy S III was the first phone to dethrone the iPhone in total quarterly sales in years, according to research from Strategy Analytics, though the subsequent release of the iPhone 5 saw Apple retake the top spot quickly thereafter. [ DO'S AND DON'TS: Using Android in business ] It's easy to find a host of reasons for Android's ascendance among consumers -- a wide variety of devices offers more choice to prospective buyers, stronger hardware and bigger screens appeal to fans of the latest and greatest, and as of Android 4.0 and 4.1, the interface is arguably more impressive than the latest version of Apple iOS. What's less simple, however, is figuring out why that dominance has taken such a long time to translate into broader uptake in the business world -- the conventional wisdom is that the iPhone supplanted the BlackBerry as the enterprise smartphone of choice thanks to its own wave of popularity with the consumer, which gave rise to the bring-your-own-device phenomenon. In contrast, Android has only recently begun to become a popular option for business users, despite its ballooning overall sales numbers. So what gives? New management, new use cases For starters, the perception of security issues in the Android platform have limited its appeal to businesses and made IT departments jumpy about a large number of Android devices accessing the network. However, the past year or so has seen big changes in that state of affairs, says Morten Grauballe, an executive vice president in charge of corporate development and strategy at Red Bend Software, which provides over-the-air firmware update capability to many top Android OEMs. "Android had a disadvantage in the enterprise compared to iOS because iOS was just more secure," Grauballe says. "What's happened over the last 12 months is that the mobile device management solutions that evolved around both iOS and Android ... [have] grown in functionality when it comes to supporting the devices, so I think CIOs in enterprises are feeling more comfortable letting Android devices on their network." Along with improved manageability, Forrester analyst David Johnson says that a new crop of use cases is helping broaden Android adoption in the business world. One such new application is what he calls "Android-on-a-stick," which is designed to provide a full desktop experience for highly mobile users like college students and consultants. "Basically it's a headless Android device -- complete with quad-core CPU, but it's on a stick that has an HDMI end on it," Johnson explains. "[Users] can plug it into most any monitor or television that has an HDMI port and it works, but is powered by a USB port. Embedded Bluetooth and Wi-Fi allow it to connect to a keyboard and mouse, and gain access to a network." Moreover, the idea of dedicated-use consumer devices running Android is beginning to get more popular, he says. "There is significant interest in using low-cost, consumer-grade tablets and smartphones for a whole host of new uses, from movie ticket scanning at the theater front door, to electronic on-board recorders (EOBR) for truckers," according to Johnson. "In applications where the device needs to be fully ruggedized, Android is preferred because manufacturers can build the devices precisely to suit the need." Custom devices aside, the cost advantages of Android are substantial for this type of bespoke application, particularly in the tablet sector. To give an example: A Google Nexus 7 tablet, as of this writing, retails for $200. That buys a 7-inch, 216ppi display, 16GB of storage and 1GB of RAM. By contrast, the cheapest iPad option available, at $329, is the basic version of the iPad Mini, which has a larger but lower-resolution screen and half as much available RAM with the same amount of storage. Android popular now, but plenty of future demand for Apple A recent survey of nearly 10,000 global IT workers performed by Forrester Research offers a clear indication that Android adoption in the enterprise has grown -- along with several statistics that could mean that growth will be short-lived. According to the February Mobile Workforce Adoption Survey, Android has actually surpassed Apple as the most-used type of business smartphone, as shown below: While that's clearly an important milestone, particularly in light of the fact that nearly half of respondents said they used smartphones in the course of their duties, the study also found that one-third of those wanted an iPhone for their next work device, compared to just 22% who wanted an Android phone. Despite the aforementioned economic advantages for Android tablets, the business tablet world still appears to be Apple's. The iPad's usage share among Forrester's respondents is more than double the size of Android's. The numbers also show that Apple tablets are more desired by the IT workers surveyed, by a ratio of about 2:1. (As a side note, there's a surprisingly large amount of interest in Windows tablets, outstripping both Android and Apple.) Clearly, while Google's platform has made progress in the business world, there are major hurdles to overcome. iOS users dipping toes into Android The case of one user, who primarily uses iOS but has taken baby steps toward Android adoption, is illustrative. Banner Engineering is a Minneapolis-based manufacturer of industrial equipment like sensors, machine safety systems and wireless controllers. The company's enormous selection of available products -- more than 30,000 individual SKUs -- means that providing detailed information on each one is a challenge for sales representatives in the field. "The old story was our sales reps and distributors would travel around in their cars with trunk loads full of literature and product material," says IT Director Kellie Christensen. "If you go to a customer and they ask about a certain product application opportunity, you may or may not have that material handy." Obviously, this was far from an optimal solution, so Banner embarked on a project that brought these reams of documentation to the digital realm. The company now issues iPads to sales staff, who can use them as a reference and presentation tool. "One of our specialties is [working] with our customer to specialize products -- so we'll have a standard product ... and if they need a slight modification to that product, or even an extensive one, we work with that customer to create what we call product specials," Christensen says. With just one device manufacturer to support, iOS seemed like the logical choice. "Internally, we chose iOS because it's a lot more predictable, a lot more secure. It's really been quite easy for us to support," she says. "We're a smaller shop, we have a smaller IT group here, and [Android] would just be too much for us to support." However, Banner works with channel partners as well as its own sales staff. And not all of those partners wanted to use the iPad. Christensen says that the company used a third-party developer to translate the app over to Android. The process was pleasantly straightforward, she notes. "It actually was fairly easy to port [the app] over to Android devices. The biggest thing that we were dealing with from a design standpoint was that the screen was different ... and making sure that those buttons were still friendly to use and that everything could be seen on the screen," Christensen says. Mobility vets: Don't sweat security, fragmentation too much CompanionLink Software Marketing Director Rushang Shah says that this multi-platform environment has its own appeal to businesses, complexity issues aside. "The business audience we've always catered to is one that values options more than being tied into one system like Apple," he argues. "That is one of the major drivers of Android's growth in the business market -- business users want options." CompanionLink has made mobile device sync software since the days of Palm OS. Shah says CEO Wayland Bruns was one of about 30 people present at Palm's first developer conference, 18 years ago. While the conventional wisdom holds that the two main factors holding back Android growth are security and platform fragmentation, Bruns and Shah say they question how valid those concerns still are. According to Bruns, the issues caused by the complexity of the Android environment -- different devices, different software versions, etc. -- have been evaporating of late. The credit for this goes to Google, he says. Ever since Android versions 2.2 and 2.3 (Froyo and Gingerbread), the company has been energetically attacking fragmentation problems. "The API functions are better than ever at allowing us to add a new feature for new phones, and still be able to run the same software on older phones. Two years ago, we were bombarded by bugs and incompatibilities related to obscure phone models," Bruns says. "It has now been months since we have had such problems, even though we support the older phones as well as the newest Jelly Bean phones and tablets." As to security, Shah says, there's nothing intrinsically less secure about the Android platform than iOS. "Inherently, I don't think there's anything about the Android platform that's more risky than iOS. Yeah, Apple has this aura of 'we lock down things' but ... it's just as risky," he says. Android/Chrome? But will Android still be Android tomorrow? Rumors that Google would merge the mobile OS with its growing Chrome ecosystem started in earnest after the news in mid-March that longtime Android chief Andy Rubin would be making way for Sundar Pichai, who heads up Chrome and Google Apps. The answer, for the moment, is yes, according to Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, who said that the two products would remain separate during a recent trip to India. That said, tight integration with Google's existing product infrastructure -- from Gmail to Google + to any number of other offerings -- has long been a hallmark of Android, and further blurring of the lines between Chrome and Android is far from impossible.

Linux-based platforms are gunning for iOS and Android, and Chinese companies want to price the iPhone and the Galaxy S line out of the market. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 26 January, 2013 12:11 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology CertaOne Com1 International Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Samsung Communications Sektor Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Vendors HP Huawei Comments Just five years ago, the global epicenters of the mobile phone universe included Finland and Canada, where Nokia and Research In Motion are headquartered. After the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007, and after Android phones started getting really good, iOS and Android devices began their sustained assault on market share, and today they dominate totally. From the perspective of who is making the majority of physical smartphone handsets, the clear leader is South Korea's Samsung, which sells more than one quarter of the world's smartphone handsets, followed by Apple, which sells about 18%. No other company gets anywhere near a two-digit market share globally. From the perspective of platforms -- who makes the operating systems and controls both the functionality and the app ecosystem that powers the world's smartphones -- it's clear that Google's Android is by far the world's leader, followed distantly by Apple's iOS. From a business perspective - who's making money on mobile phones in one way or the other - the clear winners are Apple, Google (via advertising, mostly) and Samsung. So today, we can say that the smartphone market is solidly controlled by two companies that are less than nine miles apart from each other in Silicon Valley in the U.S. (Apple and Google), plus Samsung in South Korea. These three companies in two countries ship the handsets, make the operating systems and collect most of the profits. But what will the mobile market look like five years from now? Meet the new operating systems All is not well in the universe of mobile platforms, or operating systems. Apple's iOS platform used to be much better loved by Apple fans. It had by far the most and best apps, and it was perceived by most to be innovative and leading edge. But the Android platform is either catching up to, or has already surpassed, iOS in both innovation, as well as the quantity and quality of available apps. When you combine software improvements on Android with a vastly greater variety of available handsets, many former iPhone users are defecting to the other side, or thinking about it. While users are growing ever fonder of the Android platform and its apps, hardware makers that create Android-powered phones are growing less fond. The issue is direct competition from Google itself. Google has twice launched phone initiatives where it decided to sell Google-branded phones. The first initiative was in early 2010 when Google launched the Nexus One, followed by the Nexus S. They were manufactured by HTC, but the fact that Google was involved in their design and sold them directly gave the phones a huge advantage over any phone HTC might sell -- or any phone HTC's competitors might sell. Google later came out with the Galaxy Nexus (made by Samsung) and later still the Nexus 4. Google also bought Motorola last year, both for the patents and also presumably to assert some control over the direction of Android mobile devices. The first serious assertion of that control may be the development of a device called the Google X phone, which is being developed at Motorola and which is expected to be unveiled at Google's May developer's conference, Google I/O. Nobody knows what the Google X phone (and tablet) will be like, but hints, rumors and speculation agree that it will be very different from existing Android phones. All this strong competition from Google makes handset makers wonder whether Google is friend or foe, and whether they might be better off with another software platform. These disaffected Google partners may be looking more closely at Microsoft's Windows Phone 8, now that Nokia reported some impressive numbers (both of which included the numeral 4, oddly enough): The company sold 4.4 million Lumia Windows Phone devices and reported a year-over-year quarterly U.S. market revenue increase of 444%. Although the market punished Nokia's earnings, a careful analyst might notice that Nokia's Lumia line failed horribly in the so-called "emerging markets" of China and elsewhere, but succeeded in the U.S. and Europe. The company is making more money on far fewer handsets than before. In other words, Windows Phone 8 may be helping Nokia's economic situation become less like Google's (high volume, low margin) and more like Apple's (high margin, low volume). Beyond iOS, Android and Windows Phone, there are other emerging platforms under consideration by some current Android handset makers. In fact, Google's biggest and most profitable Android partner, Samsung, is supporting a new platform called Tizen. (Intel is also a backer.) If Samsung switched from Android to Tizen, the phone platform scene would be transformed overnight. The first Tizen devices are expected within three months. Mozilla, the people who make the Firefox browser, are developing the Firefox OS for smartphones. The first Firefox phones are expected to hit next month. The people at Ubuntu Linux, the most popular client version of that operating system, are building a version for smartphones. HP's WebOS, acquired from Palm, is still a potential factor, especially since HP plans to release an open-source version called Open WebOS. Note that all of these platforms -- Tizen, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Linux and Open WebOS -- are Linux-based and all or most will be relatively open compared with Android. Meet the new handset makers While upstart platforms threaten to take advantage of weaknesses in the iOS and Android worlds, a similar thing is happening in handsets. Right now, Samsung and Apple dominate. But in China and in other markets, Chinese companies are growing faster than the global leaders. Sometime this year, we'll reach the point where half the mobile phones sold in the world will be smartphones, rather than feature phones. The reason for that shift is partly caused by a drastic reduction in pricing for smartphones, thanks to low-cost Chinese brands. And also high-end brands. In China itself, for example, Samsung is the No. 1 handset maker. But No. 2 is Lenovo, a Chinese company, and its handset business is profitable, too. According to one article, there are more than 100 Chinese companies now making smartphone handsets, and they all want to be Samsung. Rumors have been circulating that Lenovo is in talks to buy RIM -- a development that, combined with continued aggressive growth, could thrust Lenovo into Samsung territory as a global maker of phones. So if Samsung is No. 1 and Lenovo is No. 2, Apple must be No. 3, right? Wrong! No. 3 in the Chinese market is Huawei, followed by ZTE, followed by Coolpad. By unit sales, Apple is the No. 6 handset maker in China -- and its market share is shrinking. These companies, especially Huawei and ZTE, are bringing the smartphone revolution to emerging markets, for the most part. And now they want entry into the U.S. and European markets. Huawei and ZTE each had a large presence at the International CES trade show, which served as a kind of coming out party for those companies in the U.S. Samsung and Apple fans may scoff at the idea that some obscure Chinese brand like Huawei or ZTE could take market share away from the leaders. But if either or both of these companies can make phones that are 95% as good as Samsung's best phone, and cost half the price, people are going to buy them in large numbers. Apple, Google and Samsung control the global market for smartphones. But over the next year or two, all that could change as new software platforms and new handset makers take advantage of the leaders' stumbles to gobble up market share, market power and influence over the direction of mobile devices.

In short, while the company is still coming from behind in a market that it once owned, the conditions for a relaunch would likely never be better. This week I attended the event that launched the new Blackberry 10 phones, renamed the company and announced Blackberry's answer to Steve Jobs, musician Alicia Keys. The company is far from being out of the woods -for starters, most folks won't be able to buy the new phones for several weeks-but this was a strong start down the ever-more-possible path to restoring Blackberry to glory. How BlackBerry Is Following Steve Jobs' Script I often think CEOs look at their more successful peers and think, "Gee, if I do what the more successful guy is doing, he may get the credit for my success." Most, then, seem to do their level best to blame others for their eventual failure. Whether in sports or in business, there is no dishonor in using tactics that work. Jobs copied from, and improved on, Louis Gerstner's work and still got most of the credit. There were three core elements to the Apple recovery: Get people to believe that Apple could return, create and maintain a super advocate (Steve Jobs himself) and simplify the product lines to assure high quality, high margins and superior execution. The increase in value for Blackberry stock, which doubled prior to the launch, showcased strong behind-the-scenes efforts to convince people that BlackBerry can come back. Alicia Keys came on board to fulfill the role of super advocate and indicated she would be taking a hands-on approach to her product influence. Finally, the company focused on two products, the Z and Q series phones, which will form the basis for the initial turnaround effort. In Pictures: The New BlackBerry 10 SmartphonesVideos: New BlackBerry 10 Virtual Keyboard and 'Story Maker' Let's look at the three core elements to a comeback in more depth. New Name, New Image? Jobs bent over backwards to get investors on board with his recovery effort. He even went to Bill Gates, who he thought stole Windows from him, to get the initial investment to open the door for others. Later, he removed the word "computer" from Apple's name to make sure people understood the firm wasn't the old Apple and should instead be seen as something new and different. News: Goodbye, Research in Motion; Hello, BlackBerryAnalysis: BlackBerry 10 Will Determine Firm's Fate as a Premier Mobile Device Player The executive team at Blackberry has been working overtime to gain the trust of investors who have flocked to the company, doubling its valuation. Changing the name of the company to Blackberry makes sure people see it as new and different. The end result is a company with a product line even simpler than Apple's and a name equally focused on the future. Can a Celebrity Be BlackBerry's Super Advocate? I doubt we'll ever see another CEO with this skill like Jobs-at least not at a company the size of Apple or Blackberry. In addition, Cook's tenure at Apple shows the value in separating the role of CEO and super advocate when someone who fills both roles leaves the company. Analysis: 3 Obstacles to Restoring the BlackBerry Brand It's easy to get jaded by the number of celebrities that suddenly seem to by tying themselves to companies. Most seem to be paid shills who aren't really doing the type of product advocate job that Jobs did. Keys, named BlackBerry's Global Creative Director, attests that she's in this for the long haul; furthermore, she plans to meet with BlackBerry engineers to make sure her views are heard-and if they aren't, then she will leave. We haven't heard that level of commitment from other celebrity endorsers, suggesting this may be something more. Still, without any real authority and a career to manage, we need to revisit this at that end of the year to see if Keys has really stepped up to being a Super Advocate or is just another star looking for some extra pocket money. I think she's sincere, but I've been fooled before. Z10 Looks Forward, Q10 Looks Back BlackBerry clearly has a tight focus on the business customer and loyal user. The BlackBerry Z10 smartphone, which looks and feels like an improved iPhone 5, targets the business user, and its initial "showcase" partnerships and apps are with enterprise vendors BMC, Citrix and SAP. This doesn't mean BlackBerry doesn't have fun stuff, but outdoing either Android or iOS with consumers and entertainment is likely impossible. However, outdoing these platforms in ways that business people will appreciate is a place where BlackBerry is arguably the best in the market. Blog: The 'Top BlackBerry 10 Apps,' from BlackBerry Finally, like Apple, BlackBerry had to preserve what is left of its very loyal fan base. The Q10 takes the smartphone back to its two-way pager roots with a physical keyboard and an updated industrial design that's still clearly Blackberry. If Apple Can Do It, Blackberry Can, Too News: New BlackBerry Phones Don't Wow Investors, But Analysts See Promise Not all is a bed of roses, though. Unlike an Apple product launch, the new Blackberry phones aren't available closely after launch. Alicia Keys remains untested, too, and BlackBerry has yet to roll out its ad campaign. Still, as far as launches go, this is one of the better ones I've attended, and BlackBerry will have better carrier coverage than either Palm or Apple had when they started. In short, this no longer looks like RIM's year; it's looking like Blackberry's year. Rob Enderle is president and principal analyst of the Enderle Group.

A rising tide seems to be lifting most, though not all, boats in the tech sector. The Nasdaq computer index closed Friday at 1586.15, up by more than 18 points, as all major U.S. exchanges rose on upbeat economic data. U.S. employers added 157,000 jobs in January, and added an average of 181,000 jobs a month during 2012, according to updated figures released Friday by the Labor Department. The revised figure is better than the 153,000 jobs added per month that was previously reported. The new figures fueled gains Friday for all major U.S. exchanges and indexes, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 indexes had their best January since the 1990s. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 14,009.79 Friday, which was the first time it topped 14,000 since 2007. Good sales numbers from major IT vendors over the past few weeks have played a big part in the general optimism. On Friday shares of tech industry heavyweights including IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, EMC and Google all closed up. Despite the general optimism, the newly rechristened BlackBerry, which shed its former brand name Research In Motion Wednesday when it launched its new BlackBerry 10 products, has been running into headwinds. The two new devices debuting at the New York event -- the touchscreen BlackBerry Z10 and a handset with a physical keyboard, the BlackBerry Q10 -- were designed essentially from scratch around a new platform based on QNX, an operating system the company acquired in 2010. Though analysts applauded the overhauled BlackBerry 10 platform interface, the company's March launch date for the U.S. disappointed. "The March date for the US launch is a bad surprise -- announcing a device over a month before launch is never great," said Jan Dawson, chief telecom analyst at Ovum. BlackBerry shares dropped by US$1.88 to $13.78 Wednesday and declined again Thursday before rising with the rest of the market Friday. Caution also greeted Facebook's earnings announcement Wednesday, even though the social networking company reported a 40 percent year-over- year jump in fourth-quarter revenue, to $1.59 billion. Facebook also posted its first quarterly profit ever, generating net income of $64 million for the quarter. But expenses also rose significantly, causing investors to balk. Facebook shares slumped $0.26 to $30.98 Thursday and continued to decline Friday, to $29.73 Apple also can't seem to catch a break. Shares closed down at $453.62 Friday, well below the company's 52-week high of $705.07. Though the company last week posted an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter, profits were flat as it faced increasing competition from Android-based mobile devices. The share slump Friday came even after Strategy Analytics reported earlier in the day that Apple outsold Samsung Electronics to become the number-one mobile phone vendor in the U.S. for the first time ever during the fourth quarter. The good news for the market in general was that mobile phone shipments rose 4 percent annually to reach 52 million units in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012, according to Strategy Analytics. "The growth was driven by robust demand among consumers for 4G smartphones and 3G feature phones," said Neil Shah, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics, in the report. Otherwise, tech earnings news this week was good. Enterprise software vendor earnings, for example, showed a healthy market for business applications. Cloud-based business application vendor NetSuite said Thursday that revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $85 million, a 33 percent increase over the prior year. Total revenue for the year was $308.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 31 percent. Storage vendor EMC reported that it experienced a fourth-quarter revenue jump of 8 percent, fueled by solid gains at its VMware subsidiary, while profit rose 5 percent. Revenue was $6 billion for the fourth quarter, while net income hit $870 million. On the hardware front, Lenovo Wednesday said quarterly profit skyrocketed 34 percent year over year to a company record of $205 million, as revenue rose by 12 percent to US$9.4 billion. Though PC sales are expected to grow slowly this year for the industry as a whole, Lenovo was helped by gains in its smartphone business in its home market of China.

Apple announced the first investment that will come out of its newly-established Advanced Manufacturing Fund will go to Corning. One highlight for intended use of funds centers around the company’s glass processing research and development with a plant in Harrodsburg, Kentucky of particular focus. Corning partnered with Apple to debut and implement Gorilla Glass in 2007 for the original iPhone, an endeavor that has sustained 1,000 positions in the glass-maker’s R&D ranks, 400 of which are in Harrodsburg. Infinite Loop initiated its Advanced Manufacturing Fund with a $1 billion seed that may grow if needed. Image: Apple Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Is Now The World's Biggest Dividend Payer What Apple earnings run-down would be complete without checking in on the company's capital return program? Motley Fool Staff May 13, 2017 at 7:11AM When the company reported earnings earlier this month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced it was adding another $50 billion to its capital return program, focusing heavily on share repurchases. In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior tech specialist Evan Niu discuss Apple's cash position and new standing as the world's largest dividend payer.  A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 5, 2017. Dylan Lewis: I think one place that the company has been super clear, though, is its capital return program. They obviously made some new announcements related to that. Do you want to touch on that, Evan? Evan Niu: Every March or April, basically this fiscal second-quarter earnings, this is now, every year, this has become the traditional schedule, that's when they provide updates to the capital return program. This year, the update was pretty in line with previous years. It's a total increase of about $50 billion, and they're allocating most of that to share repurchases. About $35 billion is going toward share repurchases, the other $15 billion going toward dividends. Their shares repurchase authorization is going from $175 billion to $210 billion. To date, they've purchased right about $151 billion. They have about $60 billion of authorization that will last them until next year. And the overall size of the increase this year is pretty much in line with historical standards, yet, at the same time, their cash continues to grow to ridiculous, unheard-of levels. On a gross basis, they're now sitting on over a quarter-trillion dollars in cash. Of course, the vast majority of that is overseas, and that's before you factor in the net debt they've been raising. They actually just raised more debt this week. But, they have so much cash, and even though they're very aggressive at giving it back, they generate it so fast that they still add to their pile of money every quarter. Of course, the big challenge with trying to do more with that is the whole repatriation thing. Maybe the Trump administration will actually have some type of holiday. There's been a lot of talk about that. But at this point, it's still pretty uncertain, if that will happen sometime. If there is a one-time repatriation deal, either deemed repatriation or a one-time thing, I do think Apple would take that opportunity to bring quite a bit of cash back. But, at the same time, I think we have to acknowledge that the majority of their capital needs are actually outside of the U.S. Lewis: Because that's where a lot of the manufacturing and all the tooling is, right? Niu: Right, that's a big piece of it. The majority of their capital expenditures is for product and tooling equipment. This equipment is installed at contract manufacturers in Asia. It's their equipment, but they are putting it in their partners' facilities, which are all located international. Plus, on top of that, in terms of retail store expansion, the U.S. retail network for Apple stores is already pretty mature. Over the past few years, they've been really focusing on growing the footprint internationally. Those stores are pretty expensive, especially when you think about how nice Apple makes the stores. They use really high-quality materials. They put a lot of money into their stores because that's the way they want to make the experience. So, between increasing retail footprint internationally and the fact that the majority of the capital expenditures are concentrated in Asia, they do need to keep quite a bit of money out internationally. But, obviously, they don't need anywhere near $230 billion internationally, that's just ridiculous. So, I do think there's an opportunity to bring some back if you get a repatriation holiday. Maybe, as far as what they would do with it, pay down some of the debt to restrengthen the balance sheet, maybe a special, one-time dividend. I'm not a fan of the whole "make a huge blockbuster acquisition" idea, which some people like to talk about. I think that would be kind of irresponsible. But, we'll see what happens. It really hinges on this idea of a tax repatriation, because that would allow them to really bring back more and either give it back or do something more productive with it. Lewis: Yeah, I think that will probably be one of the biggest stories to watch in 2017 for Apple and the Trump administration. You touched on the dividend a little bit. It's worth noting here, they did boost their quarterly dividend payment 10.5%, it is now $0.63 per share. Now, Apple is the world's largest dividend payer, it just passed ExxonMobil, which is just another fun tidbit about the scale of their business and how quickly they are printing cash. Niu: Yeah, I think they're estimating it at $13 billion a year, which is the size of medium-sized companies, just in dividends. Lewis: Yeah. Evan, anything else before we switch things over to Facebook, on Apple? It seems to me like this kind of a humming-along, boring quarter for this company. A lot of the intrigue for Apple in 2017 would come with a tax repatriation holiday, or when they actually show what the next model of the iPhone looks like. So, it's kind of a wait-and-see quarter for investors. Niu: Yeah, this quarter seasonally isn't really too exciting. Obviously, the fourth quarter, the holiday quarter, that's where the more exciting stuff comes in. So, yeah, I agree, it's kind of more of the same, executing very well. I think the services piece is probably the most important thing that we talked about. Other than that, overall, a pretty solid quarter. Dylan Lewis owns shares of Apple, ExxonMobil, and Facebook.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Warren Buffett Stocks You Shouldn't Be Buying Right Now IBM, Apple, and individual airlines might not be the most attractive holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio to buy right now. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) May 13, 2017 at 8:21AM Warren Buffett's stock-picking prowess is envy-inspiring, but his recent comments to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) investors suggest to me that Main Street investors ought to press the pause button before buying shares in IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and individual airline stocks, such as United Continental (NYSE:UAL). Valuation prompts selling, not buying IBM has been pushing hard into next-generation, cloud-based solutions, but despite fast growth in these strategic segments, the company's legacy businesses continue to falter, and that's weighing down sales and profit. IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL Warren Buffett has been one of IBM's biggest supporters, but last weekend, he admitted he's cut his massive stake in IBM shares by one-third. He remains one of IBM's biggest shareholders (Berkshire Hathaway owned about  81 million shares exiting the first quarter), but in the past, when he starts selling, he continues selling until he doesn't own any more shares (exhibit A: Wal-Mart). In explaining his decision to sell a big chunk of his IBM shares, he explained that once shares hit $180, he felt they were valued at levels that made sense to sell, not buy. He also acknowledged on CNBC last week that IBM has "run into some very tough competition." IBMs shares have fallen to about $151, and when Buffett was asked if he's selling more shares at these prices, he replied, "I don't think we will be selling." The word "think" leads me to believe he's not against the idea, and it suggests to me that if shares climb, he could sell more of his position. Since he's still sitting on over 50 million shares, the risk that he'll sell on a rally makes buying IBM less attractive to me. No longer cheap Buffett's made a lot of money buying Apple, but his recent comments about the company's valuation suggest he's sitting on his current position, not buying more shares. He first bought Apple stock after weak iPhone sales caused shares to drop in 2015. At those post-drop prices, Buffett said last week that Apple "didn't have to do a lot better in the future than they were doing at the current time" to justify the price he was paying. Today, that may not be the case anymore. Buffett probably isn't going to be selling his Apple shares anytime soon, but he was noncommittal when he was asked last week if he's still a buyer. Instead, he hinted that buying Apple at today's prices is difficult, because, in his words, "I'm cheap ... and there's always an anchoring problem with buying stocks. We used to buy 'em, at X, and actually it's harder to buy 'em at higher prices." Apple's shares are up 68% since last April, so it's understandable that Buffett might be struggling to justify paying more to buy Apple shares today. After all, he owns a ton of shares already. According to filings, he's got $19 billion riding on the company. Overall, while Apple is a Motley Fool recommendation, his comments suggest to me that if you're long Apple already, the best bet is to stay put. If you haven't bought it yet, perhaps waiting until valuation gets Buffett-worthy is wise. Investing in individual airlines is hard Buffett surprised everyone when he became a big investor in America's biggest airlines, including United Continental, last year. His buying was arguably out of character, given that he's joked in the past that a surefire way to become a millionaire is to start out as a billionaire and then invest in an airline. Perhaps that's why he decided to buy a slate of airline stocks, rather than concentrate his risk in just one of them. After all, he describes his past investment in U.S. Air, an airline that went broke twice, as a "really dumb investment."  His interest in airline stocks nowadays isn't a mystery. Bankruptcies and mergers have removed excess capacity and boosted load factors, improving pricing power, and undeniably, that's helping airlines deliver greater growth. However, airlines still face inherent risks that make picking individual airline stocks hard, and it isn't easy for individual investors to diversify across the industry the way Buffett did. Furthermore, I don't think airlines will be a long-term investment for Berkshire Hathaway. Instead, I think it's more of an opportunistic investment that's similar to how Buffett has invested in oil stocks in the past. Despite its changes, the airline industry remains fiercely competitive, and price transparency removes a lot of an airline operator's ability to price seats at a premium to its competitors. The industry also faces risks associated with payroll costs and volatile jet-fuel prices. Furthermore, innovation is difficult, because the minute one airline does something right, it's bound to be copied quickly. In short, while airlines enjoy tailwinds because of a strong economy, there's no shortage of things that could go wrong and ultimately make these stocks less attractive to Buffett. If I'm right, then Berkshire Hathaway could as easily become a seller of these stocks in the future as it was a buyer, and Buffett will have sold his position long before you get a chance.   Todd Campbell owns shares of Apple. His clients may have positions in the companies mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Berkshire Hathaway (B shares).

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Inc.'s iPhone 8 Expected to Start at $999 Per one analyst, Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 will start at a higher price than previous iPhone models. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 13, 2017 at 7:00AM In a new research note from analysts with Goldman Sachs (via Barron's), the pricing of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming premium iPhone, widely referred to as iPhone 8, has seemingly been revealed. Per the analysts, the baseline iPhone 8 model, which will apparently sport 128 gigabytes of storage, will be priced at $999. There will also reportedly be a version with 256 gigabytes of storage for $1,099. Image source: Apple. What does this mean for Apple, its customers, and its stock? Let's dive in. An average selling price boost Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski predicts that for fiscal year 2018, Apple's iPhone average selling price will be $763 -- a substantial boost from the $645 that it saw in fiscal year 2016 and even a solid jump from the $694 average selling price that the company's iPhone business saw in the first quarter of Apple's fiscal year 2017 (which should represent the peak for the fiscal year). Underlying her assumption is that the bulk of Apple's iPhone shipments in fiscal year 2018 -- 58%, to be precise -- will consist of the premium-priced iPhone 8 models. Only time will tell how accurate Jankowski's product mix and average selling price assumptions ultimately prove to be (even Apple will be "guessing" at this point), but I do think that the general trend that Jankowski is expecting will play out; the only question is of magnitude, not general direction. A note on sustainability It's easy for investors to be focused on how compelling Apple's upcoming product cycle could ultimately be. Indeed, it's been a while since Apple has brought substantial changes to the look and feel of its iPhone lineup (despite, of course, many technical/functional innovations), and Apple is trying something new by introducing premium models. Indeed, for both Apple stockholders as well as individuals who simply enjoy buying and using Apple products, this year promises to be exciting. However, there is the question of the sustainability of the average selling price boost that Apple's iPhone business is likely to enjoy this year. If the iPhone 8 winds up being a substantial part of Apple's iPhone mix this year, then it'll be due to the combination of very compelling new features on the iPhone 8 as well as the iPhone 7s/7s+ not being all that exciting. It seems unlikely to me that Apple won't waterfall many of the innovations that it brings to the iPhone 8 down to the cheaper models for the product cycle that'll begin in the fall of 2018. What this could mean, then, is that Apple will need to do one of two things: Deal with average selling price erosion in that cycle, or find ways to keep the "premium" iPhone models several steps ahead of the more mainstream models. The first option is the easier of the two, but clearly a substantial year-over-year iPhone average selling price regression following a so-called "super-cycle" wouldn't be the best way for Apple to maximize shareholder value. The second option is the "obvious" direction to go, but that is far easier said than done. Apple is clearly investing substantially in research and development to try to fuel future innovations, but at the same time, not all major technological innovations (e.g. ,3D Touch) are effective in driving increased demand. Indeed, the "innovation" that drove Apple's last major upgrade cycle was simply the transition to larger displays. The "innovations" that are expected to drive this year's major upgrade cycle (should it happen) are a full-face display and new look and feel. Can Apple bring innovations like this to market each year from here on out? Only time will tell. Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The device could be of great help to heart patients, according to a ‘Health e-heart’ study conducted by University of California, San Francisco, which finds that the device is 97 percent accurate in diagnosing irregular heartbeat.   Read: Apple Watch Series 3 Tracks Food Nutrition Using RFID Tags In New Patent  "Our results show that common wearable trackers like smartwatches present a novel opportunity to monitor, capture and prompt medical therapy for atrial fibrillation without any active effort from patients. While mobile technology screening won't replace more conventional monitoring methods, it has the potential to successfully screen those at an increased risk and lower the number of undiagnosed cases of AF," the report's senior author, Gregory M. Marcus, MD, MAS Endowed Professor of Atrial Fibrillation Research and Director of Clinical Research for the Division of Cardiology at UCSF, said in the findings published Wednesday. The research trained a deep neural network (DNN) and paired it with the Apple Watch and Cardiogram app. In the course of the research, they took 139 million heart rate measurements and 6,158 subjects, who participated via the app.   Around 200 of the subjects had been previously diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation – abnormal heartbeat. The DNN then separated this data from the rest. The DNN was then pitted against in-hospital cardioversions –a process that restores normal heartbeat to patients with arrhythmia. On analyzing data from heart patients about to undergo treatment and according to the study, it was found a 97 percent accuracy in the device’s reports of abnormal heartbeat. Each subject wore the device for 20 minutes before and after cardioversion The findings might be of great help to heart patients and could also help the research in the field further, since around one in four heart attacks is caused by abnormal heartbeat, according to Cardiogram co-founder Brandon Ballinger. He further said that two-thirds of these ailments were treatable with relatively inexpensive drugs. According to the study, smartwatches and fitness trackers can be used to help at-risk patients and might even save lives using such algorithms, along with artificial intelligence. “While mobile technology screening won't replace more conventional monitoring methods, it has the potential to successfully screen those at an increased risk and lower the number of undiagnosed cases of AF," said Gregory M. Marcus, director of clinical research for the Division of Cardiology at UCSF. Read: Heart Health In Space: Astronaut Muscle Strength Down Because Of Blood Oxygen An Apple representative, when asked by CNET about findings said he did not have any information about them but did mention a study done by John Hopkins University, which found that the device could detect possible seizures in advance.  These kind of smart tools are easily available in the mass market, are generally not too expensive and serve many other purposes. But the fact that they could potentially save a patient’s life and maybe even health care costs, goes to show how health functions on smart devices might help not only the athletes, but even regular people with heart ailments.  Join the Discussion Most Read Newsletter Everything You Need To Know, Right Now Sign up for the newsletter.

Georgia Tech researchers have developed a proof-of-concept attack called Jekyll that involves using Trojan Horse-style apps to sneak malware past Apple's app review process and onto iOS devices such as the iPhone and iPad. Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC) Associate Director Paul Royal says we can get lulled into a fall sense of security by Apple's renowned app review process for iOS devices. [IPHONEYS:The iPhone 6 edition] Researcher Tielei Wang's team created a proof-of-concept attack that was published in the Apple App Store and used to remotely launch attacks on a controlled batch of devices, enabling them to post unauthorized tweets, take photos and even go after other apps. More detailed findings are being revealed in a paper titled "Jekyll on iOS: When Benign Apps Become Evil," which will be presented at the USENIX Security Symposium Aug. 14-16 in Washington, D.C. Separately, researcher Billy Lau's team has investigated how iOS device peripherals might attack the devices. Using a BeagleBoard, Lau's team created a USB malicious charger called Mactans that can install apps without user knowledge within a minute of being plugged in. "Despite the plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS, Mactans was able to install arbitrary apps within one minute of being plugged into current-generation Apple devices running the latest operating system software," said Lau, in a statement. "All users are affected, as our approach requires neither a jailbroken device nor user interaction." Apple has been notified by the Georgia Tech researchers of the flaws their teams discovered, and the company has implemented a feature in iOS 7 to warn users of suspicious behavior by peripherals. Apple is working on the Jekyll vulnerability. The peripherals threat is being discussed this week at the Black Hat USA conference in Las Vegas, where Georgia Tech is presenting the paper "Mactans: Injecting Malware into iOS Devices via Malicious Chargers." The growing threat of compromised mobile devices has largely centered around Android, though security watchers anticipate malware writers to put more effort into cracking iOS devices, particularly as they become more popular in corporate networks. Even Apple rival BlackBerry has addressed this issue by expanding its Secure Work Space offering, which divvies up work and personal apps/data, into Android and iOS environments.

The app, dubbed Jekyll, was helped by Apple's review process. The malware designers, a research team from Georgia Institute of Technology's Information Security Center (GTISC), were able to monitor their app during the review: they discovered Apple ran the app for only a few seconds, before ultimately approving it. That wasn't anywhere near long enough to discover Jekyll's deceitful nature. RELATED:Malicious power-charger can infect Apple iOS devices The name is a reference to the 1886 novella by Robert Louis Stevenson, called "The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde." The story is about the two personalities within Dr. Henry Jekyll: one good, but the other, which manifests as Edward Hyde, deeply evil. Jekyll's design involves more than simply hiding the offending code under legitimate behaviors. Jekyll was designed to later re-arrange its components to create new functions that couldn't have been detected by the app review. It also directed Apple's default Safari browser to reach out for new malware from specific Websites created for that purpose. "Our research shows that despite running inside the iOS sandbox, a Jekyll-based app can successfully perform many malicious tasks, such as posting tweets, taking photos, sending email and SMS, and even attacking other apps all without the user's knowledge," says Tielei Wang, in a July 31 press release by Georgia Tech. http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?nid=225501 Wang led the Jekyll development team at GTISC; also part of the team was Long Lu, a Stony Brook University security researcher. Some blogs and technology sites picked up on the press release in early August. But wider awareness of Jekyll, and its implications, seems to have been sparked by an August 15 online story in the MIT Technology Review, by Dave Talbot, who interviewed Long Lu for a more detailed account. Jekyll "even provided a way to magnify its effects, because it could direct Safari, Apple's default browser, to a website with more malware," Talbot wrote. A form of Trojan Horse malware, the recreated Jekyll, once downloaded, reaches out to the attack designers for instructions. "The app did a phone-home when it was installed, asking for commands," Lu explained. "This gave us the ability to generate new behavior of the logic of that app which was nonexistent when it was installed." Sandboxing is a fundamental tenant of secure operating systems, intended to insulate apps and their associated data from each other, and avoid the very attacks and activities that Jekyll was able to carry off. It's also explicitly used as a technique for detecting malware by running code in a protected space where it can be automatically analyzed for traits indicative of a malicious activity. The problem is that attackers are well aware of sandboxing and are working to exploit existing blind spots. [See "Malware-detecting 'sandboxing' technology no silver bullet" "The Jekyll app was live for only a few minutes in March, and no innocent victims installed it, Lu says," according to Talbot's account. "During that brief time, the researchers installed it on their own Apple devices and attacked themselves, then withdrew the app before it could do real harm." "The message we want to deliver is that right now, the Apple review process is mostly doing a static analysis of the app, which we say is not sufficient because dynamically generated logic cannot be very easily seen," Lu says. The results of the new attack, in a paper titles "Jekyll on iOS: when benign apps become evil," was scheduled to be presented in a talk last Friday at the 22nd Usenix Security Symposium, in Washington, D.C. The full paper is available online. In addition to Wang and Lu, the other co-authors are Kangjie Lu, Simon Chung, and Wenke Lee, all with Georgia Tech. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said that Apple "some changes to its iOS mobile operating system in response to issues identified in the paper," according to Talbot. "Neumayr would not comment on the app-review process." Oddly the same July 31 Georgia Tech press release that revealed Jekyll also revealed a second attack vector against iOS devices, via a custom built hardware device masquerading as a USB charger. Malware in the charger was injected into an iOS device. This exploit, presented at the recent Black Hat Conference, was widely covered (including by Network World's Layer8 blog) while Jekyll was largely overlooked.

Led by Tielei Wang, a research scientist at Georgia Tech's school of computer science, the team created a "Jekyll" app -- named for the Robert Louis Stevenson novella, Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde -- that posed as a benign news reader. Hidden inside the app, however, were code fragments, dubbed "gadgets," that self-assembled to create a proof-of-concept exploit only after the app was approved by Apple. The assembled attack code was able to send tweets, email and texts without the user's knowledge, and could steal the iPhone's unique device ID, turn on the camera and take video, forward voice calls to other phones and connect with local Bluetooth devices. Because the reconfigured app also "phoned home" to a server operated by the researchers, they were able to download additional malware and compromise other apps on the smartphone, including the Safari browser. What had seemed on the surface -- far below the surface for that matter -- to be a harmless Dr. Jekyll was silently transformed into an evil Mr. Hyde. Those code gadgets -- and the app's true control flow and operation -- were disguised in such a way that it would be virtually impossible for Apple's current review methods to discover the app's real intent. "Even with a longer time [to analyze the app] they can't find that it's malicious," said Wang in an interview Monday. Vulnerabilities, which the Jekyll app secretly planted in its code, are also nearly impossible to detect or stamp out, he said. In fact, Wang and his team -- Kangjie Lu, Long Lu, Simon Chung, and Wenke Lee, all of Georgia Tech -- sidestepped every major security technique baked into iOS, including sandboxing and code signing, as well as anti-exploit technologies like DEP (data execution prevention) and ASLR (address space layout randomization). "For instance, the app can deliberately leak its memory layout information to the remote server so that ASLR is completely ineffective," the group wrote in the paper ( download PDF) they presented Friday in Washington, D.C. at the USENIX Security Symposium. "Based on the memory layout information, attackers can launch attacks by reusing the [existing] code inside the app. As a result, DEP and code signing cannot prevent the exploit." The Georgia Tech researchers built their Jekyll app and submitted it to Apple, which approved it seven days later. Once on the App Store, the team downloaded the app onto their own iPhones, told it to transform into a Mr. Hyde and ask for instructions from their server. After confirming that it worked as designed, they removed the app from the App Store. No other users downloaded the app while it was available, Wang said. Unlike Android, Apple's iOS has been remarkably free of malicious apps, due to the Cupertino, Calif. company's mandate that only apps from its App Store can be installed on an unmodified iPhone. Apple also conducts a review before approving an app, purportedly looking for malicious code or unsanctioned operations. It rejects those it believes are suspicious or that sport illegal functions. But the review process, even if it was beefed up with personnel and the analysis done with different tools, would not stymie Jekyll apps, Wang and his team wrote in their paper. "We argue that the task of making all apps in App Store vulnerability-free is not only theoretically and practically difficult, but also quite infeasible to Apple from an economic perspective because such attempts will significantly complicate the review tasks, and therefore, prolong the app review and approval process that is already deemed low in throughput by third-party app developers," they wrote. With little chance of catching Jekyll apps during review, Apple should enhance iOS security to stymie such masquerading software at runtime, or when it's on an iPhone and active, Wang said. They made several recommendations, including improving ASLR and providing a finer-grained permission model, but pointed out that hackers may be able to work around those defenses, too. One way Apple could monitor apps at run time and thus stop Jekylls, was with "control-flow integrity" (CFI), an advanced anti-exploitation technology that requires code execution to follow pre-defined paths, and no others. Ironically, Apple's rival Microsoft has been at the forefront of CFI research, with papers from its scientists going back to 2005. And last year, the winner of Microsoft's BlueHat Prize was awarded $250,000 for coming up with a "lightweight form of control flow integrity" to protect Windows against ROP, or "return-oriented programming" attacks. "CFI is a very hot research topic right now," said Wang. Wang and his team reported their findings to Apple in March, long before the paper was made public. "They said they appreciated the report," said Wang. But he was, like everyone else, in the dark about what Apple might do to block Jekylls from reaching the App Store, or failing that, from executing on iPhones. Apple did not reply to a request for comment, but elsewhere the company has said it made changes in iOS in response. According to Wang, iOS 7 is still vulnerable to the technique of hiding vulnerabilities in a Jekyll app and exploiting them after approval to do dirty work. "However, Apple did enhance its sandbox policies," Wang said Tuesday in an email reply to follow-up questions. "Some of our attack instances no longer work, but we need to further figure our whether iOS 7 completely fixes the issues." Apple has to do something, Wang argued. "It's not a big deal for a malicious app developer [to do this]," he said. His recommendation to users? "Be very cautious when you download unknown, third-party apps," he said. Good advice, certainly, because who wants Mr. Hyde on a rampage when they expected Dr. Jekyll at the door?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones How to verify if the phone you are buying was stolen Here's a simple trick to check if the phone you are buying was stolen or genuine. Vinod Yalburgi   May 13, 2017 17:30 IST How to verify if the phone you are buying was stolen If you are planning to buy a second-hand phone, it is best to ensure the phone was not stolen as it could land you in a legal mess. Apple iPhones are easily trackable using their Find My iPhone and are less likely to get stolen while the non-Apple phones do not come with that privilege. If you are buying an iPhone, you could ask its owner to disable the Find My iPhone feature to confirm that it's not a stolen phone. On the contrary, you will have to use CTIA's Stolen Phone Checker service on non-Apple smartphones to verify the phone's true owner. The Stolen Phone Checker service offers ten years of a device's history along with the device's model number info and other hardware specifications. The use of such service should help law enforcement authorities and consumers to make informed buying decisions and avert the resale of lost and stolen mobile phones. Here's how to check if the phone you are buying was stolen: Open the URL: stolenphonechecker.org/spc/consumer on your device (the one you intend to buy). Enter the IMEI, MEID or ESN number of the phone you want to buy. For instance, if you are buying an iPhone then go to Settings > General > About. In case of non-Apple phones, you need to ask the owner to give you the IMEI number. Enter the captcha keyword when prompted and hit the submit button. That's it. If the phone you are buying is from the legitimate owner, then you will see "Not reported lost or stolen" next to Device Status on the phone's display. You will also receive additional info about the device model, make and other details on the same screen. Note: This feature is currently limited to the US and may not work as intended for international users. Related Goldman Sachs analyst predicts staggering prices for iPhone 8: Will you still buy it?

Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 28 May, 2015 06:37 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Synnex XiT Distribution Comments Apple reclaimed the top-rated brand value spot in Millward Brown's annual review on the back of exceptional iPhone 6 sales last year. The Cupertino, Calif. company, which lost the No. 1 position in 2014 to Google, climbed to an estimated $247 billion in brand value, said the research firm, which specializes in advertising effectiveness and brand equity. Google slipped to No. 2 with its $174 billion value, while Microsoft climbed a spot to No. 3 ($116 billion). Other technology companies in the Top 20 included IBM (No. 4), Tencent (No. 11), Facebook (No. 12) Alibaba (No. 13) and Amazon (No. 14). Brand value, as Millward Brown defined it, is the portion of a company's overall valuation due to the brand name itself, a metric comprising several pieces, including opinions of a consumer panel that totals more than 3 million people worldwide. "Apple displayed remarkable brand strength, returning to the number one position in the ranking based on consumer regard for the brand and its devices," Millward Brown's report read (download PDF). "The brand's iPhone 6 success contributed to an $18 billion quarterly net profit, the largest quarterly profit for a public company ever recorded." Millward Brown cited several other factors it thought contributed to Apple's 67% year-over-year increase in brand value, ranging from Apple Pay to the Apple-IBM partnership announced a year ago. Apple holds the record for the largest increase in brand value: 1,446% over the last 10 years. "Most astonishingly, 10 years ago, Apple, the world's most valuable brand, did not even rank in the ... global top 100," said the research firm. Microsoft, which like Apple moved up a spot this year, also got a thumbs up from Millward Brown, which applauded the leadership change at the 40-year-old Redmond, Wash. company. "In the first year under its new CEO [Satya Nadella], Microsoft refreshed its culture and exhibited greater willingness to be more open and collaborative with its partners and customers," the report said. Microsoft, No. 1 in Millward Brown's first report of 2006 with a brand value of $62 billion, recorded a number nearly double that for 2015. "Microsoft rose ... on the strength of three things: a shift in focus to the cloud, a more collaborative corporate philosophy, and an aura of optimism surrounding the installation of a new CEO," the research company said. In particular, Millward Brown highlighted the March 2014 debut of Office on the iPad, and in more general terms, the sweeping changes Microsoft made to its pricing practice and the discarding of its Windows-first (and in many cases, Windows-only) philosophy. Also in the mix: The decision to give away upgrades to Windows 10 to consumers and small businesses. "Microsoft announced plans to distribute the next version of its Windows 10 as a free upgrade for the first year to people who already own Windows," the researcher said. "The initiative ensures a high adoption rate and the Microsoft brand looks more generous."

Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 28 July, 2015 00:35 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Comments Best Buy yesterday announced that it will begin selling the Apple Watch in 100 of its U.S. stores, about 10% of its total outlet count, starting Aug. 7. The retailer will be the first national chain in the U.S. to sell the Apple Watch, not a surprise since it is one of Apple's largest domestic retail partners. "We know our customers want it," said Jason Bonfig, Best Buy's senior category officer, in a statement. Best Buy will sell 16 configurations -- about half the number Apple sells online -- of the low- and mid-range Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch, as well as bands and other accessories. The Apple Watch Sport starts at $349, while the Apple Watch begins at $549. By the holiday season, said Best Buy, it will have added another 200 of its stores to the Apple Watch selling list, ending the year with just under a third of the 1,050 stores the Minneapolis, Minn.-based retail has in the U.S. The smartwatch will also be available on the company's e-store. In hindsight, Apple CEO Tim Cook last week dropped clues that Apple could soon expand Watch distribution. During an earnings call with Wall Street on July 21, Cook asserted that the company had pushed past the initial supply problems that restricted sales to online, with the device reaching its own retail stores only in June. "We made huge progress with the production ramp across the quarter," Cook noted. "And in just the past few days, we've been able to catch up with demand. We're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday because we're convinced that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season." During that call, financial analysts pressed Cook for more information about Watch sales than he was willing to divulge. Previously, Cook had said that the company would not disclose sales for competitive reasons. That sent financial and industry analysts scrambling to come up with a number based on what Apple did reveal. Jan Dawson, principal analyst at Jackdaw Research, for example, settled on between 2 million and 3 million units, while Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies pegged sales at between 2.5 and 3 million (subscription required). Still, the move into Best Buy was contrary to what some analysts had earlier said would be Apple's sales strategy for the new device. "Retail is absolutely critical" to the Watch, Dawson said in March, referring to the Cupertino, Calif. company's own retail stores. "Think about going to Best Buy to shop for an Apple Watch. It would be a nightmare. Salespeople there are overworked and unavailable and commission-driven. None would be a good fit for this device." Some wags clearly held to that today. "I buy all my nice watches at Best Buy," tweeted Marco Arment, a noted Apple developer, tongue in cheek.

Police along with personnel from the Trademark Investigation Services and identified and seized dozens of boxes with counterfeit merchandise including Apple, Samsung, Adidas and Chanel brands. The raids were conducted in Sydney’s north-west by police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command with search warrants at five different locations over two days (March 10 and 11.) At about 9am on March 11 police executed a search warrant at a stall in a shopping centre in Stanhope Gardens, before attending a warehouse on Berry Street, Granville, where another search warrant was undertaken. Police seized thousands of fake mobile phone and tablet accessories. On March 10 officers executed a search warrant at a stall in a marketplace at Parklea before following up with search warrants at private residences on Donnelly Street, Guildford, and Gibbs Street, Auburn. At all three locations, police seized thousands of dollars in counterfeit goods including fake handbags, shoes and clothing. The goods are being inspected for authenticity. Inquiries are continuing and a number of people are expected to be charged. Inspector Adel Attala from Quakers Hill Local Area Command said police would continue to target businesses involved in the importation and sale of counterfeit goods. “The counterfeit goods trade robs unknowing consumers and legitimate businesses of their hard earned incomes and profits,” he said. “We’re committed to getting fake products out of local marketplaces and will be working hard to catch and prosecute more counterfeit goods traders in the very near future.” Attala expects more seizures will be taking place in the months ahead. Anyone with information about that may assist investigators should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page: here.

Apple announced that it will pour another $1 billion into the data campus at the Reno Technology Park in the Truckee River canyon east of Sparks, bringing “hundreds of jobs in operations and construction,” according to Apple executive Mike Foulkes. In turn, Apple’s $89 million in state and property and sales tax abatements awarded in 2012 with its original $1 billion investment will increase — and that’s not all. Part of the addition will include a $4 million, 27,000 square-foot warehouse for shipping and receiving built on a vacant lot in downtown Reno, originally part of a tourism improvement district created in 2009. Because the Reno City Council voted on Wednesday to allow Apple to buy the land instead of leasing it, the company is now eligible to take advantage of a tourism tax break that will lower its sales tax rate to 0.5 percent from 8.265 percent, according to the Reno Gazette Journal. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said in a statement that the Reno facility was “the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and helped place this region on the technology and innovation map.” He continued, “Apple’s decision to increase their local investment by $1 billion is a testament to our successful partnership and a demonstration that the best companies in the world are coming to Nevada, creating hundreds of jobs, investing in our communities and making our state their permanent home.” See also: How Reno Became a Data Center Hub: A Timeline The Apple data center is not the only massive server farm that feels at home and appreciated in Nevada. Massive Switch SuperNap is in Reno with eBay as the anchor tenant, and news came out in April that Google had acquired 1,210 acres in Nevada’s Tahoe Reno Industrial Center that will house a future data center. In a show of support for creating more manufacturing jobs in the US, Apple announced  a new $1 billion fund last week to make its vital role known in the national economy. The company broke down employment by state, showing where its 80,000 employees work. As you might have figured, more than half are in Silicon Valley.

The new MacBook is priced starting at $US1299, the same as the initial model introduced more than a year ago. With a new graphics chipset - Intel's HD Graphics 515 - the MacBook boasts a 25 per cent improvement in graphics performance, Apple claimed. The 1.1-GHz Skylake processor's lower-power demands should add an hour to the time between charge: Up to 10 hours of browsing, up to 11 hours of video playback. Apple also increased the speed of the flash memory that composed the 256GB SSD (solid-state drive) storage, from 1600MHz to 1886MHz. The MacBook was the first Apple notebook to get a processor from Intel's 14-nanometer Skylake line, the successor to 2014's "Broadwell." Other laptops, including Microsoft's Surface Book -- which debuted last year -- preceded Apple's to market. The MacBook form factor remains the same, with the system tipping the scale at 2 lbs. and taking the tape at a half-inch thick. Apple added rose gold - aka pink - to the previous color choices of gold, silver and space gray to match the available options for the iPhone and iPad. Most other features stay static as well, including the single USB-C port - the most controversial of Apple's design choices for the MacBook -- and the high-resolution 12-inch display that maxes out at a 2304-by-1440-pixel resolution. Both iterations of the MacBook - the more expensive option remains the $1,599 model with a 1.2-GHz CPU and 512GB of storage - are equipped with 8GB of RAM. Apple also said it has increased the standard RAM of the MacBook Air notebooks to 8GB. Now nearly ignored by Apple, the 2.4-lb. Air has not been refreshed since March 2015, and has not changed its design since 2006. It remains the only part of Apple's Mac line that lacks a "Retina" high-resolution display, whether standard or as an option. The new MacBook went on sale Tuesday on Apple's online store - early in the day, however, the purchase page was inaccessible - and was to hit its retail chain and some authorized resellers on Wednesday.

Sign up now Menu ARN Apple's emphasis on security makes ARM-powered Macs 'inevitable' Apple's emphasis on security makes ARM-powered Macs 'inevitable' Apple convinces analyst that Macs will eventually run on custom silicon, not Intel's processors Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 21 April, 2016 05:22 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Comments Apple will offer Macs equipped with an ARM processor, the same silicon used in the iPhone and iPad, an analyst said, calling the move "inevitable" because of the company's emphasis on security and encryption. "If Apple truly wants to bring their security philosophy to their products in every part of the ecosystem, they must also do what many predict and make A-series processors for Macs," said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, in a piece posted to Tech.pinions Tuesday (subscription required). "[Apple] has convinced me even more [that] A-series processors for Macs are inevitable." Apple's in-house-designed system-on-a-chip (SoC), which powers the iPhone and iPad, are labeled Ax, such as the A9 inside 2015's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, and this year's iPhone 5SE. A variation of that SoC, the A9X, powers the iPad Pro line. Bajarin's prediction was based in large part on a technical briefing Apple held with a small number of analysts last week. During the briefing, Apple focused on security and encryption - a topic that has put the company in the crosshairs of the US government over accessing criminal suspects' iPhones -- by explaining the integration between the 64-bit A-series silicon, the iOS operating system, and the "Secure Enclave" co-processor. In an interview today, Bajarin characterized Secure Enclave as the "heart of every bit of encrypted information" on an iPhone or iPad. The co-processor makes possible everything from secure boot and file encryption to its best-known task, processing the fingerprint data from an iPhone's TouchID scanner to authenticate the user for unlocking the device and authorizing electronic payment via Apple Pay. "Secure Enclave sits in the middle of making all secure bits secure," said Bajarin. "The more I look back on that, it's clear that Secure Enclave plays a much larger role than we have given it credit for." Apple, not surprisingly, has divulged few technical aspects of Secure Enclave, which it introduced with the iPhone 5S in 2013. When it rolled out that model, it said only that "all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely in the Secure Enclave inside the A7 chip on the iPhone 5S." In September 2015, Apple posted a security white paper that included a few more details of Secure Enclave. Bajarin didn't limit his analysis to Secure Enclave, but instead pointed out the top-to-bottom control that Apple maintains over security on its devices. It crafts the A-series silicon and the Secure Enclave co-processor; it develops and maintains iOS: nothing is off the shelf, and it relies on no outside party. "Security in all of its facets is being thought through every level of the product," Bajarin said in the interview of Apple's approach. "It's built from the ground up. Out of everyone out there, Apple is above and beyond on security." But if security is at root a critical component of Apple's strategy, Bajarin argued, it surely must expand from the iOS platform to the Mac. That's where ARM, the processor architecture that Apple's SoCs are based upon, comes in. "OS X has its own security story," Bajarin acknowledged. "But given the narrative Apple's trying to tell and how much time they've spent on this philosophy, if they're serious about security they need to bring it to every bit of their product line." To accomplish on the Mac what it's done on the iPhone, Apple would have to abandon Intel as its processor supplier, and use its own A-series SoC and Secure Enclave. In turn, that would mean OS X would be discarded, at least for those Macs equipped with ARM-based silicon, and replaced by iOS itself or a variation of the operating system. Apple's emphasis on security and encryption, and how they are implemented in the iPhone by Apple's customization strategy, said Bajarin, made it clear: "It signals that it's inevitable that they will do the same for all the products that they can," he concluded. Bajarin published an initial analysis of Apple's security strategy Monday; unlike yesterday's piece, the first can be read free of charge.

Credit: Apple Apple's Mac Pro is aging fast, especially with screaming fast Windows desktops being announced in recent weeks. Introduced in 2013, the Mac Pro was a top-of-the-line desktop at that time. It looked exquisite in its sleek cylindrical design, and it sported new features like Thunderbolt 2 ports, plus the latest CPUs, GPUs and NVMe storage. More importantly, it was a signal that Apple had not abandoned the professional computing market. The latest Mac Pro was a relief to those clamoring for an upgrade from an older version of the computer, which last received a face-lift in 2010. But the Mac Pro is again falling behind the competition, with powerful new workstations from Lenovo, Dell and HP carrying superior technology. The PC companies are waging an active campaign to tempt Mac Pro users, many of them creative professionals, to move over to Windows PCs with better CPUs, GPUs, and memory. The new Windows desktops are targeted at video editing, professional applications and the creation of virtual reality content for headsets like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Among the powerful new Windows machines are HP's new Z Workstations. Starting at US $4,363, the Z Workstations announced this week can be configured with Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4 chips, which have up to 22 cores. Two Nvidia Quadro M6000 GPUs in an SLI (scalable link interface) configuration can provide super-fast graphics performance. The desktop supports DDR4 memory, and there are multiple slots for SATA, SAS (serial-attached SCSI) and NVMe (non-volatile memory) SSD storage. New Dell Precision workstations, announced last week, can also support the latest 22-core Xeon E5-2600 v4 chips, based on the Broadwell architecture and also introduced last week. By comparison, the Mac Pro -- which starts at $2,999 -- supports up to 12-core Intel Xeon E5 chips based on the older Ivy Bridge microarchitecture, which started shipping in the third quarter of 2013. The desktop has older AMD FirePro GPU models and DDR3 memory. The Thunderbolt 2 ports are also outdated, and Thunderbolt 3 is two times faster, with its 40Gbps data transfer rate. The Mac Pro is still a fast machine, but creative professionals want the latest and greatest hardware, said Bob O'Donnell, principal analyst at Technalysis Research. "I compare it more to a low-end workstation," O'Donnell said. The desktop is adequate for engineering applications and video editing, but faster computers will allow creative professionals to dabble in VR, O'Donnell said. VR is a niche but emerging market, and workstations will need more horsepower for visual computing, O'Donnell said. Apple hasn't indicated it is focused on VR, which still has an uncertain future. But earlier this month, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said Rift headset support would come to Macs if Apple ever releases "a good computer” to handle the stereoscopic content. VR headsets require top-line CPUs and GPUs in desktops. Apple has more than VR to consider if it wants to retain Mac Pro users. Apple may enter the fast-growing car market, and computer-aided automobile design will happen on workstations like Mac Pro, O'Donnell said. O'Donnell also suggested Apple could opt to merge Mac Pro with the iMac. It's not an unprecedented idea; Apple in 2010 killed its Xserve product line and provided a guide for users to transition to the Mac Pro or Mac Mini. But patience has its virtues. If Apple hangs on before upgrading Mac Pro, some breakthrough technologies could put the desktop leagues ahead of its Windows rivals. Intel is developing super-fast Optane memory SSD products, which will come to high-end gaming desktops and workstations later this year. Intel claims that Optane, which is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, is 1,000 times faster and durable than NAND flash storage. Faster GPUs are en route as well. Apple has shown an affinity for graphics processors from AMD, which plans to release GPUs based on its Polaris architecture later this year. AMD's rival Nvidia this week introduced a new GPU called Tesla P100, based on its new Pascal architecture and targeted at high-performance computing. Nvidia could also release Quadro GPUs, based on Pascal, for workstations later this year. Apple could upgrade the Mac Pro if only to show evidence of its technological superiority over Windows rivals. There's no mantra like "good enough" computing for high-end desktops like the Mac Pro, O'Donnell said. "It's about maintaining relevance," O'Donnell said.

Daniel Ionescu (PC World (US online)) 05 May, 2013 15:59 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Exclusive Networks Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments They're good enough for government work: The US Department of Defense has cleared use of devices running the BlackBerry 10 operating system and Samsung's secure version of Android called Knox. So far, this means that both the BlackBerry Z10 and the Samsung Galaxy S4 have beaten Apple's iPhone to achieve DoD security clearance, although iOS 6 is expected to get approval this month, according to a Reuters report. The Pentagon also cleared the use of BlackBerry PlayBook tablets using its Enterprise Service 10 system for use on Defense Department networks, in a bid to establish a "a multivendor environment that supports a variety of state-of-the-art devices and operating systems." BlackBerry dominates DoD The DoD has some 600,000 smartphone and tablet users, most of whom are BlackBerry users (around 470,000), and just 41,000 Apple users and 8700 with Android phones, most of them in testing programs. The Pentagon denied reports earlier this year that it is looking to abandon the use of BlackBerry device, but by officially clearing Samsung Knox, and soon iOS 6, the Pentagon will put more pressure on BlackBerry, which has seen its market share slide in recent years in favor of Android and iPhones. The DoD clearance is a significant step for Samsung, which becomes the first Android manufacturer to the get approval. The company worked with U.S. National Security Agency to develop Knox, basically a version of Android with added layers or hardware and software security protection. More specifically, Samsung Knox has a customizable secure boot, a container that isolates enterprise apps and encrypts data, and a so-called per-app VPS, which allows admins to configure, provision, and manage the use of Virtual Private Networks on a per-application basis. So far, only the Samsung Galaxy S4 runs Knox, making it the only DoD-approved Android phone as well. Samsung intends to introduce Knox on some of its other devices too, but as reported last month, the launch is delayed until summer in order to run additional tests. Meanwhile, the UK government has not yet cleared BlackBerry 10 for use in classified government communications.

It is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs against Apple. The Australian competition regulator and national consumer law champion started an investigation following reports relating to "error 53", an inaccuracy which disabled some consumers’ iPads or iPhones after downloading an iOS update. Many consumers who encountered ‘error 53’ had previously had their Apple device repaired by a third party, usually replacing a cracked screen. What ACCC found was that Apple allegedly appeared to have routinely refused to look at or service consumers’ defective devices if a consumer had previously had the device repaired by a third party repairer, even where that repair was unrelated to the fault. It stated that under the Australian Consumer Law, users are protected by a number of “consumer guarantees” in relation to the quality, suitability for purpose and other characteristics of goods and services. In addition, the ACCC alleged that Apple represented to consumers faulty products that were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third party, “unauthorised repairers”. But, it mentioned that having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by anyone besides Apple cannot, by itself, remove the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with consumer guarantees. ACCC chairperson Rod Sims Read more TPG coughs up $22.5M in mobile spectrum push ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer’s warranty and are not extinguished because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party. “Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer,” he said. “As consumer goods become increasingly complex, businesses also need to remember that consumer rights extend to any software or software updates loaded onto those goods. Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law.” This proceeding follows a court enforceable undertaking which the ACCC accepted from Apple in December 2013, following an investigation into Apple’s consumer guarantees policies and practices, and representations about consumers’ rights.

At an invite-only meeting with a handful of Apple bloggers and reporters, two of Apple's top executives -- marketing head Philip Schiller and Craig Federighi, who leads software engineering -- acknowledged that the firm's strategy for the Mac Pro, the company's top-of-the-line desktop, had been a mistake. While a refreshed Mac Pro will not ship this year, Schiller and Federighi promised that one is in the pipeline. [ Further reading: 15-in. MacBook Pro delivers on speed and design â for a price ] Along with talk of the Mac Pro -- a niche item in Apple's Mac line, which in turn has been dwarfed by the iPhone -- the executives stressed that the company was committed to the professional part of its customer base. Apple will ship new iMacs this year, they said, some configured for the "pro" users at the advanced end of the spectrum. Schiller was also adamant that Apple remains steadfast in its support of personal computers. "The Mac has an important, long future at Apple, ... Apple cares deeply about the Mac, we have every intention to keep going and investing in the Mac," Schiller told the reporters and bloggers, according to Techcrunch's Matthew Panzarino, who was there. "It was certainly very unusual for Apple to reveal anything about future products," noted Jan Dawson, principal analyst with Jackdaw Research, who also characterized it as a "big break from tradition" for the company. Other experts pointed out that, while secrecy is still Apple's go-to stance -- after all, less than a year after taking the job, CEO Tim Cook said he would "double down on secrecy on products" -- there had been hints that it was easing up. "They've given more clarity on things that interest them," contended Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, such as when Cook has been bullish, if only in generalities, about augmented reality. So, what was so important that Apple departed from a public relations strategy in place for decades? "Ultimately, there has been increasing unhappiness in the Mac user base," said Dawson. "This was a response to that negative narrative that's been building." Dawson was talking about last fall when, after Apple rolled out new MacBook Pro notebooks, critics panned the machines as unsuitable for professional uses like video editing, engineering work and high-end design. Rumbles of discontent took hold in online forums, and were amplified by wider reports in the media that questioned Apple's commitment to personal computers. Some of the critics focused on the economics: Although the Mac line recorded billions in revenue for 2016 -- more than $23 billion -- the portfolio was a small portion, less than 11%, of Apple's total. "I don't think there was ever a question about Apple not caring about the Mac," said Bajarin, "but it didn't seem to be competing for the 'pro' community like they used to." Bajarin agreed that Apple's commentary was designed to combat the negative storyline, but compartmentalized it as primarily involving the Mac Pro. Not everyone interpreted the turn-about in that way. "I think they did this to keep Mac users interested [in the platform]," countered Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. "Windows and Microsoft and their partners are making it very, very interesting by leaning into very creative platforms both from the hardware and software sides." Moorhead cited Windows 10's Creators Update -- the feature upgrade slated to start landing on PCs next week -- and its emphasis on 3-D content creation, and the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop as examples. His point: Microsoft's pitch to creative professionals, long an audience devoted to Macs, was having an impact. And Apple didn't like it. "There are some very interesting options for creative types," Moorhead continued. "And Apple felt like they had to elevate their game." That Apple did, Bajarin argued. "One of the subtler things [about going public about the Mac Pro] was that they are really, really listening to the customer base," Bajarin said. "That customer base for the Mac Pro is a couple of million people at best, but Apple's saying, 'We're still listening to you,' then emphasizing that it is listening to customers and will take steps in the right direction." Dawson echoed that in commentary published to his Tech Narratives website. "These pros are no longer the core constituency of the Mac, which instead is mainstream users," Dawson wrote. "However, they are vocal, and they're important because they're disproportionately influential as a result."

On 21 April, Australian Federal Court Justice Moshinsky ruled that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) should be able to serve court documents on Apple US in the United States over allegations the company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in Australia. The move comes just weeks after the ACCC revealed it had commenced legal proceedings against the California-based tech giant and its local subsidiary, with the industry watchdog seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs against Apple. Proceeding were subsequently brought against Apple Pty Ltd, the company’s Australian corporate entity, as well as Apple Inc (Apple US), its US-based parent company. However, while the ACCC has served the originating application and its statement on Apple Australia locally, according to Federal Court documents, Apple US has not provided an address for service in Australia, even though court documents have been provided to a senior lawyer at Apple US. Consequently, the ACCC sought leave to serve the court documents out of its jurisdiction in Australia, on Apple US in its home country. In a decision dated 21 April, Moshinsky ruled that it is appropriate to give the ACCC leave to serve the court documents on Apple Inc in the US, out of jurisdiction. “It is proposed to serve the court documents in the USA,” Moshinsky stated. “The proposed method of service is to use a private service agent retained through a firm of lawyers based in San Francisco. According to Moshinksy, the ACCC has a “prima facie” case for the relief claimed against Apple US in the proceeding.

It is alleged that Apple US is liable for certain conduct of Apple Australia on the basis that Apple Australia engaged in the relevant conduct both on its own behalf and on behalf of Apple US. “In my view, it is appropriate in the circumstances to make such an order…the allegations against the respondents are closely intertwined. It is desirable that the claims against both respondents proceed together in the one proceeding,” he said. The substance of the ACCC’s claims against Apple Australia and Apple US revolve around claims the companies made in relation to a fault, known as “error 53”, experienced by some iPhone and iPad users from September 2014 to at least February 2016, which rendered their devices inoperable.

NSW Fair Trading released the results of the March Complaints Register on 28 April, with a record 36 businesses recording more than 10 complaints for the month. Electronics and home goods retailer, Harvey Norman, topped the list with 43 complaints, more than double the average number of complaints per business recorded for March. This month, the company has amassed complaints from 25 of its stores across the state, as well as its online website. More than one third of businesses on this month’s register had complaints lodged about their online trading practices, and online ticket reseller Viagogo has made the list again with a total of 27 complaints. Apple came in second on the monthly tally, with the tech giant the subject of 29 complaints received by NSW Fair Trading during March. Electronics retailer, The Good Guys, came in at number five. The company, which was acquired by fellow electronics retailer, JB Hi-Fi, for $870 million last year, was the subject of 24 complaints to NSW Fair Trading in March. Coming in at a close sixth on the list was Telstra, with NSW Fair Trading receiving 21 complaints about Australia’s largest telecommunications provider during the month. Online electronics store, Android Enjoyed, came in at number eight, with the business, operated by Digital Skies Group, being the topic of 18 complaints.

Caitlin McGarry (Macworld.com) 03 May, 2017 07:02 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Comments Fresh off a record-breaking $78.4 billion first quarter, Apple reported a decidedly more muted Q2 of fiscal year 2017: a profit of $11 billion, or $2.10 per share, on revenue of $52.9 billion. The quarter ending April 1 saw no new iPhones, of course, which partly explains the decline. And the results are better than the year-ago Q2, which saw profit of $1.90 per share on $50.6 billion in revenue. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company saw “continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus” and “strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.” Well, it wouldn’t be an Apple earnings report if some record wasn’t shattered, right? Apple’s profits beat analyst expectations on profit but missed slightly on revenue and iPhone sales, for those who care about that sort of thing. Some things to note before Apple’s Q2 earnings call, which will shed more light on its overall OK quarter: Sales in Europe and China were down year-over-year, but the Americas, Japan, and rest of the Asia Pacific were up. Expect to hear more about China from Tim Cook and Co. on the call. Apple sold fewer iPhones in Q2 than Q1, as always, but also sold fewer phones than in Q2 of 2016. However, the company made more money off the iPhones it did sell this quarter over last—$33.25 billion vs. $32.86 billion, to be precise. That indicates that perhaps people are choosing the more expensive 7 Plus when they upgrade. As Cook said (and has said time and time again), services remain a bright spot for the company as it moves to diversify its revenue sources. In the March quarter, Apple made more than $7 billion from services (which includes Apple Pay, AppleCare, Apple Music, the iTunes Store, etc., etc., etc.). That’s up from just shy of $6 billion a year ago. Adding a billion dollars to a business in one year isn’t bad, though analysts had expected Apple to hit $7.06 billion. Basically, Apple is disappointing Wall Street, as always. But it’s still America’s most valuable company, and its market cap on Tuesday hit $776.59 billion. The company is also sitting on more $250 billion in cash. We’ll hear more (maybe) about what (if anything) Apple plans to do with that cash plus much, much more when the company’s quarterly earnings conference call starts at 5 p.m. Eastern/2 p.m. Pacific.

In calendar 1Q17/fiscal 2Q17, Apple generated $52.9 billion in revenue, a gain of 4.6 per cent year-to-year, its second consecutive quarter of overall revenue growth following declines in calendar quarters 1Q16, 2Q16 and 3Q16. Diving deeper into the figures, Apple’s Services revenue surged upward 17.5 per cent year-to-year to $7 billion in calendar 1Q17 and Mac PC revenue and unit shipments climbed 14.4 per cent and 4.1 per cent year-to-year to $5.8 billion and 4.2 million, respectively. “Services segment revenue growth Apple demonstrated its near-unparalleled ability to monetise user engagement, and a second consecutive year-to-year revenue rebound in its Mac PC business shows the new MacBook and MacBook Pro have accelerated Mac PC refreshes, at least in Apple’s installed base,” said TBR senior analyst, Jack Narcotta. However, according to the analyst firm, there are indicators that Apple’s iPhone business is experiencing “deferred demand” as its customer base await the release of the iPhone 8, expected to hit shelves in September this year. In this quarter, iPhone unit shipments declined a nominal 0.8 per cent from calendar 1Q16 to 50.8 million, but a greater mix of iPhone 7 Plus models in overall iPhone mix boosted iPhone average selling price (ASP), helping to lift iPhone segment revenue 1.2 per cent year-to-year to $33.2 billion. For Narcotta, while growth in Mac PC and Services reduces the burden on the iPhone as Apple’s revenue engine – the iPhone accounted for 62.9 per cent of Apple’s total revenue in calendar 1Q17. “Sustaining demand for the current stable of iPhones will be necessary to fill gaps should Services and Mac PC revenue growth rates slow in calendar 2Q17 and 3Q17,” he added. In November last year, after reporting its first decline in annual sales and profits in 15 years, the industry speculated whether the vendor was under threat, appearing to have reached its “peak audience”, according to Narcotta at the time. Read more Tech players top NSW complaints tally, again “Apple has become a victim of its own success,” he said at the time. According to the analyst, Apple’s “largely iterative updates” to Mac PCs and the iPhone are due to the world’s most valuable company perceiving a "lack of true competition" in its target markets. Consequently, this allowed for competing mobile device vendors like Huawei, Samsung, OPPO and vivo, and PC OEMs such as Asus, Dell and HP with opportunities to loosen Apple’s grip on the premium device segment, the most coveted as it generates greater profits. Yet at the time, Narcotta predicted as iPhone demand wanes, Apple would move to prioritise pursuing growth in markets adjacent to the iPhone. In November, Narcotta said the company’s Services segment revenue climbed 24.4 per cent year-to-year to $US6.3 billion, because of Apple’s commitment to greater monetisation of iPhone user engagement. Read more Is the premium PC market approaching critical mass? “Sustaining revenue growth in these segments will emerge as a priority for Apple in 2017 as iPhone demand wanes, but the scale of the iPhone business will dictate Apple’s overall gains or, more likely through 2017, declines,” he said at the time.

James Henderson (ARN) 09 May, 2017 05:00 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology CertaOne Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Vendors Huawei Comments The worldwide tablet market once again contracted in the first quarter of 2017, as slow migration from slates to detachable devices continues to impact the industry. Specifically, shipments for the quarter totalled 36.2 million, representing a year-over-year decline of 8.5 per cent. According to preliminary IDC findings, the first quarter contraction marks the tenth straight quarter that tablets have experienced a decline over the same quarter a year earlier, with the previous five quarters recording double-digit drops. “The tablet market is comprised of two different product categories, which are headed in very different directions,” IDC program vice president Ryan Reith said. Devices offering a first-party keyboard, referred to detachable tablets, continue to grow for the most part. Reith said many of these devices have quickly grown to resemble products such as traditional notebook PCs or laptops. Meanwhile, the other product category is slate tablets (those lacking this keyboard option), which saw shipments peak in 2014 but is now on a steep decline expected to continue in the months ahead. “As far as most are aware, the tablet market was created in 2010 with the launch of the original iPad, despite unsuccessful product attempts by other OEMs in the years leading up to this,” Reith added. “The rate at which the tablet market grew from 2010 to 2013 was unlike many other consumer-oriented device markets we've seen before. Read more Innovative HP hones in on the future “However, it appears for many reasons consumers became less eager to refresh these devices, or in some instances purchase them at all. “We continue to believe the leading driver for this was the increased dependency on smartphones, along with rather minimal technology and form factor progression.” At the same time that this roller coaster of tablet growth, peak, and decline was taking place, Reith said the PC market was experiencing one the worst declines the market's history. Fast forward to 1Q17 and traditional PCs have returned to growth, albeit relatively flat growth, for the first time since 1Q12. Read more Services segment lights fire underneath Apple's latest revenue surge “A long-term threat to the overall PC market lies in how the market ultimately settles on the detachable versus convertible debate,” IDC research director of devices and displays Linn Huang added. “To date, detachable shipments have dwarfed those of convertibles, but growth of the former has slowed a bit.” Looking ahead, Huang said detachables will continue to “far outpace” convertibles in shipments, but the market pendulum seems to be swinging back in favour of convertibles if ever so slightly. “Still, the detachable market has proven it will move with major product launches and Microsoft and Apple have yet to launch their 2017 salvos,” Huang added. Read more Tech players top NSW complaints tally, again Vendors From a vendor perspective, Apple experienced its 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment decline despite being the market leader in 1Q17. “Apple's results show that it is not immune to the changing dynamics of industry and consumer demand, part of which is due to the ongoing success of its other product line,” Reith said. Read more Will Samsung unseat Intel as the world’s top chip maker this year? 2016 was Apple's first full year of iPad Pro shipments, which included the launch of the smaller screen lower-cost 9.7 inch version, with this product line quickly elevating Cupertino to the top of the growing detachable tablet market segment. “Apple is in a good spot to remain competitive at the top of this segment despite using a 'mobile OS' while many of its competitors are entering the space with Windows-based devices,” Reith added. Samsung remained the number two tablet provider despite seeing shipments decline 1.1 per cent year over year in 1Q17. “Much like Apple, Samsung continues to migrate its tablet portfolio to the detachable segment and to support this the company launched three new products at this year's Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February,” Reith said. Read more ​VMware edges closer to Google to boost Chromebook sales After supposedly leaving the PC business in 2014, Samsung now finds itself approaching the market again with a handful of Windows 10 detachable tablet models. “The move isn't surprising as the entire industry seems keen on taking advantage of this market opportunity,” Reith said. Meanwhile, Huawei was the only company among the top five to experience positive growth in 1Q17 with shipments of 2.7 million, which was up 31.7 per cent from the 2.0 million shipped in the first quarter a year ago. “Like Samsung, Huawei has also slowly migrated its tablet portfolio from an Android slate tablet lineup to now include a mix of Windows-based detachable devices,” Reith added. Read more Tech retailer to pay Microsoft $450K in copyright settlement “It is somewhat unclear how serious Huawei is about going down the Windows device route, but given this quarter's growth while others decline it seems the mix strategy and tablet play is working for the company.” In addition, Amazon.com continues to fluctuate in and out of the top rankings with its low-cost Kindle Fire devices. In 1Q17 the company shipped 2.2 million devices, all of which continue to be aimed at a very aggressive price point with a strategy to drive content and product sales via the device. “Regardless of the changing industry dynamics mentioned in this release, Amazon seems poised to remain a competitor given its market strategy,” Reith said. Lenovo rounded out the top five with 2.1 million tablets shipped in the quarter. “Of all the companies in the top five, Lenovo is likely best positioned in terms of channel strategy to grow its tablet business,” Reith advised. “We expect to see more of its successful notebook PC lineup migrate into the detachable tablet category.” Lenovo captured 5.7 per cent market share in 1Q17, which was down just slightly from the 5.5 per cent market share it had at this time last year.

Apple sells the iPhone 5S, its flagship, starting at $649 for a 16GB model sans a subsidy, and the iPhone 5C for $549, just $100 less. The smartphones are priced at $199 and $99, respectively, with a two-year carrier contract in the U.S. "Once again, Apple has stuck to its old tried-and-true formula of optimizing its iPhone hardware gross margins to attain maximum profitability," said Wayne Lam, a senior analyst at IHS, an El Segundo, Calif.-based research company, in a statement today. IHS, formerly known as iSuppli, regularly disassembles smartphones and tablets to see which component suppliers are on the upswing, which have been dumped by designers and manufacturers, and uses its examinations to estimate a "bill of materials," or BOM, of the device's manufacturing cost. The $199 BOM -- which includes an $8 estimate for actually assembling the iPhone 5S -- was almost identical to the $197 IHS pegged for 2012's iPhone 5 cost. "Technically, the iPhone 5S is a couple of bucks more than the iPhone 5," said Andrew Rassweiler, a senior director of HIS' cost benchmarking team, in an interview Wednesday. "But that's still a preliminary number and subject to change." In fact, the more Rassweiler and other IHS analysts look at the iPhone 5S, particularly its fingerprint scanner -- marketed as "Touch ID" by Apple -- the more they suspect that their $7 estimate for those components is too low. Costs of other components, however, may be lowered in the meantime, perhaps ending with a wash on the BOM. But the Touch ID addition to the iPhone 5S -- Apple didn't put the technology in the lower-priced 5C -- was intriguing to IHS for other reasons besides its component cost. "The fingerprint sensor is new stuff, and whenever you're dealing with new stuff, you're dealing with poor yield, which drives cost up and availability down," said Rassweiler. If there's a problem in Apple's supply chain for the iPhone 5S -- which most analysts believe there is, based on the shortages that appeared almost instantly with the launch last Friday -- it's in the fingerprint scanning components, said Rassweiler. "It's the pinch point," he said. "There are a lot of upgrades [in the 5S], new technologies and other new choices, but they're not so new and not so cutting-edge that it could become a problem." Apple ran through its initial stocks of the iPhone 5S within hours of opening the digital doors of its online store Friday at 12:01 a.m. PT. Its chain of retail stores exhausted supplies of the smartphone no later than Sunday mornings. CEO Tim Cook even mentioned the shortages Monday as the company announced a record-setting opening weekend, an indication of the seriousness of the emptied inventory. "We appreciate everyone's patience and are working hard to build enough new iPhones for everyone," Cook said in a statement earlier this week. Rassweiler dismissed the idea that the iPhone 5S' new A7 system-on-a-chip (SoC), which contains the smartphone industry's first-ever 64-bit processor, may have caused the shortages. "The A7, yes, it's new technology," Rassweiler said. "But [any problems with it are] still traditional wafer fab issues, and nothing like a completely new assembly like the fingerprint scanner. They're on two different planets. The [fingerprint] scanner is far more novel." According to IHS' teardown and BOM estimate, the cost of the A7 and M7 processors -- the latter was a motion processor found only in the iPhone 5S that continuously measures motion data generated by the built-in accelerometer, gyroscope and compass -- were $19 together. That was a far cry from the most expensive component, the $41 for the display and touch-screen, and also under the $32 for the smartphone's wireless components. Meanwhile, the iPhone 5C sported a BOM $25.25 less than the 5S' estimate, but still produced an implied margin almost as high as that of its pricier sibling: 68% for the 5C versus 69% for the 5S. IHS credited the normal cost reductions that accrue during a year for the lower BOM of the iPhone 5C. Apple leveraged the reductions by building the iPhone 5C as a knock-off of 2012's iPhone 5. "The iPhone 5C is basically an iPhone 5 in a plastic disguise," said Rassweiler. "The combination of the design and component reuse --- and the plastic enclosure --- has allowed Apple to offer a less expensive version of the iPhone, although it's still not cheap enough to be a true low-cost smartphone." IHS expected the iPhone 5C to cost even less before it began pulling one apart, largely because it had not accounted for the interior steel frame around which the plastic case is wrapped. Apple said that the frame also doubles as the smartphone's antenna. "They left a lot of downward price potential on the table," said Rassweiler of the 5C's components, design and construction. "We had made the naive assumption that the plastic iPhone would be more plasticky. But under the plastic case is a not-inexpensive metal frame." More information about the IHS cost estimates of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C can be found on the firm's website. IHS tore apart the iPhone 5S to find what it was made of, and how it was made, then built acost-of-manufacturing estimate that pegged Apple's margin at a whopping 69%. (Image: IHS.)

The company also chose to create its own version of a hybrid drive for Macs rather than use one of several all-in-one offerings available from third party vendors. So when Apple Monday announced another first -- that the new MacBook Air will include native PCIe flash storage technology -- some industry pundits speculated that other hardware makers will follow suit. "It's coming," said Joseph Unsworth, research vice president for NAND Flash & SSD at Gartner. Michael Yang, an analyst at memory and storage research firm IHS iSuppli, said that while Apple's move is more evolutionary than revolutionary (PCIe flash cards for servers have been around for years), the addition of native PCIe flash in the Mac Pro and MacBook Air "officializes" the technology for the masses. The cost of flash has plummeted in recent years. Once a luxury, solid state drives (SSDs) now sell for under $1 per gigabyte. Today, most desktop and laptop manufacturers offer flash in the form of a SATA-connected SSD option in their systems. Once an expensive upgrade, vendors such as Apple charge about $100 for a 128GB SSD in a MacBook Pro. The upgrade provides a significant performance boost over hard drives. PCIe-based flash takes solid-state performance to new levels. Serial ATA, the most common interface for consumer NAND flash products, communicates through a high-speed serial cable over two pair of conductors. PCIe uses a switch architecture, which has multiple end points to allow the sharing of one endpoint with multiple end devices, according to IHS analyst Fang Zhang. For example, Apple's Mac Pro will boast 1.25GBps reads and 1.0GBps writes. The best consumer SATA III SSDs today offer about 550MB/sec speeds, or about half that of PCIe flash. "The benefits to a professional user is obvious and gives Apple more bragging rights in the art and publishing segment where it has been traditionally strong," Yang said. The flash storage in the MacBook Air is now up to 45% faster than the previous generation. The MacBook Air is available with up to 512GB of flash, and, according to AnandTech, has performance that approaches a mind-blowing 800MB/sec throughput. The 11-in MacBook Air model comes standard with twice the capacity of previous models - 128GB -- but still starts at starts at $999. Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, said Apple has already proven it can to a better job than other vendors at integrating solid-state storage with an operating system. In fact, Apple is the number one consumer of flash technology, according to IHS. And, Gottheil said, Apple never misses an opportunity to upsell. "At the higher end of their notebook line they sure want to look for every possible excuse for people to spend the kind of dollars they ask for those things," Gottheil said. "So assuming the power requirements are manageable for a laptop... yeah, they'll throw everything into their top of the line notebooks."

Sign up now Menu ARN Apple doubles down on iPad by doubling max storage to 128GB Apple doubles down on iPad by doubling max storage to 128GB Not a play to squeeze out the MacBook line, argues analyst Computerworld Staff (Computerworld (US)) 29 January, 2013 19:20 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Synnex XiT Distribution Comments Apple today doubled the maximum storage space of its fourth-generation iPad to 128GB, and announced it would start selling the new tablet next week. The Wi-Fi-only 128GB iPad will cost $799, while the cellular-enabled model will run $929. Those prices are $100 more than the corresponding 64GB iPad SKUs. Apple pitched the increased storage as a business play, citing the iPad's success in the Fortune 500, and running testimonials from several corporations who use the tablet. "Companies regularly utilizing large amounts of data such as 3-D CAD files, X-rays, film edits, music tracks, project blueprints, training videos and service manuals all benefit from having a greater choice of storage options for iPad," Apple said in a statement Tuesday. The new iPad will also be a money maker. According to the latest estimates by IHS iSuppli, Apple pays $9.60 per 16GB of NAND flash memory, the type used for iPad storage. But the company increases the retail price by $100 for each step-up in storage. A 128GB iPad's NAND RAM costs Apple approximately $77, twice the $38 for the 64GB model. Compared to the 64GB version, the 128GB iPad will generate about $62 in additional profit per unit. Apple's profit will be $142 higher for the 128GB iPad than the 32GB device, and a whopping $233 more than for each 16GB tablet. The 128GB of solid-state storage is the same amount that comes standard with Apple's top-end 11-in. MacBook Air, and the entry-level 13-in. MacBook Air and 13-in. MacBook Pro with Retina laptops. It's double that of the least-expensive 11-in. MacBook Air. But the storage space similarities don't portend a push against Mac laptops, said Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research. "I do think they would like to find a way to get some, or even many, users of PCs onto the iPad," Gottheil said of the storage increase. Gottheil's comment echoed the pitch Apple made today when it announced the beefed-up storage. "Customers ... are finding more great reasons to work, learn and play on their iPads rather than their old PCs," said Philip Schiller, Apple's top marketing executive. It shouldn't be a surprise that Schiller didn't include Macs in his cannibalization scenario, even though Apple has been adamant that if its products are at risk of cannibalization, it would rather Apple, not a rival, make the replacement sale. But could that be one of the reasons why Apple doubled the storage of the iPad, to capture sales it fears losing as its self-proclaiming "post-PC" era develops? Gottheil didn't think so. While it may seem that an iPad with a larger amount of storage space could better compete with a laptop on productivity and creativity, Gottheil disagreed. To morph the iPad into something akin to, say, Microsoft's Surface Pro -- which most experts see as a rival of ultra-light notebooks rather than tablets -- Apple would have to come up with a slick, integrated keyboard for the iPad and modify iOS to, for instance, allow true app multi-tasking, he argued. "I'm not sure if more storage is the answer," Gottheil said, pointing out that with cloud options, users can store their documents, video files and the like online. "The real challenge is the memory of the iPad, and looming large apps, especially [Microsoft] Office, that require more [memory]." The 128GB iPad will join the other models of the fourth-generation tablet -- 16GB, 32GB and 64GB -- on Tuesday, Feb. 5, when the tablet goes on sale at Apple's online and retail stores, and at some Apple resellers.

"You can make a smartphone for under $150 or even under $100," said Andrew Rassweiler, a senior director of IHS iSuppli's cost benchmarking team, in an interview Wednesday. "Apple could have done that if it de-speced [the iPhone 5C] enough. But it would have tarnished the brand." Two weeks ago, Apple unveiled the iPhone 5C, an old smartphone -- essentially 2012's iPhone 5 -- in a new plastic coat. More importantly to the Wall Street and industry analysts who had pondered the long-rumored handset, Apple priced the entry-level 16GB iPhone 5C at $549 sans a mobile carrier subsidy, just $100 less than the company's flagship iPhone 5S. Before the Sept. 10 unveiling, experts of all stripes bet on an unsubsidized price of between $300 and $450 for the iPhone 5C. That price range, their thinking went, would allow Apple to compete with global smartphone brands powered by Android, like Samsung, and the plethora of in-country, Android-using handset makers in massive markets such as China, like the hard-charging Xiaomi. They argued that without a truly low-priced model, Apple would continue to shed share -- especially in China, India and other parts of Asia -- and perhaps lose its prominent place in developers' minds as a result. In turn, that could negate one of its biggest advantages, a thriving app ecosystem. Instead, as only a few analysts predicted, including Ben Thompson of Stratechery, Apple reiterated the strategy that has made it billions: The iPhone is a premium smartphone even when it costs less. The build quality and components within the iPhone 5C support that, said Rassweiler. IHS regularly disassembles smartphones and tablets to see which component suppliers are in with a vendor, which have been dumped. The research firm also uses its teardowns to calculate a "bill of materials," or BOM, an estimate of the device's manufacturing cost. According to IHS' calculations, the iPhone 5C's BOM was $173.45 for the 16GB model. But Apple could have built an iPhone that would sell unsubsidized for $400 and retained its customary high hardware margin of around 68%, Rassweiler contended. Such an iPhone would have had to cut enough corners to bring the BOM in at approximately $130. In fact, IHS created a "straw man" BOM as an exercise, hoping to find out what such an iPhone would have -- and have to give up -- to meet the $130 limit. "We were able to make it to $134," said Rassweiler of IHS' speculative BOM for a $400 iPhone. "It would have had the same A6 [system-on-a-chip] as the iPhone 5C, the same display. But they would have had to downgrade the system memory from 1GB to 512MB, reduce the NAND flash to 8GB, [shrink] the battery to 1250 mAh [milliampere-hour], and it would have been 3G only." By comparison, the iPhone 5C that Apple released sported a minimum of 16GB of NAND flash memory, included a battery rated at 1510 mAh, and supported both 3G and LTE -- also called 4G -- cellular networks. Apple could not have stopped there. It also would have had to install a lower-quality rear-facing camera -- a 5-megapixel camera -- and supported only 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. The actual iPhone 5C boasted an 8-megapixel camera and supported both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi. "Those were all a far cry from the specs they used in the 5C," noted Rassweiler. IHS' imaginary lower-priced iPhone would also have been more "plasticky," as Rassweiler put it, and do without the expensive steel frame that firmed up the real device and doubled as its antenna. "We had made the naive assumption that the plastic iPhone would be more plasticky," said Rassweiler. "But under the plastic case is a not-inexpensive metal frame." Numerous reviewers -- including analysts who had hands-on time Sept. 10 -- have remarked how solid the iPhone 5C felt, a trait credited to the interior steel framework, which would have had to go to drive the BOM close to $130. The bottom line, said Rassweiler, is that a $400 iPhone would have felt, looked, and operated a lot cheaper than Apple's usual smartphones. And Apple knew it. "You definitely don't want to go low end in China," Rassweiler said, citing China- and Asia-based colleagues who were adamant about the danger to the brand and reputation of Apple if it had gone low rent. "Even so, there was a media backlash about how high-priced the iPhone 5C was for China." Still, Apple could have gone lower, if not to $400, then to a mark midway between that and $549, without damaging its brand. "They could have gone lower, split the difference," said Rassweiler. "We've seen plenty of phones much lower-priced than the iPhone 5C, but I don't think Apple wants to go there yet," he added. "But it could have been possible."

According to a poll conducted by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), U.S. Apple customers downsized the storage sizes of their iPhone and iPad between 4% and 12% in the just-completed quarter. The largest decrease in average storage capacity was for Apple's flagship iPhone 5S, which fell from 29.1GB in the December quarter to 25.7GB in the March quarter. The latter was down 11.7% from the former. Averages for the iPhone 5C and the iPad Air slid 8.6% in the March period, while storage for the Retina-equipped iPad Mini slipped 3.7%. Apple charges a $100 premium for each step in storage space for both the iPhone and iPad, and most of that is pure profit. An iPad Air with 16GB retails for $499, while the same tablet with 32GB runs $599, but Apple pays only $9 more for the memory in the latter, according to tear-down experts at IHS iSuppli. At the same time, CIRP's survey of 500 Americans who bought an iPhone, iPad or Mac in the January-March stretch showed that buyers leaned more toward the top-end models than in the same quarter the year prior. In the all-iPhone bucket, 62% of those sold were the iPhone 5S, compared to 53% of the then-top-tier iPhone 5 in early 2013. The iPad Air accounted for 47% of all iPads bought by the polled consumers in the first three months of this year, 12 percentage points more than the then-flagship Retina iPad during the first quarter of 2013. "Apple sold relatively cheaper storage configurations for these leading products. After the holiday quarter, buyers seemed to gravitate to the flagship models, while economizing with smaller storage capacity," said Mike Levin, co-founder and analyst at CIRP, in a statement. "We expect to see stable or even slightly lower U.S. ASPs as a result." Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

A lower-cost iPhone would be a major strategic shift by Apple, which has rigorously held the price line, and may signal that it believes real growth will be found only in emerging markets, said Sameer Singh, who covers the mobile industry at his Tech-Thoughts blog. "I think the primary driver would be their position in emerging markets," said Singh in a Thursday email reply to questions. In a Jan. 14 post, Singh assembled a rough estimate of what it might cost Apple to assemble a lower-priced iPhone. His total, including manufacturing costs, came to $144.03. By comparison, other BOM calculations by the likes of IHS iSuppli have pegged the BOM, including manufacturing, of the lowest-priced iPhone 5 at $207, indicating a 30% reduction in Apple's cost if it did pull the trigger on a less-expensive smartphone. Singh made numerous assumptions about the hypothetical handset -- which he, like others, tentatively dubbed "iPhone Mini" in a sop to a frequently-used Apple naming convention -- including a 3.5-in. display, 8GB of storage space, the same processor and camera as used in the successful iPad Mini, a plastic rather than metal case, and the omission of support for faster LTE, or 4G, data networks. "This is not a BOM estimate nor my prediction of the iPhone Mini's cost structure, but a rough estimate of how far Apple could realistically bring down product costs," Singh wrote in the Monday post. Many of his component assumptions were based on the idea that Apple would reuse parts it has worked with in the past, such as a 3.5-in Retina screen -- last used in the iPhone 4S -- and the A5 system-on-a-chip (SoC) found in the iPad Mini. Using the rough cost estimate, Singh then ball parked suggested list prices by determining various profit margins. He assumed that Apple would not surrender its historically high margins for such a phone, just as it did not when it created and priced the 7.9-in. iPad Mini tablet. "After the launch of the iPad Mini, we can safely say that Apple will not compromise on margins and will price its products at a premium even at the low end of the market," Singh said. The likeliest retail prices were $299 and $349, which would deliver margins ranging from 52% to 63%, close to, but not equal to, the 68% margin Apple collects on the iPhone 5. Analysts have argued that Apple needs a lower-priced iPhone to compete with the hard-charging Samsung, and to keep its growth in line with Wall Street's expectations by broadening the potential pool of buyers. Carriers in most emerging markets, China being at the top of the list, are resistant to paying Apple the large subsidies for the top-of-the-line iPhone -- which comes with a suggested retail price starting at $650 -- and so a cheaper model would presumably be more likely to sell well in those locales. Singh also outlined other problems at Apple that bother analysts, especially those on Wall Street, including recent talk of major cuts in iPhone 5 component orders and the now-established pattern where Apple sells massive numbers of a new model in the first quarter or two after introduction, but with dramatic decreases after that. A less-expensive iPhone may explain those rumors and help Apple address its up-and-down sales pattern, which seems to have had a major impact on its stock price. The component cuts could be due, Singh said, to Apple shifting to a more frequent release schedule where it launches a new iPhone two or more times a year. "An iPhone refresh ahead of schedule doesn't make much sense unless they move to a semi-annual release schedule," he noted. "In that case, a cheaper iPhone launch later in the year would make sense." With a cheaper iPhone in its portfolio, Apple would have two smartphone lines -- the flagship iPhone and the less-capable iPhone Mini -- and could spread out new model launches to alleviate the boom-bust cycle. "iPhones sales have become increasingly concentrated in the launch quarter, partly attributed to Apple's marketing prowess as well," Singh said. "The only way to really solve this is to move to a release cycle that's a little more spread out. And if Apple is planning on multiple releases, it makes sense to make a cheaper iPhone." While Singh acknowledged he has no information to support his theories, he speculated that if Apple does decide on a less-expensive iPhone, the company would launch the device in the fall, after it refreshes the iPhone 5 with a new high-priced model labeled "iPhone 5S" or even "iPhone 6." A cheaper iPhone would also give Apple an instantly-available fallback position if, as some have predicted, carriers eventually revolt against high subsidies. In the U.S., for instance, T-Mobile plans to start selling the iPhone this year, but will not subsidize the device. Instead, T-Mobile will tempt buyers with no-contract, unlimited data plans. If that carrier's experiment works, others will follow, analysts have said. "If they do go ahead with a cheaper iPhone, I think they'll view it as a hedge against subsidy disruption, as opposed to responding to an immediate threat," said Singh. Apple will hold its quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts next week, on Jan. 23, and while questions about its future plans, including a less-expensive iPhone may be asked, it's very unlikely that Apple will break with policy and reveal anything.

Apple said it has joined RE100, a global initiative by influential businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity. To date, RE100 has amassed membership from 77 corporations. Other RE100 members include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, VMware, Rackspace and Wells Fargo. Apple's announcement is mostly symbolic at this point. The company is already powering its operations in the U.S., China and 21 other countries with 100% renewable energy, and, in 2015, powered 93% of its operations around the world with renewable energy. Apple has invested in renewable energy for several years. Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, said Monday that the company completed construction on its latest renewable energy project — a 50-megawatt (MW) solar farm in Arizona, Apple worked with local utility Salt River Project on the solar array, which will provide renewable power to Apple's global command data center in Mesa, Arizona. The solar farm provides power equal to the energy use of more than 12,000 Arizona homes. Apple The Singapore solar project is the first distributed utility-scale installation in the country. Solar energy developer Sunseap Group will provide Apple with 100% renewable electricity from solar energy systems built atop more than 800 buildings in Singapore. Last year, Apple announced it would invest $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and a provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW (megawatts, or million watts) from the new California Flats Solar Project. The First Solar deal rocketed Apple past Walmart as the largest corporate user of solar power. On the same day Apple joined RE100, Bank of America also announced it was committing to RE100. America's top tech companies have been going green in a big way, so much so that the availability of clean energy resources is a key consideration in where they locate corporate offices and data centers. The move is designed to save them millions of dollars in long-term energy costs. "We believe energy is the future of our business," Josh Henretig, director of environmental sustainability at Microsoft, said in an earlier interview with Computerworld. Last year, Google announced it would purchase 842 megawatts (MW) of clean energy, nearly double the clean energy it had already purchased -- taking the company to 2 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy. Creative Commons Lic. The Googleplex is Google's corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company has committed to tripling its purchases of clean energy by 2025. Put in context, 1 megawatt (MW) can power roughly 200 homes, so Google's purchase could power about 168,000 homes. Google has pledged to triple its renewable energy purchases by 2025. Last year, Apple also joined with 12 of the largest companies in the U.S. to launch the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a White House initiative to have corporations commit to reduce their emissions, increase low-carbon investments, deploy more clean energy, and take other actions to build more sustainable businesses and tackle climate change. Despite only being a few months old, the RE100 collaborative already boasts corporate signups from companies in India, China, Europe and the U.S. "Research shows that in the U.S. alone, doubling energy productivity by 2030 could save $327 billion annually in energy costs and add 1.3 million jobs to the economy, while carbon dioxide emissions would be cut by approximately 33%," RE100 stated on its website. "We're happy to stand beside other companies that are working toward the same effort," Jackson said during remarks at Climate Week in New York City on Monday. "We're excited to share the industry-leading work we've been doing to drive renewable energy into the manufacturing supply chain and look forward to partnering with RE100 to advocate for clean-energy policies around the world." Apple is also a member of The Advanced Energy Economy (AEE), a trade association representing the renewable energy industry. "We're thrilled that Advanced Energy Economy member Apple has committed to run on 100% renewable energy and also sees the need to improve policy," AEE CEO Graham Richard said in a statement Tuesday. "They are upping the ante as they manage their energy needs, a trend we are seeing among our corporate energy buyer members." Last month, Apple glass supplier Lens Technology in Beijing announced it would run its Apple operations entirely on renewable energy. The clean energy commitment by Lens was combined with a zero waste compliance agreement for all of its final assembly sites. Solvay Specialty Polymers, which supplies Apple with antenna bands for the iPhone, also pledged to use 100% renewable energy for all of its Apple production. The commitment will cover 14 manufacturing facilities across eight countries by the end of 2018. Catcher Technology, one of Apple’s largest aluminum enclosure suppliers, also is targeting 100% renewable power for its production of Apple goods by the end of 2018. Altogether, Apple suppliers' commitments to date will represent more than 1.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy used in the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018, equal to the amount of electricity consumed by more than 1 million Chinese homes.

At the same time, automakers are also queuing up Google's Android Auto for mirroring those smartphones to radio systems. Android Auto is expected to outpace CarPlay in manufacturer deployments, according to research firm IHS. Apple's own website proclaims that CarPlay will be available in "select new cars in 2014." But, to date, no car manufacturer has rolled the software out, according to Filomena Berardi, a senior analyst with ABI Research. Three of five leading carmakers who had expected to integrate the CarPlay middleware for 2015 models coming out this year appear to have delayed their rollout. Some of the basic apps available on Apple's CarPlay user interface (image: Apple). Mercedes-Benz confirmed it is delaying the rollout until next year. Volvo, according to 9to5Mac, indicated it is also delaying its rollout until 2015. Honda had planned a 2014 rollout, but is expected to delay that move as well until 2015, according to IHS. Colin Bird, a senior analyst for Software, Apps, & Services at IHS, said CarPlay and Android Auto are relatively simple middleware applications that shouldn't present much of a challenge for automakers to integrate. "For Volvo, part of it seems to be either a miscommunication or a delay of the product CarPlay's being deployed on, which is the XC90 SUV," Bird said, adding that the new vehicle model is now due out in 2015 in North America. In an email reply to Computerworld, a Volvo spokesman said the company will announce all details about its CarPlay plans at the world premiere of the new Volvo XC90, which will take place on Tuesday. Hyundai is one carmaker that still plans a 2014 deployment of CarPlay and Android Auto. Android Auto's music player (image: Google). "Right now, they're performing the final validation work as we speak," said Hyundai spokesman Miles Johnson. "We're still planning to have it in the 2015 models year for sure." Apple, which refers to CarPlay as "iOS in the car," and Android Auto will enable simpler, but similar user interfaces on a vehicle's infotainment system, also known as the radio head unit. Once connected, basic iPhone and Android apps, such as phone, music and maps, will appear as icons in the infotainment touchscreen display. Two dozen manufacturers plan to implement CarPlay and/or Android Auto in new vehicles. Those carmakers include Chrysler, Fiat, Maserati, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Suzuki, BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar/Land Rover, Toyota, Nissan, Ferrari, and Volvo. According to IHS, Android Auto will outpace CarPlay in deployments through the year 2020. Both Android Auto and CarPlay are expected to be deployed in at least 100,000 vehicles this year, according to Bird. However, over the next six years, Android Auto will see a 179% annual growth rate, while Apple's CarPlay will see a 165% annual growth rate. In 2020, Android Auto will be deployed in 40 million cars versus 37 million for CarPlay, Bird said. "Open-source" middleware platforms, such as MirrorLink, OAA and GENIVI will also take up a much smaller share of the smartphone/infotainment system integration market, according to IHS. Unlike CarPlay and Android Auto, which enable integration only with iOS and Android devices, open-source standards such as MirrorLink can also handle Android, Windows and Blackberry phones. "For MirrorLink, we only see 3 million in 2016," Bird said. "That's just because of the popularity of iOS and Android." Android Auto's navigation interface (Image: Google). Just as with native vehicle infotainment apps, CarPlay-enabled and Android Auto-enabled apps can be controlled by voice, through a car's built-in touchscreen or by steering wheel-mounted controls. The middleware is part of the head-unit or infotainment system that interfaces to the middleware in Android or iPhone smartphones. While some companies are pushing the envelope to release their middleware this year, others such as Toyota are targeting a 2015 release. "So it just seems like part of it is different strategies...or just simple product delays," Bird said. Read more about emerging technologies in Computerworld's Emerging Technologies Topic Center.

The researchers, led by cryptography expert Matthew D. Green of Johns Hopkins University, wrote software that mimicked an Apple server and then targeted an encrypted photo stored on iCloud, the publication reported. They were able to obtain the decryption key by repeatedly guessing each of its 64 digits. When a correct digit was guessed, the phone let them know if it was correct. Further technical details were not available. Apple's iMessage application uses end-to-end encryption, which means the company does not store any encryption keys. A vulnerability in iMessage would mean that attackers would have a way to circumvent that security and view private content. Storing the encryption keys on the devices rather than central servers is considered a good security practice. But researchers have pointed out weaknesses in Apple's system and how it would, in theory, be possible for the company to send copies of iMessages to another party. The Washington Post story prompted many comments on Twitter after it was apparently mistakenly posted earlier on Sunday but then withdrawn. The story then ran just after midnight Monday U.S. East Coast time. Apple is quoted as saying the flaw will be patched in iOS 9.3, which is due for release Monday. Apple officials couldn't immediately be reached. Ian Miers, a computer science doctoral student at Johns Hopkins, wrote on Twitter on Sunday that a blog post, technical paper and more details will be released after Apple issues a patch. "And now you have 14 hours to guess what the attack is," Miers wrote in another tweet. "As a hint, no, it's not a bug in how Apple stores or encrypts attachments." The Post reported that the vulnerability will not help the U.S. government unlock the phone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. Apple is in a legal battle with the government over a court order that requires the company to create a special version of iOS that would allow investigators to try to unlock Farook's phone. Farook's iPhone 5c in question may have a security feature enabled that will destroy a decryption key for its data if the passcode is entered 10 times incorrectly. The government wants access to six weeks' worth of data stored only on the device and was not backed up to Farook's iCloud account, which Apple turned over to investigators. Apple fears creating such software will pose risks to millions of customers if it was obtained by other parties.

Sign up now Menu ARN Tor Project says it can quickly catch spying code Tor Project says it can quickly catch spying code The organization has worked for three years to improve its ability to catch fraudulent software Jeremy Kirk (IDG News Service) 22 March, 2016 13:47 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Comments The Tor Project is fortifying its software so that it can quickly detect if its network is tampered with for surveillance purposes, a top developer for the volunteer project wrote on Monday. There are worries that Tor could either be technically subverted or subject to court orders, which could force the project to turn over critical information that would undermine its security, similar to the standoff between Apple and the U.S. Department of Justice. Tor developers are now designing the system in such a way that many people can verify if code has been changed and "eliminate single points of failure," wrote Mike Perry, lead developer of the Tor Browser, on Monday. Over the last few years, Tor has concentrated on enabling users to take its source code and create their "deterministic builds" of Tor that can be verified using the organization's public cryptographic keys and other public copies of the application. "Even if a government or a criminal obtains our cryptographic keys, our distributed network and its users would be able to detect this fact and report it to us as a security issue," Perry wrote. "From an engineering perspective, our code review and open source development processes make it likely that such a backdoor would be quickly discovered." Two cryptographic keys would be required for a tampered version of the Tor Browser to be distributed without at least initially tripping security checks: the SSL/TLS key that secures the connection between a user and Tor Project servers plus the key used to sign a software update. "Right now, two keys are required, and those keys are not accessible by the same people," Perry wrote in a Q&A near the end of the post. "They are also secured in different ways." Even if an attacker obtained the keys, in theory people would be able to check the software's hash and figure out if it may have been tampered with. Apple is fighting a federal court's order to create a special version of iOS 9 that would remove security protections on an iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino mass shooters. A ruling against Apple is widely feared by technology companies, as it could give the government wider leverage to order companies to undermine encryption systems in their products. On Monday, the Justice Department indicated it is investigating an alternative method to crack Farook's iPhone, which if successful would not require Apple's assistance. Perry wrote that the Tor Project stands "with Apple to defend strong encryption and to oppose government pressure to weaken it. We will never backdoor our software." Tor, short for The Onion Router, is a network that provides more anonymous browsing across the Internet using a customized Firefox Web browser. The project was started by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory but is now maintained by the nonprofit Tor Project. Web browsing traffic is encrypted and routed through random proxy servers, making it harder to figure out the true IP address of a computer. Tor is a critical tool for activists and dissidents, as it provides a stronger layer of privacy and anonymity. But some functions of Tor have also been embraced by cybercriminals, which has prompted interest from law enforcement. Thousands of websites run as Tor "hidden" services, which have a special ".onion" URL and are only accessible using the customized browser. The Silk Road, the underground market shut down by the FBI in October 2013, is one of the most famous sites to use the hidden services feature.

License plate readers worried FBI lawyers, documents reveal As license-plate-reading technology spreads and huge databases are built up across the U.S. that could be used to track innocent people's movements, it emerges that the FBI had its doubts, at least for a while. Wired reports that the FBI's lawyers recommended that it stop buying the devices in 2012. Seems that the moratorium was temporary, though. Just click 'buy' -- coming soon to Google search results Google will include a "buy" button in its search results on mobile devices in the coming weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. Google will let shoppers store payment information, and products will still be sold and shipped by retailers. Macy's is apparently in talks to sign on to the program. Alibaba sued over sales of luxury counterfeits Alibaba is facing a lawsuit in New York federal court brought by luxury brands that are alleging the Chinese e-commerce giant is deliberately promoting fakes on its online marketplace.

ARM moving fast on next high-end chip ARM is in the advanced stages of development of its next high-end processor, and it could reach mobile-device makers by the end of next year. The company's designs are used in most of the world's smartphones and tablets, and its speedy development work reflects both the intense pressure to get new products to market quickly, and heightened competition from Intel. European telcos split on sanity of blocking Google's ads After some European mobile service providers were reported last week to be considering a scheme to block Google's mobile ads across their networks in a ploy to force the search giant to share revenue, a few other big carriers have stepped forward to say the plan is ill-conceived. Both Deutsche Telekom and Swedish operator TeliaSonera said they would not engage in the plan; a representative of the latter pointed out that Google's apps and services drive traffic, and data consumption, and tangling with it doesn't make sense.

Sign up now Menu ARN Fierce smartphone rivalry driving faster chip development, ARM CEO says Fierce smartphone rivalry driving faster chip development, ARM CEO says New mobile chips are now being developing at a yearly pace to line up with smartphone announcements Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 21 May, 2015 09:28 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments Smartphones using ARM-based chips. View all images Heated competition in the smartphone and tablet markets has required chip makers to speed up the pace at which they release new processors, the CEO of ARM said in an interview this week. Following in the footsteps of Apple, rivals like Samsung and HTC are upgrading their flagship devices on a near yearly basis, adding better displays, faster chips and more memory to entice customers into buying their products. ARM designs the microprocessors used in most of those devices, and the increased competition means it's having to push out faster, more power-efficient chips at a quicker pace, CEO Simon Segars said Tuesday. "We're always going to be looking to deliver more performance, make the best use of manufacturing technology ... and deliver better system-wide efficiency," he added. ARM creates chip designs that it licenses to other companies such as Samsung, Apple and Qualcomm, who then tweak those designs for use in phones and tablets. A report last week said ARM is making rapid progress on its next major processor design, which could turn out to be the quickest design upgrade it's yet produced. The new chip could be rolling off production lines by the end of next year and appearing in mobile gadgets soon after that, according to the report, from The Linley Group. That would mean it arrives just a year after its predecessor, the Cortex-A72, which was announced in March and is expected in devices at the end of this year. The A72 also arrived sooner than expected, but it was a much-needed upgrade to its predecessor, the Cortex-A57. That chip was announced in 2012 and took two years to find its way into mobile devices -- perhaps twice as long as the current chips. Segars declined to comment on specific plans for the newest chip, but he acknowledged that ARM has been accelerating its design efforts. That's possible partly because ARM has more CPU designers than it had in the past, he said. Beyond the CPU itself, ARM is looking at ways to improve memory and to speed up data exchange between components, he said. ARM's yearly upgrade cycle mirrors that of Apple, which releases new A-series chips for its iPhones on a similar 12-month schedule. Apple's new chips typically include upgrades for the CPU, connectivity and graphics components. The tech industry has grown accustomed to the pace at which vendors upgrade PC lines, which happens every year to 18 months. ARM is meeting the demands of a smartphone industry that's heading toward a cycle of six months to one year, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The faster refresh cycle is the fruit of investments ARM made a few years back to help it stay ahead of Intel, its primary competitor, McCarron said. Intel's smartphone chips are used in only a few handsets, but two years ago the company said it would upgrade its mobile chips faster in an effort to break ARM's dominance. Intel year released new Atom chips code-named Merrifield and Moorefield, and earlier this year it shipped chips code-named Sofia for low-end smartphones. The Sofia chips were made in conjunction with Chinese company Rockchip, which has experience turning around processor designs in a matter of months, McCarron said. Next year Intel will ship a high-end Atom chip called Broxton, which has a modular design that allows Intel to modify the chip and deliver updates at a faster pace. Broxton supports Intel's larger plan to deliver products that can be customized more easily, making its model more similar to that of ARM. For now, the intense competition has resulted in new chips coming to market more quickly, but designing and manufacturing chips is a complex business, and it remains to be seen how long the yearly upgrade cycle will continue.

At the IFA trade show, Samsung Electronics and Motorola Mobility aim to show that their smartwatches can compete with Apple's, Sony needs to demonstrate that it's still a relevant smartphone manufacturer, and LG want to convince customers that it's time to buy a new TV. Here's what to look out for: Smartwatches Samsung has already revealed it plans to launch the round Gear S2 in Berlin. The square original was powered by the company's own Tizen operating system, and the new model is likely to use it as well. Videos and images of the Gear S2 hint at a product that's smaller and better-looking than the original model, which was just a bit too large. If Samsung wants to keep the cost down and improve the battery life, removing the integrated 3G connection would also be a step in the right direction. Last year saw Samsung attack the smartwatch market with a barrage of products. But it seems the company has rethought that strategy since the Gear S2 will be the first model it has launched this year. Spending all its resources on one product that could turn out to be really good, as opposed to a handful of so-so efforts, may be a better approach. Sales during the second quarter showed Samsung needs to do something different. It sold 600,000 wearables to gain a 3.3 percent market share, according to IDC. That left it far behind Fitbit and Apple, which sold 4.4 million and 3.6 million units, respectively. Motorola Mobility also needs to reboot its smartwatch strategy. It sold only 150,000 smartwatches during Q2, IDC said. The round, Android Wear-based Moto 360 was one of the most anticipated products when it arrived last year, but it didn't quite deliver. The company hasn't been as forthcoming about its plans for IFA as Samsung has, but is expected to launch at least two new and improved smartwatches with different sized screens. Smartphones Samsung has already put its contenders on the field with the recently launched Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+, but it looks like there will still be some noteworthy smartphone introductions at IFA. Huawei Technologies is expected to launch a successor to the Mate 7. The new model is rumored to be called the Mate S and comes with a 6-inch, 1440 by 2560 pixel screen. It may also have a 21-megapixel camera and up to 64GB of integrated storage (plus whatever is added via the microSD card slot) and 4GB of RAM. That debut will go up against the anticipated Xperia Z5 from Sony, a smartphone that could turn out to be the company's swan song in this category. The company has been struggling for some time, as it's become hard to see why millions of consumers would wake up one morning and realize they want a high-end smartphone from Sony instead of one from Apple or Samsung. There is little doubt Sony makes good smartphones, but not enough people want to buy them. But Sony doesn't seem ready to give up just yet. The company is betting on its camera know-how to help the Z5 stand out with a 23-megapixel sensor. The company will also deliver a long battery life with a 4,500mAh battery capacity, according to reports. The Z5 is also rumored to be one of the first devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820. That may be a long shot, however, since Qualcomm has said the first devices won't arrive until the first half of next year. Hopefully, Sony has decided to launch a smaller Compact model, as well as a large one. Big screens may be all the rage, but not everyone wants one. TVs While mobile devices have been getting most of the attention at the last couple of IFAs, new TVs have always been a mainstay at the show, and this year won't be any different. LG Electronics has already said the company will unveil four new OLED TVs in Berlin. The 55-inch and 65-inch EF9500 models feature the industry’s first flat 4K resolution OLED displays, according to LG. They also have support for HDR (high dynamic range), which is meant to improve contrast and color reproduction. LG contends only OLED panels can deliver the absolute black that makes the bright colors of HDR look even more impressive, it said. Right now, however, very little content is broadcast or streamed in HDR, so early adopters won't see the full benefit of the technology.

But there are no unlocked versions in sight. Dan Rosenbaum (Computerworld (US)) 09 March, 2016 03:28 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Pacific Datacom Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are beautifully well-executed smartphones, worthy flagships from one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers. The changes from last year's S6 lines are incremental, but the fixes and upgrades are in all the right places. Those small improvements make for two vastly better phones, which start at $650 (for the S7) and $750 (for the S7 Edge), depending on the carrier. Samsung, like its bête noire Apple, seems to be on a two-year schedule, with major upgrades and model increments appearing in alternating years. The S7, like Apple's biennial "S" upgrades, builds on last year's models in important ways without changing the basic form. Specs and features The signature improvement, the one that will headline many reviews, is true: The S7 line is all but waterproof. In tech terms, the S7 phones have an IP68 rating: Impervious to dust and protected from prolonged immersion of up to 3 meters. In 30 years of reviewing electronics, I've never before dunked a product. This past week, I filled a sink (it's still winter in New York and a pool wasn't handy) and dropped in a phone. On purpose. And left it there. It sank -- but it was fine. None of the obvious penetration points -- the micro-USB power port, mic, speaker, power and volume buttons, SIM/memory drawer -- leaked water. Over the past year (admittedly a bad year) this single feature would have saved my family $1,000. Dan Rosenbaum The Samsung Galaxy S7 is very water resistant. Really. A waterproof product, interesting as it may be, would be kind of pointless if that was the only remarkable thing about it. The S7s just start there. These are top-of-the-line phones. The S7 is 5.6 x 2.75 x 0.3 in. with a 5.1-in. screen; the S7 Edge is 5.9 x 2.9 x 0.3 in. with a 5.7-in. screen. The S7's screen is flat; the Edge version is rounded along both long edges. The S7 weighs 5.36 oz.; the Edge weighs 5.54 oz., not a particularly noticeable difference. The phones themselves are sleek and welcoming; they felt well balanced in my hand. Both the S7 and S7 Edge run Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) and default to Samsung's TouchWiz flavor of UI. Both phones come in black and gold; the Edge also comes in silver. Red and green Edges from last year have apparently been retired. (A pity, I liked them.) Stupendous screens The screens of the S7 and S7 Edge will knock your eyes out. Both displays are Super AMOLED, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4, 2560 x 1440 pixels with a 640dpi resolution. They're astonishingly sharp, and the processing infrastructure behind them easily keeps up with the displays. The added real estate of the dot pitch and pixel count gives the interface room to breathe that you may not have known you were missing. The Samsung phones follow the current fashion of "always-on" screens; even when the phone is in sleep mode, it displays the time or calendar. (Exactly what the phone displays is configurable to a slight extent.) Samsung says power drain is minimal -- 0.8mAh per hour -- and has no significant impact on battery life. I'd agree with that claim. [Further reading: Wearables in the enterprise? Yes, really!] And as in previous models, the rounded screens of the S7 Edge have functions. Depending how and where you swipe from the edge, you can read news or sports headlines, get quick access to top contacts or frequently used functions. The Edge has a Do Not Disturb mode that shows the time only along one of its edges. It's really quite subtle and lovely. And swiping up and down along an edge when the phone is asleep will show you how many emails you have waiting and show a news crawl. I love the look and feel of the Edge -- and I'm not usually a fan of big phones -- and kept hoping to love the Edge-exclusive functions, but could never quite get there. They're an incremental interface improvement, but in and of themselves, not a reason to get the Edge. Speed and comfort There's hardly a corner on these phones. The sides are rounded and fit comfortably in the hand. The power button is on the right edge, perfectly placed, and volume buttons are along the left edge. The SIM/SD card drawer is on the top; the speaker, micro-USB port and earphone jack are on the bottom. The power and volume switches are perfectly positioned under your thumb and index fingers. The designers paid close attention to the phone's balance and the way you'll hold it, and the buttons are exactly right in ways that most phones' aren't. Notice two of those features: Samsung has restored the micro-SD port that it took out of the S6, and it has decided to stick with a micro-USB power connection instead of USB-C. The former is a welcome choice. The wisdom of the latter will be revealed only with time and through the competitive landscape. The battery (3,000mAh for the S7, 3,600mAh for the Edge) remains sealed. This really isn't a problem; the phones support QuickCharge 2.0 and charge fully in about two hours. Rundown tests show a 4-hour talk time for the S7 and 5 hours for the Edge, and standby times of more than two days each. Both support wireless charging -- both the Qi and AirFuel standards -- which wasn't tested for this review. Depending on which market you wind up with, your phone may be based on either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or Samsung's home-rolled Exynos 8890. (In the review units, both on Verizon for the U.S. market, the S7 came with a Samsung processor and the Edge with Qualcomm's.) Both are quad-core top-of-the-line processors, and if there is any functional difference between them, it didn't emerge in testing. Both phones have a slightly raised oblong Home button/fingerprint sensor in the center of the phones' front bottom edge. The Chooser and Back capacitor buttons are on the left and right, respectively, of the Home button, and light up only when they're touched. This is something of a UI problem because there's no indication that the buttons exist, let alone their function, until you use them. Unlike the Power and Volume controls, the bottom-row controls are just OK. I've become a fan of the way LG puts a fingerprint sensor/Home button on a phone's back, and the ability in LG phones to change the arrangement of the front panel buttons to account for handed-ness. Samsung's phones always have the Chooser on the left and Back on the right. Camera The main camera on the back of the phones -- in the center laterally and about a half-inch from the phones' top edge -- cause a barely-there 0.5mm bump, significantly less prominent than in previous models. It's a 12MP camera that's been built with low-light shooting in mind. The camera's got an aperture of f/1.7 and fewer pixels on the same-size sensor as the S6, which lets the remaining pixels be larger. That's key for photo quality. An LED flash and heart rate/SpO2 sensor are to the right of the camera lens. The phones have the expected complement of Bluetooth, GPS, NFC and WiFi radios. They work with Samsung Pay and Google Pay, and they still puzzle sales clerks when Samsung Pay mimics magnetic card swipes. One of the places that Samsung has applied its processing power to is the camera. Focusing and exposure calculation is very fast. There are panorama, hyperlapse and slo-mo modes, as well as a Food mode if you're one of those annoying people who eat with their eyes. In addition, the S7s allow live streaming over YouTube. Selective focus lets you pick what part of an already-taken photo will be in focus, and there's a "virtual shot" mode that seems to be a kind of panorama mode around objects. I didn't understand it and couldn't get it to work in any interesting way. And, for ultimate control freaks, there's Pro mode that gives you full exposure control. The camera even lets you save in RAW format. Off to see the TouchWiz TouchWiz is Samsung's Android UI, and it's gotten a refresh for Android 6.0. How annoying you find it will probably be a function of how much of an Android purist you are, or how much you've gotten used to other phone makers' versions of Android. As UIs go, though, there's a lot to recommend in TouchWiz. When you pull down from the top of the screen, you'll see the usual set of notifications, along with a horizontal row of well-chosen quick-access settings buttons: Wi-Fi, Location, Sound, Auto-rotate and Bluetooth. Pull down again, and rather than the usual full Settings menu, you're presented with four rows of customizable quick-access settings buttons. If you want something that isn't in that matrix, you can click on the gear, as usual, to forage through the Android settings list. (Left) Dragging from the screen edge of the S7 Edge brings up a set of quick-choice icons. (Right) The TouchWiz flavor of Android 6.0 puts the Google entry box a third of the way down the page and the Apps drawer at the bottom right. TouchWiz does a bunch of tricks to shrink the effective size of the screen for one-handed operation. On the Home screen, the Google entry window is a third of the way down the screen, rather than at the top. The Apps launcher is on the right of the lower row, rather than in the middle. Maybe the neatest trick, though, are the keyboards. Samsung has taken advantage of its high pixel count and resolution to shrink the keyboard in a way that doesn't force you to reach all the way across the screen to type with one hand. The keyboard stretches about three-fourths of the way across the screen (and includes a fifth numeric row), which makes it easy to type one-handedly. And best of all, you can choose which side of the phone the keyboard appears on, making life easier no matter which hand you type with. It is truly a beautiful hack. It takes a while to figure out that with TouchWiz, the Google Now interface isn't accessed by swiping right, the way it is in stock Android. Swiping right does nothing unless you've set up what appears to be an immovable Flipboard widget. If you want Google Now cards, tap in the Google search bar on the Home screen. The most annoying part of TouchWiz comes in the worst possible place: When you're setting up your phone. On a Verizon phone (our review units were on Verizon), there are no fewer than three ecosystems you need to opt into -- or not. First comes the My Verizon cloud, which wants to control your SMS, photos and contacts. Then there's Google, which is necessary because Android pretty much requires access to Google. Lastly, you're asked to create a Samsung account "to get the most out of your device," which seems to entail downloading Galaxy apps including S Health and unexplained "enhanced features." Three ecosystems is at least one too many, and leaves the nagging impression that the people who sold you the phone think of it less as a piece of personal technology and more as a network endpoint through which you can be sold services. That's not a particular rap against Samsung as much as it is about the wireless industry, except to the extent that the company was unable to build a graceful onboard experience that matches the elegance of their phones. As it is, the setup process is confusing and intimidating. You're being asked to opt into and create credentials for services you're not really told about; you're being asked three times for permission without being informed what you're signing up for. From a personal security standpoint, this is terrible. From a consumer point of view, it's pretty assaultive and underlines that the companies behind your phone see it as a way to, as they say, deepen their relationship with you. The services may well be useful, but this process isn't designed for informed consent. Paying the price Pricing, unfortunately, seems to be carrier-dependent. For example, the Galaxy S7 with 32GB of RAM costs $200 with a two-year Verizon or Sprint contract, or $23 per month for 30 months from AT&T. The Edge, also with 32GB of RAM, costs $300 from Verizon or Sprint with a two-year contract, and $26 per month for 30 months from AT&T. T-Mobile prices the S7 at $670 and the S7 Edge at $780; AT&T prices them at $695 and $795 with "qualifying service." There are a variety of other pricing options as well. According to Samsung, there are no current plans to make the phones available unlocked -- an increasingly unusual state of affairs for high-end phones these days. Bottom line Over the past couple of years, Android phones have been gaining in power and sophistication, and the Samsung S7 series is pretty much the state of the art. The physical package is right: top-end build quality, waterproofing, switches in the right place, long battery life, expandability, a knock-out screen and plenty of processing power. The software is right: Smartly implemented UI enhancements and Android's increasingly seamless melding of device and cloud. There are quibbles -- placement of the fingerprint sensor, lack of handedness control of the basic controls - but they're just that: quibbles. Less of a quibble is a setup process that tries to lock you into ecosystems without your fully informed consent. But you can still say no and use the phone reasonably well until you know what it is you're consenting to. We're reaching the time of year when top-end phones are hitting the market. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have set a very high bar for the rest of the industry. Whichever platform you may prefer, these phones are currently the ones to beat. At a Glance Galaxy S7/S7 Edge Samsung Price: Verizon: $672 or $28/mo. (S7), $792 or $33/mo. (S7 Edge); T-Mobile: $670 or $28/mo. (S7), $780 or $33/mo. (S7 Edge); Sprint: $650 or $27/mo. (S7), $750 or $31/mo. (S7 Edge); AT&T: $695 or $23/mo. (S7), $795 or $26/mo.

IDC said that smartphone shipments in the quarter increased just 0.2% compared to the first quarter of 2015, marking the smallest year-over-year growth on record. IDC recorded 334.9 million smartphones shipped worldwide during the quarter. Even Samsung, the world's biggest smartphone maker with a 25 per cent market share, saw a slight decline of 0.6 per cent in smartphone shipments, dropping to 81.9 million. No. 2 Apple declined by 16.3 per cent to 51.2 million, giving it a 15 per cent market share, IDC said. In developed economies like the US, nearly everybody already has a smartphone -- and next-generation models don't seem significantly better to bother with a replacement, analysts have noted for the past year or more. Even in China, where smartphone sales were once supposed to help Apple and others, "the appetite for smartphones has slowed dramatically as the explosion of uptake has passed its peak," IDC said. Year-over-year growth in China was 62 per cent in 2013; that number dropped to 2.5 per cent by 2015. "We've seen the writing on the wall for some time with smartphone replacement rates down and saturation high in developed markets," said IDC analyst Ramon Llamas. "The smartphone market in emerging markets has also been steadily shrinking. What's the next emerging market going to be? It's not a China or an India. It's going to be scattered across less dense populations and less dense markets. Seeing things flatten is the way the market is going now." Like other analysts, Llamas said it isn't clear what new smartphone features will throw a life-line to the overall industry. "What will make the market move up again, that's the $64,000 question," he said. "Things are slowing down quite a bit for smartphones and will adding 5G wireless do it?" he said. "Not really, since that's coming post-2020. The usual things every vendor is putting on are either a big screen or a small screen. They continue to play with materials. So, let's look at where new applications take us. " As both Samsung and Apple were hit by the same market pressures in the first quarter, Huawei came in third place, with 8% market share and growth of 58 per cent year-over-year. Huawei shipped 27.5 million smartphones in the quarter. Smartphone makers in the next two spots are almost completely unknown in the U.S. In fourth place, Oppo had 5.5 per cent of the market share with 18.5 million smartphones shipped --an increase of 153 per cent. And in fifth place, Vivo took 4.3 per cent of the market, with 14.3 million smartphones shipped. That represented an increase of 123 per cent.

The new program, dubbed OSX/Dok by researchers from Check Point Software Technologies, was distributed via email phishing campaigns to users in Europe. One of the rogue emails was crafted to look as if it was sent by a Swiss government agency warning recipients about apparent errors in their tax returns. The malware was attached to the email as a file called Dokument.zip. What makes OSX/Dok interesting is that it was digitally signed with a valid Apple developer certificate. These certificates are issued by Apple to members of its developer program and are needed to publish applications in the official Mac App Store. Applications signed with an Apple-issued developer certificate can also be installed on the latest versions of macOS without triggering security errors or requiring manual overrides, so it's not hard to see why this would be valuable to a malware program. It's not clear if Dok's creators paid to obtain a developer certificate by joining Apple's developer program with a fake identity or if they stole the certificate from a legitimate developer. Once installed on a Mac, OSX/Dok displays a fake and persistent notification about a system security update that needs to be installed. Users who agree to install the update will be prompted for their administrator password. Once the malware obtains elevated privileges, it will make the active user a permanent administrator so the OS will never ask for the password again when the malware executes privileged commands in the background. Dok will also modify the system's network settings to route web traffic through a proxy server controlled by the attackers andÂ located on the Tor anonymity network. In order for this to work, it also installs a Tor client that's started automatically. The reason why web traffic is routed through a proxy server is to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and decrypt secure HTTPS connections. This is achieved by installing a rogue root certificate on the system that is then used to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS connections when they pass through the proxy. With this method, users will continue to see the SSL visual indicator in their browser when they access HTTPS websites and the browser will not complain about untrusted certificates. The ability to snoop on HTTPS traffic allows attackers to steal sensitive information like passwords for email; social media and online banking accounts; credit card details entered on shopping websites; personal and financial information entered into web forms; and more. With more than half of all web traffic in an average user's browser now encrypted, it's not surprising that attackers are resorting to man-in-the-middle techniques to capture sensitive data. This and other capabilities make Dok one of the most sophisticated malware programs targetingÂ macOS to date, not counting spy programs created or used by nation states and law enforcement agencies. "We have been and still are in direct contact with Apple [employees] who are very helpful and responsive," Yaniv Balmas, Check Point's malware research team leader, said via email. "With Appleâs cooperation, we believe this specific campaign is now futile and does no longer pose any threat to Mac users." Check Point is looking for related attack campaigns and other possible variants of this malware that might have remained undiscovered until now. "The best way to avoid being infected with this and similar type of malware is to stay alert while opening emails and files from untrusted or unknown sources," Balmas said.

Sign up now Menu ARN Anything you post can and will be used against you Anything you post can and will be used against you Sure, the CIA can hack your TV, but public posts on Facebook could really hurt you Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 11 March, 2017 23:00 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Comments Everybody's freaking out over the Wikileaks revelations that the Central Intelligence Agency can hack Apple and Android smartphones, major PC operating systems -- and even TV sets. The news is causing ripples in international relations and got companies like Google and Apple to patch holes and issue fixes. It's also creating unnecessary panic. Wikileaks' characterization of the documents was alarmist and misleading. The press picked up on the alarmism and spread further misinformation. Many in the public believe that the CIA has some new and hitherto unimaginable ability to hack anything. In reality, the Wikileaks documents reveal what we should have already assumed: The CIA collects knowledge about and tools for hacking things. The Wikileaks/CIA stories simply remind us that anything with a camera, microphone or IP address could theoretically be hacked. The question is, will the CIA hack you? I believe the chances that the CIA (or any other hacker) will watch or listen to you, personally, through your smartphone, PC, TV or IP camera are extremely low. It's probably never going to happen. And if it does, it's unlikely that you'll be affected in any way. Yes, take precautions. Use encrypted communication. Don't click on links emailed from strangers. Cover your laptop camera with tape like Mark Zuckerberg does. But anxiety and action shouldn't be based only on what could happen in theory as much as what's likely to happen in practice -- and how much it will affect you. Some people are afraid of sharks. While the prospect of being eaten by a giant fish is vivid and terrifying, it's also unlikely, old chum. In fact, the drive to the beach is far more dangerous than the swim once you get there. Likewise, avoid getting hacked. But more important, start taking action on the bigger risk: The stuff publicly posted on social sites. Anything you post can and will be used against you Politico reported in December that the U.S. government started asking some foreign visitors to provide Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube accounts, so they can be checked for signs of terrorist connections. It was a pretty gentle request, providing such information is only for those on the visa waiver program, and optional. In recent months, however, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials have begun checking the social media accounts of some U.S. citizens who are also Muslim at the point of entry, rather than as part of the paperwork. These checks on social media could reveal what travelers have posted publicly. But the government wants the private stuff, too. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in an interview this week that the Trump administration wants travelers from certain countries to provide lists of websites they've visited and their online passwords. He wants U.S. Customs "to get on those websites to see what they're looking at." U.S. Customs is proposing to add all Chinese visitors to the list of people asked to disclose their social media profiles. Current policy is based on the religion or nationality of travelers and is mostly superficial and voluntary. But the trend is clear: The U.S. government is rapidly expanding the invasiveness of social media checks in order to figure out who is trustworthy -- and who is not. Other nations are likely to follow the U.S.'s lead, but would search social media based on their own national criteria. Your business trip to Turkey may involve searches that look for support of Kurdish independence. Your vacation to China may involve searching your social accounts for trade secrets to steal. Your weekend in Cuba may end before it begins if Cuban customs agents find a three-year-old tweet shaming hipsters for wearing Che Guevara T-shirts. Social media scrutiny increasingly affects spheres of life beyond travel. Between 35% and 50% of college admissions officers now check the social media accounts of applicants as part of their selection process. Some insurance companies are reportedly checking social media to find out if customers live risky lifestyles, raising the cost of premiums for those who do. Some are even denying claims based on social posts. A CareerBuilder survey last year found that 60% of employers look at the social media posts of prospective employees before choosing which candidate to hire. That number jumped to more than 75% for IT companies, according to the survey. More than 40% of HR managers routinely check the social media accounts of current employees, and a quarter of them have found something that led to action ranging from reprimands to terminations. In the past year, CEOs have become the target of intense scrutiny of social posts, according to Ken Springer, a former FBI agent and current president of Corporate Resolutions, a company that performs such checks on behalf of clients. The bar for acceptable posts by CEOs is high: The CEO of a company called Taylor Gourmet posted a picture of himself with President Trump, which caused a "social media backlash" against the company, according to a report in Bloomberg BNA. All this checking of social media comes with risks. But today's risks are nothing compared with what's coming. Social media posts reveal more than you think Your social media posts are a theoretical open book into your state of mind, opinions, religion, personality and social connections. One example in the news: Facebook is testing the use of artificial intelligence (A.I.) tools to analyze posts and determine whether people are feeling suicidal. Flagged users are reported to the community operations team for possible intervention. That's an extreme case where a company is rightly public about its analysis of user mindset based on social media posts. But the ability for social posts to detect mood is demonstrated by a site called We Feel, which aggregates the mood of everybody on Twitter to track the global collective mood. The analysis of social posts to find out what kind of person you are, how you think, what you believe and how big a "risk" you are to various organizations is about to become big business. Here's what's going to happen. 'Social media profile' will take on a dark new meaning In the near future, social media and A.I. will enable any organization to rank people based on trustworthiness. A Chinese government program called the Social Credit System, which is currently in "beta," seeks to rank everyone in the country. The Chinese government is compiling data on all citizens based on their legal or criminal records, their financial activity and their activity on social networks. All this data is to be collected, compiled and crunched, resulting in a "social credit score" for each citizen. The score will determine rights, privileges and acceptability in various realms. Though the program is still in its infancy, the government has already banned some 6.7 million people from flying or even taking high-speed trains because they haven't paid their debts on time, according to a report in The Financial Times. The social media aspect of this is especially alarming. For example, posting pro-government posts and comments on social media is expected to raise one's score. Posting anything about Tibet or the Dalai Lama is supposed to lower it. A planning document quoted by The Wall Street Journal summarizes the purpose of the Social Credit System: to "allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step." Data-driven government control of the population is the Chinese way. The American way is based on freedom, which in this case means corporations may be free to use social media to decide who they trust. Software applications are being developed that can identify any person's social media accounts, download every post they've ever made public, and "profile" those people categorically based on comparative analysis. The ability to use data to categorize people is magnified enormously by the rise in artificial intelligence. To oversimplify the inevitable process: Everything known about you (say, your name, location, age, gender, your family and friends and other information) will be fed into A.I. systems that will scan the social web to find all your profiles. The systems will then copy every post, photo or comment you've ever posted. The A.I. will recognize patterns, interpret the photos and parse the comments. The output of these systems will be a profile or dossier on you, and it will advise users about whether to deny your request for a visa, turn down your loan application, avoid hiring you, reject your insurance claims, rebuff your business partnership proposals and more. In other words, A.I. will use data on social networks to rank people based on how much they can be trusted. The worst part is that this trust-judging process happens invisibly behind the scenes. When you don't get that job or loan, you'll never know why. Yes, the CIA can hack your TV. But it probably won't. The bigger risk is social media. Because anything you post can and will be used against you. Arrow APEX Puts Partners in F1 Pole Position More from Arrow ECS Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

People do like their iPhones, alot Brad Reed (Network World) 15 May, 2012 14:38 - - - - print email Distributors Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech Dicker Data Exclusive Networks Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments The latest American Customer Satisfaction Index has found, not surprisingly, that people really like their iPhones. The latest ACSI, which is published quarterly by the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business and rates a wide range of big-name tech vendors on a 100-point scale, shows that Apple is simply outclassing its competition in the mobile phone market, as its score of 83 bests its nearest competitor by eight points. Apple's closest competitors on the latest ACSI are HTC, LG and Nokia, all of whom scored 75 on the latest index. Troubled BlackBerry maker Research in Motion had the lowest score among mobile phone manufacturers on this year's ACSI, as its 69 rating trailed Apple's score by a whopping 14 points. ACSI founder Claes Fornell says that RIM's low ratings shouldn't be surprising to anyone who's been following the news surrounding the company for the past year. RELATED: AT&amp;T again ranks last in Consumer Reports survey IN OTHER NEWS: iPad rivals not up to snuff, says Consumer Reports "Companies with weak customer satisfaction often have weak stock performance," Fornell says. "RIM's sales are slumping amid a bevy of problems, from hardware and software issues to server lapses that have caused email and messaging outages. Over the past year, share price for RIM has virtually collapsed." The latest ACSI has also found that Sprint is tops among major American wireless carriers in overall customer satisfaction, although this may be a somewhat dubious honor since most U.S. wireless carriers have seen their satisfaction score fall over the past year. According to the ACSI, Sprint is leading the pack with a satisfaction score of 71, followed closely by Verizon at 70, and AT&T and T-Mobile, which both scored 69 on the survey. AT&T was the only major wireless carrier to see its ratings increase year-over-year as its 69 score represented a 4.5% increase from the 66 score it recorded in 2011. What's more, it seems that subscribers at small carriers were significantly more satisfied than subscribers at the big four, as all other wireless carriers had an aggregate score of 76 on this year's survey. And finally, Verizon's FiOS fiber optic service led all subscription television services in the latest ACSI in customer satisfaction with a score of 72. FiOS was the only subscription TV service to top 70 on the latest index and was trailed by the DISH Network, which had a score of 69, and by AT&T's U-Verse and DirecTV, which each had scores of 68. Charter Communications had the lowest customer satisfaction score among subscription TV services at 59, while Comcast had the second-lowest score at 61. Overall, the ACSI creates customer satisfaction indexes for 10 economic sectors consisting of more than 200 companies. Each company's ACSI is based on a sample of at least 250 customer interviews, and the ACSI conducts more than 65,000 customer interviews each year.

Jared Newman (PC World (US online)) 16 April, 2015 03:33 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Dynamic Supplies Hills Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Comments After a PR blunder that involved comparing Apple to Nazism, Chinese firm LeTV is announcing something that's actually worth some attention. The company's Le Superphone will be among the first to use a USB Type-C connection (also known as USB-C) for charging and data transfer. This is the same type of fully-reversible connector that debuted recently in Google's new Chromebook Pixel and Apple's new MacBook. As more devices include USB-C, users will be able to connect them all with a single cable and power adapter. Why this matters: Given that LeTV hasn't announced a price or release date, it's entirely possible that another USB-C smartphone may hit the market first. Either way, it's good to see the new connectors popping up on smartphones already, bringing us ever-closer to the dream of a universal cable that you can never plug in the wrong way. A phone with a reputation to repair LeTV put itself on the map in an offensive way last month when CEO Jia Yeuting released an animation on China's Weibo social network, depicting Adolf Hitler with an Apple logo on his armband. Yueting later apologized and retracted the video. Aside from the new connector, LeTV's phone will have a metal chassis and a "bezel-free" display custom-manufactured by Sharp. The company is also touting "wireless HDMI," though it's unclear how this will work. The software appears to be Android, with a modified "Ecosystem User Interface" on top. For tech specs, LeTV is promising a Snapdragon 810 processor, 4GB of memory, a 21-megapixel camera, a 3000-mAh battery, and dual 4G SIM card slots. There's no word on screen size or storage for this model, which LeTV wants to bring to the U.S. market later this year. (For the China market, LeTV is launching two more phones with 6.3-inch and 5.5-inch displays, but neither match up precisely with the Superphone's spec sheet.)

In fact, Apple reportedly has discouraged partners in years past from discussing MPP out in the open. But the veil of secrecy surrounding the program is thinning. Apple’s public relations department didn't acknowledge my queries about MPP, such as how long the program has actually been around. But CEO Tim Cook has begun citing the program during Apple (AAPL - NASDAQ) earnings calls over the past year: He specified in October that more than 120 partners have signed on worldwide, and that’s up from about 90 at the start of the year. MORE: iPhone 8 Rumor Rollup Perhaps emboldened by Cook’s revelations, Apple mobility partners are increasingly making themselves known. After all, why should Apple’s really big name partners – those like IBM, Cisco, SAP and Deloitte that it has touted over the past few years – get all the glory? I’ve interviewed a handful of these Apple Mobility Partner Program members over the past week or so to get a sense of what it’s like formally sidling up to Apple via the MPP and what it has meant to their enterprise customers. ASYNCHRONY LABS: EARLY APPLE FANBOYS Technology solution provider World Wide Technology’s Asynchrony Labs revealed this January that it is a new member of the MPP, and the results are so far, so good, according to Bob Elfanbaum, GM and co-founder of the labs. Asynchrony Labs is a 425-person agile software development subsidiary of WTT, a business that pulls in $9 billion-plus in annual revenue. WWT Asynchrony Labs Asynchrony Labs GM Bob Elfanbaum: "We wanted to make sure this wasn’t just a marketing thing" Elfanbaum suggests that the MPP has perhaps begun to emerge more publicly in part because Apple’s general approach to supporting enterprises has changed, with the company moving a little away from engaging enterprises directly with its own sales organization and building up a channel partner network of solution providers and developers. “I think historically the Mobility Partner Program was a lot more focused on product companies vs. solutions or integrated solutions companies [like ours],” he says. Asynchrony Labs focuses on integrating Apple technology into customers’ IT infrastructure and architecture, including Cisco networks, so that they can build upon those iPhone and iPad platforms. He says Asynchrony has had about a dozen people in recent months focused on research and development around Apple and Cisco products, and benefits by gaining access to alpha and beta products. “Today, the customers are trying to figure out how to leverage APIs emerging from Cisco” related to products such as Spark, Meraki wireless gear, etc., Elfanbaum says. “So we can do things like at a large retail customer actually pulling data out of the network about what users are doing and how they’re accessing the network, and then using that data to drive customers’ experiences on the mobile application.” Elfanbaum, who acknowledges members of his team were "early Apple fanboys" who appreciated Apple's architectural and security approaches, says the partner program goes way beyond a simple marketing deal. “The nice thing is that we interact with them heavily on the technical and engineering side, but increasingly on the go-to-market side,” he says. Having that technical and engineering access allows Asynchrony to focus on really helping customers build apps that leverage specific mobile platforms, rather than just slapping desktop apps onto a mobile device. While Asynchrony Labs has been working informally with Apple for years, it wasn’t easy getting into the MPP. “They are looking for commitments from us, and likewise for us, we wanted to make sure this wasn’t just a marketing thing, that it would bring real value to our collective customers,” Elfanbaum says. ATIMI: FROM VANCOUVER TO CUPERTINO This Vancouver-based native app development specialist, a part of Apple’s App Store since the day it opened, has carved out a separate page on its website to tout its inclusion among “a handful of global partners in the Apple Mobility Partner Program.” “There are literally thousands of companies out there that can build you a native mobile app,” says Frank Matas, VP of sales and marketing for Atimi, which builds about 80% of its apps for both Apple and Android devices. “It’s a difficult market to differentiate yourself in today,” but being a member of the MPP helps, he says. It’s not like there are 10 bullet points of benefits from being a part of MPP. “It’s more like one or two,” Matas says, but those one or two are important. Matas says when Apple goes into a customer account and is asked about who can build an app for them, Atimi gets referrals. “The biggest bullet for us is that we’re trusted, that Apple vetted us,” he says. Apple is most enthusiastic about apps that disconnect employees from their desktops and have them exploiting iPhones and iPads, Matas says. “Apple has no interest in the customer-facing apps,” he says. “Employee retention and productivity, those are the kinds of things that excite them.” Otherwise, Apple isn’t especially proactive through the program, but being a member opens doors for Atimi when Matas or colleagues want to ask questions or make presentations. “I talk with them every couple of weeks,” he says. Matas joined Atimi last summer, after 6 years at SAP, to help get the word out about the app development outfit, which he says has built more than 100 apps over the past 10 years. Atimi has actually brought customers down to Apple labs in Cupertino and Matas says Apple will review his company’s work as apps are being built. “They’ll make recommendations on what we should change, on what customers might want to consider, Matas says. “We’ll build what the customer wants, but it helps to actually have Apple tell customers what it thinks.” SHOWPAD: "OFFERING CONSUMER GRADE USABILITY WITH ENTERPRISE RIGOR ON THE BACK END" Showpad, a Ghent, Belgium- and San Francisco-based maker of sales enablement software for iOS and other platforms, revealed itself to be an Apple Mobility Partner Program member in 2015. Showpad, which says sales people use its software an average of 15 hours a month, finds being in the program bolsters the company’s credibility with current and potential customers. Senior Director of Business development David Warren, who joined Showpad last year, says MPP has been almost like a startup within Apple’s large organization that has been figuring itself out. For Showpad, the relationship has involved everything from co-marketing to co-development to co-selling. It’s evolved from sort of a default partnership program to something more, he says. “Even now I believe the team is not very large by Apple’s standards, but they have a large and important charter in terms of ramping up the ecosystem around Apple,” Warren says. This includes connecting ISVs like Showpad with top Apple channel partners on the reseller side. “I actually know people by their real names over at Apple,” he adds. Like Matas from Atimi, Warren says that Apple is very focused on selling devices into businesses. “What we can try to do together is meet the common challenge, which is how do you offer consumer grade usability with enterprise rigor on the back end,” Warren says. “How much time can you spend talking [to a business customer] about the recs and specs of an iPad? But you can spend a lot of time talking about Showpad on the iPad in a financial services context where you have high usability by folks on the front line, security on the back end…there’s just a broader story to tell.” Apple has worked directly with Showpad to help it optimize its user interface for iOS, says Warren, who figures he speaks with Apple about three times a month. “So when there is an OS update coming out, our app is not only in compliance with it, but highlights the best features of it,” Warren says. When something like Touch ID debuted on Apple’s mobile devices, Showpad could take advantage of it. “Our approach to design is to mirror whatever the native UI is for the device,” he says. While the overall tablet market has been flagging, Warren says he still sees strong demand for iPads among Showpad’s customers, and asserts that the company’s software runs on more iPads than iPhones. He says: “The struggle with iPads in the enterprise is that we have them, now what do we do with them?” DRCHRONO: TRUE IPAD BELIEVER This Mountain View-based maker of Electronic Health Record and related software for medical practitioners/staff and patients publicly celebrated its entrance into the Apple Mobility Partner Program in December as part of a broader announcement of new product capabilities. It’s too early to say what benefits drchono and its customers will gain from the company’s MPP acceptance, but Co-Founder and COO Daniel Kivatinos says it “formalizes something we’ve been trying to facilitate as a company from the start… We invested heavily in iOS before becoming formal partners with Apple.” Being part of MPP does bode well for Apple ISVs working with each other, though, he says. "In the context of iOS, as the sector continues to evolve we are going to see more and more apps within iOS working together. For example, drchrono and box are connected," according to Kivatinos. Drchrono got its start in 2009 when Kivatinos and Michael Nusimow sought to enable doctors to use the cloud to access medical data and take care of patients in a better way. They both had iPhones, but became intrigued by the as-yet-unavailable iPad as a bigger real estate platform that could better display the information medical professionals would really need. They began building for it in January 2010 and were ready with an app the first day that tablet was released in April. Drchrono now claims to have over 100,000 doctors signed up and around 8 million patients as customers, and recently was in talks with the Obama administration about ways to hugely modernize healthcare data sharing. drchrono drchrono EHR app for the iPad Going forward, drchrono will look to work in lockstep with Apple as the larger company fleshes out its HealthKit platform, which will work with iOS devices as well as other wearables. “Apple’s done a phenomenal job creating the best future medical toolkit for providers,” Kivatinos says. Being part of the Apple Mobility Partner Program shouldn’t hurt drchrono’s chances of getting in on that.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones The most expensive iPhone to get 3D face recognition from LG If you want the iPhone 8, which comes with 3D face recognition from LG, be prepared to shell out the top dollar. Sami Khan   May 13, 2017 14:39 IST An Apple iPhone 7 and the company logo are seen in this illustration picture taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017.REUTERS/Regis Duvignau Owning an iPhone is partially about the elite status its owner holds in the society. The growing standard of living has made iPhones somewhat affordable, making it a viable option while looking to buy a good smartphone. But it looks like things are going to change this year. With all the rumours swirling around the web about the upcoming iPhone 8's high-end specs such as OLED display, wireless charging and such, a fresh rumour about a feature will get fans excited. According to the Korean Economic Daily, LG has dedicated a $238.5 million-worth facility just for Apple orders, in which the company will make 3D facial recognition models for the iPhone 8. With this information, it is clear that the new iPhone 8 will have advanced front camera module, but it remains unclear if there will be a dual camera setup or a standard single lens. Apple is also expected to take advantage of PrimeSense algorithms for 3D sensing capabilities, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said. Apple had bought PrimeSense in 2013. The Israel-based company is known for developing 3D sensors, and a good example of that is Microsoft's first Kinect sensor for Xbox. In a separate report, Goldman Sachs' Simona Jankowski predicted the iPhone 8 to be the most expensive iPhone ever made. Jankowski mentioned in her research note that the iPhone 8 will have a 3D sensor worth $20 among other material costs to put the iPhone 8's price at the range of $1,000. If the prediction is right, the iPhone 8 will come in two variants, 128GB and 256GB, costing $999 and $1,099, respectively. This would make the new iPhone $130 more than the most expensive iPhone model currently available in the market, Business Insider reported. In case you're wondering what drives the iPhone 8's price to such high levels, Jankowski has a breakdown of the materials used in the manufacturing. The iPhone 8's OLED display measuring 5.8 inches with no bezels is expected to cost $35, 3D sensing to add $20, improved NAND/DRAM memory to add up to $29, A11 chipset, no physical home button, biometric sensor, and storage starting at 128GB, will collectively throw the iPhone 8's price through the roof. Even with that, iPhone fans need not be worried. Apple's rumoured iPhone 8 is going to be the third variant this year and the company would also launch iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus to fulfil the demands of average consumers. The iPhone 7S is expected to cost $649 and the iPhone 7S Plus variant will go on sale for about $769. These models will come in regular 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage options. If Apple continues the tradition, the iPhone 7S series won't bring major upgrades in terms of design and simply improve the performance as compared to the iPhone 7 series. Apple is still several months from launching the 2017 iPhone flagships, and a lot is expected to change in due course. Related How will iPhone 8 and 8 Plus stack up against iPhone 7?

Last year, Apple put its iOS 10.2.1 update into beta for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. After several weeks of testing, the company decided the iOS 10.2.1 update was ready for primetime. The iOS 10.2.1 update has been available for several weeks now and it still reigns as the the most up-to-date version of iOS 10. That said, its days are numbered and we could see its replacement roll out in the near future. iOS 10.2.1 is a maintenance release which means it’s much smaller than a milestone update like iOS 10.2 was or iOS 10.3 will be. That doesn’t make it any less important. The iOS 10.2.1 update delivers bug fixes and security patches for potential exploits. If you value your security you probably want to install iOS 10.2.1 in the near future. Today we’re taking an updated look at the iOS 10.2.1 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Here are the most important things you need to know as we push toward the next big iOS 10 release. iOS 10.2.1 Review The iOS 10.2.1 update has been out for several weeks. And for several weeks, we’ve been poking and prodding the update in order to give you feedback about the update’s performance. Tiny updates like iOS 10.2.1 can have a huge impact on performance so it’s important to dig into feedback before you install. We’ve taken a look at the iOS 10.2.1 update for the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5, and a few different iPads. These roundups offer a glimpse at iOS 10.2.1’s performance in key areas like battery life, connectivity and speed. If you’re on the fence about iOS 10.2.1, and you own one of those devices, dig into that feedback. It should help. We’ve also put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.2.1 update right now. If you’re having an excellent experience on iOS 10.2 or below, we highly recommend digging into those reasons before making a move. The iOS 10.2.1 update has greatly reduced unexpected shutdown issues plaguing the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6. The update reportedly has reduced the issue by 80% on the iPhone 6s and 70% on the iPhone 6. The company also says its “added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown.” This ability is available on the iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6. It will come to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 in Apple’s next iOS update. If you own an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6 and you’ve experienced this issue, you should think about installing the iOS 10.2.1 update today. iOS 10.2.1 Problems The iOS 10.2.1 update went through a fairly lengthy beta but various problems slipped have through the cracks into the final release. iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users continue to complain about an assortment of iOS 10.2.1 bugs and performance issues including issues with apps, battery life, connectivity, lag, random reboots, installation issues, and more. Fortunately, these are fairly common and most can be solved from the comfort of a computer chair at work or the office. If you’re seeing an issue with one of these, or something else, take a look at our list of fixes. Unfortunately, it looks like there’s at least one major bug lurking on board some versions of the iOS 10.2.1 update. The widespread “30% battery bug” that’s been affecting owners of older iPhones (iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners aren’t seeing the issue) is still an issue. The issue has been around since October, shortly after Apple released iOS 10. It’s unclear if Apple’s next iOS 10 update, iOS 10.3, will solve the issue once and for all. You Can’t Downgrade from iOS 10.2.1 If you download iOS 10.2.1 you won’t be able to get off it (unless you jump to Apple’s new iOS 10 beta) until Apple rolls out a new iOS 10 update. And that release could be weeks from now. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2 which means you can’t take advantage of a loophole and drop back down if you decide that you hate the iOS 10.2.1 update’s performance on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. You can’t drop down to anything older than iOS 10.2 either. Apple’s no longer signing off on any iOS updates older than iOS 10.2.1. Now that a downgrade is no longer available you’ll want to be absolutely sure about your version of the iOS 10.2.1 update. If you’re hesitant, you might be better off waiting for Apple’s next version of iOS 10 which is expected to arrive this month alongside new iPads. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our roundup. It’ll walk you through everything you need to know for next time. iOS 10.2.1 Jailbreak Jailbreak developers recently released an iOS 10 jailbreak tool that works with iOS 10.2 and below. It’s not compatible with the iOS 10.2.1 update. It’s not clear if jailbreak developers will release a public jailbreak tool for iOS 10.2.1. It could happen tomorrow, it could happen months from now. We simply don’t know. There’s some chatter about a new iOS 10.2 jailbreak but we haven’t heard about anything concrete for iOS 10.2.1 If you want to jailbreak your device (the iOS 10.2/iOS 10.1.1 jailbreaks are only available for select devices) you need to avoid the iOS 10.2.1 update. And if you’re already on iOS 10.2.1 you’ll just have to cross your fingers and wait. What’s Next A new iOS 10 update is currently in testing ahead of an imminent release date. iOS 10.3 will deliver a new Find My AirPods feature. Earlier this year Apple released an iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and anyone with a working Apple ID. Unlike iOS 10.2.1, iOS 10.3 is a large milestone update which means it comes with more than just bug fixes and security patches. The iOS 10.3 update, in its current state, features numerous changes to iOS 10. These include performance improvements, a Find My AirPods feature located in the Find My iPhone app, some huge improvements to CarPlay, Apple File System (AFPS), and a whole lot more. Apple is still testing the iOS 10.3 update which means we could see more changes added before the update’s official release date. The iOS 10.3 beta is the only way to get off iOS 10.2.1 at this point and the beta’s features certainly make it a tempting install ahead of the official release. That said, there are some reasons to avoid the iOS 10.3 beta. For one, the update is causing problems for us and many others. Early iOS software can be unstable. Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3 release date but it will arrive sometime before the end of April. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 6 Responses 01/28/2017 Terry Stewart Reply Apples quality suffered severely since Steve Jobs passed away.

So apple think they can just dim my screen now not caring what situation I’m in! 05/04/2017 Phill Reply I own a I phone 5 and starting to get very frustrated with it. I know off two people that have done the 10.2.1 upgrade and one has locked up and unable to do anything with it seized and the other phone the battery power has basically died to nothing. So I don,t even want to risk my phone doing that and the hassle trying to sort it out but then you have a person at the I phone shop telling you that you need to install the 10.2.1 and when i asked this person that i just want to stop the harassing and very annoying and wont let up just about every time a touch the phone for the 10.2.1 upgrade Install Now,Later.Remind me later Im over this complete bullshit. The guy at the I phone shop said there was nothing i can do to stop the never ending reminder of the 10.2.1 unless you do the upgrade so i have basically said your lost a client and probable many more due to this complete bullshit as you can see im not impressed at all any more. I will be going the Samsung to give them a go I don,t like being held to ransom from these complete and utter dickheads wake up and stop harassing people with this shit we will contact you if we want this upgrade or what every you want to call it. I would call it a total cluster 10.2.1 downgrade and strongly sounds to me as a wast of time and guess what to buy a new phone not happy at all lost all respect for I phones now and the future. You may as well have a nice day to whoever reads this stuff because just about every time I try making a phone call or a text or anything that I look at on this phone Im up shit creek messing around with the 10.2.1 reminder rubbish hounding me annoying me harassing me im very very pissed. 05/13/2017 John Mukupa Reply Iso 10.2.1 has failed to download automatically and manually Saying am not connected to Internet when in fact using wifi even using data it has failed Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Apple and Corning first teamed up 10 years ago when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered the plastic screen on the company’s first iPhone to be replaced with a scratch-resistant glass just a few months before the product was to launch. Since then, Corning says it has made 552 million square feet of its Gorilla Glass product for iPhones and iPads, or roughly enough glass to cover 10,000 football fields. “All of that work happened right here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you,” Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams told workers at Corning’s Harrodsburg facility on Friday. Williams said the money is the first of $1 billion the company plans to spend on US-based companies from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. “It’s only fitting that the first commitment from that fund be for Corning and specifically for Harrodsburg, where so much of our history is,” Williams said. Williams was joined by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. Officials from both companies did not say if the money would bring more jobs to Kentucky, or if the state offered any tax incentives for the investment. Corning officials said the money would be used “to sustain” the 400 employees who work in Harrodsburg. Officials said the partnership between Apple and Corning has produced 1,000 jobs in the United States. It was the fourth major business investment in Kentucky this year. In January, Amazon announced it would spend $1.4 billion to build a worldwide cargo hub in northern Kentucky. Toyota has said it will spend $1.3 billion in its Georgetown plant that produces its flagship Camry sedan. And last month, Braidy Industries announced it would spend $1.3 billion to build an aluminum plant in eastern Kentucky. State taxpayers could pay nearly $100 million in tax incentives to those companies over the next 10 years if they meet projected goals with spending and job creation.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Apple gives $200M to advance phone glass print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google more business news Apple gives $200M to advance phone glass By Vindu Goel / New York Times News Service Published May 13, 2017 at 12:02AM SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is seeding the next generation of American-made glass for its iPhones and iPads, and its investments may have the side benefit of helping the company win favor in Washington. Apple announced Friday that it was giving $200 million to Corning, which makes the tough, scratch-resistant face for every iPhone and iPad, to support the glassmaker’s efforts to develop more sophisticated products at its factory in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Corning has made the glass for every iPhone since the original 10 years ago. Apple’s investment, the first from the technology giant’s $1 billion fund to promote advanced American manufacturing, will help Corning develop thinner, more versatile glass for iPhones, as well as other product lines that Apple is exploring, such as screens for self-driving cars and augmented reality glasses. The move goes beyond Apple’s traditional practice of subsidizing suppliers, said Tim Bajarin, president of the technology consulting firm Creative Strategies. “I would see this more as an Apple-Corning partnership to flesh out what other kinds of things you would use glass for,” he said. “They are literally thinking about stuff you and I aren’t thinking about yet.” The investment is a goodwill gesture toward Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who has criticized Apple for building its iPhones in China, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who represents Kentucky. Apple said it spent $50 billion last year with U.S. suppliers, although it manufactures just one product line, the nearly obsolete Mac Pro, in the United States. Last month, Trump sketched out a plan to slash overall corporate tax rates and perhaps offer companies a special break for bringing back profits held overseas. 17228317 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

By: IANS | San Francisco | Published: May 13, 2017 12:52 PM Apple’s expected launch of its ,000 iPhone this year would give it market capitalisation of nearly 0 billion. (Reuters) Apple’s expected launch of its $1,000 iPhone this year would give it market capitalisation of nearly $900 billion, making it the first company ever with such a mammoth valuation, a media report said. “Apple will unveil its first $1,000 iPhone in September and that it could help rocket average selling prices and gross margins and ‘drive meaningful upside’ to the stock,” marketwatch.com reported on Saturday. Earlier this month, Apple’s market capitalisation briefly soared past $800 billion threshold and shares closed up 2.7 per cent for the day at $153.01 late on May 8, taking the company to a market value of $797.8 billion. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is the second most valuable company with a market cap of $653 billion, followed by Microsoft at $532 billion. Also watch: Apple sold 50.8 million iPhones in the first three months of 2017, down one per cent year-on-year, according to the company’s second quarter results that came earlier in May. The dip in iPhone sales was offset by services, including Apple Pay, iCloud and the App store, which recorded an 18 per cent increase in sales to $7 billion. Due to the robust sales of its iPhone 7 Plus, the revenue from iPhones climbed one per cent to $33.2 billion. No Comments.

All these are the areas that the company is currently exploring. "In our opinion, Apple is well positioned to capture share in the video game market using its iOS platform, but also to leverage that more broadly over time to support an experience similar to console gaming. Further recent hires suggest that the capability of the Apple TV can incorporate console gaming and set-top box all integrated into a single product down the road," Merill Lynch of Bank of America (BofML) said in a note to its clients. The shares of the company, which is already up by more than 30% this year, on Friday closed at $155 and change, following which the company's market value now stands at more than $800 million. Reports have already suggested that one of the most prodigious companies of the world, Apple is already foraying into its own streaming TV service. In terms of gaming, Apple TV already offers iOS gaming, however, it's considerably casual compared to the gaming consoles like Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One and the most recent and very successful, Nintendo Switch. apple.com We had reported that Apple is looking forward to entering the smart home assistant space now with the plans of integrating its digital assistant Siri in the device, however, it won't be as easy for the tech giant to crack the surface of this market as Amazon Echo and Google Home already possesses a large share of the smart home assistant market. Rumors have it that Apple is going to announce such a device as soon as next month. "We estimate the potential market at $7.5 billion. To size this, we factor a 5% penetration (attach) into the iPhone installed base of 600 million units. Assuming a sell price of $250 per device, we estimate a $7.5 billion potential market for Apple," said BofML. Apple Car is another opportunity that the company is exploring pretty seriously. Recently it has been discovered that the company is not only running a secret project named Project Titan regarding smart cars, but it is also keeping a secret office in Berlin, which, according to Business Insider's sources, is devoted to transportation and all the engineers that work there have been hired from car companies. "Project Titan is likely to be a transportation platform — not a car but the entire experience," said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a recent conversation that he hosted with Horace Dediu (of Asymco.com) and Neil Cybart (of AboveAvalon.com). The project now looks all the more promising as, BofML adds that Apple could garner a revenue of $1 billion by 2020 and increase it up to $27 billion by 2025, if it starts developing and selling autonomous cars by 2020 with an average selling price of each car 10% greater than that of Tesla's Model S, reported CNBC. Reuters The BofAML also sees an upside in VR, which it says will have a total addressable market value of $30 billion in 2020. With all the assets, Apple doesn't necessarily need to enter new markets; however, it's kind of inevitable that it will dip its toes into new areas at some point. BofAML also said that, even if Apple sits still, the markets Apple currently addresses (smartphones, tablets, wearables and desktops/laptops) can generate $550 billion in revenue by 2020.

The investment will support “Corning’s R&D, capital equipment needs and state-of-the-art glass processing”.  Corning’s partnership with Apple began a decade ago with the first iPhone. Apple has committed to investing at least $1 billion with US-based companies focusing on manufacturing. Apple’s billion-dollar Advanced Manufacturing Fund was unveiled last week by CEO Tim Cook. The company claims it “supports 2 million jobs” in the U.S., including 450,000 at companies that supply it with components. Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer said, Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers. This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America. We’re extremely proud of our collaboration over the years and we are investing further with Corning who has such a rich legacy of innovative manufacturing practices. "Apple invests $200 million in Gorilla glass maker Corning", 5 out of 5 based on 10 ratings.

NEW YORK – Citigroup listed seven companies as potential takeover targets for Apple Inc, including Netflix, Walt Disney and Tesla Inc, as a way to put its cash hoard of more than $250 billion to work. With over 90% of its cash sitting overseas, a one-time 10% repatriation tax would give Apple $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a note to clients. US President Donald Trump’s tax blueprint, which was unveiled last month, proposes allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10% versus 35% now. “Since one of the new administration’s top priorities is to allow US companies to repatriate overseas cash at a lower tax rate, Apple may have a more acute need to put this cash to use,” Suva said. The analyst is rated three out of five stars for his recommendations on Apple, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The other potential acquisition targets include video game developers Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive Software as well as video streaming service Hulu. The analyst said the targets were screened considering five criteria – strategic fit, global scale, transaction size, few non-strategic assets and likely impact on Apple’s share price. Under pressure from shareholders to hand over more of its cash hoard, Apple recently boosted its capital return program by $50 billion, increased its share buyback program by $35 billion and raised its quarterly dividend by 10.55%.

Now, instead of releasing an iPad Air 2 successor, the company has scrapped the Air line altogether and has introduced an all new affordable iPad simply called - 'iPad'. Tablet sales are tailing off rapidly. Tablets, which were once envisioned as the next big thing in computing are witnessing a rapid decrease in popularity. Even the mighty iPad is not immune to this development - iPad sales have been decreasing year on year since 2014. Also Read: Apple's iPad Air 2 gets a refresh, iPhone SE gets more storage The 2017 iPad is an attempt by Apple to bolster iPad's flagging sales. Last year's super high-end (and super expensive) iPad Pro models, which were an attempt by Apple to appeal to Pro users, failed to set the market on fire. Now Apple has decided to focus on the other end of the market - users who just want a simple, affordable iPad that works. To understand this new iPad properly, we need to take a trip down memory lane. The 9.7 inch iPad was the first tablet Apple launched and consecutively launched the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th gen of the iPad. Apple then forked the iPad line-up and introduced the Air and Mini series. So where does the new iPad slot in? It is not a sequel to the iPad Air, in spite of the fact that it looks almost exactly like the iPad Air 1. Apple just calls it the iPad, when in fact it is actually a spiritual successor to the iPad 4, which was released back in 2012. The iPad 2017 is an odd mishmash of new hardware and recycled bits from old iPads that does not necessarily come across as an update to last year's iPad Air 2. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Let's talk about the good points first. The 2017 iPad, as with all iPads, claims to have a stellar 10 hour battery life (more details in our upcoming full review), has a nice and crisp Retina display, runs the latest iOS 10 operating system flawlessly and almost never leaves you wanting in terms of performance. In my limited testing, the iPad handled all that I threw at it with aplomb, almost never slowing down even with a multitude of tabs open in Safari and a lot of apps open in the background. A pleasant surprise is the fact that this iPad supports the split-screen multitasking feature introduced with iOS 10. The iPad Air 2 lacked this feature. The iPad 2017 is an odd mishmash of new hardware and recycled bits from old iPads that does not necessarily come across as an update to last year's iPad Air 2. This is not necessarily a bad thing Thus in essence, Apple has succeeded in their aim of creating an affordable iPad that comes with all the essentials. The compromises made can be excused when we take the low $299 dollar price into consideration, which is the cheapest entry point ever for a new full size iPad. Although in India, the 2017 iPad costs Rs 28,999, which is a whopping 150 dollars more than the US price. In India, the new iPad costs exactly the same as the iPad Air 2 did before it was discontinued. In this light, the 2017 iPad seems like a downgrade in some aspects. At this price, the new iPad becomes a hard sell. While it comes with a better processor than the iPad Air 2 ( Apple A9 as compared to A8X), it has a display that lacks some of the fancy tech first seen in the iPad Air 2. It also does not come with stereo speakers and is thicker and heavier. The iPad Air 2 was the first iPad ever to come with a fully laminated display. Instead of the digitiser, LCD and glass being three separate components, Apple bonded them together. Such an arrangement not only makes content look much better, it also reduces reflection by a considerable margin. Also Read: 5 reasons why iPhone SE at Rs 19,999 is totally worth it, 1 reason why it's not The 2017 iPad does not come with a bonded display. This might sound like a small thing, but in reality is quite noticeable. Not only is the display very reflective, the display just does not feel modern. Almost all smartphones these days come with fully laminated display and looking at the 2017 iPad's screen made me realise how much we have gotten used to this arrangement. All in all, the 2017 iPad by itself seems pretty neat. It is undoubtedly the best tablet in this price range and comes with phenomenal battery life, the latest iOS 10 operating system, a powerful processor and the promise of future updates. That's what the ipad has always been...the best tablet you can buy. It's only that iPad Air 2 still casts a long shadow. But let's leave that for the full review.

Apple’s new video campaign does just that, shedding light on some of the basic ways to shoot with an iPhone 7. But there’s something particularly noticeable about some of these videos. Especially for South Africans. Available to view on Apple’s official site and on YouTube, the video series showcases a few landmarks that Cape Town residents would instantly recognise. One is undeniably Table Mountain, looking across from Lion’s Head. Another is of Muizenberg Beach’s famous colourful changing huts. While those two are definitely filmed on South African soil, we had an office debate about the rest. This one is seemingly filmed looking across False Bay from a chasm (possibly the Kogel Bay caves). The others, well… we all threw our postulations in the hat based on house colours, the incline of streets, the colour of poles and various vegetation in the background that we’ve seen in the city before. Table Mountain and Muizenberg Beach’s colourful changing huts are just two instantly recognisable SA landmarks in Apple’s latest iPhone 7 videos Ultimately, we could assume that some are also filmed in South Africa, but we can’t confirm it. Additionally, it seems that some of the iPhone 7 Plus videos are not filmed in SA, with cars using the right-hand side of the streets a dead giveaway. Nevertheless, even if we can’t completely verify a few of these videos’ filming locations, it’s a massive boost for South Africa and Cape Town that Apple felt it worthwhile filming some clips in a how to video series here. We’ve reached out to Apple global and its local distributor to shed more light on the videos, and will update this piece if we hear back. For now though, have a look at the full playlist here, and let us know where you think Apple filmed some of these videos in the comments below.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: These 3 Stocks Just Raised Their Dividends Last week's lifters are among the top names in their respective industries. Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) May 12, 2017 at 7:27PM Although the current earnings season is winding down, dividend raises continue to rain onto the market. Last week, the market was practically soaked as it saw nearly 30 lifts, by my count.  And at least a few of those raises were from big, high-profile companies. Here are three of the more famous issuers bumping their payouts. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Apple Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been an aggressive dividend raiser since resuming its quarterly payout just over five years ago. The tech giant's latest hike is an 11% bump to $0.63 per share. The company has been fairly generous with its raises. Since the relaunch, and adjusted for a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014, the distribution has risen considerably. Adjusted for that split, it has grown from around $0.38 per share to the present level. Apple also announced an expansion of its share repurchase program, increasing the maximum authorized amount to $210 billion from the previous $175 billion. The two moves reflect how the company has been doing as of late. Encouragingly, it's returned to revenue and profitability growth earlier this year, following three quarters of declines. In its recently reported second quarter, it managed to increase the former by almost 5% on a year-over-year basis to nearly $53 billion. Per-share net profit advanced by 11% to $2.10.   Apple remains extremely profitable, with gross margins approaching 40%. Both cash from operations and free cash flow have seen growth recently, and the latter is more than sufficient to cover dividend payouts and share buybacks. I'd be very optimistic about the future of this dividend. AAPL Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts. Apple's new payout will be dispensed on May 18 to stockholders of record as of May 15. At the most recent closing stock price, it would yield 1.6%. That's a touch lower than the current 1.9% average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500. The company did not provide an end date for its current share repurchase initiative. PepsiCo PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), one of the top names in the food/beverage industry, is also one of its most aristocratic. That is to say, it's high on the list of Dividend Aristocrats, the group of stocks that have raised their dividends at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years in a row.  In February, along with its Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, the company promised a 7% increase in its quarterly dividend to just under $0.81. Last week, the company made good on that promise by formally declaring the enhanced payout. PEP Dividend data by YCharts. The declaration comes after a first quarter that beat analyst expectations, although it wasn't exactly a quarter for the record books. Revenue inched up less than 2% on a year-over-year basis to land at just over $12 billion. And that increase was due to increased pricing, as opposed to organic growth (volumes were either flat or down in most regions).   On a slightly more encouraging note, per-share adjusted net profit rose by almost 6% to clock in at $0.94. Times are tough for businesses built on a core of sugary drinks (hello, Coca-Cola!) and traditional snacks, since consumers are continuing to opt for healthier alternatives. Pepsi is holding up fairly well considering, although if I were an investor, I'd prefer that the company break its recent habit of spending most, or even more, than its annual free cash flow on dividends and share buybacks. PepsiCo's extra-fizz new distribution is to be paid on June 30 to investors of record as of June 2. It yields a theoretical 2.9%.  Marriott International Storied hotel operator Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) is maintaining its one-raise-per-year habit. The company has declared a quarterly payout of $0.33 per share, a 10% increase over its predecessor. That's to be expected, and not only because the company's a regular lifter. Its most recently reported quarterly results pleased the market, with Marriott convincingly beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines. For the period, revenue rose by a beefy 47% to $5.56 billion, with adjusted net income also experiencing a pleasant boost (of 36%) to $395 million. The latter shook out to $1.01 per share, well exceeding the average $0.91 estimate from analysts. That top-line figure, meanwhile, was comfortably above projections of $5.29 billion.  What went right? Well, Marriott is doing a good job of squeezing more from its visitors. Revenue per available room -- a key metric in the hotel industry -- saw a 3% rise during the quarter, even as the company added roughly 17,000 rooms to its total count. Those improved fundamentals, plus recent strategic asset sales, are keeping cash flow nice and buoyant. Free cash flow has been rising steadily and encouragingly over the past few years, and at the latest annual tally of nearly $1.4 billion, it easily covered the approximately $942 million in dividend payouts and share repurchases. I think this trend will continue, and I expect the company will continue adding to the former. MAR Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Marriott's upcoming dividend will be handed out on June 30 to shareholders of record as of May 19. It would yield 1.3% on the current stock price.

Well, the iPhone 7 specifically. So, the company has gone to the trouble of putting together a series of tutorial videos to make sure people can take great mobile shots, while satisfying their inner hipster. There are 16 videos all up, covering everything from selfies to... one-handed selfies. You can check them out either on Apple's own site or its YouTube channel, however the latter only appears to have nine of the clips. How useful are the tutorials? They're all done in portrait format, which suggests Apple itself has no idea how to use its own gadget. Joking aside, it's fairly basic stuff so there's not much here for the experienced hand. However, if you know someone who's terrible at taking decent photos with their iPhone 7, this might be worth a less-than-subtle share on your social media channel of choice.

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing Friday Charts: More Apple Domination and Volatility’s Strange Disappearance Published Fri, May 12, 2017  |  Louis Basenese, Investment Director Apple’s series of record-breaking stats continues. Volatility’s disappearance goes under the microscope. Time to rejoice or run for cover? Also recommended: Fascinating trend supercharges blue chip stocks. It’s Friday in the Wall Street Daily nation. That means it’s time to embrace the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. This week, I’ve handpicked two charts to convey Apple’s current — and likely continued — dominance. Then, it’s on to a handful of graphics that underscore the shocking disappearance of market volatility in a time of so much political uncertainty. Is it time for investors to rejoice or run for cover? Let’s find out… Candy Apple Corporate records are meant to be broken. Apparently, Apple wants to break them all. Repeatedly. Consider: 2015: Apple reports the single highest quarterly profit in corporate history of $18 billion 2016: The company tops its own profit record, reporting an $18.4 billion haul. 2017: Apple reveals it has the biggest cash hoard in corporate history, at $256.8 billion. If Apple’s cash pile were its own public company, it would be the 13th largest in the world, right ahead of General Electric. Of course, all along the way, these records have propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. This year alone, Apple’s stock hit 19 new record highs (and counting). As a result, Apple’s market capitalization — you guessed it — hit a record high of $800 billion. As you can see in the following chart, many companies made a valiant effort to reach the same heights and failed. It appears that the company is on a crash course with an unfathomable $1 trillion market capitalization now. Can anything stop it? Chime in using the comments section with your thoughts. Exclusive Content MUST-SEE: Trump’s Financial Disclosure Statement This could be the biggest Obama “scandal” EVER… It has to do with a secret that he and the Pentagon kept hidden at 9800 Savage Rd., Fort Meade, Maryland, for his ENTIRE presidency. You won’t want to miss THIS. The CIA spends billions of dollars to keep scandalous stories under wraps. So we wouldn’t be surprised if they wanted this page taken down immediately. Click here for the shocking truth. If I were a betting man, though, I wouldn’t bet against Apple. My True Alpha subscribers have been betting on Apple since December 2016. While the stock is up 31% since then, they’re sitting on profits of over 150%. (Click here to find out how, and to start your risk-free trial to our premium advisory today.) And while I’m convinced that Apple’s trend of hitting new highs will continue, here’s one trend I’d bet you dollars to doughnuts doesn’t last… O Volatility, Volatility, Wherefore Art Thou, Volatility? Wall Street’s fear index is currently plumbing near record lows. The CBOE Volatility Index dropped to 9.77 — its lowest since 1993. That’s even more remarkable considering the political volatility we’re witnessing — here and abroad. Historically, political unrest and unpredictability can spook investors. Not this time. Not yet, at least, which brings us to this Reuters observation… A declining VIX typically indicates a bullish outlook for stocks, but the extreme lows the index has touched are sounding caution for some stock investors. Count Citi among them. The firm’s Macro Risk Index recorded its sixth-consecutive monthly decline to hit an extreme low. According to Citi, “Comparable low levels of risk aversion have historically been followed by higher volatility, stronger USD, higher bond prices and weak performance of global equities.” The takeaway: Don’t panic. But don’t be oblivious. Speculators should consider going long the VIX. It’s only a matter of time before volatility returns. As for everyone else? Make sure you have trailing stops in place to protect your profits in the event of any sudden and severe market sell-offs.

Zeman   @phonescooper Apple today said it plans to invest $200 million in its business partner Corning. Corning makes the Gorilla Glass used on iPhones and many other modern smartphones and tablets. Apple said the funds will support Corning's research and development efforts, as well its equipment purchases, and manufacturing facilities. Apple is targeting Corning's facility in Harrodsburg, Ky., which has supplied Apple with glass since the first iPhone in 2007. The Harrodsburg facility employs about 400 people. Earlier this year, Apple committed to spending $1 billion through its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to foster innovation among American manufacturers. Corning is the first recipient of these funds. more info at Apple » Related Review: RhinoShield Playproof and Crashguard RhinoShield has some inexpensive Apple iPhone cases for sale that claim to offer big protection with a minimal footprint.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Reviving Goliath: Liberty Utilities contributes $410,000 to Measure F opposition Friday May 12, 2017 at 5:44 PM May 13, 2017 at 10:01 AM With contributions currently totaling $410,000, Liberty Utilities has far outpaced the campaign raising money in support of Measure F. Should the water company contribute another $74,000 before the June 6 special election, the amount spent lobbying for Measure V last November will be surpassed. Meanwhile, Measure F proponents are attacking a Canadian corporation and pleading their case for 'water freedom.' Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The campaign against Measure F has spent nearly 93 times more than its opponent leading up to a June 6 special election that will determine whether the Town of Apple Valley can bankroll a potential Liberty Utilities water-system takeover and purchase by incurring a maximum of $150 million in revenue bond debt. EXPENDITURES AND CONTRIBUTIONS Between Jan. 1 and April 22, the No on Measure F/Apple Valley Taxpayers Against Higher Water Fees campaign spent $264,437.90 on its effort to defeat the measure, according to campaign finance documents. As the sole funder of No on Measure F, Liberty Utilities has contributed $410,000 to the campaign as of Friday. The Citizens for Water Freedom group, meanwhile, has spent $2,856.32 in support of the measure, with contributions from Councilman Larry Cusack, Burrtec Waste Industries and Apple Valley Communications — Cusack’s company — totaling $15,000, according to documents. FAMILIAR SCENARIO Liberty poured nearly $484,000 into the Yes on Measure V campaign last year. In contrast, proponents for Measure W raised less than $26,000, documents show. At the time, Measure W supporters likened the funding disparity to a battle of biblical proportions, saying they were “competing with Goliath.” But on Election Day, Measure V garnered more than 67 percent of the vote, a decisive win that set up the Measure F vote. Liberty has contributed nearly $894,000 between the two campaigns, documents show, a figure Citizens for Water Freedom member Rick Piercy called "amazing." "We feel like we need to do everything we can to stand up to what we see as a real problem in that a big corporation in Canada controls our water,” Piercy said. "I just get very upset about the fact that we’re being manipulated by the (California Public Utilities Commission) and the folks out of Canada, and my feeling is they really don’t care. We’re a source of revenue." The reference is to Algonquin Power & Utilities Corporation. As a subsidiary of Algonquin, Liberty purchased Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company — as well as systems in greater Los Angeles and Missoula, Montana — from the Carlyle Group in early 2016 for $327 million. But Diana Carloni-O’Malley, of the No on Measure F campaign, said "the history of this takeover has been to demonize Liberty Utilities." "I do not fault any person or entity to fight for their business," Carloni-O’Malley said of the money the company has spent thus far. "If the town wanted to take Napa Auto Parts, I believe (Mayor) Scott Nassif would fight for his business in the same way." WHAT THE MONEY BUYS The more than $264,000 Liberty has put toward that fight has bought the campaign significant exposure, including more than $132,000 in “TV or cable airtime and production costs,” documents show. It also funded economist John Husing’s recent analysis of the town’s takeover attempt; Economics and Politics, Inc. — Husing’s research firm — received $50,000, an amount Liberty officials say is standard for such services. But nearly $39,000 in "campaign literature and mailings" has been the campaign's driving force, according to Carloni-O’Malley. "I don’t know how much people understand about this issue," she said, "so the strength we’ve had is getting mailers out to people. We’ve sent multiple mailers that fact check and correct the town." As for Citizens for Water Freedom, contributions have afforded the group $2,251.32 in "campaign paraphernalia," namely 50 signs erected throughout the town. Piercy said "getting boots on the ground" is how Measure F supporters are combating an aggressive opposition. "We’re talking to groups. We need to spend a lot of time getting the truth out, talking to friends and letting people know what’s really going on here," Piercy said. "This all makes Goliath a whole lot bigger than David, but we’ve got five smooth stones and our sling, so we’ll try our best." Last week, the campaign came under fire from Citizens for Government Accountability — a group against the takeover — after town resident Pat Hanson filed a complaint with the state’s Fair Political Practices Commission alleging failure "to disclose properly who the signs were from," a post on CFGA's website shows. “The committee failed to include a disclosure statement of at least 5 percent of the height of the advertisement,” Hanson wrote in her complaint, also available on CFGA’s website. In response, Piercy said Hanson was correct, adding that “the guy who printed our signs thought (the regulation) was 0.5 percent, not 5 percent” of the signs’ height. "You make an error and you correct the error. That’s what we did,” he said. “We spent about $400 putting stickers on the signs with the correct size of the committee name. That could have been used for something else, but if you have integrity you fix what is messed up." The Citizens for Water Freedom campaign now awaits word from the commission’s Enforcement Division on possible fines. WHAT’S AT STAKE Passage of Measure F would authorize the town to finance a purchase of Liberty’s water system by issuing debt in the maximum amount of $150 million, according to the measure’s impartial analysis. Pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Town Council on March 9, the interest rate on debt repayment cannot exceed 12 percent. Measure F opponents have argued the town won’t have funds for improvements to the system’s aging infrastructure, let alone money for debt service. Assistant Town Manager Marc Puckett has said he expects the price of the system to be far less than Measure F’s asking amount, adding that the interest rate will be closer to 5 percent. By Puckett’s estimation, nearly $12 million will be available to fund debt service and lower water rates via the elimination of profits, taxes and other expenses associated with Liberty’s ownership. Opponents have also criticized the town for holding a special election — which comes with an estimated $220,000 price tag paid for by the town — before a right-to-take trial has been set. But officials believe potential passage of Measure F is similar to “prequalifying before you shop for a house,” according to town spokesperson Kathie Martin. “We need to know we have the approval of the citizens before we spend the money and see the takeover action to its conclusion,” Martin said. A trial-setting hearing for the the right-to-take trial is scheduled for June 26, court documents show. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

Photo: D.C. PUBLIC LIBRARY Apple wants to transform historic Carnegie Library 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON — Steve Jobs made Apple into a top American retailer by designing crisp, modern stores with features reminiscent of the company’s products. Glass boxes and aluminum panels abounded. But as Apple moves to turn its stores into experiences — places for concerts, art exhibitions and photography classes — the tech giant has begun to pursue distinctive yet familiar buildings that its customers might admire as well. In Washington, Apple has set its sights squarely on the Carnegie Library in Mount Vernon Square. One of thousands of libraries built nationwide with funds donated by steel tycoon and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, it opened in 1903 as the first desegregated public building in the city. Latest business videos Apple officials say they plan to restore the building to its original grandeur and outfit Carnegie as a place to hold free concerts, art exhibitions, workshops for teachers and coding classes for children. Trial programs at other Apple Stores have included presentations from community artists and photographers, as well as concerts and talks by bigger names — the hip-hop producer RZA led an “Art of Beatmaking” session at the Apple Store in Brooklyn last fall. The company plans to release a schedule of events around the country this month. The ultimate goal, of course, is to sell more iPhones and iPads. Where the Carnegie Library once housed the city’s book collection, Apple plans a Genius Grove, a tree-lined sales floor where associates will show customers how to make the best use of Apple products for music, photography or other passions. The Cupertino company already operates a Genius Grove in its flagship San Francisco Apple Store on Union Square. “This is a way of creating a reason to come to the store, to touch and feel our products, but also to have an engaging experience with someone who is passionate about the same thing,” said B.J. Siegel, the senior design director for Apple’s retail division. Finding historic buildings with stories rooted in their communities are part and parcel to the experience Apple is trying to create, Siegel said. The company has opened stores in a former restaurant bay in New York’s Grand Central Terminal, in a Depression-era brick storefront in Brooklyn, and in a 130-year-old former bank in Paris. Rather than plastering the buildings with the familiar logo, Apple’s designers say they will focus on restoring the building’s historic character. It can take a little work to find the store’s signs and logo — which is the point. “For us, it wasn’t about coming in and leaving our mark,” Siegel said. “It was about bringing the history back out and respecting it. “We’ve discovered that big, garish logos on historic buildings don’t work very well, so often we try to find more subtle ways to brand the building.” That couldn’t be further from the failed strategy of the previous pursuit of the Carnegie Building. The International Spy Museum proposed moving into the building more than three years ago, but it sought to double the size of the 63,000-square-foot structure by adding two expansive, glass-encased wings. The Historic Preservation Review Board turned the proposal away. Apple does plan to install a skylight in the Carnegie Building’s roof above a central events area, and there are bound to be questions about handing one of the city’s more cherished buildings to a corporation. But there is wide agreement among officials that the Carnegie Building could be better used. Despite its visible location, it serves mainly as an office space for the Historical Society of Washington, D.C., and as a venue for the occasional wedding or reception organized by Events DC, which manages the building. When Apple signed a letter of intent in December to lease the building, Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a statement saying that an Apple Store there “could link D.C.’s rich history to our continued economic renaissance, will demonstrate the strength of our retail market, and will tell companies across the globe that the District is open for business.” Even the Historical Society isn’t going anywhere; Siegel said that Apple considers it a benefit to have such a unique community institution as a neighbor, and that the organization would maintain offices on the second floor. Gregory O’Dell, president and chief executive of Events DC, said he is “working to support Apple with its plans as well as our partners in the Historical Society.” Apple is scheduled to present its plans to the area’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission on Monday evening. In New York, Apple picked up a historic preservation award for its work restoring the sort of buildings that, in Jobs’ era, it would not have considered. Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president for retail, considers it essential to the company’s future that it be more than a place to buy things. “Starbucks figured it out, for being a gathering place, right? ‘Meet me at Starbucks,’” Ahrendts told CBS in a recent interview. “I’ve told my teams, I’ll know we’ve done a great job if the next generation ... says, ‘Meet me at Apple.’” Jonathan O’Connell is a Washington Post writer.

Get a cup of coffee. This article is a big geeky at points by virtue of using a lot of acronyms. But be patient! It contains important information about the restructuring of the US workforce. By William Lazonick, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Lowell. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website How the U.S. New Economy Business Model has devalued science & engineering PhDs This note comments on Eric Weinstein’s, “How and Why Government, Universities, and Industries Create Domestic Labor Shortages of Scientists and High-Tech Workers,” posted recently on INET’s website. At the outset of his paper, Weinstein argues that: Long term labor shortages do not happen naturally in market economies. That is not to say that they don’t exist. They are created when employers or government agencies tamper with the natural functioning of the wage mechanism. The contention, written from the perspective of the late 1990s, is that in the first half of the 1990s an oversupply (“a glut”) of science and engineering (S&E) labor that depressed the wages of PhD scientists and engineers was primarily the result of the promotion of a government-university-industry (GUI) agenda, coordinated by the National Science Foundation under the leadership of Erich Bloch, head of the NSF from 1984 to 1990. Beginning in 1985, the NSF predicted a shortfall of 675,000 S&E personnel in the U.S. economy over the next two decades. According to a study by the NSF’s Policy Research and Analysis (PRA) division, quoted by Weinstein, salary data show that real PhD-level pay began to rise after 1982, moving from $52,000 to $64,000 in 1987 (measured in 1984 dollars). One set of salary projections show that real pay will reach $75,000 in 1996 and approach $100,000 shortly beyond the year 2000. Weinstein argues that the GUI agenda (inspired by Reaganomics) sought to prevent these salary increases. He contends that the legislation that enabled this oversupply was the Immigration Act of 1990 that expanded the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program and instituted employment-based immigration preferences. Given that most of these foreigners came from lower-wage (Asian) nations, it is assumed that they were attracted to work in the United States by what for them were high wages, whereas Americans with S&E PhDs began to shun S&E careers as the salaries became less attractive.1 There is a lot missing from Weinstein’s perspective, which is also the perspective of demographer Michael Teitelbaum, who Weinstein cites extensively and who was at the Sloan Foundation from 1983 to 2013, rising to Vice-President in 2006. Weinstein and Teitelbaum view the salaries of scientists and engineers as being determined by supply and demand on the labor market (“the natural wage rate” and “the natural functioning of the labor market”). From this (neoclassical) perspective, they completely ignore the “marketization” of employment relations for S&E workers that occurred in the U.S. business sector from the mid-1980s as well as the concomitant “financialization” of the U.S. business corporation that remains, in my view, the most damaging economic problem facing the United States. This transformation of employment relations put out of work large numbers of PhD scientists and engineers who previously had secure employment and who enjoyed high incomes and benefits as well as creative corporate careers. The marketization of employment relations brought to an end of the norm of a career with  one  company  (CWOC)—an  employment norm  that was  pervasive  in  U.S.  business corporations from the 1950s to the 1980s, but that has since disappeared. 2 The “financialization” of the corporation, manifested by massive distributions to shareholders in the forms of cash dividends and stock buybacks, undermined the opportunities for business-sector S&E careers. The major cause of marketization was the rise of the “New Economy business model” (NEBM) in which high-tech startups, primarily in information-and-communication technology (ICT) and biotechnology, lured S&E personnel away from established companies, which offered CWOC under the “Old Economy business model” (OEBM). As startups with uncertain futures, the New Economy companies could not realistically offer CWOC, but instead enticed S&E personnel away from CWOC at Old Economy companies by offering these employees stock options on top of their salaries (which were typically lower than those at the Old Economy companies). The stock options could become extremely valuable if and when the startup did an initial public offering (IPO) or a merger-and-acquisition (M&A) deal with an established  publicly-listed company. The rise in S&E PhD salaries from 1982 to 1987, identified in the NSF study that Weinstein quotes, was the result of increased demand for S&E personnel by New Economy companies, with some of the increase taking the form of stock-based pay, which in the Census data drawn from tax returns is lumped in with salaries.3 Competing with companies for S&E personnel, the rise of the NEBM in turn put pressure on salaries at Old Economy companies as they tried to use CWOC to attract and retain S&E labor in the face of the stock-based alternative. By the last half of the 1980s, this New Economy competition for talent was eroding the learning capabilities of the corporate research labs that, in many cases from the early twentieth century, had been a characteristic feature of Old Economy companies in a wide range of knowledge-intensive industries. 4 The CWOC norm under OEBM had provided employment security and rising wages from years-of-service with the company and internal promotion of S&E personnel (significant proportions of whom in science- based companies had PhDs). As I show in my book Sustainable Prosperity in the New Economy?, the beginning of the end of CWOC was the transformation of IBM, the world’s leading computer company, from OEBM to NEBM from 1990 to 1994. In 1990, with 374,000 employees, IBM still bragged about its adherence to the CWOC norm (calling it “lifelong employment”), claiming that the company had not laid off anyone involuntarily since 1921. By 1994 IBM had 220,000 employees, and, with senior executives under CEO Louis Gerstner themselves getting fired for not laying off employees fast enough, CWOC was history. Over the course of the 1990s and into the 2000s, other major Old Economy companies followed IBM’s example, throwing out of work older employees, many of them highly educated and with accumulated experience that had previously been highly valued by the companies. Already in the early 1990s, the marketization of employment relations was responsible for a precipitous decline of employment at the corporate research labs that had underpinned the twentieth-century growth of Old Economy high-tech companies, of which IBM was an exemplar. In 1993, a conference held at Harvard Business School decried the “end of an era” in industrial research, with papers from the conference appearing in a volume Engines of Innovation, published in 1996.5 In the introductory chapter, entitled “Technology’s Vanishing Wellspring,” conference organizers and volume editors Richard Rosenbloom and William Spencer argued that industrial research (as distinct from product development) of the type that had been carried out by corporate labs in the “golden era” of the post- World War II decades “expands the base of knowledge on which existing industries depend and generates new knowledge that leads to new technologies and the birth of new industries.” In the more competitive environment of the 1980s and 1990s, however, in the new industries of “biotechnology, exotic materials, and information products (and services based on them)”, Rosenbloom and Spencer observed that it was more difficult for companies “to keep new technologies fully proprietary”, and hence “research activities have been downsized, redirected, and restructured in recent years within most of the firms that once were among the largest sponsors of industrial research.” 6 There is little doubt that S&E PhDs were major victims of this transformation. But the problem that they, along with most other members of the U.S. labor force, have faced is not simply the marketization of employment relations. For reasons that I have fully described in my publications cited above, the transition from OEBM to NEBM was accompanied by the “financialization” of the U.S. business corporation as, from the last half of the 1980s, U.S. boardrooms and business schools embraced the ideology that, for the sake of superior economic performance, a business enterprise should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). Instead of retaining employees and reinvesting in their productive capabilities, as had been the case when CWOC had prevailed, MSV advocated and legitimized the downsizing of the company’s labor force and the distribution of corporate revenues to shareholders in the forms of both cash dividends and stock repurchases. 7 With the demise of CWOC, older employees were the most vulnerable, not only because they tended to have the highest salaries, but also because the shift from OEBM to NEBM was a shift from proprietary technology systems, in which employees with long years of experience were highly valued, to open technology systems that favored younger workers with the latest computer-related skills (often acquired by working at other companies). Under CWOC, older employees were more expensive not because of a “natural wage rate” that was the result of supply and demand on the S&E labor market, but because of the internal job ladders that are integral to a “retain-and-reinvest” resource-allocation regime. The salaries of S&E employees tended to increase with years of experience with the company, with a defined-benefit pension (based on years of service and highest salary levels) in retirement. These types of secure employment relations, and the high and rising pay levels associated with them, were the norm among established high-tech companies in the mid-1980s, but, as exemplified by IBM’s transformation, started to become undone in the early 1990s, and were virtually extinct a decade later, as Old Economy companies either made the transition to the NEBM, or disappeared.8 The culprit in the weakening in the demand for, and earnings of, S&E PhDs from the early 1990s was the demise of CWOC—a phenomenon that Weinstein (and Teitelbaum) entirely ignore. With the rise of NEBM, companies wanted employees who were younger and cheaper, and that was the major reason why at the end of the 1980s the ICT industry pushed for an expansion of H-1B nonimmigrant visas and employment-based immigration visas. It is not at all clear that an influx of PhDs from foreign countries via these programs was undermining the earnings of S&E PhDs in the early 1990s. Most H-1B visa holders had Bachelor’s degrees when they entered the United States. At the same time, large numbers of non-immigrant visa holders entered the United States on student visas to do Master’s and PhD degrees, and then looked to employment on H-1B visas to enable them to stay in the United States for extended periods (up to seven years).9 It was in response to the availability of advanced- degree graduates of U.S. universities that in 2005 an additional 20,000 H-1B visas were added to the normal cap of 65,000. Without the influx of foreign students into U.S. S&E Master’s and PhD programs, many of these programs would not have survived. Through this route, the H-1B visa program has made more foreign-born PhDs available to corporations for employment in the United States. But I posit that it has been the demise of OEBM and rise of the NEBM, not an increased supply of foreign-born PhDs, that has placed downward pressure on the career earnings of the most highly educated members of the U.S. labor force. Besides giving employers access to an expanded supply of younger and cheaper high-tech labor in the United States, the H-1B visa along with the L-1 visa for people who had previously worked for the employer for at least one year outside the United States have another valuable attribute for employers: the person on the visa is immobile on the labor market—he or she can’t change jobs—whereas under NEBM the most valued high-tech workers are those who are highly mobile. This mobility of labor can boost the worker’s pay package but is highly problematic for a company that needs these employees to be engaged in the collective and cumulative learning processes that are the essence of generating competitive products. Under OEBM, CWOC was the central employment institution for college-educated workers precisely because of the need for collective and cumulative learning. But it was the rise of NEBM, not the Immigration Act of 1990, that undermined CWOC. The growing dominance of NEBM with its open systems architectures then led employers to make increased use of H-1 and L-1 visas in the 1980s, prompting them to get behind an expanded cap for H-1B visas in the Immigration Act of 1990. 10 Once OEBM was attacked by NEBM, with its offer of stock-based pay, these corporations became fertile territory for the adoption of the ideology that a company should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). This momentous transformation in U.S. corporate governance occurred from the late 1980s, legitimizing the transition from a “retain-and-reinvest” to a “downsize-and-distribute” corporate- governance regime. In the 1990s and beyond, this corporate-governance transformation laid waste to CWOC across corporate America, knowledge-intensive companies included. 11 With corporate research eroding as high-tech personnel responded to the lure of stock-based pay from NEBM companies— including not only startups but also those such as Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and Cisco Systems that during the 1990s grew to employ tens of thousands of people, most of them with stock- based pay—senior executives at the Old Economy high-tech companies began to see their company’s stock price as not only key to the size of their own stock-based pay packages but also as an instrument to compete for a broad-based of high-tech personnel. As exemplified by IBM in the 1990s and beyond, a company’s stock price could be raised by laying off expensive older workers and using the resultant “free” cash flow (as the purveyors of MSV called it) to do stock buybacks. 12 As I have documented in detail, over the past three decades this legalized looting of the U.S. business corporation has only gotten worse. As shown Table 1, driven by stock buybacks, net equity issues by U.S. nonfinancial corporations were, in 2015 dollars, minus $4.5 trillion over the decade 2006-2015. In 2016 net equity issues were minus $586 billion. Net equity issues are new stock issues by companies (in this case nonfinancial corporations) minus stock retired from the market as the result of stock repurchases and M&A deals. The massively negative numbers in recent decades are the result of stock buybacks. I have calculated net equity issues as a percent of GDP by decade to provide a measure of the value of buybacks done relative to the size of the U.S. economy. In both absolute inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percent of GDP, buybacks have become a prime mode of corporate resource allocation in the U.S. economy. Contrary to popular belief, in aggregate U.S. corporations fund the stock market, not vice versa. Note that almost all of the buybacks in the decade 1976-1985 occurred in 1984 and 1985 after in November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation. Table 1: Net equity issues of nonfinancial corporations in the United States, 1946-2015, by decade, in 2015 dollars, and as a percent of GDP Decade Net Equity Issues, 2015$ billions Net Equity Issues as % of GDP 1946-1955 143.2 0.56 1956-1965 110.9 0.30 1966-1975 316.0 0.58 1976-1985 -290.9 -0.40 1986-1995 -1,002.5 -1.00 1996-2005 -1,524.4 -1.09 2006-2015 -4,466.6 -2.65 Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Statistical Release Z.1, “Financial Accounts of the United States: Flow of Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts,” Table F-223: Corporate Equities, March 9, 2017, at    https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/. Over the years 2006-2015, the 459 companies in the S&P 500 Index in January 2016 that were publicly listed over the ten-year period expended $3.9 trillion on stock buybacks, representing 53.6 percent of net income, plus another 36.7 percent of net income on dividends. Much of the remaining 9.7 percent of profits was held abroad, sheltered from U.S. taxes. Mean buybacks for these 459 companies ranged from $291 million in 2009, when the stock markets had collapsed, to $1,205 million in 2007, when the stock market peaked before the Great Financial Crisis. In 2015, with the stock market booming, mean buybacks for these companies were $1,173 million. Meanwhile, dividends declined moderately in 2009, but over the period 2006-2015 they trended up in real terms. Among the largest repurchasers are America’s premier high-tech companies. Table 2 shows the top 25 repurchasers over the decade 2006-2015. Among the companies that one would expect to employ large numbers of S&E PhDs are Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard, Pfizer, Oracle, Intel, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. We do not know the historical numbers of S&E PhDs at these companies, but I hypothesize that numbers would be much higher than they are if the companies were not financialized. Many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees.13 As I have shown, the only logical explanation for this buyback activity is that the stock-based pay that represents the vast majority of the remuneration of senior corporate executives incentivizes them to manipulate their companies’ stock prices, leaving most Americans worse off. 14 Table 2: The 25 largest stock repurchasers among U.S.-based corporations, 2006-2015, showing net income (NI) stock buybacks (BB), and cash dividends (DV) Source: Calculated from data downloaded from Standard & Poor’s Compustat database. The Weinstein-Teitelbaum focus on a GUI design to expand the supply of S&E PhDs ignores the transformations of corporate governance and employment relations that have decimated career employment for this group of workers over the past three decades. At the same time, the channeling of trillions of dollars of value created in U.S. nonfinancial corporations to the financial sector has opened up jobs on Wall Street that can provide quick income bonanzas for highly-educated members of the U.S. labor force, many of whom might have otherwise pursued S&E careers. Among the wealthiest of these Wall Street players are corporate predators—euphemistically known as “hedge-fund activists”—who have billions of dollars in assets under management with which they can attack companies to pump up their stock prices through the implementation of “downsize-and-distribute” allocation regimes and, even if it takes a few years, dump the stock for huge gains.15 In the case of Apple, we have shown how Carl Icahn used his wealth, visibility, hype, and influence to take $2 billion in stock-market gains by buying $3.6 billion of Apple shares in the summer of 2013 and selling them in the winter of 2016, even though he contributed absolutely nothing of any kind to Apple as a value-creating company.16 Apple CEO Tim Cook and his board (which includes former U.S. Vice President Al Gore) helped Icahn turn his accumulated fortune into an even bigger one by having Apple repurchase $45 billion in shares in 2014 and $36 billion in 2015—by far the two largest one-year stock buybacks of any company in history. Imagine the corporate research capabilities in which Apple could have invested, and the S&E PhDs the company could have employed, had it looked for productive ways to use even a fraction of the almost unimaginable sums that it wasted on buybacks.17 From 2011 through the first quarter of 2017, Apple spent $144 billion on buybacks and $51 billion on dividends under what it calls its “Capital Return” program. But the company is “returning” capital to shareholders who never gave the company anything in the first place; the only time in its history that Apple has ever raised funds on the public stock market was $97 million in its 1980 IPO. 18 A number of “hedge-fund activists”—Nelson Peltz of Trian, Daniel Loeb of Third Point, and William Ackman of Pershing Square are among the most prominent—have been able to put up one or two billion dollars to purchase small stakes in major high-tech companies, and, with the proxy votes of pension funds, mutual funds and endowments, have been able put pressure on companies, often by placing their representatives on the boards of directors, to implement “downsize-and-distribute” regimes for the sake of “maximizing shareholder value.”19 In the summer of 2013, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management bought DuPont stock worth $1.3 billion, representing 2.2% of shares outstanding. In May 2015 Peltz lost a proxy fight to put four of his nominees on the DuPont board, but in October 2015 DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman, who had opposed Peltz, resigned, and the new management began to implement Peltz’s plans to cut costs and hit financial targets, to be done in the context of a merger with Dow Chemical, which had fallen into the hands of another corporate predator Daniel Loeb. Meanwhile, in October 2015, Peltz bought 0.8 percent of the shares of General Electric (GE), and began to pressure another iconic high-tech company to cut costs and increase its stock price. GE was already a financialized company that had done $52 billion in buybacks in the decade 2006-2015 (see Table 2)—a massive amount of money for the purpose of manipulating its stock price. Undoubtedly responding to additional pressure from Peltz, during 2016, GE, with profits of $8.0 billion, paid out $8.5 billion in dividends and spent another $22.0 billion on buybacks. This financialization of U.S. high-tech corporations undermines, among other things, the employment of S&E PhDs. We need research on this subject to quantify its impacts. I submit, however, that such a research agenda must focus on transformations of regimes of corporate governance and employment relations. Relying on the neoclassical economist’s notion of a “natural wage rate” determined by the interaction of supply and demand, Weinstein, a mathematician, and Teitelbaum, a demographer, missed the transformations in corporate governance and employment relations that marked the late 1980s and early 1990s—and beyond—and as result, in my view, failed to understand the changing fortunes of S&E PhDs in the marketized, globalized, and financialized New Economy. Given the dominance of what I have called “the myth of the market economy”20 in the thought processes of economists, Weinstein and Teitelbaum were by no means alone in erroneously focusing on supply and demand on the PhD labor market while failing to recognize the centrality of corporate governance and employment relations in determining the earnings and career prospects of S&E PhDs. It is time for new economic thinking on these critical questions.

Reply ↓ David McClain May 12, 2017 at 10:10 am As one who actually lived this process, I can tell you that the premise of this article must be basically true. Back in the early ’90s I set out to fill in the gaps of my own computer science background (I’m actually an astrophysicist). And my classes were filled entirely by people from Asia, except for myself and one other Anglo. Job ads in the journals were already beginning to ask for PhD level CompSci with emphasis on, e.g., voice recognition, for a pay rate of $26K (1992 !). That was definitely appealing to the foreign students and unappealing to American STEM students. During that period, the only job market for native PhD STEM students became the American Defense and Intelligence agencies, because they required security clearances and US Citizenship. I found myself driven in those directions too. Now, after many years doing my own thing, I look around at the STEM marketplace and I am shocked to find large numbers of compatriots being pressured into the GIG Economy, and pay rates are appalling by former standards.

From another perspective this is just over investment in education. Technology for the most part is just increasing complexity and increasing complexity has diminishing returns. With energy becoming less available, we probably need a lot less complexity. Reply ↓ anonymous in Southfield May 12, 2017 at 6:15 pm I was reading the article earlier at work and thought I would finish reading the comments With energy becoming less available, we probably need a lot less complexity. Relevant in many ways. Take intensive horticultural methods which could increase yields on agricultural products. Organic gardening (a garden is anything smaller than a field (about 40 acres)) can yield up tremendous amounts per square yard because the soil is tilled intensively and carefully. The organic content of the soil in commercial farming districts is very low as the methods used (particularly intensive nitrogen implants) destroy the Soil microorganisms thereby lessening the amount of nutrients available to vegetative methods in the roots. So by taking the technology level down (small equipment and lots of loving labor, lots of mulching a careful cohabitation of plants) the yields per acre can be in fact astronomical with organic methods.

This whole “New Economy” has been one big war on wages. I mean look at the collusion too between Google, Apple, and Intel to keep wages low. https://www.wired.com/2015/01/apple-google-tech-giants-reach-415m-settlement-poaching-suit/ Considering how slap on the wrist this was, what incentive is there to not do it again? They know they can get away with this. Not to mention, this H1B and L1B program has become a way to keep wages low in the technology sector. In many sectors, there really isn’t a “shortage” of Americans. Oh and for all the talk of these companies being “innovative”, if they are prioritizing money on stock buybacks over R&D, that’s not really innovative as much as it is trying to boost salaries by capitalizing on the huge cash reserves they get for being the dominant companies in their sector. Same could be said about Exxon. Not much being spent on R&D means that they are more about rent seeking rather than innovation. Perhaps not yet as blatant as those patent trolls, which are little more than shell companies that sue other companies over patents, but that is their ideal business model. I think that at the end of the day, even though many engineers in the tech companies are in the top 10% in terms of income percentile, their interests are closer aligned with working class people. The other issue is that I bet when many of these engineers turn into their 40s, they are going to witness first hand the very real age discrimination that exists in the technology industry. Basically it comes down to, the rich are really greedy. The issue right now for the rich is that they are desperate to keep the looting from happening, while people are increasingly aware that the system is against them. Bernie Sanders got a lot of support in the Valley and while it is a very Democratic leaning area, I cannot imagine that Trump’s anti-H1B and L1B stance would have been opposed by the average employee. I think that the rich are not going to concede anything and that there needs to be some sort of solidarity union amongst all workers.

Early on, the use of stock-based compensation drove down wage-based compensation and increased the role of financial speculators. Today, the speculators get the stock, but wages remain suppressed and only foreign workers will accept them. The author is correct: the causes are complicated, but the result drove down wages and job security for STEM workers. Reply ↓ mary May 12, 2017 at 11:30 am I got my Ph.D. in biology in 2000.

Applying, seeking an income, to a non-law job produces a range of disbelief to anger from employers that someone with a JD is applying to a nonlaw job. Reality is there are few law jobs for the multitudes of JDs. The legal profession is broken. Law schools exist to support the former Supreme Court law clerks and Ivy League grads.

Reply ↓ cr May 12, 2017 at 12:01 pm Post WWII labor overplayed its hand by the 1970’s. Corporations and their decided they had had it. Corps and management proceeded to change the rules of the game on everything–courts, trade, taxation and regulation. These countermeasures have had disastrous long term consequences. Corporations now run the country in a fascist manner. Government capture has created myriad problems beyond financialization, only one tool in the corporate quiver. Oligopolies across most to all industries comes to mind. Rail, air, health insurance, banking, defense, telecom, entertainment…. But this paper is also lamenting a lack of business capex, which is directly correlated to public investment. When you decided to offshore manufacturing and fail to invest in infrastructure you get a double whammy that hits business capex. Increasing regulation and taxation on small and midsize companies has lead to consolidation. Approximately 5000 public companies have likely been consolidated. Sarbanes-Oxley added millions to compliance costs making it highly uneconomical to be a public company with less than $300 million in revenue. Dodd-Frank has created increases in cost for financial firms that had nothing to do with the crisis. In fact, the big banks have benefited enormously from implementation of this legislation.

See his comments on ‘the Lucas Critique’ beginning at 2:00. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSS4GCA__As Reply ↓ allan May 12, 2017 at 12:15 pm Reply to cr@May 12, 2017 at 12:01 pm Sarbanes-Oxley … Dodd-Frank … The trends described in the post predate by decades the communist tyranny [/s] imposed by those bills. The wholesale closing or offshoring of corporate research labs already started in the 1980s, driven in part by corporate raiders like Milken, Pickens and Icahn. IBM, GM, Kodak, Xerox, GE … they all had labs that provided jobs to STEM graduates and a stream of discoveries and inventions to generate more jobs. Now these are largely gone or substantially off-shored. What has happened to corporate R&D shouldn’t be used as an excuse to make life easier for the Wall Street culture largely responsible for it. Reply ↓ Vatch May 12, 2017 at 12:22 pm Yes, any burdens imposed by Sarbanes Oxley are the fault of numerous unethical business executives over recent decades, and not the fault of people in government. Reply ↓ visitor May 12, 2017 at 3:02 pm When I was a student in IT, the shining stars at the firmament of industrial computer science and engineering R&D were Xerox PARC, DEC SRC, ATT Bell Labs and IBM Yorktown Heights. They are gone or a shadow of their former selves. Reply ↓ Science Officer Smirnoff May 12, 2017 at 12:36 pm Contrary to popular belief, in aggregate U.S. corporations fund the stock market, not vice versa. Note that almost all of the buybacks in the decade 1976-1985 occurred in 1984 and 1985 after in November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation. William Lazonick, “Stock Buybacks: From Retain-and-Reinvest to Downsize-and-Distribute,” Center for Effective Public Management, Brookings Institution, April 2015 at http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/04/17-stock-buybacks-lazonick. See Lazonick’s footnoted paper for many loving particulars. Especially note the details of how Rule 10b-18 offers no protection from abuse and (no news to NC readers) is a pillar of general corporate asset-stripping. Reply ↓ Science Officer Smirnoff May 12, 2017 at 12:43 pm P. S. pages 10 and 11 of Lazonick’s pdf lay out Rule 10b-18 in full. Reply ↓ David Barrera May 12, 2017 at 12:59 pm Thanks. Tremendous article! Reply ↓ Socal Rhino May 12, 2017 at 12:59 pm Engineering long-term career arc has been an issue since at least my father’s generation (those born during WWI). Longer tenure (mid to late mid career) engineers were being eased out for young grads. When I was in a ChemE program in the 70s, advice was to follow the engineering degree with either law or a business degree because the odds of a long career doing engineering was not great. No one advised going for a PhD in engineering. Reply ↓ Arizona Slim May 12, 2017 at 2:19 pm My father had a PhD in chemical engineering. When I asked him why he got the degree, which didn’t seem necessary for someone who spent much of his career in industrial R&D, he said, “I’m like Mallory climbing Mount Everest. I got that degree because it is there.” So, there you have it. My old man getting that degree because he wanted to. And because my mother was willing to support both of them while he worked on it. Reply ↓ shinola May 12, 2017 at 1:02 pm To me, this is the money quote (literally): “Many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees … the only logical explanation for this buyback activity is that the stock-based pay that represents the vast majority of the remuneration of senior corporate executives incentivizes them to manipulate their companies’ stock prices…” This not only applies to the STEM sector, but nearly every large corp. in America. “Earnings quality” (i.e stock price) takes precedence over everything else leading to the crapification of products & services and devaluation of employees. Thank gawd this type of thinking wasn’t around when Jonas Salk was working on the polio vaccine. Reply ↓ nowhere May 12, 2017 at 2:30 pm Which begs the question: what discoveries are we missing out on now because of this short sighted approach? Reply ↓ LT May 12, 2017 at 8:51 pm There’s probably not a discovery to be made that this economic system couldn’t turn to crap. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 12, 2017 at 1:27 pm “In November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation.” How can you have “looting” without lootees? The stockholders aren’t complaining. If any party is being disadvantaged by borrowing to fund stock buybacks, it’s existing bondholders. As David Swensen describes in an extended example in Pioneering Portfolio Management, managers compensated by stock options tend to treat corporate debt holders quite shabbily by piling on more debt, compromising the interest coverage ratio. High tech companies use stock buybacks to offset their widespread granting of stock options which — absent Rule 10b-18 — would badly dilute existing stock holders over time. Trying to paint the well-disclosed practice of stock buybacks as “looting” is histrionic ax grinding on Lazonick’s part. Over-leveraged companies are going to regret it in the next recession. But that’s a lamentable social phenomenon in a bubble-driven economy. Those who disagree with it are free to sell short over-leveraged stocks — perhaps a more meaningful way of expressing dissent than scribbling academic screeds. Reply ↓ Science Officer Smirnoff May 12, 2017 at 1:41 pm And political dissenters are free to emigrate. Reply ↓ fritter May 12, 2017 at 2:22 pm Well Jim, ponzi schemes work pretty well for those at the top. I suppose we shouldn’t worry about it until we start getting complaints.. Actually though, watching the train wreck that is the outlook for the youngest generation today, provides some grim amusement. For instance noting that the “bubble-driven” economy composed of companies desperate to prevent their stock becoming “badly diluted” by having fire sales on capitol and expertise that probably took their predecessors decades to build can really only have one outcome. Depression, misery, socialism. Maybe we skip the Mao route this time, maybe not. Reply ↓ Alejandro May 12, 2017 at 2:38 pm Here’s some related “histrionics” of your channeling D.D…. an excerpt of a debate about “creative destruction” (emphasis mine) from 1991(context), chronologically, roughly following the tandem of Ronnie and Maggie. Gregory Peck: “The Robber Barons of old at least left something tangible in their wake — a coal mine, a railroad, banks. THIS MAN LEAVES NOTHING. HE CREATES NOTHING. HE BUILDS NOTHING. HE RUNS NOTHING. And in his wake lies nothing but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain. Oh, if he said, “I know how to run your business better than you,” that would be something worth talking about. But he’s not saying that. He’s saying, “I’m going to kill you because at this particular moment in time, you’re worth more dead than alive.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJRhrow3Jws Danny Devito: “Let’s have the intelligence, let’s have the decency to sign the death certificate, collect the insurance, and invest in something with a future…”Ah, but we can’t,” goes the prayer. “We can’t because we have responsibility, a responsibility to our employees, to our community. What will happen to them?” I got two words for that: WHO CARES? Care about them? Why? They didn’t care about you. They sucked you dry. You have no responsibility to them. For the last ten years this company bled your money. Did this community ever say, “We know times are tough. We’ll lower taxes, reduce water and sewer.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62kxPyNZF3Q Reply ↓ John Wright May 13, 2017 at 9:41 am In this statement: “managers compensated by stock options tend to treat corporate debt holders quite shabbily by piling on more debt, compromising the interest coverage ratio.” you suggest what might limit the corporate stock buyback trend might not be legislation but future bond buyers refusal to accept the corporation’s terms on new debt.. Perhaps there will be a requirement to preserve a debt/equity ratio within a range, perhaps a minimum interest coverage ratio will be required. Perhaps a debt buyback provision will be triggered if more corporate stock is purchased. Low interest rates make bond buyers more desperate for yield, so it seems unlikely this will happen near term. A future bondholders’ revolt might put a damper on this corporate stock buyback trend before any legislation ever does. Reply ↓ oho May 12, 2017 at 1:29 pm IBM. Poster child of everything wrong at the executive-level and the shareholder-level. Reply ↓ David Barrera May 12, 2017 at 2:09 pm Oho, Yes, the IBM reference is interesting.The author gives an ordinal lead to IBM as a mover from the OEBM to NEBM. I ask myself if, from a mere one large corporation managing perspective, this was IBM’s 11th hour response to the by then devastating rise of its competitors like Apple & Microsoft. Also the irony that it did not help IBM at least in the midterm. So, IBM was the prime mover to initiate some aspects of a model change -change which every major player adhered to- in response to a new technological disadvantage vs. competitors, and in turned did not seem to do much for IBM in the immediate years. Although, if I recall well, IBM was immersed in many political battles and internal problems, legal and otherwise. Nevertheless, I doubt there was a historic inevitability on IBM’s ordinal force. Outstanding work by Lazonick Reply ↓ Trout Creek May 12, 2017 at 3:23 pm Let me quote a noted tech analyst on IBM : “IBM is the poster child for shenanigans. Last month, IBM reported its 20th quarter in a row of declining year over year revenues….. a 13% drop in earnings, profit margins that declined in every business segment ( much worse than expected ), free cash flow that plummeted over 50% year over year and an earnings “beat” of 3 cents per share. How could this “beat” happen? ….. a negative tax rate of -23%…. This is why they pay the CEO Rometti the big bucks ( estimated at $50 to $65 million last year).” And this is one of the Bluest of the Blue Chip companies in the world. Reply ↓ Sue May 12, 2017 at 6:12 pm I read IBM spent a fortune at that time defending itself against monopolistic claims litigation. This was happening while Microsoft and Apple were clearly consolidating their oligopolistic empires. I read reports stating Oracle initial breakthroughs were taken from IBM’s research work. Reply ↓ Thomas Williams May 12, 2017 at 2:04 pm Really fine piece, thanks. Also, the quality of the readers’ comments is some of the highest I’ve seen in years of following NC Reply ↓ nowhere May 12, 2017 at 2:35 pm Not sure if anyone watches “Silicon Valley”, but here is a quote that seems fitting: Season 2 – Bad Money Richard: Once we get a few customers and start a subscription-revenue model. Russ: What? Revenue? No, no, no, no, no. No. If you show revenue, people will ask “How much?” And it will never be enough, but if you have no revenue, you can say you’re pre-revenue. You’re a potential pure play. It’s not about how much you earn, it’s about what you’re worth. And who’s worth the most? Companies that lose money. Pinterest, Snap chat… No revenue. Amazon has lost money every fucking quarter for the last 20 fucking years, and that Bezos motherfucker is the king. Reply ↓ Kalen May 13, 2017 at 3:40 am The midget billionaire was there to destroy not to create hence what do you need profit to accomplish that for? With all the financialization the only products of S&P500 corporates are their stocks and they are recently very bad in selling that too having to borrow a cool $Trillions to buy stocks back or pay a bribes (dividends on supposedly growth stocks) to market mass concentrated monopolistic investors. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 12, 2017 at 5:50 pm Just wanted to point out that there is one more link in the chain to be followed: the financiers would not have such an easy time playing Nero with our economy, if the banking sector were still properly constrained by a gold standard (=limited supply of printed credit), the risk of bank runs by outraged consumers, the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial from investment banking, personal rather than corporate punishment for fraud and abuse, antitrust enforcement, etc. In addition, the rise of 401(k) based investing, in which workers are tax-incentivized to buy in to the corporate stock scheming, but lack the normal shareholder voice in corporate governance, has taken the chains off the looters as well. It’s time to end the impunity. The government has been corrupted by the corporations, so only a populist uprising will produce reform. The uprising will require sacrifices of time, income, security. It will require boycotts of products that people like, but whose producers and vendors are evil. The products will not disappear while demand persists – but the producers and vendors must be brought to heel. Consider the following inductees into the Corporate Hall of Shame: Wells Fargo – customer abuse United Airlines – customer abuse UBER – employee abuse; legal system abuse Mylan (Epi Pens) – Monopolistic price abuse Hewlett Packard (spyware on laptops) – customer abuse … pick an industry, you’ll find a Hall of Shame candidate. Hit them all in the wallet until they reform.

Reply ↓ Smitty May 12, 2017 at 5:53 pm The impact on the Grads was secondary a byproduct of a larger agenda which included the transfer offshore and consolidation of “IP” of the entire American, EU and Asian industrial economies along with the withdrawl of capital, while at the same time intentionally sabotaging future innovations with the handicap of diversity.

The quarterly growth demanded by the financiers reminds me of those movies where the mobster shakes down merchants monthly or weekly for their “protection.” Reply ↓ Aumua May 12, 2017 at 10:12 pm So it’s the financial sector taking everything over, and running it into the ground for short term profit. Greed is winning. So ubiquitous, so dreary, hopeless. We probably won’t survive our own short sightedness. Dragged back into the primordial ooze by our evolutionary heritage. Reply ↓ Winston May 12, 2017 at 11:46 pm This is related to the Lasonick article: “the returns to companies’ R&D spending have declined 65% over the past three decades. Not coincidentally, this decline in companies’ research quotient or RQ (a metric I’ve developed that measures R&D productivity, or how much output they get for their innovation inputs) mimics the decline in U.S. GDP growth over the past 30 years.” https://hbr.org/2017/03/is-rd-getting-harder-or-are-companies-just-getting-worse-at-it Is R&D Getting Harder, or Are Companies Just Getting Worse At It? Reply ↓ cnchal May 13, 2017 at 7:58 am Despite the importance of innovation to companies, as well as to the broader economy, despite the 250% rise in the number of scientists and engineers engaged in R&D, and despite all the experts dedicated to helping companies innovate, the money companies spend on R&D is producing fewer and fewer results. . . So, a supply and demand problem? When scientists and engineers come up with idiocy such as Juiceroo, the well of ideas appears empty. No one got the memo from Milton, from way back in 1960, that individuals are now their own means of production and are capitalists, whether they like it or not. Looked at that way, your employer is the enemy because the value you create within the company is stripped from you and transferred to the boss. All you get out of your effort is a declining paycheck while your boss get’s rich, sitting on his or her ass in an air conditioned office with extended lunch breaks, while the whip is snapping on the sweaty shop floor. Your boss is a sadistic middle man, paying as little as possible for your labor, selling your output for as much as possible, keeping the difference, all the while enjoying treating you like crap. It’s called experience! Reply ↓ Ep3 May 13, 2017 at 10:23 am Yves, another wonderfully great post. But this is just another sliver of the overall pie. We are only out to gain for ourselves. Everyone, from the local garbage man to Icahn, human survival instincts will cause us to act to benefit ourselves first, without a care of future results. Apple says “we could invest all that money in the next phone device. But that same investment could bankrupt us and all that money we had could go down the toilet. It’s better to suck up all the available money now, and if the ship sinks, at least the gold won’t go down with it”. Said another way. “We could all be gone tomorrow. What matters is what happens today.” Who cares if I dump trash in the ocean. I don’t have to drink that water. And I have insulated myself from the effects from my ways so that I won’t ever have to realize the consequences. It all comes back to accountability. If you aren’t held responsible for your actions, then you will continue to escalate the amount of looting and destruction that you can do. Reply ↓ darms May 14, 2017 at 12:49 am Saw a number of what I call “H1-B” employment ads in the late 80’s – 90’s: they were looking for an EE/CS – masters degree person w/10 years exp in a technology that was 4 years old & the wage was ~$10K/year. Obviously no US citizen would apply for a crap job like that so ‘obviously’ the employer was ‘forced’ to look overseas for ‘suitable’ candidates. I did Sr. Tech work in support of electronics manufacturing for 38 years but was forced into involuntary retirement when the electronics hardware mfg. industry left central TX in 2008, and I am bitter as hell… Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

There are over 1,700 regularly updated lists now.  You can see them all here. As usual, in order to make this list, a site had to be: * accessible to English Language Learners and non-tech savvy users. * free-of-charge. * appropriate for classroom use. * completely browser-based with no download required (however, I’ve begun to make exceptions for special mobile apps). It’s possible that a few of these sites began earlier than this year, but, if so, I’m including them in this list because they were “new to me” in 2017. You might want to visit previous editions, as well as The “All-Time” Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education; The “All-Time” Best Ways To Create Online Content Easily & Quickly and The “All-Time” Best 2.0 Tools For Beginning English Language Learners. The Fifty Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education In 2016 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education In 2015 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education In 2014 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education In 2013 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education In 2012 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education In 2011 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education — 2010 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education — 2009 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education — 2008 The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education — 2007 I don’t rank my mid-year lists, but do place them in order of preference in my end-of-year lists. Just because a tool is on this mid-year list does not mean it will make the cut for the year-end version. Feel free to let me know if you think I’m leaving any tools out. Here are my twenty-five choices for The Best Web 2.0 Applications For Education In 2017- So Far (not ranked in any order): Publishthis.email lets you create a website via email.  You can read more about it at Richard Byrne’s site.  I’m adding it to A Few Simple Ways To Introduce Reluctant Colleagues To Technology. Quiznetic is a Kahoot-like tool that lets you create learning games in various racing forms. Students can then “race” each other in answering the questions and see their positions. It appears to be free, and seems simple to use. Google unveiled AutoDraw, a free site that uses artificial intelligence that provides a series of guesses about what you are drawing. You can choose the right “guess” to pretty-up your artistic creation, write up some description, and then download it or share the link. The image above is an example. This is perfect for English Language Learners – instead of spending tons of time getting their drawing “just right,” they can, instead, have fun drawing quickly and spend more time on the language part of the exercise. And it’s great for ESL teachers, too – no more working hard trying to draw images of scenes for vocabulary items to support language acquisition. Now just draw a few lines, project it onto the screen, and you’ll be able to show a masterpiece. I’m adding this info to The Best Art Websites For Learning English. Apple released a neat new free app called Clips. You can read a very good – and detailed – explanation of its features at TechCrunch. It’s billed as a video-editing tool, and it seems like an excellent and simple one. I’m always on the look-out for one of those since I have my IB Theory of Knowledge students periodically make videos, so Clips definitely gets added to the Not The “Best,” But A List… Of Online Video Editors list. But it’s much more than just a video-editor.  It has the “stop-action” ability of Instagram video (press to video, stop, press again), it provides flowing text you want to display by recognizing the words you say (a particularly useful tool for English Language Learners) and, even though it’s an Apple product, it’s easy to share videos to whatever platform you want to use. So, because of those features and others, I’m also adding it to The Best Resources For Learning To Use The Video Apps “Vine” & Instagram. Erasures lets you create a version of “Blackout Poetry” online. You can learn more about Blackout Poetry here. Loopy lets you create interactive simulations – just by drawing. This is how they describe themselves: It’s the ancient, time-honored way of learning: messing around and seeing what happens. Play with simulations to ask “what if” questions, and get an intuition for how the system works! Raw code is too inaccessible. Also drag-and-drop is too mainstream. But with LOOPY, you can model systems by simply drawing circles & arrows, like a wee baby I don’t quite get it, but my post about it was quite popular, so apparently a lot of readers do…. StoryShares lets teachers create virtual classrooms for free and offers a collection of books that students can read. Even better, there’s an option that provides audio of the text in a pleasing-to-the-ear-voice. The best part of the site, though, is that students can also write and publish their own books to share. I’m adding it to The Best Sites Where Students Can Work Independently & Let Teachers Check On Progress. SlideBot lets you type the text you want to appear in each slide and then uses its software to design your slideshow in seconds. It’s pretty neat, and they’ve just unveiled a free education version. Unfortunately, if you want to be able to export it or use it in full-screen mode, it will cost $15. Those restrictions might make its use in education somewhat limited. However, I could also see some pretty major advantages, including eliminating the extensive time that some students spend on slide design. In addition, having students use SlideBot even a few times could be a good learning experience about good design of slides – its software appears pretty powerful based on my testing it out. I’m going to purchase the $15 dollar license for myself because it seems to create slideshows that are a hell of a lot better looking than the ones I create manually. In many ways, it’s a non-animated version of “My Simple Slideshow,” which automatically creates animations from text (see Wow – “My Simple Show” Is An Extraordinary Tool For Creating Free Video “Explainers”). I’m adding this info to The Best Ways To Create Online Slideshows. Verse lets you create interactive videos. I’m adding it to A Potpourri Of The Best & Most Useful Video Sites. Story Friend is a new iPhone app that may have potential.  It lets you create slideshows (like a zillion other apps).  However, this one lets you include content from other social media accounts, too – sort of a like a mobile Storify tool. Dotstorming is an online collaborative tool that allows groups to work together and vote on preferences. It’s like a bunch of other similar tools, though this one stands out because it lets you easily search for and post images.  I’m adding it to The Best Online Tools For Real-Time Collaboration. PortfolioGen lets students easily create online portfolios of their work.  I’m adding it to The Best Resources For Developing Student Portfolios. Anchor is an easy tool for creating podcasts.  You can read more about it at Richard Byrne’s blog.  I’m adding it to The Best Sites To Practice Speaking English. QuizPedia lets you – or students – easily create…quizzes. You can learn more about it from Ed Tech For Beginners. I’m adding it to The Best Ways To Create Online Tests. Sketchboard is an online whiteboard where users can draw collaboratively. I’m adding it to The Best Online Tools For Real-Time Collaboration. Chart Accent lets you create charts and then annotate them. Thanks to Flowing Data for the tip. Pinup is the latest addition to The Best Online Virtual “Corkboards” (or “Bulletin Boards”). Qzzr looks like a fun place for students to create online quizzes.  I learned about it from Creative Language Class and am adding it to The Best Ways To Create Online Tests. Stormboard, which is free for educators at least through July, 2017, is a nice new collaborative online “corkboard/bulletin board” where you can share “stickies,” including photos, videos and text. I’m adding it to the very popular The Best Online Virtual “Corkboards” (or “Bulletin Boards”). I’ve written some past posts about the work of Philip Tetlock (Quote Of The Day: “beliefs are hypotheses to be tested…” and The Best Resources On The Importance Of Knowing What You Don’t Know).  He’s particularly known for his work in developing a science of “forecasting.” He recently unveiled a site called Good Judgment where users can forecast an answer to a question and, when and if the action takes place, is “scored” on their forecasting ability.  Users make a prediction, then share their reasoning, and you can link directly to individual’s forecasts. This seems to me to be an excellent way for students to write for an authentic audience, which is why I’m adding it to The Best Places Where Students Can Write For An “Authentic Audience” Recap is a new tool designed to have students create short videos highlighting their reflections on the learning they’re doing in the classroom. I’m adding it to A Potpourri Of The Best & Most Useful Video Sites. StepMap looks like a decent map-making site. I’m adding it to The Best Map-Making Sites On The Web. Animaker looks like a pretty simple tool for creating online animations. It has lots of premium features, but you can make five for free. I’m adding it to The Best Ways For Students To Create Online Animations.

But this sea change in photography has created new issues, such as: Pictures are easier to take and retain. Your iPhone doesn’t swell like an overstuffed photo album if you keep all those blurry photos that would be better off consigned to the dustbin of history. Camera capabilities have improved steadily over time, radically increasing storage requirements. Did you ever think you’d be able to shoot high-definition video on something like an iPhone? Thanks to the increased space requirements of photos and videos, our iPhones and iPads, not to mention some Macs, can’t handle the size of our photo libraries. We want to access our photos and videos from any of our devices, at any time, and have any edits we make reflected everywhere. iCloud Photo Library is Apple’s solution to these issues. There are competing options, such as Google Photos, Lightroom mobile, Mylio, and Amazon Prime Photos (all explained in Jeff Carlson’s “Take Control of Your Digital Photos on a Mac”), but the idea behind all of them is basically the same: Provide more space to store our photos and videos in the cloud Allow us to access these photos and videos from any of our devices This cloud-based approach has a couple of welcome byproducts. Although it shouldn’t be seen as the backup, a cloud-based photo library certainly does provide another copy of everything in a location that’s safe from fire, flood, or theft. Also, sharing photos with family and friends becomes a bit easier. If you decide to use iCloud Photo Library, here are four things to think about before you flip that switch and turn it on. Cull Photos First… Or Not -- Many of the features of Apple’s Photos app — automatic albums like Selfies and Screenshots, facial recognition, Memories, and searching for photos by generic categories like Mountains or Snow — eliminate much of the tedium of organizing photos and help us avoid throwing things away. After all, why toss any photos when Photos can organize most of them automatically for later reference? It’s much more fun to keep shooting than to engage in the chore of trashing photos that, upon further review, you’d be ashamed to admit you took. How does this apply to iCloud Photo Library? If you have time now, you might want to delete unnecessary photos like the eight nearly identical photos I apparently just took of my sleeping cat (who, like most sleeping cats, didn’t move the entire time). That will reduce the upload and download times for iCloud. On the other hand, if you’re thinking that it would be way more fun to clean up your photo collection while lounging on the couch with your iPad in the future, just leave all the cruft in place for now — you can always trash it later. Start with the Host with the Most -- It may take quite a bit of time to upload all your photos and videos to your iCloud Photo Library: days or even weeks, depending on your upstream Internet speed and how many photos and videos you have. In my case, the vast majority of my several thousand photos and videos were stored on my Mac. Many were duplicated on my iPad and iPhone because I had manually synced them there at some point in the past. So I started with the Mac, and even with the library culling that I performed, it still took several days to finish. But there are plenty of people who have all or most of their photos on an iPhone or iPad, or maybe don’t even own a Mac. If you’re in that situation, start from the device that contains most of your photos and videos. Once that first upload is done, you can repeat the process with your other devices. Happily, to make sure you don’t chew through your monthly data limit uploading photos, iOS devices won’t upload to the iCloud Photo Library using a cellular connection, just via Wi-Fi. If you find your Mac or iOS device is getting bogged down, or your Internet connection has slowed considerably as a result of all the uploading, you can pause the upload. It will resume automatically after a day, or you can start it again manually before bed. On the Mac the Pause button is in Photos > Preferences > iCloud; in iOS look for it in Settings > Photos & Camera. Optimize Photos Where Appropriate -- iCloud Photo Library always stores your photos and videos in the cloud at their original full resolutions. But you likely don’t have enough space on your iPhone or iPad, or even possibly on a MacBook Air, to store all that data. That’s why Apple gives you the option to instead store “optimized” versions (small thumbnails) on any of your devices. When you want to work with an optimized photo, Photos downloads the original. Think carefully about where you store full-resolution and optimized versions of photos. I opted for optimized copies on my iPhone and iPad, but I chose to keep the full-resolution versions on my Mac. The Mac is where I tend to exercise my meager photo-editing skills, and I would prefer not to wait for each photo to download before I edit it. In addition, I back up my Mac both locally via Time Machine and via the online service Backblaze, which puts my full photo library in four different places — iCloud Photo Library, my Mac’s drive, my Time Machine backup drive, and Backblaze. Should disaster strike, I’m confident that I won’t lose any precious photos. Space Is Money -- My Photo Stream was Apple’s initial foray into syncing a limited number of user photos via the cloud, and the photos it syncs do not count against an iCloud account’s storage limits (it doesn’t even work with videos). In contrast, all the photos and videos in iCloud Photo Library do count against that storage limit. A free iCloud account gives you 5 GB to get started. But, particularly if you’re backing up an iOS device or two, a photo library of any decent size won’t come close to fitting in that space. Fortunately, Apple notifies you before you start uploading if your iCloud account needs more storage space, and you can buy additional iCloud storage at a relatively low cost: $0.99 per month for 50 GB, $2.99 for 200 GB, $9.99 for 1 TB, or $19.99 for 2 TB. In my case, I only needed to do a little bit of editing to whittle my photo library down so it was comfortably below the 50 GB mark, giving me some room for short-term growth and saving me a couple of bucks a month. For me, it wasn’t worth paying for the extra space up front with an eventual goal of taming the photo library later, especially since I hadn’t been especially motivated to do so for several years. In addition, there are three other members of my family with their own iCloud accounts, so walking the talk was a factor in my decision. That said, most people probably can’t drop their library size significantly enough to fit comfortably into a lower pricing tier. And remember, at 2–3 MB per iPhone photo, library size can grow quickly. Still, there’s no reason to pay more than necessary; Apple will happily tell you if you need to upgrade again in the future. Annoyingly, there’s no way to buy iCloud storage for a year at a time, so you’ll be getting and accounting for a small iCloud storage payment every month no matter what. Flip the Switch -- Once you’ve thought about these things and are ready to go, turn on iCloud Photo Library in Photos > Preferences > iCloud on the Mac, or in Settings > Photos & Camera in iOS. Then reward yourself with a favorite beverage, particularly if you’ve done any pruning of your photo library. While you wait for your photos to upload, which will take days or even weeks, you can still use your Mac or iOS device normally. Do not stare at the progress count or try to second-guess what’s happening. And in particular, do not turn iCloud Photo Library off and back on, since that will force the system to evaluate every photo again, slowing the process further. Just let it run and it will finish eventually. In the meantime, can I recommend a relaxing hobby that will get you away from the screen, like maybe photography?   READERS LIKE YOU!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David campbell  2017-05-11 04:12 All of this is very good advice, but it is also important to remember later on if a friend or relative offers you photos of an event. Our son loaded a lot of high res photos of our grandson on his mother's computer not knowing we had iCould photo library turned on. Before we realized what was happening we burned through our monthly data cap in a week. Reply Cheesehead Dave  2017-05-11 11:21 I learned this the hard way. We took a trip to Disney and got the photo package where they give you full resolution files for all the character and ride photos that get taken for you over your trip. In the end, we had about 300 pictures. I downloaded them all and added them to iPhoto which then got to work re-uploading them to iCloud. My Mac was unusable for two days. Reply Lee  2017-05-11 13:43 I run into this all the time...I snap away knowing I'm only going to keep about one out of ten of the photos. So what I now do is to download from my DSLR not into Photos but using Image Capture. That gives me the opportunity to go through them with a quick once-over, delete the ones I'm not going to keep, and then import the rest into Photos. I don't have to make painstaking decisions...I can make those later. Just get rid of the ones that at a glance I can get rid of. Reply Mike Matthews   2017-05-11 14:46 This is a good thing to remember (and monitor) *after* you turn on iCloud Photo Library. Reply Mike Matthews   2017-05-11 14:47 Good idea--reviewing via Image Capture, I mean. Reply Dave Edwards  2017-05-13 21:25 Image Capture, the unsung hero of Mac photo management. Reply Scott Rose  2017-05-11 12:29 The biggest problem with how Apple designed iCloud Photo Library is that even if you choose to optimize images, it still requires your device to show ALL THE THUMBNAIL IMAGES FOR ALL 100% OF YOUR IMAGES. Why? Because iCloud Photo Library always requires you to DISPLAY ALL 100% OF YOUR IMAGES ON EVERY DEVICE. You are NEVER allowed to show just a SUBSET of your images. Therefore, people with smaller capacity iPhones or iPads (such as 16 GB or 32 GB devices) WILL STILL RUN OUT OF SPACES ON THEIR DEVICES... even if they turn on optimize images. The ideal solution from Apple would be to let people store ALL 100% of their images in the cloud, but only display a subset of images on their devices. As it stands now, if you dare try to remove an image from your device, it gets deleted everywhere. Apple really needs to rethink this entire thing from the ground up. Reply Twisell  2017-05-11 12:54 BUT THUMBNAILS IMAGES ARE SMALL not like your CAPS LOCK Reply Charles Jacobs  2017-05-12 09:24 1. It gets better - if you took a picture yesterday that you want to share - boom - already a thumbnail - so if you are at a low bandwidth area SOL 2. He didn't use cap lock - he used caps - because he really was shouting. 3. Thumbnails are more problem than solution. Reply Michel Hedley  2017-05-11 20:50 Don't do it. Don't use iCloud to store images and vids. There are too many disaster stories that cannot be ignored. Apple has never 'got' cloud. It is disappointing that this story did not point out all the downsides using iCloud to store your digital images. Reply Simon   2017-05-13 11:49 I'm still using My Photo Stream. It allows me to easily get photos from my iPhone to my Mac, but it doesn't interfere with originals, it doesn't hog bandwidth, and it doesn't cost anything. On the Mac I then select, edit, and make albums that then get synced back to the iPhone and iPad. It's a barebones solution, but it's simple, free, and works most of the time - and when it doesn't it's because Apple doesn't get the cloud and there you're no better off with iCloud Photo Library. Reply James Katt  2017-05-13 19:45 iCloud Photo Library is useless to me because I have over 4TB of photos. I find it far more useful to store backups of my photos on Amazon Drive which has unlimited Storage for only $60 a year. I currently have 16 TB stored on my Amazon drive using Arq to do the backup. I upload photos also to Amazon Drive's photo folder so it can be accessible to all my devices. This includes backups from my iPhones. Again Amazon gives you unlimited storage. ODrive app will sync whatever folders you want on your Mac and Amazon drive.

Here are some things to consider Facebook & Apple add egg freezing to employee benefit plans, spark controversy Canadian women are choosing motherhood later in life and the average age for a first pregnancy in Canada now hovers around 31 years old.  With an increase in age comes a greater potential for complications in getting pregnant and one in six Canadians experiences infertility.  Dr. Sonya Kashyap, medical director of Genesis Fertility Centre in Vancouver, said fertility is something women should keep in mind — before they attempt to get pregnant.  Kashyap talked to CBC's Our Vancouver host Gloria Macarenko about planning for motherhood with modern medicine and the necessity of thinking ahead.  "These days, we see many individuals and couples delaying their childbearing until later years," Kashyap said. "It takes longer to find a partner, it takes longer to complete your education, it takes longer to have a career and, certainly in Vancouver, it takes longer to find a house." Professional women are faced with career choices that men are not, Kashyap said, and it is harming their ability to become mothers when they decide to. "Women deserve to understand their reproductive options," she said. "Education about egg freezing is as important as contraceptive education when you think about family planning."  Egg freezing isn't a guarantee, says Sonya Kashyap, but it is the best option currently available. (Genesis Fertility Clinic) 'Fertility gender gap' Although 40 per cent of infertility in couples is on the male side, it is something that affects women more as they get older. "There really is a fertility gender gap," Kashyap said. "For women, our eggs are our age, whether that's 30, 35 or 40. For men, no matter what age they are, their sperm is two months old."  Older eggs mean a decline in the number and quality, reducing fertility and can result in an increased risk of miscarriage. Kashyap said freezing eggs at a younger age is a solution she hopes will change the perceptions about infertility.   Egg freezing's on the rise, but when's a good time do it? Access to tax credit for fertility treatments expanded in budget "We'd love to change the conversation and take 'infertility' out of the vocabulary and call it 'fertility' and egg freezing is a way to do that," she said.  Kashyap said freezing eggs won't necessarily solve infertility but it improves options for motherhood.  "It's not a guarantee but it is the best thing that we have to prolong or extend women's fertility until they are ready — whatever ready means." Anyone who has incurred expenses over the past 10 years for reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization can refile their taxes for that year and claim the deduction. (iStock) High treatment costs  Egg freezing involves an ovarian reserve assessment, an ultrasound, an antral follicle count and an egg extraction. The cost of the process can range from $7,000 to $10,000 and just the storage of an egg can cost several hundred dollars a year.  In Canada, the consults to the work-up are covered by medical plans, and the federal government has committed a tax credit to assist people who need to use assisted reproductive technologies.  Cost is just one factor though, Kashyap cautioned, and time is just as important to keep in mind. "Don't just freeze them and forget about them," she said. "Whatever the circumstances are, for sure, will be easier when you are younger."  She said there are always options but, with time, the options change.  Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: Tetsa River (Provincial Park) Muncho Lake Fort Nelson Vancouver Mostly Cloudy 10°C Kelowna Cloudy 8°C Abbotsford Partly Cloudy 8°C Prince George Cloudy 6°C Victoria Mostly Cloudy 9°C More Weather Latest British Columbia News Only bid for Victoria's pedestrian bridges $1 million more than city willing to spend audio Small landslide near Vernon, B.C., results in evacuation order for 17 properties 2 B.C. ridings to get recounts following tight election race Program aimed at Whistler's sleep-deprived and newly-arrived parents audio Multiple evacuation alerts and orders rescinded in B.C.'s Central Okanagan Top News Headlines Trump 'cannot imagine that Russia is pleased' with latest North Korea missile launch Why the Trump administration's War on Drugs time warp could cause 'gratuitous suffering' video Senators take early series lead with OT win in Pittsburgh read comments video 'Really tiring': Indigenous writer says 'appropriation prize' op-ed is proof more needs to be done video 'This is child's play,' expert warns after global cyberattack on schools, hospitals Most Viewed Small landslide near Vernon, B.C., results in evacuation order for 17 properties 2 B.C. ridings to get recounts following tight election race Scarce condo supply in Metro Vancouver squeezes would-be buyers from market Nice weather hampers flood efforts in Kelowna as residents begin to doubt warnings 'Huge and delicious,' Vancouver's 11th Spot Prawn festival delights appetites Only bid for Victoria's pedestrian bridges $1 million more than city willing to spend Program aimed at Whistler's sleep-deprived and newly-arrived parents Multiple evacuation alerts and orders rescinded in B.C.'s Central Okanagan Not the Sweetest Thing: long lines for Vancouver U2 show mar experience for some Don't Miss Only bid for Victoria's pedestrian bridges $1 million more than city willing to spend Small landslide near Vernon, B.C., results in evacuation order for 17 properties 2 B.C. ridings to get recounts following tight election race Program aimed at Whistler's sleep-deprived and newly-arrived parents Multiple evacuation alerts and orders rescinded in B.C.'s Central Okanagan Photos 'Huge and delicious,' Vancouver's 11th Spot Prawn festival delights appetites Nice weather hampers flood efforts in Kelowna as residents begin to doubt warnings Our Vancouver How modern medicine can improve options for motherhood The Rookies: 3 first-time candidates reflect on losses Land use and climate change could increase flood frequency, experts say Scarce condo supply in Metro Vancouver squeezes would-be buyers from market Photos 6 memorable photos from election night in B.C.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 13, 2017 9:02pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL According To New Data, The Samsung S8 Is No 'iPhone Killer' Device Apple Quietly Acquired A Sleep Tracking App Stocks Drift To Mixed Finish; Apple, Wynn, Trade Desk Score (Investor's Business Daily) IConic Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is approaching yet another milestone event. Apple's shares, which had a lackluster run in 2015, turned the corner in mid-2016 and began to trend broadly higher subsequently. The company's fiscal second-quarter earnings release gave further momentum to the rally and the stock's market capitalization shot above $800 billion for the first time ever. It took the stock a little over two years to add $100 billion to its market capitalization and scale the $800 billion mark. No mean feat, indeed. To put things in perspective: The valuation of Apple is now more than 45 of the 50 U.S. states, with only Illinois, Florida, New York, Texas and California boasting of economies of size bigger than Apple's valuation. Based on IMF's nominal GDP estimate for 2016, if Apple were a country and its market cap, GDP, it would have ranked 18 among the 191 nations the agency surveyed. Some Contributing Factors Apart from the strong market position, product appeal, solid fundamentals, the company's shares have also been beneficiaries of massive stock repurchases. From 6.61 billion in early 2013, the number of outstanding shares has fallen to 5.21 billion currently, a 21 percent drop over a timeframe of a little over four years. Source: Y Charts Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, for his part, has added fuel to Apple's recent rally by increasing his stake in the company in a big way. The 13D filing done by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) following the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 showed that it had nearly quadrupled its position in Apple. $1 Trillion Valuation In The Offing Given its product momentum, it wouldn't be a surprise if the stock quickly gallops toward the $1 trillion market cap mark in the near to medium term. Apple's much-hyped iPhone 8, its tenth-anniversary product, which is expected to be launched later this year, and its plunge into Augmented Reality, are considered to be catalysts that can expedite the stock's march towards the $1 trillion mark. Meanwhile, a Fortune article, quoting Barclays, said Apple might have serious competition in its race towards the $1 trillion mark, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) being considered as a contender. Amazon is currently valued at only $455.16 million. Among the others in the fray are Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), with a market cap of $650.77 billion, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) ($536.62 million) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) ($433.95 million). The Original $1 Trillion Company Even as there is a scramble toward achieving $1 trillion market cap, Benzinga looked at United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), which was the first company ever to be capitalized at over $1 trillion. The history of the steel maker is a checkered one, and over the years, it has lost its shine and appeal and is currently looking a pale shadow of its old self. U.S. Steel now commands a paltry valuation of $24.75 billion. Source: Y Charts A Brief History U.S. Steel was founded in 1901, when John Piermont Morgan and Elbert Gary combined Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie Steel Company, Gary's Federal Steel Company and William Henry Judge Moore's National Steel Company. Morgan visualized establishing a steel behemoth and convinced Carnegie, whose steel company was then the biggest and most efficient producer of steel, to sell his company for $492 million in stocks and bonds of the new company. Though the company was valued at over $1 trillion, its tangible assets were valued at only $682 million, with goodwill accounting for the remaining amount. In 1907, U.S. Steel bought Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad company, its biggest rival, with the purchase eliciting anti-trust scrutiny. At that time, it produced 67 percent of all the steel produced in the U.S. The bulking up strategy did not work well for the company over the years, as it saw its market share dwindle and profitability erode. In 1982, in a diversification bid, the company picked up Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) and renamed itself as USX. A six-month lock-up of most of the plants following a strike by United Steelworkers of America in 1986 hurt the company further. During this time, corporate raider and activists investor Carl Icahn had launched a hostile bid for the company, which was later withdrawn. To unlock value and to focus on its core business, U.S. Steel spun off Marathon Oil in 2001 and forayed into international markets by making some overseas acquisitions. With fundamentals deteriorating, the company announced layoffs in 2014. The company, which was one of the original members of the S&P 500 when it was formed in 1957, was removed from the index in July 2014, as its market cap contracted. Risky Proposition The company is now considered a risky proposition, given the fundamentals woes of the industry and company-specific issues. The industry is facing competition from cheap imports from China, which is glutting the market and bringing down prices. Additionally, the demand side of the equation is also suffering amid uncertain global macroeconomic conditions. Recently Cowen downgraded the shares of the company to Market Perform, citing a lack of earnings visibility following its first quarter results. The company is facing issues at its flat-rolled segment, with the management responding with a dramatic revitalization. With all the negativity, it looks like U.S. Steel's valuation could only head southward, even as some of newbie tech stalwarts are battling it out for achieving market cap supremacy.

Synaptics' recent earnings report revealed a big long-term catalyst. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) May 13, 2017 at 8:53PM Shares of Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) got a much-needed shot in the arm after the company's third-quarter fiscal 2017 results easily bested Wall Street's expectations. The human interface solutions provider's revenue jumped 10% year-over-year (to $444.2 million), translating into $1.27 per share in earnings. By comparison, analysts were expecting $1.20 per share in earnings on $430 million in revenue. Synaptics' results were warmly received, and the stock shot up 6% during the post-earnings action, bringing relief to investors amid speculation that the company could lose business from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). More importantly, CEO Richard Bergman provided clarity about the company's next big growth driver -- edge-to-edge smartphone displays -- where Synaptics is trying to lead the field with its product development moves. Image Source: Synaptics  Why edge-to-edge displays could be a big deal for Synaptics The display of Samsung's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, covers the front of the device almost entirely. This has led to the elimination of the home button, which traditionally houses the fingerprint sensor to unlock the device. Samsung had been collaborating with Synaptics to integrate the fingerprint scanning technology into the display, but it wasn't ready in time for deployment into the Galaxy S8. Instead, Samsung had to place Synaptics' fingerprint sensor at the back of the device, near the camera, just before the device went into production. Industry sources are reportedly blaming Synaptics' delayed development for Samsung's last-minute change. But it's really no surprise it wasn't ready. The semiconductor specialist currently has the "only workable solution" to integrate the fingerprint scanner into the touchscreen, per Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri. And Synaptics' FS9100 optical fingerprint sensor -- which can scan fingerprints through 1mm of glass -- was only launched in December 2016. Synaptics started sampling it to customers in the first quarter this year and the company had indicated that mass production would begin only in the second quarter. So people shouldn't have expected the sensor to be in the Galaxy S8. However, Cowen forecasts that Samsung's next Note device will be the first one to sport the touch and display integration (TDDI) while Korean news publication The Bell's unnamed sources confirm the same. Samsung is expected to launch the next Note in the second half of the year, giving Synaptics enough time to ramp up production of the integrated sensor. Synaptics' product lead in this market and its Samsung partnership will play a crucial role in capturing a bigger share of the TDDI space. IHS Markit forecasts that TDDI chip demand will jump to 654 million units in 2022 compared to this year's projected shipments of 100 million units. Synaptics is one of just three companies in this space, and is the only one to have licensed its intellectual property to display panel makers. Will Apple use Synaptics' solutions? Leaked specs of what purports to be the next iPhone's case molding (via Slash Leaks) indicates that Apple won't go the Samsung route by placing the Touch ID on the back of the device. Instead, it could integrate the device into the rumored OLED display and remove the iconic home button in the process. But an Apple move toward TDDI doesn't guarantee Synaptics a slot inside the device, as Cupertino has been reportedly developing an in-house display and fingerprint sensor integration technology. Motley Fool contributor Ashraf Eassa believes it highly unlikey that the iPhone maker bought AuthenTec to build Touch IDs in-house for just a few iPhone models. This makes sense, and indicates that Apple could be developing its own system. However, Synaptics can still hope for a spot if Apple's product development falls behind schedule. But investors shouldn't worry too much even if the chipmaker doesn't land a spot in the next iPhone thanks to the end market's secular growth. As mentioned earlier, sales of TDDI chips are estimated to boom in the long run, and Synaptics is probably the best-positioned company to take advantage of the opportunity. This is because Apple is unlikely to license its technology to other smartphone companies, using it exclusively for its iPhones. Japan Display, the other operator in this space, is primarily a flat-panel display provider, so it might find it difficult to license its technology to rival display makers. Synaptics, therefore, is sitting on a huge opportunity that could give its revenue a nice boost in the long run. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

After going dark for one season during its bankruptcy, the not-so-big top will pitch its tent in Lincoln Center this fall, for its 40th anniversary. All the show needs is a new ringmaster. Wanted: someone warm and welcoming who can move the action along and whip the crowd into a frenzy, without cracking an actual whip. Of course, looking hot in a top hat doesn’t hurt, either. At an open call last Wednesday, nearly 40 ringmaster wannabes threw their hats into the ring. Here are a few of the contenders; the winner will be announced this week. Matt RoperAnnie Wermiel Matt Roper Age: 39 Home: Brooklyn, by way of Cheshire, England Skill set: “I’m a comedian — I know how to keep the room alive at the Slipper Room, a burlesque lounge. That’s kind of a circus!” What he’s wearing: “I think it’s a Queen’s Welsh Guard jacket that I got for [about $38]. I like vintage as long as nobody died in it.” Why join the circus? “It’s family — you live together, set up [a] tent and take it down together, and create happiness. Then you get a check.” Victor WisehartAnnie Wermiel Victor Wisehart Age: 33 Home: Long Island City Skill set: “In [the Broadway musicals] ‘An American in Paris’ and ‘Holiday Inn,’ I played a Russian choreographer and a Hollywood director. I figure ringmaster is next.” Why join the circus? “Anything that brings social creativity to the masses is a special endeavor.” Ty McFarlanAnnie Wermiel Ty McFarlan Age: 47 Home: Blythewood, SC Skill set: “I served as Ringmaster Ty at the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus for five years and over 3,000 shows.” Secret weapons: “Being ringmaster is rigorous and requires discipline, and I served 13 years in the Army.” Why join the circus? “The circus is 150 years old — older than Coca-Cola, older than baseball. Who wouldn’t want to be part of it?” Olivia SblendorioAnnie Wermiel Olivia Sblendorio Age: 37 Home: Santa Cruz, Calif. Skill set: “I’ve been with circuses for 15 years. I started as an acrobat, got injured on the flying trapeze and became a clown. I’ve been clowning in hospitals and can bring joy, even on the worst days.” Why join the circus? “Growing up in Brooklyn, I saw Grandma [the clown, star of the Big Apple Circus] and a lady on a trapeze and thought, ‘I can do that!’ That’s what the circus is about: inspiring people beyond what they think possible.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under circuses ,  lincoln center ,  new york city Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next 2017 is the year of the incredible collapsing Hollywood hu...

In each instance, no money was taken from cash registers but, rather, cigarettes were stolen. (Published Saturday, May 13, 2017) The 3 men move fast. Dressed in dark clothing and wearing hoods, they are targeting Central Massachusetts convenience stores, stealing packs of cigarettes. "It's crazy that this happened, honestly. Pretty weird, " Jacob Tinker of Country Cupboard in Bolton, Mass. said. "There was, like, 3 guys all in black and I guess they came in and stole 500 dollars worth of cigarettes." Belmont, Mass. PD Shares Robbery Footage in Hopes of ID The small store was hit early Thursday morning. The thieves smashed a glass door and ran in with duffle bags. "Out of everything they took, there is liquor - all that liquor over there - all they wanted was the cigarettes," Tinker said. "I am glad it was a break-in and not a hold-up; glad no one was involved except the door. That was the only thing that got hurt." Man Charged in Armed Robbery of Convenience Store The same morning, Apple Country Market in nearby Hudson was also hit. "When the officer showed up here they said in 4 years this was the first commercial break in, so to hear that I was extremely surprised,"  Apple Country employee Vinod Patel said. VideoPolice Search for Armed Robbery Suspect In this break-in, the 3 men also stole cigarettes. "Not very happy because I'm a hard-working guy, and I expect nothing for nothing, and I hope they catch them," said Patel. In a surveillance video,  the 3 enter Apple Country Market with duffle bags and immediately start taking cigarettes. Days before, the E-Z Mart in Marlborough was also targeted. "That's the rock they threw," John Gagas, who owns the E-Z Mart building, said. "They took Marlboro cigarettes; they cleaned them all out. Maybe they smoke Marlboro and they want to re-sell them." Gagas and others say they have heard of other stores that were hit in similar smash-and-grabs. "I was surprised because it has never happened like this. We never had a problem in this neighborhood," Gagas said.

BWW Review: Encores! Serves Up Delicious Mounting of Cult Favorite THE GOLDEN APPLE by Michael Dale BroadwayWorld.com May. 13, 2017   Tweet Share      In the late-night hours of June, 14, 1994, when hockey's New York Rangers won their first Stanley Cup championship in 54 years, there were fans visiting the gravesites of loved ones, armed with six-packs of beer and radios, to share with long-gone fans a moment they thought they might never live to see. Lindsay Mendez and Barton Cowperthwaite (Photo: Joan Marcus) I imagine if there was a live broadcast of Wednesday night's opening performance of the Encores! production of THE GOLDEN APPLE, there might have been a few musical theatre fans venturing out to the city's cemeteries, perhaps sporting a bottle or two of prosecco, to also share with loved ones a moment they thought they might never live to see. This is a show that Broadway lovers have been begging Encores! to do ever since the City Center company began presenting concert mountings of rarely-revived musicals in February of '94. Despite positive reviews, it only ran for three and a half months at the Alvin Theatre after transferring in April of 1954 from Off-Broadway's Phoenix Theatre. But the score was preserved in an original Broadway cast recording that has helped it accumulate a passionate following. The phrase "cult musical" might have been created for THE GOLDEN APPLE. Perhaps it was an early case of Off-Broadway quirkiness not quite jibing with Broadway audiences. After all, it was a musical retelling of the story of Ulysses and Helen of Troy, back when that was an original idea. Bookwriter/lyricist John Latouche mixes literary wit with hearty folksiness as he sets the scene in the first decade of the 20th Century, when soldiers with names like Ulysses, Homer and Agamemnon are returning from the Spanish-American War back to Angel's Roost, a rural Washington State locale at the foot of Mt. Olympus. All the fellas are crazy about Helen, though unlike the way the Greeks tell it, in this case she's a fun and rowdy gal; way more than just a pretty face who launches ships. But while they were off to war, she married the older, wealthier Sheriff Menelaus. Longing for adventure, Helen runs off with a traveling salesman named Paris, who arrives in town via a hot air balloon. He takes her back to the tawdry town of Rhododendron, a playground for the gods run by its showman mayor Hector. To the dismay of his wife Penelope, Ulysses sets out to Rhododendron to bring Helen Back, but Hector encourages him to stay and enjoy the delights of his domain. Ryan Silverman and Mikaela Bennett (Photo: Joan Marcus) Composed for a combination of legit voices and Broadway belters, Jerome Moross' score is a crazy mix of classical jazz, operetta, folk, vaudeville and showtune, with Helen's languidly sexy "Lazy Afternoon" being its most enduring selection. Encores! music director Rob Berman leads a 31-piece onstage orchestra - more than half of them on strings - playing Moross and Hershey Kay's original orchestrations; an excitingly eclectic Americana sound that's rarely heard on Broadway. As is often the case when Encores! produces Golden Age musicals, the production values of director Michael Berresse's spirited production may be modest by today's standards, but the festive visuals by scenic designer Allen Moyer and costume consultant William Ivey Long are in the spirit of replicating the experience of attending theatre when the focus was on innovative writing and imaginative staging. Lindsay Mendez shines brightly as Helen, a role originated by Kaye Ballard, singing with warmth, humor and gleeful sexuality. Ryan Silverman's Ulysses is a traditionally virile-voiced baritone, well-match with Mikaela Bennett's strong dramatic soprano as Penelope. Barton Cowperthwaite doesn't utter a sound as Paris, dancing the role with sexy balletic strides choreographed by Joshua Bergasse. With such a varied score, Bergasse's work throughout the show ranges from acrobatic ballet to jazz to buck and wing. There are plenty of juicy supporting roles to go around and Encores! has gathered a top cast to play them. Alli Mauzey, Ashley Brown and Carrie Compare are a trio of proper town ladies in act one who get to break out as goddesses performing specialty numbers in the second half. N'Kenge is a dazzler as an eccentric soothsayer who promises a golden (wire) apple to the winner of a county fair bake-off. Jeff Blumenkrantz is a comical dullard as Sheriff Menelaus, but when in Rhododendron, he and Jason Kravits (as a gritty vaudevillian Hector) partake in a kooky Gallagher and Shean parody number as Scylla and Charybdis. Though over sixty years old, THE GOLDEN APPLE is a musical that retains its youthful vim with its consistent cleverness. While a commercial Broadway revival is always a risky venture, perhaps a high-profile Encores! production may prove to be what's needed to inspire high school and regional productions. This one deserves a far greater following.

Sources tell the site that the deal was closed a couple weeks ago for around $200 million. About 20 engineers from the company have joined Apple. Lattice was born out of the Stanford research project DeepDive, a programming and execution framework for statistical inference, which allows engineers to solve data cleaning, extraction, and integration problems jointly. It aims to take unstructured data like text and images and turn it into structured data at unprecedented speed and scale. We continuously push the envelope on machine learning speed and scale with our bleeding-edge systems research. For years, we have been building systems and applications that involve billions of webpages, thousands of machines, and terabytes of data. It's unclear what Apple plans to do with the technology; however, speculation is that Apple may use it to help its AI efforts.

My old man has a iPhone 5s and BT's his hearing aids to it, at times the audio is extremely poor but by switching to the phones loud speaker or back to the phone instantly rectifies the issue. Reading up on this I found that BT 4.0 and LTE do not play nicely with each other, and that BT 4.2 is different and fixes the problems. Looking at the specs of the iPhone 5s,6(s) and 7 models it show the first two have BT 4.0 were the 7 has 4.2, speaking with apple support they tell me that by updating the 5s and 6 models to IOS 10 will upgrade the BT to BT 4.2 thus fixing the poor audio issue experienced with the hearing aids. My question, is this a true statement or am I been given incorrect information? as further reading, apple may be half right in that the latest update provides the BT 4.2 features but to fully take advantage of the features the hardware must also be the newer 4.2 compliment chip. Please help as I do no not want to tell the old man to go out and spend $1200 if he doesn't have to. RunningMan 4144 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 1087   Reply # 1781833 14-May-2017 08:15 Not sure if it helps you, but I was chasing a Bluetooth issue with Apple hardware recently. The issue was the reliability of personal hotspot using bluetooth (tethering). In short, BT tethering from an iPhone SE to an older Macbook Pro was very flaky, wouldn't stay connected for more than a minute or so. A backup of that phone restored to older iPhones (5s, 5c) worked flawlessly. All phones running iOS 10.3.1. Factory restore of the SE didn't resolve it. Hardware replacement of the SE also didn't resolve it.   I take from that there are some anomalies between hardware versions, and also that updating to the most recent iOS does not update the BT hardware on board the phone, even if it brings some of the new features.

Windows / Windows 10 on ARM: expect laptops, convertibles, more By Hadlee Simons on 13 May, 2017 Microsoft’s BUILD conference this week saw it deliver a variety of news. From Apple-style cross-device functionality to iTunes on the Windows Store, the company had no shortage of news to spare. The company has been rather quiet on the Windows 10 on ARM front since the initial announcement last year, but the conference saw Microsoft open up a bit in a pre-recorded video. So what did we learn? Only one chip for now? Microsoft reiterated that Windows 10 on ARM devices would be powered by Snapdragon processors. But more specifically, the company’s slides say that it will be the Snapdragon 835. There wasn’t any mention of other Snapdragon chips, so it looks like you’ll need top-flight silicon for now. Which means a budget price is probably out of the question. What form will these devices take? We all await a smartphone that can run legacy apps and full Windows 10 (or maybe it’s just me), but Microsoft hasn’t mentioned this just yet. What the company did however mention during the presentation was that we could expect ARM laptops and “two-in-one” convertible designs. It added that these devices would launch “later this year”. More proof of legacy apps working Back when Windows 10 on ARM was originally announced, Microsoft showed off full Photoshop and what appeared to be World of Tanks Blitz. Microsoft’s BUILD video also showed off a few more desktop apps, in the form of 7-zip and League of Legends. The former saw employees install the executable and run it to show that it was indeed a legacy app. Unfortunately, we didn’t actually see League of Legends running, merely being installed. How does it actually work? Microsoft’s employees also explained just how these legacy, unmodified apps work, saying that Windows 10 on ARM has an emulation layer. “x86 instructions are translated to ARM64 at runtime and cached on disk for faster use,” Microsoft explained. Check out a more detailed overview of the process in the image above. Apps obtained from the Windows Store use ARM packages where available though, ostensibly to skip the emulation bits. USB peripherals seem to work like normal It’s the full Windows 10 experience, right? So you’d expect your USB-based gadgets to work just fine. This does indeed seem to be the case, as Microsoft demoed a USB camera on an ARM-based Windows 10 machine, with “no drivers needed”. More questions though The presentation did answer a couple of questions, but we do have a few more concerns and unanswered questions about Windows 10 on ARM devices. For one, we wonder about the price of these devices, especially given their use of flagship silicon. Speaking of silicon, we wonder whether more Snapdragon chips will be compatible, after all, we saw the Snapdragon 820 being demoed last year. What about the Snapdragon 600 series? Too slow? What about MediaTek and other ARM chip makers too? You’d think Microsoft would heavily lean on MediaTek to deliver cheap Windows 10 convertibles. And of course, there’s also the question of performance… We didn’t see League of Legends and other games running on the ARM reference device. We aren’t expecting crazy performance, but will this be enough for light gaming? Finally, there’s the Windows Phone question. It seems like Microsoft is slowly working towards making its next phone compatible with Windows 10 in full. Combined with Continuum for Phones and it seems like Microsoft’s Surface Phone is closer than ever, yet so far away.

View all images Apple's iPhones are a big business in China. So big that an alleged supplier of knock-off iPhones in the country produced at least 40,000 units, before local police shut down the massive operation. Beijing authorities have arrested nine suspects, and confiscated over 1,400 fake handsets of different brands, as part of an investigation into the supplier, the city's police force announced on Sunday. The supplier, based in Beijing, allegedly established one of the largest knock-off phone operations found in recent years, according to the police. Since January, the supplier produced over 41,000 fake iPhones, along with 66,000 smartphone circuit boards, for a value of over US$19.7 million. In addition to smartphones, the supplier had also manufactured over a million imitation handset accessory units. Beijing police began its investigation after a batch of fake smartphones were found shipped to the U.S. Chinese authorities then found that a 43-year-old man, surnamed Yu, and his wife had set up a factory in Beijing back in 2011, geared toward electronics repair. The factory employed hundreds of people, and was specialized in taking discarded motherboards from old phones, and then repackaging them into new casings, for sale as knock-off handsets. Large quantities of these old motherboards came from outside China. To supply the casings, the factory relied on material shipped in from the Chinese city of Shenzhen that was labeled with brand names. These fake phones were then exported to foreign countries, the police added. The knock-off operation goes to show the large scale of the fake smartphone business in the country. China is not only a major producer of handsets, but it's also a major site for the world's electronic waste, with shipments of discarded products coming from across the world. Since April, Beijing police has stepped up its enforcement of intellectual property, although knock-off products have long been a staple in China's electronics markets. At the same time, local suppliers in the country have also been seeking to cash in on the iPhone's popularity. Both new iPhones, and even older ones are in demand. In Shenzhen, for instance, an entire mall has been set up devoted to selling secondhand iPhones that are refurbished for resale.

Leadership Search Search Best CompaniesThe Starbucks App Might Be Easier to Hack Than You Think Most Powerful WomenFacebook Pulls Abortion Group Page for ‘Encouragement of Drug Use’—Then Reverses BitcoinWhy Bitcoin’s Price Has Been Surging and Where It Could Go From Here PointCloudApple Just Acquired This Little-Known Artificial Intelligence Startup wechat CEO Daily: Saturday May 13th claychandler May 13, 2017 I spent most of last week in Guangzhou with Time Inc. colleagues making arrangements for December's Fortune Global Forum. On Thursday, we stopped by WeChat, the popular messaging app developed by Tencent Holdings. I came away marveling anew at the pace and scale of technological innovation in China. You can tell WeChat isn't a typical Chinese company from the moment you set foot on its campus in Guangzhou Creative Park, a cluster of old textile factories redesigned by U.S. architecture firm M Moser Associates. The space exudes confidence and cool. WeChat is less an app than an operating system--and one that, since its launch in 2011, has become so ubiquitous and indispensable to Chinese consumers that it verges on a way a life. The list of things you can do with it is staggering: trade text and voice messages; create group chats; hail a taxi or ride-share; play video games; read the news; download emojis; make travel arrangements; order dumplings; pay the corner fruit-vendor; find a date; get rid of your acne; cure your hiccups; raise your IQ. Well, okay, those last few are debatable, but the other stuff is only the beginning. WeChat is emerging as China's One App to Rule Them All. At the end of 2016, WeChat claimed 890 million active users, more than half of whom were logged into WeChat more than 90 minutes a day. (Just to put that in context: Facebook and Facebook Messenger, the two most popular apps in the United States, have a total of 275 million active users, according to Nielsen. Instagram, which Facebook owns, adds only another 74 million.) WeChat's size, efficiency and creativity make it a formidable force, and not just within China. In a recent post on Strategery.com, Ben Thompson argued WeChat poses a long-term problem for Apple, the only major U.S. tech company to have succeeded in cracking the China market. In the U.S., consumers are willing to pay more for iPhones not just because for the device itself but for the superior quality of its operating system. In China, the operating system that matters is WeChat, which works fine on iPhones. Unfortunately for Apple, WeChat works just as well on cheaper Android phones, which means, says Thompson, that Chinese consumers face "no penalty to switching away from an iPhone." Apple's China sales fell 14% in the last quarter compared to a year earlier. In 2016, its China market share fell to 9.6%, from 13.6% the year before. Many analysts think WeChat's share of China's mobile payment market will soon overtake that of Alibaba Group's Alipay. In just the past two years, WeChat's share of the mobile payment market has more than quadrupled to 37%, while that of Alipay has tumbled to 54%, down from 79%. Together the two tech giants control nine out of every ten renminbi Chinese consumers spent using their phones last year. And that was a lot of renminbi: In 2016, the value of China's third-party mobile payments surged to $5.5 trillion, according to China-based forecaster iResearch. That's 50 times the size of the U.S. mobile payments market, which Forrest Research estimates at $112 billion. The battle between Tencent and Alibaba is spilling beyond China's borders. Earlier this week, Tencent announced a partnership between WeChat and Silicon Valley startup Citcon to roll out a cashless payment service for Chinese travelers in the United States. WeChat now offers cashless payment in 15 other countries, including Japan and Singapore. Alipay offers cashless payment in 26 countries. In the past month, Ant Financial, Alibaba Group's financial services arm, announced a tie-up between Alipay and U.S. card processing service First Data, and offered $1.2 billion to acquire MoneyGram, the U.S.-based cross-border payments. The two giants waged a similar slugfest in the ride-sharing sector, with Tencent-backed Didi Dache squaring off against Alibaba-backed Kuaidi Dache. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on promotions and rebates until agreeing in 2015 on a "strategic merger." The new company, Didi Chuxing, turned its combined firepower on Travis Kalanick's Uber, which surrendered and exited China last summer. This year, the war between Tencent and Alibaba has erupted on a new front: bike-sharing. Tencent-backed Mobike (which uses WePay), and Alibaba-backed Ofo (which uses Alipay) dominate the sector. I saw evidence of the bike battle everywhere on the streets of Guangzhou this week. Mobike's orange bikes seemed to outnumber Ofo's yellow ones. But the colors are misleading: at the parent level, orange is Alibaba's color, while WeChat's is green. Reuters and Quartz offer good dispatches from the front lines. The two titans have taken their fight to Singapore and San Francisco, and are headed for the United Kingdom. What fascinates me is that in all three of these sectors--mobile payments, ride-hailing, and bike-sharing--Chinese tech firms aren't just innovators, they're innovation leaders, and the competition with each other for domination in their home market has unleashed a scramble to conquer markets overseas. Enjoy your weekend. More China links below. [ceo_attribution author="Clay Chandler" email=”clay.chandler@timeinc.com" twitter="clay chandler"] Politics and Policy Is China "bent on world domination"? Washington Post Editorial Page editor Fred Hiatt thinks so, "but not with missiles and aircraft carriers but by controlling solar energy, cloud computing and other industries of the future."  He credits this bleak vision to the American Chamber of Commerce in China, which sent a delegation to Washington recently to warn that "China's aggressive mercantilist policies are one of the most serious threats facing the future of U.S. technology sectors." Hiatt quotes veteran China hand James MacGregor as saying China's goal is nothing sort of "domination of the industries of the future." That's an amazing reversal. I used to cover economic policy for the Post. I remember MacGregor bringing the AmCham China delegation to the paper and telling us that he was hopeful about the U.S. - China relationship and that the best way to strengthen it was to admit China to the World Trade Organization.  The Washington Post U.S sends a delegation to China's "New Silk Road" summit: Trump has dispatched a team led by White House senior adviser Matt Pottinger to Beijing t0 attend the "One Belt, One Road" summit, China's biggest diplomatic gathering of the year. Some analysts see China's Belt and Road initiative as an effort to use infrastructure programs to counter U.S. global influence in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Pottinger, a fluent Mandarin speaker who tangled with  Chinese security police during his years as a Beijing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, has been a pointed critic of China's authoritarian government in the past. Reuters U.S. strikes a watered-down trade deal with China. The Trump administration struck a set of trade deals with China in electronic payments, beef and poultry, but side-stepped larger issues that might have complicated relations between the two countries at a time when Trump is hoping to enlist Xi Jinping's help in containing the nuclear threat in North Korea. The deals will allow Chinese companies to export cooked poultry products and promise China access to liquified natural gas from the U.S. There were no agreements on steel, aluminum, auto parts or the sort of technology issues raised by the American Chamber of Commerce in China.  New York Times Trump's lonely trade warrior. The Wall Street Journal's Bob Davis says Trump hawkish trade advisor Peter Navarro is still pushing for concessions from China and Mexico even though his boss says he no longer thinks China is a currency manipulator and has abandoned his threats to slap steep tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump decided last month to scrap the National Trade Council, the agency he created for Navarro to run, and has replaced it with Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. Navarro declined to respond to suggestions he's been marginalized. "I don't worry about getting outmaneuvered. I just worry about getting things done."  The Wall Street Journal  Technology and Innovation Is Tesla building a factory in China? Guangdong's local newspaper, the Southern Metropolis Daily, citing multiple sources, said the electric vehicle maker is planning to build a factory in the province. The paper reported that the factory site has been chosen and "the plan is waiting for approval from [the] relevant department in local government." Tesla denied the report. Elon Musk made an unexpected visit to China in late April, and met with vice premier Wang Yang, one of the country's top economic officials. Musk has predicted China could eventually become China's biggest market. In March, Tencent paid $1.78 billion to secure a 5% stake in Tesla.  CNBC Chinese engineers offer to build Trump's wall in less than a year and for 60% less. Ma Yihe, founder and chairman of WinSun, a construction company based in China's Jiangsu province, tells South China Morning Post contributor Zigor Almada that 3-D printing techniques to could dramatically shorten construction time and lower costs of Trump's promised wall along the U.S.'s southern border with Mexico. South China Morning Post Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, May 14, 2017 - Page 16　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple gives US$200m for phone glass LOOKING FORWARD:The investment in Corning points to a partnership between the two companies to develop other, unforeseen uses for the glass, a consultant said NY Times News Service, SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc is seeding the next generation of US-made glass for its iPhones and iPads, and its investments might have the side benefit of helping the company win favor in Washington. Apple on Friday announced that it was giving US$200 million to Corning Inc, which makes the tough, scratch-resistant face for every iPhone and iPad, to support the glass maker’s efforts to develop and build more sophisticated products at its factory in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Corning has made the glass for every iPhone since the original 10 years ago. Apple’s investment, the first from the technology giant’s US$1 billion fund to promote advanced US manufacturing, would help Corning develop thinner, more versatile glass for iPhones as well as other product lines that Apple is exploring, such as screens for self-driving cars and augmented reality glasses. The move goes beyond Apple’s traditional practice of subsidizing suppliers, said Tim Bajarin, president of the technology consulting firm Creative Strategies. “I would see this more as an Apple-Corning partnership to flesh out what other kinds of things you would use glass for,” he said. “They are literally thinking about stuff you and I aren’t thinking about yet.” The investment is also a goodwill gesture toward Republicans, including US President Donald Trump, who has criticized Apple for building its iPhones in China, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who represents Kentucky. Apple said it spent US$50 billion last year with US suppliers, although it manufactures just one product line, the nearly obsolete Mac Pro, in the US. Apple has accumulated more cash than any other company in the US — US$257 billion as of April 1 — and virtually all of it is stashed untaxed in foreign bank accounts. Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook has repeatedly complained that US taxes are too high and has vowed not to bring the cash home until taxes are cut. Last month, Trump sketched out a plan to slash overall corporate tax rates and perhaps offer companies a special break for bringing back profits held overseas. Underscoring the political implications of the Apple-Corning deal, McConnell joined executives from the two companies at the formal announcement at the 65-year-old plant on Friday afternoon. “Like millions of people around the world, the last thing I look at at night and the first thing I look at in the morning is my iPhone,” McConnell said. “Unlike millions of people around the world, I think of Harrodsburg, Kentucky, and this amazing Gorilla Glass that you guys make here.” McConnell said there was a lot that Congress could do to help Corning and Apple be even more successful. “We are going to try, through comprehensive tax reform, to make both of these corporations be in a better position to compete with other companies in other countries,” he said. Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams said that when Apple founder Steve Jobs showed a prototype of the first iPhone on stage in 2007, it had a hard plastic face. Jobs complained that it scratched too easily in his pocket and ordered Williams to replace it with scratch-proof, shatter-resistant glass by the time the phone went on sale six months later. Such glass did not exist except in the lab, but Corning scrambled to get it into production. “It all happened here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you,” Williams told the assembled workers.

Your iPhone doesn’t swell like an overstuffed photo album if you keep all those blurry photos that would be better off consigned to the dustbin of history. Camera capabilities have improved steadily over time, radically increasing storage requirements. Did you ever think you’d be able to shoot high-definition video on something like an iPhone? Thanks to the increased space requirements of photos and videos, our iPhones and iPads, not to mention some Macs, can’t handle the size of our photo libraries. We want to access our photos and videos from any of our devices, at any time, and have any edits we make reflected everywhere. iCloud Photo Library is Apple’s solution to these issues. There are competing options, such as Google Photos, Lightroom mobile, Mylio, and Amazon Prime Photos (all explained in Jeff Carlson’s “Take Control of Your Digital Photos on a Mac”), but the idea behind all of them is basically the same: Provide more space to store our photos and videos in the cloud Allow us to access these photos and videos from any of our devices This cloud-based approach has a couple of welcome byproducts. Although it shouldn’t be seen as the backup, a cloud-based photo library certainly does provide another copy of everything in a location that’s safe from fire, flood, or theft. Also, sharing photos with family and friends becomes a bit easier. If you decide to use iCloud Photo Library, here are four things to think about before you flip that switch and turn it on. Cull Photos First… Or Not -- Many of the features of Apple’s Photos app — automatic albums like Selfies and Screenshots, facial recognition, Memories, and searching for photos by generic categories like Mountains or Snow — eliminate much of the tedium of organizing photos and help us avoid throwing things away. After all, why toss any photos when Photos can organize most of them automatically for later reference? It’s much more fun to keep shooting than to engage in the chore of trashing photos that, upon further review, you’d be ashamed to admit you took. How does this apply to iCloud Photo Library? If you have time now, you might want to delete unnecessary photos like the eight nearly identical photos I apparently just took of my sleeping cat (who, like most sleeping cats, didn’t move the entire time). That will reduce the upload and download times for iCloud. On the other hand, if you’re thinking that it would be way more fun to clean up your photo collection while lounging on the couch with your iPad in the future, just leave all the cruft in place for now — you can always trash it later. Start with the Host with the Most -- It may take quite a bit of time to upload all your photos and videos to your iCloud Photo Library: days or even weeks, depending on your upstream Internet speed and how many photos and videos you have. In my case, the vast majority of my several thousand photos and videos were stored on my Mac. Many were duplicated on my iPad and iPhone because I had manually synced them there at some point in the past. So I started with the Mac, and even with the library culling that I performed, it still took several days to finish. But there are plenty of people who have all or most of their photos on an iPhone or iPad, or maybe don’t even own a Mac. If you’re in that situation, start from the device that contains most of your photos and videos. Once that first upload is done, you can repeat the process with your other devices. Happily, to make sure you don’t chew through your monthly data limit uploading photos, iOS devices won’t upload to the iCloud Photo Library using a cellular connection, just via Wi-Fi. If you find your Mac or iOS device is getting bogged down, or your Internet connection has slowed considerably as a result of all the uploading, you can pause the upload. It will resume automatically after a day, or you can start it again manually before bed. On the Mac the Pause button is in Photos > Preferences > iCloud; in iOS look for it in Settings > Photos & Camera. Optimize Photos Where Appropriate -- iCloud Photo Library always stores your photos and videos in the cloud at their original full resolutions. But you likely don’t have enough space on your iPhone or iPad, or even possibly on a MacBook Air, to store all that data. That’s why Apple gives you the option to instead store “optimized” versions (small thumbnails) on any of your devices. When you want to work with an optimized photo, Photos downloads the original. Think carefully about where you store full-resolution and optimized versions of photos. I opted for optimized copies on my iPhone and iPad, but I chose to keep the full-resolution versions on my Mac. The Mac is where I tend to exercise my meager photo-editing skills, and I would prefer not to wait for each photo to download before I edit it. In addition, I back up my Mac both locally via Time Machine and via the online service Backblaze, which puts my full photo library in four different places — iCloud Photo Library, my Mac’s drive, my Time Machine backup drive, and Backblaze. Should disaster strike, I’m confident that I won’t lose any precious photos. Space Is Money -- My Photo Stream was Apple’s initial foray into syncing a limited number of user photos via the cloud, and the photos it syncs do not count against an iCloud account’s storage limits (it doesn’t even work with videos). In contrast, all the photos and videos in iCloud Photo Library do count against that storage limit. A free iCloud account gives you 5 GB to get started. But, particularly if you’re backing up an iOS device or two, a photo library of any decent size won’t come close to fitting in that space. Fortunately, Apple notifies you before you start uploading if your iCloud account needs more storage space, and you can buy additional iCloud storage at a relatively low cost: $0.99 per month for 50 GB, $2.99 for 200 GB, $9.99 for 1 TB, or $19.99 for 2 TB. In my case, I only needed to do a little bit of editing to whittle my photo library down so it was comfortably below the 50 GB mark, giving me some room for short-term growth and saving me a couple of bucks a month. For me, it wasn’t worth paying for the extra space up front with an eventual goal of taming the photo library later, especially since I hadn’t been especially motivated to do so for several years. In addition, there are three other members of my family with their own iCloud accounts, so walking the talk was a factor in my decision. That said, most people probably can’t drop their library size significantly enough to fit comfortably into a lower pricing tier. And remember, at 2–3 MB per iPhone photo, library size can grow quickly. Still, there’s no reason to pay more than necessary; Apple will happily tell you if you need to upgrade again in the future. Annoyingly, there’s no way to buy iCloud storage for a year at a time, so you’ll be getting and accounting for a small iCloud storage payment every month no matter what. Flip the Switch -- Once you’ve thought about these things and are ready to go, turn on iCloud Photo Library in Photos > Preferences > iCloud on the Mac, or in Settings > Photos & Camera in iOS. Then reward yourself with a favorite beverage, particularly if you’ve done any pruning of your photo library. While you wait for your photos to upload, which will take days or even weeks, you can still use your Mac or iOS device normally. Do not stare at the progress count or try to second-guess what’s happening. And in particular, do not turn iCloud Photo Library off and back on, since that will force the system to evaluate every photo again, slowing the process further. Just let it run and it will finish eventually. In the meantime, can I recommend a relaxing hobby that will get you away from the screen, like maybe photography?   READERS LIKE YOU!

Our son loaded a lot of high res photos of our grandson on his mother's computer not knowing we had iCould photo library turned on. Before we realized what was happening we burned through our monthly data cap in a week. Reply Cheesehead Dave  2017-05-11 11:21 I learned this the hard way. We took a trip to Disney and got the photo package where they give you full resolution files for all the character and ride photos that get taken for you over your trip. In the end, we had about 300 pictures. I downloaded them all and added them to iPhoto which then got to work re-uploading them to iCloud. My Mac was unusable for two days. Reply Lee  2017-05-11 13:43 I run into this all the time...I snap away knowing I'm only going to keep about one out of ten of the photos. So what I now do is to download from my DSLR not into Photos but using Image Capture. That gives me the opportunity to go through them with a quick once-over, delete the ones I'm not going to keep, and then import the rest into Photos. I don't have to make painstaking decisions...I can make those later. Just get rid of the ones that at a glance I can get rid of. Reply Mike Matthews   2017-05-11 14:46 This is a good thing to remember (and monitor) *after* you turn on iCloud Photo Library. Reply Mike Matthews   2017-05-11 14:47 Good idea--reviewing via Image Capture, I mean. Reply Dave Edwards  2017-05-13 21:25 Image Capture, the unsung hero of Mac photo management. Reply Scott Rose  2017-05-11 12:29 The biggest problem with how Apple designed iCloud Photo Library is that even if you choose to optimize images, it still requires your device to show ALL THE THUMBNAIL IMAGES FOR ALL 100% OF YOUR IMAGES. Why? Because iCloud Photo Library always requires you to DISPLAY ALL 100% OF YOUR IMAGES ON EVERY DEVICE. You are NEVER allowed to show just a SUBSET of your images. Therefore, people with smaller capacity iPhones or iPads (such as 16 GB or 32 GB devices) WILL STILL RUN OUT OF SPACES ON THEIR DEVICES... even if they turn on optimize images. The ideal solution from Apple would be to let people store ALL 100% of their images in the cloud, but only display a subset of images on their devices. As it stands now, if you dare try to remove an image from your device, it gets deleted everywhere. Apple really needs to rethink this entire thing from the ground up. Reply Twisell  2017-05-11 12:54 BUT THUMBNAILS IMAGES ARE SMALL not like your CAPS LOCK Reply Charles Jacobs  2017-05-12 09:24 1. It gets better - if you took a picture yesterday that you want to share - boom - already a thumbnail - so if you are at a low bandwidth area SOL 2. He didn't use cap lock - he used caps - because he really was shouting. 3. Thumbnails are more problem than solution. Reply Michel Hedley  2017-05-11 20:50 Don't do it. Don't use iCloud to store images and vids. There are too many disaster stories that cannot be ignored. Apple has never 'got' cloud. It is disappointing that this story did not point out all the downsides using iCloud to store your digital images. Reply Simon   2017-05-13 11:49 I'm still using My Photo Stream. It allows me to easily get photos from my iPhone to my Mac, but it doesn't interfere with originals, it doesn't hog bandwidth, and it doesn't cost anything. On the Mac I then select, edit, and make albums that then get synced back to the iPhone and iPad. It's a barebones solution, but it's simple, free, and works most of the time - and when it doesn't it's because Apple doesn't get the cloud and there you're no better off with iCloud Photo Library. Reply James Katt  2017-05-13 19:45 iCloud Photo Library is useless to me because I have over 4TB of photos. I find it far more useful to store backups of my photos on Amazon Drive which has unlimited Storage for only $60 a year. I currently have 16 TB stored on my Amazon drive using Arq to do the backup. I upload photos also to Amazon Drive's photo folder so it can be accessible to all my devices. This includes backups from my iPhones. Again Amazon gives you unlimited storage. ODrive app will sync whatever folders you want on your Mac and Amazon drive.

The app is the most searched for app in the store, but is currently only available to download from the main Apple website. Microsoft says that the Windows Store version of iTunes will be able to do everything the regular version does, including accessing the iTunes Store and Apple Music and supporting syncing for iPhones and iPads. At this point, it’s possible to use iPhones and iPads without ever touching iTunes, but you can still use the app to perform software updates, make encrypted local backups, and do general app and data management. One of the most important aspects of iTunes from an e-reading perspective is the ability to upload PDF and EPUB books to your iPad or iPhone and then use iBooks to read everything. The Windows Store is a big priority with Microsoft. Not only have they finally secured Apple to allow their app to be downloaded on a competing platform, but Redmond company announced that Spotify, SAP Boardroom, and Autodesk are all coming to its Store later this year.

Both headphones feature the flexible, contoured neckband popularized by Apple’s latest headphones, and both come with the usual slate of midrange headphone specs including aptX, noise isolation, and 12 hours of playback. The MA650 features a 380.1 dynamic driver while there is a 560.1 dynamic driver in the MA750 (as well as over-the-ear hooks), likely making up for the $70 price difference. The MA650 will cost $99 and the MA750 will come in at $169 — more expensive than the Beats X which seems like a mistake — when they are released later this summer.

When Steve Jobs came back to Apple and introduced their 'Think Different' ad campaign, he was determined to kill off the stuffy business suit forever in the tech community. He made wearing jeans and sneakers the cool look that has changed the way Silicon Valley keynotes are delivered forever. The graphic below makes that point crystal clear with Steve Jobs from 1998 through to 2010.   Apple CEO Tim Cook   Apple's current CEO Tim Cook obviously carries on tradition with his Nike shoes, jeans and black T-Shirt. His runners cost a modest $75.Though for keynotes, Cook like to wear a different style of shirt. At times he like to wear Lanvin shoes as noted here.   Microsoft's CEO this week at Build 2017   Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella reportedly wears the French upscale Lanvin Suede runners going for $495. Nadella wore them for the opening keynote at their Build 2017 developer conference earlier this week. Below are photos of Microsoft VP's Joe Belfiore and Terry Myerson in Jeans and sneakers that likewise delivered segments at Build 2017.      Google's CEO Sundar Pichai   Google's CEO Sundar Pichai loves his Lanvin shoes as well as does Alphabet's CEO Larry Page.   Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg   Facebook's CEO also has the Steve Jobs look at keynotes wearing everyday Nike runners.   What are the runners of choice from the Silicon Valley elite?

The 10.5-inch iPad is said to be similar in size to the 9.7-inch iPad but with smaller bezels. Kuo believes there is a greater than 70% chance it will be unveiled at the developer conference. "The newly designed 10.5” iPad Pro will have a similar form factor to the 9.7” model, but will feature a larger display thanks to narrow bezels. The new design should improve the user experience and help gain traction in the corporate/ commercial sectors. We forecast 10.5” iPad shipments of 5.0-6.0mn units in 2017F, accounting for 15% of total 2017F iPad shipments." As previously noted, Kuo thinks that there is a greater than 50% chance Apple will unveil a Siri smart speaker at WWDC to rival the Amazon Echo. The speaker could launch later in the year giving developers time to support the product. Kuo believes it will include a touch panel display, similar to the Echo Show. "In our April 28 Insight report (“Apple’s first home AI product to see cyclical shipments of over 10mn units; main competitor is Amazon Echo”), we offered estimates for the new home AI/ Siri speaker line. We also believe this new product will come with a touch panel." Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates ahead of WWDC in June.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) added $7.14 last week (4.8%), posting a new 52-week high on Friday. The company remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 34.78% year to date, well above second-place McDonald’s 19.42% improvement. Apple reported fiscal second-quarter results two weeks ago, with earnings per share totaling $2.10 and revenues totaling $52.9 billion, pretty much in line with estimates of $2.02 in earnings per share and $52.97 billion in revenues. In the same period last year, Apple reported earnings per share of $1.90 and revenues of $50.56 billion. Last week, the company said it would pay its regular $0.63 quarterly dividend on May 18. Apple said its total dividend payment for the quarter amounts to $3.0 billion, slightly below the $3.1 billion the company paid out in dividends in the prior three quarters. In addition to dividend payments, Apple repurchased $7 billion worth of its own stock during the quarter. The company also reported $99 billion in total debt at the end of the second quarter. And that raises the question of why a company with more than $250 billion in cash needs to borrow money to pay $10 billion out to shareholders. The answer, of course, is taxes. Most of Apple’s cash pile is held overseas and, under U.S. law, would be taxed if the company brought the money back into the country. That’s a whole story in itself. Apple, and other companies like Alphabet that also keep large stores of cash offshore, often borrow to pay dividends because money is cheap, particularly if the company has a market cap of $800 billion and is the most valuable private-sector company in the world. Last Thursday, Apple issued $7 billion in new bonds with floating interest rates and maturing dates between 2020 and 2027. Like the rest of the cash-rich U.S. firms, Apple is waiting for the president to make good on his promise to lower corporate tax rates and, perhaps, even a one-time tax holiday on repatriated funds. Apple shares closed at $156.10 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $90.00 to $156.42. The consensus 12-month price target is $153.96, in a price target range of $104 to $202 per share. And see our story on why Merrill Lynch raised its price target on Apple last week.

The latest one to watch out for is the new text scam which aims to access the personal data of iPhone owners. Scammers are reportedly sending text messages to users requesting their personal information. It begins with a personalised text from a number purporting to be "iSupport" and warns owners their iCloud account has been deactivated. IN OTHER NEWS: How to always pick the fastest queue in the supermarket It then asks unwitting users to head to a website, where they can re-enter their personal details. The message adds: "To reactivate your account confirm your details here". The text links to a fake Apple login page that asks for an Apple ID and password. But, according to the Birmingham Mail, Apple Support have confirmed that this is not a message it would send out. Apple is now telling device owners who have received the message to report it as Junk and contact their network provider. The Birmingham Mail said the US tech giant also confirmed to its customers that it will never ask users to provide personal information or sensitive details via text message or email. "You should never enter your Apple account information on any non-Apple website," added the company.

(AMZN) Echo Speaker’s Alexa Skills Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) First Advanced Manufacturing Fund Investment Goes to Corning The Tesla Inc (TSLA) Solar Roof Is Available … And Cheaper! View All Posts This is a very high profile time for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Alexa smart assistant/Echo smart speaker combination. The latest new Amazon Echo — the Echo Show — has just been announced. Plus, Alexa voice calling just launched. Source: Amazon This comes just weeks after the Echo Look was unveiled. Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Google and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are now in the smart speaker game, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to take the wraps off a Siri speaker as soon as June. With this flurry of activity, it’s worth looking at the Amazon Echo’s biggest advantage: the thousands of Alexa skills. These capabilities let AMZN and third-party developers add functionality to the Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled smart speakers. There are currently more than 10,000 Alexa skills, and here are 10 of the coolest. The Smart Home AMZN currently lists nearly 400 Alexa smart home skills. One of the most popular lets your Amazon Echo control Google’s Nest smart thermostat with voice commands. You can also use Alexa to control the popular Hue smart lighting system. You can tell your Amazon Echo to turn lights on or off in specific rooms, change the color and even adjust brightness, all without picking up a smartphone, touching a switch or launching an app. Social Media Thanks to Alexa, AMZN can make interacting with your social media feeds a hands-free task. You can’t view Instagram photos (although that will undoubtedly come when the Echo Show hits shelves), but Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) and the rest are represented through third-party Alexa skills. You can use Twitter Reader to have your Amazon Echo read out loud key information including Twitter Likes, Retweets, Mentions and Trending Tweets. Want to get the latest words of wisdom from President Trump? Ask your Echo to check POTUS Tweets. Utilities Find Phone is one of those skills that everyone can use. It solves the issue of misplacing your smartphone in the couch cushions by having your Amazon Echo call the phone to activate its ringer. Having trouble sleeping? Skills like Ambient Noise: Rainforest Sounds will play soothing tracks in the background to drown out all the noise and help you nod off.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Goldman Sachs Says iPhone 8 Will Cost $1,000 Denisse Moreno International Business Times May 12, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share A group known as the Turkish Crime Family has reportedly received its requested ransom and will no longer carry out a purported attack that would have erased millions of iOS devices associated stolen iCloud accounts.More If you want to buy the upcoming iPhone 8, you might want to start saving up. Goldman Sachs says Apple’s 20th anniversary iPhone will cost $1,000, according to CNBC. Goldman Sachs is recommending clients buy Apple shares because the upcoming expensive iPhone 8 will drive earnings above expectations. Read: iPhone 8 To Get LG Facial Recognition System Module For 3D Front-Facing Camera "The first $1,000 iPhone can drive meaningful upside," analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a note to clients Thursday, according to CNBC. "The bottom line is that we are raising our FY18/19 EPS estimates further above consensus. … While our FY18 iPhone unit estimate is relatively in-line (GSe 243mn vs. consensus at 242mn), we see significant upside in iPhone ASPs [average selling prices]." She said Apple’s upcoming iPhone will feature a 5.8-inch OLED display and 3D sensing with augmented reality capabilities. Jankowski said Apple could release a 128GB iPhone 8 for $999 and a 256GB version for $1,099. Goldman Sachs also predicts the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch bezel less OLED screen, better and faster NAND/DRAM memory, A11 processor, no home button and expects the device to come with biometric authentication, Business Insider reported. "We think the higher demand for the larger (5.8") form factor will be supported by the fact that the iPhone 8 will have compelling new features not available in the smaller form factors," she added. The high price of the iPhone 8 had been rumored before earlier this year. The iPhone 8 will reportedly get a memory boost compared to last year’s generation, which could be a reason why the 10th anniversary iPhone might cost more than $1,000 (memory is pretty expensive right now). The $1,000 price wouldn’t be a huge surprise, since Apple already sells the iPhone 7 Plus with 256 GB, which costs $969, and over $1,000 if you add the $129 AppleCare plan. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date: Apple Could Launch Device In October, According To Supply Chain Reports iPhone 8 Rumors, Features, Leaks The iPhone 8 is rumored to come with numerous technologies, including an embedded Touch ID feature and wireless charging. The 10th anniversary iPhone will reportedly come with a vertical dual-camera system, different from how the camera system is positioned on the iPhone 7 Plus. A recently leaked schematic of the iPhone 8 showed a spot for a vertical dual-camera and a circular hole underneath the log. The iPhone 8, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, is also rumored to come with True Tone display, which can adjust the color and intensity of the smartphone’s display based on the environment. The iPhone 8 is expected to be released this fall alongside the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, however some reports have suggested the 10th anniversary iPhone could be delayed or face severe supply shortages.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) to put some of its billions upon billions of dollars to use might be disappointed to find out the Cupertino-based company didn't buy a Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) or a Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS)-type of company. Instead, Apple quietly acquired a sleep monitoring app and device called Beddit. In fact, news of the acquisition was made public when Beddit updated its privacy policy on its website to state it had been bought out by Apple. Beddit also stated users' personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with Apple's privacy policy. According to a CNBC report, Beddit's old webpage linked to its Apple Watch applications appear to have been taken down. Apple Wants Information It is clear Apple bought access to sleep-related data, likely for its own health and wellness initiatives. Apple will gain access to Beddit's users who track not only basic sleep data but more complex aspects of sleep, such as heart rate and respiratory data. Apple may be looking to target the 50 to 70 million adults in the U.S. alone who have sleep or wakefulness disorders.

This feature had been strongly linked with the Galaxy S8 earlier this year, but Samsung decided against including it in its flagship smartphone. This would seem to be a wise move, as it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Korean corporation to distinguish between its two main device ranges. Media in Samsung’s native South Korea has reported that the consumer electronics giant is already preparing to include dual-camera technology in the Galaxy Note 8. This comes just days after reports from East Asia indicated that Samsung will also be releasing a refurbished version of the Galaxy Note 7 as well. Clearly the company believes that there is still a great deal of mileage in this somewhat discredited product range. Image Credit: Ivo Maric / Concept Creator / YouTube video (screenshot) Galaxy Note 8: FinFET coming It is also likely that Samsung will include its 10nm FinFET LPP technology in the Galaxy Note 8, having outlined this technology in recent public statements. This reportedly delivers a 10 per cent performance increase and a further 15 per cent in efficiency. This could assist the Korean manufacturer in including a more powerful camera in the Galaxy Note 8, safe in the knowledge that it would be balanced out by this power-saving innovation. But it is debatable whether Samsung will increase the megapixel rating included in the Galaxy Note 8, as the corporation has instead concentrated on improving features rather than specs in recent releases. While many Samsung fans would probably welcome an increase in the 12-megapixel resolution included in the Galaxy Note 7, we should not expect this to be forthcoming. Photography has become increasingly important in the mobile space, and Samsung has earned its reputation as a particularly esteemed purveyor of this technology. Both the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series have performed particularly capably in photography in recent releases, and thus Samsung will be looking to build on this in order to stay ahead of the pack. This will require the Galaxy Note 8 to deliver some serious functionality, as some of Samsung‘s rivals are already being linked with some outstanding camera technology for 2017. This could see the Korean corporation particularly focused on virtual reality with its next generation phablet, as the dual-camera feature will enable this to be delivered. iPhone 8 VR focus While virtual reality has yet to become an entirely mainstream technology, the PlayStation VR headset has achieved significant market penetration, while the Oculus Rift project has also proved popular with PC users. This means that the time could be ideal for Samsung to move into the VR niche with the Note 8, particularly as it has already committed itself to this technology with the Gear VR headset. And murmurs from East Asia suggest that LG Innotek has acquired the order to supply the 3D facial recognition cameras that will be included in the iPhone 8. This latter whisper suggests that Apple will embrace the augmented technology that it has publicly expressed enthusiasm about previously. The CEO of the Californian company, Tim Cook, previously noted that Apple is excited about the potential of augmented reality, and that it fits with its goals for the iPhone range far more neatly than VR. Whether this will impact upon the quality and functionality of the iPhone 8 camera is debatable, but it is known that the supplier is already involved in the iPhone range by delivering the dual-lens camera modules for the iPhone 7 Plus. FunkyFocus / Pixabay New Facility But reports from Korea suggest that LG Innotek has set up this new facility because the modules included in the iPhone 8 will be both front-facing and smaller than the previous devices in the series. It is also notable that 3D facial recognition technology is significantly more sophisticated than its 2D equivalent, enabling much improved accuracy to be delivered. Apple is likely to be utilizing this 3D version of facial recognition as it will deliver a superior experience to the existing Galaxy S8. Many users have observed that the system can be relatively easily deceived, and Apple will clearly hope to resist this tendency with the dual-camera included in the iPhone 8. With the 3D modules included in the potential iPhone 8 camera, the security of this device will be greatly enhanced. This is bound to be emphasized in advertising for the iPhone 8, and the ball will be very much in Samsung’s courts to deliver something of the same quality and safety. Apple acquired Israeli startup RealFace in February, and ever since then it has been expected that the corporation would instigate some form of facial recognition in the near future. RealFace claims its algorithms can recognize faces with 99.67 per cent success rate, which significantly outperforms even the human eye. Technical issues This will certainly put pressure on Samsung, as the East Asian company has experienced technical issues with components related to its cameras previously. This inability to overcome those difficulties means that the Galaxy S8 featured almost exactly the same camera already included with the Galaxy S7 Edge, considered a disappointment by some Android users. However, it now seems likely that Samsung will have ironed out any dual-camera difficulties by the time that the Galaxy Note 8 is released. Images had been posted online ahead of the release of the Galaxy S8 suggesting that this device would feature a dual-lens camera, so it is obvious that the Korean corporation has been moving in this direction for some time. Yet reports have also suggested that Samsung will tease the dual-camera set up in the Galaxy Note 8 by including it in a Galaxy C release before the phablet arrives. This has been reported on by ValueWalk previously, and should it come to fruition then we will get a sneak preview of the dual-camera when the more affordable Galaxy C series arrives. This all adds up to an interesting year for smartphone cameras.

View all images Staff cuts at Lenovo and HTC, a failed patch from Google, and Samsung's latest flagship smartphones all highlight how tricky selling Android smartphones has become. Apple's stranglehold on the market for the most expensive smartphones have left most vendors in the Android camp scrambling to make a living off of cheaper devices with lower margins. Recent data from market research company IDC illustrates how Android is losing ground in the $600+ segment. Just 8 percent of smartphones sold during the second quarter was in this category, down from 11 percent in the same period last year, according to Francisco Jeronimo, research director at IDC. At the same time, 82 percent of iPhones fell into this category, up from 60 percent last year, he said. Samsung is still convinced it can make a mark in this segment of the market. Adding to its portfolio of high-end smartphones, it launched the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ at an event in New York on Thursday. Although the new products are very impressive, selling the tens of million units Samsung needs to make them a hit won't be easy. To an even larger extent than before, great products are no longer a guarantee for market success. "There is a general apathy towards new smartphones. Consumers just aren't as exited about the next big thing anymore. As far as they are concerned products have reached a level of maturity that's good enough," said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight. The cuts announced by HTC and Lenovo show just how ruthless the smartphone market has become. While HTC's struggles have been intensifying for a couple of years, Lenovo, helped by its acquisition of Motorola Mobility, seemed to be on the right track. But the second quarter painted a grim picture of its fortunes. While the overall market grew by just over 15 percent year-on-year, both Lenovo and Motorola shipped 32 percent fewer units, according to Strategy Analytics. The two have struggled with the transition from 3G to 4G smartphones in China and the U.S., it said. For example, Motorola never launched an LTE version of the second-generation Moto G in the U.S. The company finally launched a proper upgrade of the device last month along with new Moto X models. While the Moto G is the company's budget king, the new Moto X Pure (also known as the Style) is Motorola's take on what an Android-based high-end smartphone should cost and look like in 2015. The Moto X family is a perfect illustration of how the smartphone market has changed due to increasing competition. When Motorola launched the original model about two years ago, the 16GB version started at US$579.99, and last year the price for the second generation had dropped to $499.99. The Moto X Pure will go on sale next month, priced from $399.99. The new flagship isn't just cheaper, the smartphone also beats its predecessors in overall performance. So what's an Android smartphone vendor to do? Motorola is hoping the lower price of the new Moto X will help convince consumers to pick its flagship over Samsung's and Apple's much more expensive offerings. HTC, which is laying off 15 percent of its staff, is hoping to survive by expanding beyond smartphones. For its part, Lenovo said on Thursday it would cut 3,200 jobs and restructure its mobile business, with the aim of creating leaner and meaner company. To keep up, it will update its smartphones and add new models every six months, Lenovo said. If all this wasn't bad enough, manufacturers now have to take security vulnerabilities in Android seriously. Thanks to the operating system's enormous success, hackers looking to steal data or defraud users have increasingly targeted smartphones. Google will play a key role, but vendors have to get intimately involved to ensure their products are safe. Samsung and LG have said they are planning to push out patches monthly, and other vendors will have to follow in their footsteps sooner rather than later. This change will come with increased costs as well as the risk of alienating users if a patch fails or doesn't arrive soon enough. Highlighting how complicated this all is, Google had to release another patch to fix the Stagefright vulnerability after a security firm said the first one included a flaw. So if there is light at the end of the tunnel for the Android vendors, it's hard to find. There are exceptions: Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi, for example, can celebrate their second quarters, which were boosted by aggressively priced products that attract smartphone buyers in China. Huawei is also expanding rapidly across other parts of Asia, Europe and North America. In addition, smartphone sales are still growing, which is more than can be said for PCs and tablets. If there is a winner in all this doom and gloom it's consumers all over the world. Just a couple of years ago, smartphones for below $100 where bordering on unusable. That's no longer the case. At the same time, mid-range devices are becoming increasingly competent and high-end phones are reaching new engineering heights, even though improvements over previous generations are smaller than they used to be. But nothing lasts forever; if vendors start going of out business competition will decrease and that's never a good thing.

Al Sacco (CIO (US)) 14 August, 2015 01:23 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Exclusive Networks Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments The top of new S Pen also clicks in and out like a traditional ballpoint pen when it's removed, and though the feature doesn't do anything, it makes the stylus feel more like a real pen, which is a nice touch. View all images Samsung today showed the world its latest two "phablet" devices -- the Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 (GS6) edge+ -- at a press event in New York City. The stylus-, nay, S-Pen-equipped Note5 is the newest member of the popular Note family of phablets, and it follows the Note 4, which first hit the U.S. market last October. The curvy, sleek GS6 edge+ is an upsized evolution of the company's GS6 edge, which was released in the United States last April. The timing of Samsung's announcement not so coincidentally comes about a month before Apple's expected new iPhone unveil -- which should take place on or around Sept. 9 -- and the Korean electronics king is clearly hoping to draw attention away from Apple. Last week, I spent some time with both of the new Galaxy devices during a media event at New York's Soho Grand hotel. Though I didn't put the two phablets through all the paces, I had enough hands-on time to form some solid first impressions. A number of things -- both positive and negative -- stood out to me about the new Note5. What you'll like about the Galaxy Note5 In 2011, Samsung pioneered the modern phablet craze with the first Galaxy Note smartphone. Like the large siblings that came before it, the Note5's defining features are its massive, 5.7-inch screen and the S Pen stylus. While the Note5 didn't receive any significant screen enhancements over the Note 4, the S Pen sure did. Samsung says it dramatically improved the on-screen writing experience with the Note5, and though I didn't spend much time scribbling on its display, it did seem more responsive in my tests. It's also much easier to remove the S Pen from the device than in earlier versions. You no longer have to wedge a fingernail beneath the S Pen to yank it out; instead, you just push it inward, and a spring mechanism pops the pen out. The top of new S Pen also clicks in and out like a traditional ballpoint pen when it's removed, and though the feature doesn't do anything, it makes the stylus feel more like a real pen, which is a nice touch. The S pen itself is constructed of higher-end materials than past versions, and it feels better in hand -- again, more like an actual pen. And with the Note5, you can "write" directly on PDF files, a valuable new feature that could eliminate the need to print, sign and scan documents that need signatures. The Note5 features a new notebook function that lets you quickly jot notes on the screen as soon as you remove the S Pen -- the screen automatically turns black when you eject the pen while the device is locked or asleep, and you can immediately start taking notes. (You can disable this feature if you'd rather not use it.) Thanks to a new on-screen shortcut that's accessible via any app or screen when you're using the S Pen, you can quickly view your "Air Command" box, which provides shortcuts to frequently used apps. Air Command isn't new, but you used to have to hover over your display and then push a button on the pen to invoke it. The new shortcut makes it easy to access favorite features and functionality, and you can move it around the edges of your display to the position that works best for you. You can also remove the shortcut if you don't want or need it. The S Pen's new "scroll capture" feature grabs screen shots of full Web pages, instead of individual screens. You just initiate scroll capture via the settings menu, scroll with the S Pen to bottom of the page and choose the appropriate option to complete the action. The vertical page capture is saved as a .JPG file in your image gallery. Scroll capture is easy to use and it could come in handy when trying to grab an image of a long list of directions, or steps in any process or recipe, for example. The Note5, which runs Android 5.1 Lollipop, also has a brand new "Live Broadcast" feature built into its default camera. Instead of opening up your Meerkat or Periscope app to capture and broadcast video in real time, you can now just launch the Samsung camera app (front or back), enable the new mode and send live video to directly to your YouTube channel. I watched a live demo of the feature, but I didn't get to try it out for myself, so I can't say how well it works. It is, however, a unique addition to the Galaxy camera. The display on the Note5 shines, as expected. Samsung established itself as the star of the smartphone-screen space during the past few years, and the Note5 screen doesn't disappoint. However, it also didn't get an upgrade over the Note 4. Both the Note 4 and Note5 have 2560 x 1440-pixel quad HD, Super AMOLED displays at 518ppi. One of the most significant additions to the Note family is support for two wireless charging standards (Qi and PMA), which means you can use the majority of charging pads and wireless power accessories on the market today to power up the Note5. I've been using various wireless charging accessories with my GS6 edge since it launched last fall, and I'm a huge fan -- plugging cords directly into mobile devices already feels like an inconvenience. The new Note has a higher-quality, front-facing camera (5MP) than the Note 4 (3.7MP). Samsung also (finally) provided U.S. release date details (sort of) for its much-anticipated mobile payment service, Samsung Pay, and you will be able to use the Note5 to make contactless mobile payments at the majority of U.S. retail locations, using magnetic secure transmission (MST) or NFC, if the retailers have compatible contactless point-of-sale terminals. (Samsung should have a distinct advantage over Apple Pay, thanks to the MST support.) The new mobile payment service will be officially released in the United States in September, according to Samsung. The Note5 has a more powerful, Exynos 7420, 64-bit octa-core (2.1GHz quad + 1.5Ghz quad) processor than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805, 2.7Ghz quad core processor in the U.S. version of the Note 4. And it also has 4GB of RAM, 1GB more than the last Note phablet. A new Ultra High Quality Audio (UHQA) "upscaler" can be used to convert poor or average quality audio to higher bit rates. More specifically, Samsung says "any audio" MP3 files, or files from a CD, can be upscaled to a maximum of 24bit/192kHz, though not all audio players will be able to take advantage of the increase. And finally, Samsung showed off a new case for the Note that consists of a protective shell and an add-on "physical" QWERTY keyboard, not unlike the keyboards found on traditional BlackBerry smartphones. The case snaps on and off, and when it's in use, the Note5 display adapts and shifts all of your apps into place above the keys. It's tough to say how well it will work in real-world scenarios, but I typed a few sentences and was impressed. Unfortunately, the company didn't share any price or availability details for the case. These are the features and functionality that impressed during my hands-on time with the Galaxy Note5, but a number of the phablet's unfortunate shortcomings also caught my eye. What you might not like about the Galaxy S6 edge+  I'm going to come right out and admit it: I don't like phablets. They're just too damn big. Of course, that's a matter of preference, and clearly lots of people love their gigantic phones. Obviously, if you're a fan of large phones, the Note5's size isn't a concern. The new Note5's design is similar to the GS6. It's made entirely of metal and glass, and, frankly, it's a looker. In fact, I think the Note5's glass rear panel looks much better than the faux leather battery cover on the Note 4. However, as soon as you grab the Note5 and hold it in your hand for a few minutes, something feels ... off -- it feels less durable than the GS6 and even the GS6 edge. It's almost a bit flimsy. I tried to determine the cause, and as far as I can tell, it's because the metal bezel that surrounds the phone doesn't run along the top of the phone's side, as it does with the GSG edge and GS6 edge+. The glass on the rear panel curves upward to the top edges, and your hand feels the curved, slick glass instead of the sturdy stainless steel when you hold it. This could be a nonissue, and a case would address the problem. But the device definitely feels odd in hand. The GS6 phones marked a notable new focus on design from Samsung, and they are available in a variety of vivid colors, including a memorable and unique emerald green. Unfortunately, the Note5 comes in only two, boring colors in the United States: black and white. Like the Galaxy S6, GS6 edge and now the GS6 edge+, the Note5 does not have a removable battery or an expandable memory card slot. That's par for the course these days, but it is the first Note device without these features. And that's a shame. You can never have too much battery life, and the option of swapping out a dead battery for a full one is always better than scrambling to find a power outlet in an unfamiliar environment. On the subject of batteries, the Note5's 3,000 mAh battery is 7 percent smaller than the 3,220 mAh pack in the Note 4, which might not bode well for the possibility of longer battery life. The absence of a memory card slot is all the more notable because Samsung chose to offer the Note5 with only two storage options: 32GB and 64GB. The Note 4 only came with 32GB of storage, so the new Note actually has an additional storage configuration. But it still lacks the large, 128GB option that's common today. Finally, the Note5 does not have an infrared (IR) blaster. For many folks, this won't be a deal breaker. In fact, I bet most people have never even used the IR blasters on their favorite mobile devices. However, if you've come to rely on a specific app that uses the feature (a remote control app for your Apple TV or other streaming box, for example) you may be disappointed to learn that it won't work on the new GS6 edge+. To be clear, this isn't meant to be a Note5 review. It's impossible to accurately evaluate a new device after only an hour or two of hands-on time. Instead, I tried to spotlight the features, or lack thereof, that will stand out to people familiar with Samsung's current smartphone lineup.

By MORGAN LEE, Associated Press Published: May 13, 2017, 6:04 AM A   A SANTA FE, N.M. — A techno-infused opera about the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has earned the financial backing of opera companies in San Francisco and Seattle, ensuring the musical meditation on the iconic entrepreneur will travel to America’s high-tech enclave. The partnerships were announced Tuesday as the Santa Fe Opera prepared for its July world premiere of “The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs” at its open-air summer stage in the foothills of New Mexico’s Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The Seattle Opera and the San Francisco Opera are underwriting both the already completed artistic creation of the opera, led by composer and electronica DJ Mason Bates, and its physical stage production. As co-producers, the companies guarantee their right to performances beyond Santa Fe in California and Washington. The Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University also has signed on as a co-producer. Story of human frailty Job’s life story, as the relentless technology pioneer who embraced Buddhism and simple vegetarian family dinners, has been the subject of documentaries, books, a feature film and a graphic novel since his death from cancer in 2011. Sponsors of the Jobs opera are counting on Bates and librettist Mark Campbell to deliver a “deeply layered, moving portrayal of a man grappling with the complex priorities of life, family and work,” in the words of San Francisco opera General Manager Matthew Shilvock. “He was also a real person and a member of our community,” Shilvock said of Jobs in a written announcement. Charles MacKay, general director of the Santa Fe Opera, said Jobs provides the “sort of heroic, tragic figure” that operas have explored for centuries — who also may lure new and younger audiences to metropolitan opera houses. “The proof is in the pudding and in how the audience responds,” MacKay told the Associated Press. “This is not an opera about technology, although it will be the highest technology production that we’ve ever done. It is an opera about relationships, and it is an opera about human frailties. … He could be a very difficult man.” Accompaniments include a live orchestra, guitar, natural sounds and expressive electronics — sounds tailored to the man who first won fame and fortune during the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 80s with partner Steve Wozniak as they introduced the pivotal Apple II and Macintosh computers. Seed money from NEA Fired by Apple in 1984, Jobs went into the visual effects industry at Pixar before his return to Apple as CEO to preside over the heyday of the early iPhone and related gadgets MacKay cautioned that “The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs” could take a few years to reach the Bay Area and beyond — normal delays in the painstaking opera planning cycle. Investments as a co-producer can pay financial dividends if the opera sells tickets and eventually travels the country, or world. The Santa Fe Opera brokered a collaborative hit with other companies with the 2015 opera premiere of “Cold Mountain,” adapted from the 1997 novel and popular film. Seed money for the Jobs opera was provided by the National Endowment for the Arts. From Santa Fe, MacKay has been outspoken in pushing back against President Donald Trump’s proposed elimination of the endowment from the federal budget, with funding recently extended through the end of the current fiscal year in September.

The company said, in a statement, that in the two weeks ending January 3, customers spent more than $US1.1 billion on apps and in-app purchases. This set back-to-back weekly records for traffic and purchases as January 1 marked the biggest day in App Store history, with customers spending more than $US144 million. It also broke the previous single-day record set on Christmas Day last year. In addition, Apple claimed 2015 was a record-breaking year for the App Store globally, which has brought in nearly $US40 billion for developers since 2008. “The App Store had a holiday season for the record books. We are excited that our customers downloaded and enjoyed so many incredible apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, spending more than $US20 billion on the App Store last year alone,” Apple senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, Philip Schiller, said. “We're grateful to all the developers who have created the most innovative and exciting apps in the world for our customers. We can't wait for what's to come in 2016.” He added that with two new App Stores for Apple TV and Apple Watch, and the native features for the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and iPad Pro, developers of all sizes from all around the world have opportunities to innovate across these eco-systems. “Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud.” Apple also said largely as a result of the App Store’s success, the company is now responsible for creating and supporting 1.9 million jobs in the US, and the iOS app economy has created 1.2 million jobs in Europe and 1.4 million jobs in China.

Matt Hamblen, Marc Ferranti (Computerworld (US)) 11 February, 2013 11:12 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Exclusive Networks Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Comments The company formerly known as RIM delivered on its promise to breathe new life into its aging, iconic BlackBerry product line, but BlackBerry devices still face an uphill battle against Apple's iPhone and myriad smartphones based on Google's Android operating system. At a New York launch event attended by hundreds of reporters and analysts late last month, CEO Thorsten Heins underscored the plan to reignite his company by first announcing that the vendor had changed its name from Research In Motion to BlackBerry. The two long-awaited devices introduced at the event -- the first smartphones that the struggling Canadian company has unveiled in 18 months -- appear to be designed to appeal to two major audiences: consumers and corporate users. The photo and video capabilities in the new BlackBerry Z10 and Q10 smartphones are likely to appeal to consumers. Enterprise IT managers, meanwhile, will likely welcome the embedded BlackBerry Balance technology, which can create two separate, secure spaces on the phones -- one to hold corporate data and the other for personal files, said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst at IDC. Heins said the touchscreen Z10 and the Q10 handset with a physical keyboard were designed essentially from scratch around a new platform based on QNX, a real-time operating system RIM acquired in 2010. While the BlackBerry was the undisputed leader of the smartphone market for years, the advent of the iPhone and then the rise of Android-based devices led many of its once-loyal users to defect. The company now has about 80 million users, amounting to less than 5% of the worldwide smartphone market, and it faces an uphill battle when it comes to marketing and selling the Z10 and Q10, even though many analysts say the new devices are a good step forward from previous generations of BlackBerries. "I think this is definitely a good start, and it will help slow those defections, but many [consumers] in the U.S., for example, have already left," noted Jan Dawson, an analyst at Ovum. "Most of the remaining BlackBerry users in the U.S. are on corporate-issued devices, so it's about convincing the IT department to continue with BlackBerry." Outside of North American corporate IT operations, BlackBerry will run into trouble finding users, Dawson said. "The only big differentiators are productivity-centric, so [the Z10 and Q10 will] help with business users, but not so much with pure consumer users," he said. "At best, RIM's new products will allow it to stop the bleeding and hold its market share," said Charles Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. "Our consumer data shows that while more than half of U.S. BlackBerry owners plan to get a new phone in the next year, fewer than two in five say it will be another BlackBerry." BlackBerry said that U.S. sales of the Z10 will begin in March and the Q10 will be available in the U.S. by June. Carriers AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile will announce U.S. prices for the devices before shipments begin. In Canada, the Z10 started shipping on Feb. 5 at a price of $149.99 with a three-year contract. Ferranti is a reporter for the IDG News Service.

Sign up now Menu ARN Smartphone buyers will benefit from changing chipset market, analysts say Smartphone buyers will benefit from changing chipset market, analysts say Smartphone vendors building their own chipsets will result in more competition in the low-end and cheaper smartphones Mikael Ricknäs (IDG News Service) 10 December, 2012 14:03 - - - - print email Comments The mobile chipset market is in a state of flux with a number of key vendors struggling, but analysts say the result of the turmoil will be more advanced high-end smartphones and cheaper low-end devices. On Monday, chip maker ST-Ericsson was dealt a blow as co-owner STMicroelectronics decided to exit the joint venture, which leaves its other owner Ericsson scrambling for a way to save it. This is just the latest sign of difficulties faced by mobile chipset vendors. Texas Instruments recently said it will focus its wireless market investments on embedded products. And Broadcom has also been struggling in the mobile space, according to Malik Saadi, principal analyst with market research company Informa Telecoms & Media. One of the reasons ST doesn't see a bright future in the wireless chipset space is the growing number of major smartphone vendors that want to develop their own components, the company's CEO Carlo Bozotti said. One element of Samsung's success is that the company builds its own processors and other components of its Galaxy products, and others want to emulate that. LG Electronics and Huawei Technologies are going down the same route, and Apple will also bring more chipset design inhouse, according to Saadi. If Apple wants to strengthen the company's expertise in mobile components, either though acquisitions or by poaching staff, now would be a good time, because of the uncertain future many of the vendors are facing. For smartphone buyers this trend will be a good thing, according to Saadi and Francisco Jeronimo, research manager at IDC. "It will give the smartphone vendors better control of their products. That will allow for better integration between hardware and software, which will result in a better user experience," Saadi said. Besides a better user experience, having more components in-house will also help keep costs down because they don't have to pay markups to a third party, Jeronimo said. Fewer chances to make money in the high end will result in chipset vendors focusing more on the low end of the market. "Look at Qualcomm, for example. It is doing extremely well, but its opportunities in the high-end are limited, because of the Samsung and Apple effect. But Qualcomm has started to push far more aggressively in the low-end of the market with its reference designs ," said Geoff Blaber, who leads mobile device software research at CCS Insight. This is a trend that other vendors will latch onto, according to Blaber. That will in turn result in more competition and price cuts, he said. Price cuts on the component side will make it possible for phone vendors to develop smartphones that cost less than $100 without subsidies, according to Saadi. Still not everyone will survive these changes, and there will be consolidation in the market. "We don't have to wait two or three years for that to happen, it will take place in 2013," Saadi said. ST-Ericsson's future will be decided in negotiations between ST and Ericsson that have already started, Ericsson said. The transition period is expected to end during the third quarter of 2013, ST said. ST-Ericsson was founded as a 50/50 joint venture by STMicroelectronics and Ericsson in February 2009. It married ST's wireless semiconductor division and Ericsson's mobile platform. However, since its start ST-Ericsson has struggled to compete. During the third quarter it reported an operating loss of $174 million, which was an improvement over the $224 million it lost during the same period last year. ST's exit is the outcome of a strategic review that started more than a year ago, according to the company. The company will now concentrate on sensors, automotive products and embedded processing, it said.

Sign up now Menu ARN HTC 10 is a 'spot on' smartphone that won't save HTC HTC 10 is a 'spot on' smartphone that won't save HTC Unless its Vive VR device does well, HTC is 'doomed,' says one analyst Matt Hamblen (Computerworld (US)) 13 April, 2016 07:12 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology CertaOne Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Vendors Huawei Comments HTC has announced the HTC 10, a $699 Android 6 smartphone that seems to touch on all the design and feature wishes of any high-end smartphone customer. However, those plums won't be enough for the HTC 10 to sell well in a crowded Android field, analysts said, even with its 5.2-in. display, fast Snapdragon 820 processor, metal case and superior camera technology. HTC is facing slipping market share and desperately needs to score a success, they said. "Even with a device like the HTC 10, which has a clean design and … improved internals, HTC simply lacks the scale to effectively compete with Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, ZTE, LG and Lenovo," said Jack Narcotta, an analyst at TBR. "On paper, HTC has the right strategy and the right products," Narcotta added. "The problem is that the premium Android space is toxic to nearly all Android manufacturers. Only the largest are able to endure there, and HTC is simply outgunned." Narcotta further predicted that unless HTC's recently announced Vive VR headset "vaults into a billion dollar business, HTC is doomed." Shrinking market share TBR estimated that HTC's U.S. market share last December was less than 4%, and was even less globally. Analyst firm IDC said HTC hasn't been among the top five smartphone makers for several years and ranked 15th globally in smartphone shipments in 2015. It was seventh in the U.S. In terms of sales, Gartner said HTC went from a 2.2% share globally in 2013, down to 1.3% last year. Searching for what 'juices the game' "HTC 10 hits all the high points -- design, music, screen and camera -- but you have to come up with something else to juice the game," said IDC analyst Will Stofega. By comparison, Samsung may have hit on something effective in its marketing of the new Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones bundled with the Samsung Gear VR. Soon, Samsung will sell the Gear 360, a spherical VR camera. "Samsung has it right with bundling its newest phones with other products that are not overly expensive," Stofega said. Likewise, Huawei and its new P9 smartphone with the Leica branded dual-lens camera, announced last week, could be distinctive enough to make some difference in a highly competitive market, he added. Smartphone companies have always had to find a singular but sometimes elusive quality to market in a new device and then spend marketing dollars to back it up. Innovations, such as flexible and foldable screens and faster 5G wireless, that are clearly different from today's products, will take much longer to arrive, possibly not until 2022. "Right now, it's a very saturated market and there's no special thing coming up, so manufacturers are resting on their laurels," Stofega added. Smartphone saturation and longer time to upgrade While high-end Android smartphones face competitive problems, there is a general recognition -- even with Apple -- that customers in the U.S., as well as other places, are slow to upgrade to new phones. "Even Apple has to take stock of what's happening in the U.S. and other saturated markets," Stofega said. "You need more than faster speeds and something that's incredibly different, which is not an easy thing to do." At a recent conference, Stofega said he heard that LTE phones will sell well in Africa in the next year, "but even they don't make up the volumes needed." Overall, there is smartphone growth, albeit slower than in recent years, so smartphone makers are not about to walk away. But U.S. sales in the last quarter of 2015 were down 6%. At Mobile World Congress in late February, LG Electronics officials were especially candid about the need to find new strategies to sell smartphones. Two years ago, LG said it knew there would be a plateau in smartphone popularity so it launched the G5 smartphone with a modular design, and heavily marketed the phone in the U.S. Even Apple is feeling the impact of customers' putting off smartphone upgrades more often than they once did. Brokerage firm BTIG last week cut its estimates for iPhone sales through 2017, based on long upgrade cycles, and indicated that structural changes are underway for the market. "Upgrade rates [for all smartphones] were lower than we expected in the fourth quarter and driving even lower in the March quarter," wrote BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk. Marketing matters — a lot Unlike Samsung and LG, and certainly Apple, HTC is not expected to launch a major marketing campaign with its new HTC 10. "HTC still has some of the best designs out there today, but they don't have the necessary marketing budget to go out there and push and don't spend — or can't spend," Stofega said. "I've always been a fan of their designs. They have always been spot on." Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, added that the HTC 10 is "good-looking, but it's not the only one that is." She said its primary market will be loyal HTC fans who are upgrading from an HTC M7 or M8. Before 2012, HTC was considered a smartphone market leader, but "the market grew up so quickly around it that new competitors were able to quickly gain scale," said TBR's Narcotta. "HTC misfired when it mattered most by changing its strategy [to lower-priced devices] when Samsung and Apple were competing in the premium space, only to change it back again when Samsung's smartphone business began to slow down." Glimmers of hope for HTC HTC's biggest hope may dwell in markets not directly related to smartphones, like its Vive VR and recently announced partnerships with Under Armour and IBM Watson. HTC in January announced UA Healthbox with Under Armour, a $400 product with a wristband, scale and heart rate monitor for fitness tracking. (Even though the word "health" appears in the name, it is not sold as a federally regulated healthcare product, and is instead intended as a fitness product.) IBM Watson will add artificial intelligence to Healthbox features through the UA Record App, which acts as a fitness trainer, coach and consultant. The app will rely on a database kept by Watson of 160 million Under Armour app users, medical research and more. "Vive VR is relevant to HTC's future because VR is the next step towards how people interface with the world," said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen. "IBM Watson makes the fitness app even cooler, and that's an example of where the handset companies need to go with services, where a fitness apps links you to other parts of your life." Nguyen said Vive and Healthbox will matter more to HTC's future than the HTC 10. "Regardless of the HTC 10 device or its hardware features or the brand and vendor behind it, it will be hard to sell."
